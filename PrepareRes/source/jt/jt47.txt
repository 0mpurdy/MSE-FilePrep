READINGS ON EZEKIEL (1)
@Ezekiel 1: 1 - 28; @Ezekiel 2: 1 - 4; @Ezekiel 3: 22 - 27
J.T. What is in mind this evening, in commencing to read the book of Ezekiel, is to show the character of the prophet's gift and of his mission.
The chapters from which we have read are introductory. It will be necessary for us in pursuing our subject to keep in mind the description of the living creatures; for it presents much detail, which will only be intelligible to us as we consider the scenes presented in this wonderful book. Dates have a great place in this book; we read in verse 1: "Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth of the month" @Ezekiel 1: 1, and then in verse 2 it says, "it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity" @Ezekiel 1: 2. These two dates are to be understood, if we are to see how ministry is to be prospered, for it is the prophet's ministry which will come before us. The first date, the thirtieth year, according to a backward computation of the reigns of various kings, alludes to Josiah's reign, and more specifically to the year in which he held the passover -- the eighteenth year of his reign -- and it is evidently implied here that Ezekiel had that in mind; a time of revival and prosperity amongst the saints.
And then the reference to Jehoiachin's captivity, of course, suggests the adverse side. It is a humiliating thought, reminding us of failure and the awful state of the people. Those two things are necessary in the servant's soul; the idea of a revival as in Josiah's day, thirty years before, and then the sorrowful failure of his family; for Jehoiachin, a grandson of Josiah, is here referred to as in captivity, having been captive for five years when this vision was seen by Ezekiel.
{2}
W.R. One who was faithful to God and to man is referred to here as priest; not as prophet. His priesthood is emphasised.
J.T. It is not simply a priest but *the* priest. "The word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest" (@Ezekiel 1: 3). It was characteristic of him. Now, as remarked, the thirtieth year alludes to the lapse of time since the year of Josiah's passover, which was a landmark in Israel (see @2 Chronicles 35). Computing the different periods given, you reach back to that year; the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, a point of great significance as a revival. There had been no passover like it from the days of Samuel. That God gives such occasions as that would be a matter of positive importance to the soul of the prophet in his ministry. A minister ought to have that in mind in his service, for God can cause it to recur. The other date is sorrowful: one of Josiah's family had failed, and was a captive. That a king of Judah should be in captivity was indeed a sorrowful matter.
A.B.P. Do you suggest that in Ezekiel's mind the time dates from the passover?
J.T. Evidently. We do not know if there was any other incident in Ezekiel's mind, but we do know it refers to *that* year, a most important year in Israel's history. We can understand that a man like Ezekiel would have it in his mind, as we have the beginning of the great revival in our day, in our minds. But then there are sorrowful things that have happened during the last hundred years that we have to remember, too. The *date* of Josiah's passover is carefully given both in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles.
C.A.M. Would these two happenings synchronise? Would one be seen as from God's side, in blessing, and then would the other be governmental?
J.T. Yes, thirty years back, and five years back. The five years refer to what is humiliating; the captivity of one of the kings of Judah. I think in that way dates are especially important for those who are serving; that
{3}
is, what has happened in the history of God's people must be kept continually in mind.
C.A.M. Would the first date give a sort of impetus to the ministry?
J.T. Yes. And the second date would challenge us as to whether we are in captivity or whether we are going on in the energy of revival, looking for another, or looking for the maintenance, to the end, of that which God has recovered.
J.H.E. The second date is in a parenthesis, as if it were added in a secondary way to strengthen the thought of date.
J.T. It was thirty years from one date and five years from the other; so that Jehoiachin was taken in captivity twenty-five years after the first date.
A.B.P. Does the reference to Jehoiachin indicate that the ministry of Jeremiah had been refused?
J.T. Yes. Jeremiah's ministry in that period was at Jerusalem. Ezekiel is ministering away in the east at the river Chebar, where the people had been taken.
Ques. Is it right to say that in relation to ministry we have what is substantial to look back to, as well as what God may disclose to us in the midst of difficulty, such as the "visions of God" here?
J.T. Quite so; the two dates we have referred to would be in the prophet's mind, but now there is something fresh coming in on this particular date; the heavens are opened. What stimulation there is in that! Ezekiel says, "the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,) the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar" (@Ezekiel 1: 1 - 3). God is operating now far away from Jerusalem, following up the captives, and a greater thing happens here than perhaps we can find elsewhere in the prophets: the heavens were opened.
{4}
Ques. Do you connect that in any way with matters being directed from heaven? In @Revelation 2 and 3 the position would seem to be heavenly, although what is seen is on earth. The Lord is really in charge of the matter, whether on earth or as directing from heaven.
J.T. Yes; the heavens are opened; heaven is intervening now. Influence no longer emanates from Jerusalem; it is from heaven. So the scene corresponds with incidents in the New Testament: what happened at the banks of the Jordan, and particularly at the death of Stephen, who beheld the heavens opened. The Son of man was operating from heaven instead of from Jerusalem.
A.N.W. There are the "visions of God" and "the word of Jehovah". The "visions of God" seem to be connected with Josiah, and "the word of Jehovah" with Jehoiachin, are they not?
J.T. Yes; the expression, "visions of God" appears in verse 1; but "the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel" appears in verse 3. The latter is what he is going to *say*. We need not say everything that we *see*, but the word of Jehovah is urgent. The vision is not said to be express, but "the word" is. It is a message. You may ponder over and enjoy what you see; it may build you up; but the message is express, as it says, "the word of Jehovah came expressly" @Ezekiel 1: 3.
A.R.S. Is this not very similar to the circumstances surrounding John's being at Patmos? Ezekiel is a captive by the river Chebar, and John was a captive in Patmos; also, John was called up to heaven, and Ezekiel sees the heavens opened as he remains on the earth.
J.T. Quite so; there is a correspondence, I am sure, particularly with chapter 4 of Revelation. The Son of man is seen on earth among the candlesticks in chapter 1 of that book; in chapters 2 and 3 it is "the things that are" (that is the church period), "and the things that are about to be after these" @Revelation 1: 19 would refer to
{5}
chapter 4. The scene of operation is transferred to heaven, so John is caught up to heaven. We do not get that kind of thing here in Ezekiel, but rather a great system portrayed for us, which God has ordered for the maintenance of His government, Jerusalem having failed Him. Although the house of David has failed Him, He has this wonderful array of power among the gentiles; hence, it is the Son of man that is in mind; Christ in relation to the nations.
A.R.S. Why is the first date connected with the reign of Josiah, for Ezekiel at this time was amongst the captives at the river Chebar?
J.T. Well, we might go back in our thoughts to what happened in Ireland over a hundred years ago and recognise how God brought about such wonderful recovery; but then, we may be in captivity now. The position is different, and it is humiliating. For, in Ezekiel's day, one of the kings of Judah was in captivity, and he refers to that also in mentioning dates.
J.S. Going back a hundred years, we find most of the people of God in captivity, but a remnant was delivered, would you say?
J.T. Quite so.
B. Your reference to Ezekiel and the word coming expressly to him is like what is said of the apostle Paul. The men that were with him at the time of his conversion saw the light, but they "heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me", @Acts 22: 9. Paul could record exactly what he heard in the message.
J.T. Quite so. In @Acts 9: 7, it is said they heard the voice, but that would be in the sense of 'sound' as the margin reads. Saul heard *words*: he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?"
W.S.S. Would the second date given suggest the moral conditions that obtained at the time Ezekiel ministered? Reference has been made to the refusal of Jeremiah's prophecy. Ezekiel evidently was one who
{6}
had accepted it, and in those deplorable moral conditions there was this priest to whom the word of God came expressly. Is it not an encouragement to us at the present time that there are still possibilities?
J.T. Quite so; you would want to be a priest so that God could trust you with a message. The apostle Paul says, "the Spirit speaks expressly", @1 Timothy 4: 1. It is an urgent matter. You want to be available to the Lord, and I believe that is the force of the expression "Ezekiel the priest". Jeremiah was one of the priests, but Ezekiel is a distinctive priest, evidently characteristically so, so that God can trust him with this message.
The nearer we get to the beginning of that thirty years, the brighter things will be found to be. Ezekiel was reverting to a brighter period. Whether or not he had part in it we cannot definitely say; but it would recall the blessed time they had in the days of Josiah. One can understand how a priest of God would revert to such a time as that. Why not have times like it again?
Ques. Will you say something more about the vision in contrast to speaking?
J.T. Well, what you *see* is one thing; what you *say* is another. Take Stephen, for instance. We are told that he saw the glory of God and *Jesus*, but he does not say that. He says, "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God", @Acts 7: 56. The account of the Spirit of God in verse 55 is: "But being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God" @Acts 7: 55, but when Stephen spoke in testimony he called Him "Son of man". The time had come to announce the truth as to the Lord's position as the Son of man, which is a wider thought of Christ; His operations would now extend out to the whole race of man. So that the servant does not always say just what he sees. The levitical touch means that I know *what* to say. You find it constantly in Scripture with servants of God.
{7}
They see something and then present in testimony what is suitable at the moment.
Ques. Paul also, in @Acts 9, saw a vision. The Lord said to Ananias, "behold, he is praying, and has seen in a vision a man" @Acts 9: 12. Is there any suggestion in the introduction of vision there of the setting aside of the speaking at Jerusalem?
J.T. The vision in Saul's case was Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him. In our chapter, Ezekiel says, "the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God" @Ezekiel 1: 1. Then we have the description of what he saw, and in order to grasp this we have to look over the chapter carefully. He says: "And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings: their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle. And their faces and their wings were parted above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. And they went every one straight forward: whither the Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went" (@Ezekiel 1: 4 - 12).
It will be helpful for all, I think, to see that the general appearance of this great array is the appearance
{8}
of a man. It is not the presentation of the beasts, but it is a question of *man*. There are the four heads of creation, but the general appearance has the *likeness* of a man. And then there is a man's *hand*, and then the likeness of their faces was the *face* of a man. These three items help us to understand what is in mind; that they are not heartless, like the beasts of the gentile monarchies. Man is the characterising thought in them. The idea of "man" runs right through, both as to their general appearance and their faces and then the operative part -- the hands -- were the hands of a man. All is human.
J.S. Is this array of power in the living creatures connected with the movement of testimony from Jerusalem to Chaldea?
J.T. That is the thought; God has this immense power among the gentiles, and He is bringing Ezekiel into it. It is to give character to Ezekiel's prophecy, as I hope we shall see as we go through the book. The "man" runs through the governmental dealings of God. The gentile monarchies are likened to beasts, but here the characterising feature is man. There is sympathy for men in it.
A.F.M. Does it suggest special regard for men in contrast to the dealings of God with Israel? Israel was set aside, and now in the Son of man, God acts in affection towards recovery in the race of men.
J.T. Of course sympathetic consideration marked God's dealings with Israel too. But here the threefold allusion to man is striking. Then finally a *Man* on the throne; supreme authority above is in Man. The first part of the description runs on to verse 12, where we have the living creatures and their wings moving with the Spirit. And then the general operative power in verses 13 and 14; there is no idea of presenting concreteness here. These are symbols; hence the frequency of the words "likeness" and "appearance". The intent is to impress our minds with the ideas
{9}
suggested. It is really what marks the agencies of the government of God. The operative part is most energetic and rapid and characterised by fire. And then we have, from verse 15 to the end of verse 21, the idea of wheels and unity in the movement, and the same spirit was in the wheels and in the living creature, and they all moved together; the wheels allude to the contact with the earth. This government makes contact with the earth, because wheels have to do with solid earth. And then, in verse 22, we have an expanse or firmament over the heads of the living creature, and above that expanse, a throne (verse 26). The whole domain of God's operations would be suggested; the wheels on the earth, and then the expanse above, which has the look of a "terrible crystal", so that we are impressed with the majesty of God, and the greatness, the incomprehensibleness of the means and sphere of His government. It is intended to subdue us and cause us to fear Him in all this. Then, over this, the throne, as it says: "And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke" (verses 26 - 28).
The prophet is brought into all this, and he is engaged and hears a voice. It is all to prepare him for his mission.
Rem. This would be a presentation of Christ?
J.T. Quite so; it is Christ, only here He is on the throne as a Man with affections -- the appearance of
{10}
the loins upward and downward carrying through the thought of man in the entire presentation of the matter.
Rem. John, beholding Jesus as He walked, testified to Him as the Son of God; whereas Ezekiel here, was a witness of Him in the character of Son of man.
J.T. Exactly; Ezekiel now would be able to speak about what he saw. He would speak about Him, but, of course, under the limitations of Old Testament times (see @1 Peter 1: 10 - 12).
J.S. In chapter 1, Ezekiel is introduced as priest, yet spoken to as son of man in chapter 2.
J.T. Yes; he is to embody the spirit of all this. That is the idea of the recurrence of the words "likeness" and "appearance", showing the formation of the prophet, especially in his intelligence, so that he could convey what God had in His mind.
J.S. It fits in remarkably with Stephen's experience in @Acts 7, as you have already mentioned.
C.A.M. This likeness of man (verses 4 - 12), would have the effect of focusing our attention on man in relation to the whole realm of creation. This gives a sort of key thought; that God's thoughts centre in manhood.
J.T. Quite so; Ezekiel is to be impressed with *man* now, instead of with Israel alone; that God has *man* in His mind.
F.H.L. Is that the reason for emphasis of the number four?
J.T. I think so; it suggests what is universal.
Ques. If we are to be workers together with God, we must understand how God operates -- everything in all -- and is this the vision of it?
J.T. It is to impress the servant with what God has in His mind. God is imparting what is in His mind, but it is conveyed by means of symbols. They are not concrete things, but *appearing* things that are wholly symbolic.
{11}
Ques. Is there sufficient representation in these symbols, if properly understood, to provide for everything connected with government?
J.T. Exactly; you feel that things will be done, and done quickly -- drastically when necessary -- but all the time you are impressed with the idea of man. And then, I think the reference to the voice from above the expanse that was over the heads of the creatures is very beautiful. Verse 24 says, "when they stood, they let down their wings" @Ezekiel 1: 24, then in verse 25 after the voice is mentioned it says again, "When they stood, they let down their wings" @Ezekiel 1:25. These two statements are the same, but a voice comes between them. The repetition is of something that is to be taken into our souls; their wings are their locomotive power, but they have let them down. I believe the allusion is, that as having part in this great service, we are to be humble and let down our wings -- to stand at attention. Let us be available and ready to be detained before God, and then we shall *hear* something. We are not told what the voice said, but we have the suggestion that in letting down our wings, there is a voice. The servant is to be exercised in godly fear; he is to be reverential. If one has gift and power in ministry, he is apt to go on in that, and forget to let down his wings to be detained before God. After all, it is that "the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us", @2 Corinthians 4: 7. And so there is the voice. We must get communications from heaven.
W.S.S. Would you say Paul let down his wings at Corinth? He was with them "in weakness and in fear and in much trembling", @1 Corinthians 2: 3.
J.T. Yes; you feel the necessity for this in your ministry; that you hear the voice, for you need a fresh communication from the Lord in serving. The repetition of the letting down of the wings is to stress the idea of humility. The wings are prominent and they make a tremendous noise. We are apt to think of the
{12}
noise we are making, but that is not the end in view. In service we need to let down the wings, be quiet and listen to God, so that there will be a voice. I think that is seen at the banks of the Jordan in the blessed humiliation of Christ. How lowly He was! And then as He went up from the Jordan and was *praying*, there was a voice from heaven: "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", @Luke 3: 21,22. There is a *voice*; and that is what we need in our ministry.
W.S.S. There seems to be a resemblance in the opening of Ezekiel, as has already been remarked, to the opening of John's gospel. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory)" (@John 1: 14), as if in a day of departure such as Ezekiel's and John's day, there is to be the light of the glory of Christ's Person.
J.T. Yes; the voice is referred to here, and then the glory of the Lord on the throne in the next section -- the *likeness* of a throne -- but it is above this terrible crystal-like expanse; so that this is an elevated view which would stress the greatness of Christ in the government of God. There is "the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it" (@Ezekiel 1: 26). As our minds absorb these great thoughts, Christ becomes greater and greater to us. This array of power in the creatures is below the firmament, but He is above it. The firmament is a great thing in itself. The difference between what is below and what is above is pronounced. It is as the look of the terrible crystal, which suggests that we are to be subdued and feel that we have to do with God in these matters, for it is a divine Person who sits on the throne. Our attention being called to the "loins" would point to the fact that although He is so great and glorious above, He has feelings and affections in relation to men.
{13}
J.S. Would the introduction of glowing brass and fire call attention to the need for self-judgment on our part?
J.T. I think so. You feel how drastic the means are in this array of governmental power.
J.T.Jr. Do you think that David, when he went in and sat before the Lord, would be subdued by it, and like the living creatures, there would be a letting down of his wings, and then taking account of all the greatness that was inside?
J.T. That is a good illustration; and what wonderful thoughts came into his mind about God!
W.B-w. It says their feet were straight feet. Does that mean that the ministers are to be guarded as to their feet and pathway as they serve?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques What relation has the movement of the wheels to the movement of the wings?
J.T. It is one great system. The wings appear to be the locomotive power; they make a great noise. It says, "And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, a tumultuous noise, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings" (@Ezekiel 1: 24). The initial apostolic power, for instance, was very great, and everybody's attention was called to the testimony, but then in letting down of the wings there was reverence and lowliness marking the apostles, and then other communications followed.
J.S. Would the wings be for movement in the air, and the wheels for movement on the earth?
J.T. Yes; there is power to mount up, but then there is contact with the earth; the government is heavenly, but there is contact here below.
F.H.L. Should we not be impressed with the idea of going "straight forward", also of being "lifted up"?
{14}
J.T. Quite so. Both these thoughts were exemplified in Christ.
W.R. @Psalm 19: 1 says, "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands".
J.T. That is the testimony in the heavens; it is *always* there. But here we have what is most extraordinary, and yet the prophet is to absorb it all into his soul; you get the idea of eating at the end of chapter 2, the idea of appropriation and assimilation of certain things. In the section, verses 26 - 28, our minds are focused on the appearance of Man on a throne; and it is said to be the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah, and the prophet says, "And when I saw, I fell on my face" (@Ezekiel 1: 28). He is deeply affected by it. He is now, as it were, qualified for his service.
A.F.M. The introductory part of this book would be preparatory for Ezekiel. All these great things coming before him so affected him that he fell on his face. And then in the next chapter the Spirit entered into him, when Jehovah spoke to him, and set him upon his feet.
J.T. He is now qualified, falling on his face, showing how humble and reverential he was. He says, "This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah" @Ezekiel 1: 28; that is, he puts it all into a few words. He understands that it is the glory of Jehovah in relation to His government here. "And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke". @Ezekiel 1: 28. This sentence directs us back to the idea of "voice". He is now qualified through the vision, and he is getting communications. So the next thing is, "he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet" (@Ezekiel 2: 1.) He would be reminded of the straight feet of the cherubim as the voice uttered the word "feet". He had feet, too; now the Spirit sets him on them.
J.S. And following this, would he be prepared to hear the voice?
{15}
J.T. I think he is already qualified; just as the voice comes in relation to the letting down of the wings, now Ezekiel falls on his face and hears a voice.
Ques. Is there any suggestion of the covenant in verse 28?
J.T. Well, yes, in the broad sense in which the bow suggests covenant relations, I suppose. God's covenant with His creation would be recalled.
A.B.P. What is the thought in, "from the ... loins and upward from the ... loins and downward" @Ezekiel 1: 27?
J.T. I think the allusion is to divine compassion in Christ. The description is "from the appearance of his loins", alluding to feelings; compassionate feelings.
A.B.P. Would there also be the direction of those feelings, as expressed Godward and manward?
J.T. That is the idea; you have in the same Person what refers to God and what refers to man -- upward and downward. Then it goes on to say, "and I heard a voice of one that spoke" @Ezekiel 1: 28. And then again in @Ezekiel 3: 12, "the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place!" -- so that there are actual communications now.
G.MacP. Peter in his second epistle says, "such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory"; and then goes on to say, "this voice *we* heard uttered from heaven", @2 Peter 1: 18.
J.T. Yes; when he was about to put off his tabernacle he could speak of what he had seen, being with Him on the holy mountain; not simply when there, but when *with Him*. The point is association with Christ there.
Ques. Will you help us as to the distinction between a priest and a prophet? Do they run concurrently, or does one precede the other?
J.T. One may be a priest without being a prophet. Christians are all priests, but we are not all prophets. I think that morally the priest comes before the prophet.
{16}
Moses was a prophet. He had the privilege of priesthood, too. Entering into the holiest, he received divine communications. Every saint is a priest, as you know -- "a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2: 5. The general thought is that we have access to God; so morally I think priesthood comes before prophecy. If I am not able to draw near to God, I shall not have a word from Him for the brethren. Prophecy is toward man.
W.S.S. I was thinking, in regard to the last verse of chapter 1, "This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah" @Ezekiel 1: 28, how it would exercise us that we might be in line with these features of government and encourage us also that there might be conditions in which this glory may be apprehended.
J.T. Yes; Ezekiel is able to *name* it. He is able to name what he saw and to act rightly in regard to it; able to put it into smaller compass of expression. It is the appearance of the glory of Jehovah. He is not elated. He falls down. He is impressed with it, and that qualifies him, I think, for the further word: "Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee" (@Ezekiel 2: 1); that is, qualification of the servant is in mind here, all the way through.
W.S.S. Would you say the glory that is referred to here is a glory in the light of which we may live and move at the present time, requiring, of course, suited conditions on our side?
J.T. Each one, in his ministry, must have some contact with God in this way, secretly; that one may see the glory. You see something in relation to what God has in mind for you to do, which is designed to enable you to do it. It is right to fall down, but then He says, Stand up. You are to be used as on your own feet.
W.F.K. Is the service of the living creatures completed in Revelation?
J.T. Well, you get them there with variations from those we are considering. When they give glory and
{17}
honour and thanksgiving to Him that sits on the throne, the elders fall down and worship. The living creatures in Revelation have six wings; we are not told what they did with them, but we are told what they *say*. They celebrate Him that sits on the throne. We get much more than what is found in @Ezekiel 1, for the elders worship when they celebrate, but here our mind is being focused on one man who is going to be used of God. And so God would use any of us, but we must be qualified to put a name on what is presented to us from God; we must be reverent in regard to it; not light about it, or elated, but lowly, and prepared to let down our wings, and fall down in the presence of God. And then the word will be to stand upon our feet, and God will speak and tell us what our missions are to be. That is the great lesson in chapter 2.
B. Is there not a great similarity between the taking up of Ezekiel and the call of Jeremiah?
J.T. Quite so; only the grandeur of the display here is much greater.
A.Pf. Ezekiel is told, "Son of man, I send thee" @Ezekiel 2: 3. Is that a further thought?
J.T. He is being commissioned. He has qualified in chapter 1 in the way he acted in relation to the glory. He named it and fell down, and then the word is, "Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee" @Ezekiel 2: 1. One must change his position if he is to get any communication; and then he says, "the Spirit entered into me" @Ezekiel 2: 2. How important this is! The Spirit of God is my strength now. "And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spoke unto me. And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me unto this very day; and these children are impudent and hard-hearted: I am sending thee unto
{18}
them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah", @Ezekiel 2: 2 - 4. That is his commission.
A.R. Do you think we would have less difficulty in following the ministry that comes to us, if we were more exercised about listening in the power of the Spirit? It says the Spirit entered into Ezekiel.
J.T. That is the next thing to see here; for one spirit actuated the wheels and the living creatures. Wherever the Spirit was to go, they went. The point now is Ezekiel, an actual man, the others are merely symbols -- likenesses -- intended to make impressions on the prophet's mind.
J.S. God has His communications on earth now through Ezekiel.
J.T. That is it. He says, in principle, You are going to have a hard time, but you are to go. There is nothing for the flesh in this at all. The Lord said, "the Son of man has not where he may lay his head", @Luke 9: 58. And then Ezekiel has to eat the roll; "And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll which I give thee. And I ate, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness" (@Ezekiel 3: 1 - 3). This would signify that Ezekiel is moving with God in the matter.
We cannot go into all the details, but we should note the word "valley" (@Ezekiel 3: 22): "And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there I will talk with thee". The word "valley" suggests a descent -- that we are to go down -- and would include the suggestion of death. I am to go there, and I get a message there.
A.F.M. As to the eating of the roll in @Ezekiel 3, it was in Ezekiel's mouth as honey for sweetness, and when John ate the little book of @Revelation 10 it was in his *mouth* as honey; but when he had eaten it,
{19}
his *belly* was made bitter. Was it after having gone through so much sorrow and suffering in spirit in connection with his mission sympathetically?
J.T. I suppose the New Testament emphasises intelligence in the servant. John would discern what was involved, in the little book, for the saints of God. He would discern that it meant suffering for the saints, and that caused him sorrow. Here, the prophet is not seen as discerning that, although there were lamentations and woes. He is impressed with the sweetness of the word of God.
J.S. Would you say a word about the prophet's movement here from the river Chebar to the valley?
J.T. Well, he is told to go. "And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley" @Ezekiel 3: 22. He was by the river Chebar. That was his own matter. He was there and saw the vision there, but now he is directed by God to go to the valley, and it meant that Ezekiel must go down, foreshadowing Christ going into death, for one has to understand what it is to go down into death, to be effective as a servant. The servant must go wherever God directs him. There is always divine significance in a direction of this kind.
Ques. What about the glory following him in the end of verse 23?
J.T. "Arise, go forth into the valley; and there I will talk with thee" (@Ezekiel 3: 22). He must go there or he will not get the word. "And I arose, and went forth into the valley, and behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there" (@Ezekiel 3: 23). It is worth while going there to get the glory; to see it. "The glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar". @Ezekiel 3: 23. It is the same thing; it is now in the valley. "And I fell on my face" (@Ezekiel 3: 23); he is again reverential.
W.S.S. It is striking that Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul, and John all fell on their faces, or fell to the earth, and they were all told to stand on their feet.
{20}
J.T. I think the idea is that you are to be a *man*. Jehovah said to Job: "Gird up now thy loins like a man" (@Job 38: 3). It is right to fall on your face as in the presence of God, but for service, a man is to be on his feet -- balanced, ready for action. Joshua fell on his face, too, but God told him to get up. There are things to be done, Standing on your feet means that you are available to God as a man, because manhood is needed in these matters.
W.S.S. Falling on our faces would be the result of the impression made upon us personally; standing on our feet would be for service in relation to that impression.
J.T. One is told to do it. God puts one on his feet, "And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet" (@Ezekiel 3: 24). It is in the power of the Spirit that one stands.
A.N.W. As falling on his face, he heard the voice; but in standing up, he heard *Him*.
W.H-w. Do you think Ezekiel gets his gift in chapter 1; in chapter 2 his commission; and in chapter 3, the word?
J.T. Quite so; he is now actually in the place of death. It is like the apostle's experience preceding the writing of 2 Corinthians. He had gone down, and that is the secret, I believe, of the peculiar character of the second epistle as compared with the first. He had gone *down*. He says, "We ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver", @2 Corinthians 1: 9.
R.W.S. Ezekiel says, "And I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit" (@Ezekiel 3: 14). Did that involve the valley?
J.T. The bitterness reminds us of the apostle's saying, "if against my will". There is nothing for the flesh in all this; indeed, it is against the flesh. He says
{21}
there, "And the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me. And I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I sat there astonied among them seven days" (@Ezekiel 3: 14, 15). What an experience that was among the captives! Think of the bitterness of his spirit; but then he comes out in power.
Ques. Paul speaks of the greatness of the revelations in the second epistle, and then he goes on to speak about the thorn that was given to him for the flesh. Is that a kindred thought to what we have here; something to modify the effect of the greatness of the revelation upon him?
J.T. Yes. He says, "when I am weak, then I am powerful", @2 Corinthians 12: 10. That is what the word "valley" would imply. "And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house. And thou, son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee therewith, and thou shalt not go out among them. And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. And when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house" (@Ezekiel 3: 24 - 27).
What an experience he had there! Instead of giving powerful ministry, he has to shut himself up, and they put bands on him, and moreover, his tongue would cleave to the roof of his mouth. What an experience that was! Who of us knows anything about that? But that is what is involved in the valley, and it is in order that in due course God will open his mouth to speak to a people who perhaps will not hear him at all.
{22}
It is to bring out the wonderful patience of God; that God is ready to testify to them in spite of their rebelliousness.
J.S. All this glory is shown him over against the rebellious condition of the people.
J.T. You can see the necessity for it. What power you need to minister under these circumstances; when people do not want to hear you!
{23}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (2)
@Ezekiel 4: 1 - 8; @Ezekiel 5: 1 - 4; @Ezekiel 6: 9,10; @Ezekiel 8: 1 - 6
J.T. At our first reading in Ezekiel, we considered chapters 1 - 3, which deal mainly with the fitting of the prophet for his great service. Chapters 4 - 7 (particularly chapter 4) depict his initial service, into which personal suffering entered. Chapters 8 - 11, taken together, are a subdivision of a great section which extends to chapter 19. In our two readings today we should cover, in a general way, the teaching of chapters 4 - 11, inclusive, so that we can begin with chapter 12 next time.
The first subject to be considered is the sign which portrays a siege against Jerusalem: "And thou, son of man, take thee a brick, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, -- Jerusalem: and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place battering-rams against it round about. And take unto thee an iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: this shall be a sign to the house of Israel", @Ezekiel 4: 1 - 3. This is the first solemn lesson in relation to an apostate condition of things; how God has laid siege against it; the prophet being used to represent the besieging power, from which there is no possible escape. The city is completely circumvented for destruction. Then the prophet himself endures suffering during two periods of three hundred and ninety days, and forty days, respectively.
Ques. What is suggested in the character of the testimony rendered in Ezekiel? God is not as yet speaking directly to the people.
J.T. It is a testimony that is presented to them by signs. It was for the people, however. God finds a way of causing such testimony as He gives to reach those concerned in it.
{24}
Rem. Later on, he speaks by word of mouth to the rebellious house; but here, the prophet himself is to be a sign.
J.T. That is the thought. It brings those who serve into the character of signs, for God employs signs; and He employs His people as signs. This book is very much marked by that; indeed, all the prophets are marked by it, more or less; and the Lord Jesus brings in the same idea Himself. The book of Revelation was written on this basis, for it is "signified"; that is, it is set out by signs; so that evidently those whom God uses should be ready to be employed in this way. The people later ask the prophet what he means by these things, and he tells them. Something which happens in the way of a sign from God would occasion inquiry, which gives opportunity to bring in the mind of God in detail. So that Ezekiel's portrayal of the city would be that: the apostate condition of things was to be entirely circumvented. There was to be no escape; utter destruction is in mind. In like manner, the book of Revelation shows that utter destruction will fall upon the present apostate state of things.
Ques. Would Mr. Darby's writings apply here?
J.T. Well, his prophetic writings certainly help as to these signs, because they open up the truth. Prophetic ministry was a great feature of the recovery of the truth; not simply prophetic ministry in the sense that we have had it before us recently, as bringing to us the mind of God on current conditions, but opening up the detail of future events.
A.N.W. Does this run on concurrently with preaching the glad tidings to the world?
J.T. I think it does. The book of Revelation helps in that regard. The Lord addressed Himself to the assemblies judicially, but His final word, addressed to Laodicea, is, "*I* ... have sat down with my Father in his throne" (@Revelation 3: 21); meaning that whatever
{25}
happens in the history of the assembly, the Lord retains His place on the throne of grace -- the Father's throne -- and the gospel goes on accordingly.
It is important that we have the force of the word as to the siege clearly in our minds, first, that God is dealing with the apostate condition that exists, and will deal with it thoroughly. There is no possibility of escape. This sign shows that. It was a siege. The forts are built *against* it. Notice the word "against". "Cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place battering-rams against it round about. And take thou unto thee an iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between thee and the city" (it would be a protection for the besieging power); "and set thy face against it ... and thou shalt lay siege against it" (@Ezekiel 4: 2, 3). It is very remarkable language, showing the thoroughness of the judgment that God announced. The system is to be completely destroyed.
J.S. Would the fact that Jehovah reverts to a sign indicate that the ears of the people had become dull of hearing; so that He would now show them something to reach their conscience through their eyes?
J.T. If people do not hear, they may *see*, in spite of themselves, and this extraordinary intervention did cause them to inquire what it meant, as we see later on. In view of the current thought in the world that there will be continual evolution to a perfect state of things, it is well to see that complete destruction is in the mind of God for the whole system. There is no possibility of escape! It is a very solemn matter, because we are in the midst of a state that is doomed, in this sense; so that Jeremiah, whose ministry corresponds to this testimony, was in the very midst of the city, and the gospel to those in it called upon them to go out from it. That is the gospel that Jeremiah preached. It was a very sorrowful service, for he had to announce the destruction of what he loved -- the city of Jerusalem -- and likewise with Ezekiel too, for the city is called
{26}
an ornament (@Ezekiel 7: 20). We shall see this reference as we pursue our subject.
So that is the position. It is, of course, a spiritual matter, and to be understood in a spiritual way, and the testimony concerning it is to be presented in a spiritual way; nevertheless, it is a fact; all pretension to the development of a better state of things in the future is simply fallacious. The whole system around us is doomed to unmitigated destruction.
A.R. In the addresses to the seven churches, a way of escape is offered for the overcomer in each one; whereas it says, great Babylon has fallen, as if the thing had already happened.
J.T. There is no escape for her; she is doomed. People are called upon to come out of her: "Come out of her, my people", @Revelation 18: 4. She represents the whole current moral system. The Lord says, "And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent", @Revelation 2: 21.
A.R. Does the city of Jerusalem in our chapter in Ezekiel represent the whole professing system?
J.T. Yes; that is clearly how it would apply today.
R.W.S. The people are not said to inquire here, but at least the prophet is sympathetic with God. Is he not particularly before us in the way of suffering?
J.T. That is what we shall see, particularly in the next chapter. There is one man who corresponds to Christ. God could portray in Ezekiel beforehand, the spirit and attitude of Christ in suffering, for it is a vicarious position that he takes on; not simply that he is suffering from the hands of man. He is suffering under divine direction, and typically, in a vicarious way, that is, for others.
C.A.M. It is a great privilege to be among those who stand for God. Those men are signs in themselves. Jonah, for instance, or Joshua, standing before the angel, and so too with Ezekiel.
{27}
J.T. Quite so; each one is to be concerned as to himself, as to how far he is a sign. The Lord says through Isaiah, in spirit, "Behold, I and the children that Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel" (@Isaiah 8: 18); not only are the prophets signs, but the *children* also.
A.F.M. Was Ezekiel, in this position, suffering in his own person as with bands upon him, three hundred and ninety days, and forty days, protected by the iron plate for a wall, until the end of the siege?
J.T. Yes; the iron plate in verse 3 would signify protection for the besiegers against counter-attacks. If we are for God in ministering the truth, we shall be attacked. "Take thou unto thee an iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between thee and the city" @Ezekiel 4: 3. That would be protection for him, enabling him to carry on his definite attitude of attack. "Set thy face against it, ... and thou shalt lay siege against it". Thus the besieger is protected and continues his attack.
Ques. Would the materials symbolise the condition? Brick is a substance that can be broken in upon. The iron plate would probably represent impregnability?
J.T. Yes; it is said to be "a wall of iron" @Ezekiel 4: 3. The other would be the condition of the city, I suppose; and the battering-rams being amongst the besiegers¬ equipment would be very powerful against walls of brick. We are protected by the iron plate so that our eyes may continue on in the right direction. "Set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it" @Ezekiel 4: 3; so that the besiegers are protected, and their faces are set in the right direction. We do not turn away from any. The lion is said to be marked by that; he "turneth not away for any", @Proverbs 30: 30. You set your face in that direction and maintain that attitude.
A.R. Do the first three verses represent God's judgment relative to the city, in order to bring us into correspondence with His judgment? "For God has
{28}
judged your judgment upon her", @Revelation 18: 20. Does it bring in sympathy in that sense?
J.T. Thus we come out with Christ finally in the armies of heaven. We have learned to set our faces against the apostate system. We do not turn aside.
Rem. In Zechariah, reference is made to the wall around Jerusalem in a symbolic way. It is a protection of this kind, is it not? It says, "and I, saith Jehovah, I will be unto her a wall of fire round about" (@Zechariah 2: 5). That, of course, speaks of Jerusalem in a favourable position.
J.T. That is right; and she is protected by mountains. "Jerusalem! -- mountains are round about her, and Jehovah is round about his people", @Psalm 125: 2. Here, the position is that of attacking, and you may be sure that there will be a counter-attack. How to meet that is in mind, so that your face is kept in the right direction.
C.N. Will you say a little more about how this siege would apply today?
J.T. It is a very striking picture. You have a besieger's complete equipment, so that victory is assured, and the person who is besieging has his face in the right direction unalterably. We do not turn aside. The wall of iron is to protect you. It is a sort of armour, so that you are kept looking on as a true warrior, in the right direction.
C.N. Did I understand you to say that the gospel would apply, in any sense?
J.T. No doubt it does. The gospel goes on concurrently with what would correspond with this siege today. We were remarking that the book of Revelation opens with the Lord speaking to the assemblies; and to the last one He says that He is about to spue it out of His mouth: the setting aside of the whole public christian profession is intimated, which implies what we have been speaking about; the attack on the whole system. In the meantime, Christ is on His Father's
{29}
throne, and therefore the continuation of the testimony of grace goes on. But still, there is this city -- this system of apostasy -- that is now developing rapidly. It is all heading up; so the attack would be of a *moral* kind, for the moment. It would be in *testimony*, and that is what God is doing and has been doing for many years -- bringing out His thoughts as to *His* system of things -- which really is what is most effective in pulling down what man has built up. There is also in the ministry an exposure of the apostasy.
A.C. If Ezekiel was so secured and protected against the forces of evil, would it not serve as an encouragement and incentive to the people of God today?
J.T. Well, you can understand how impregnable the position is as seen here; there is no letting up of the attack: "and thou shalt lay siege against it" @Ezekiel 4: 3. The thing goes on. And then, "This shall be a sign to the house of Israel" @Ezekiel 4: 3. There is a testimony in it.
J.S. And would the fact that the city is being besieged show the severity of the judgment of God, for it would compel those besieged to pass through a period of great privation? It is not simply being laid waste, but being besieged in this manner.
J.T. That is right; there is nothing more harrowing or distressing than a siege rightly pressed. And the picture here supposes complete besieging equipment, so that there is no possible escape for those besieged.
Ques. And is there an object lesson in this for us? Should we be prepared to besiege what is apostate today; and, on the other hand, to take on the feelings of those who are in the midst of it in a priestly way?
J.T. Quite so; it is worthy of note that while the siege is going on, the testimony of grace is going on, too -- the testimony of vicarious atonement -- *one* (Ezekiel) typically bearing the sin. "And thou, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: the number of the days that thou liest
{30}
upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. And I have appointed thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year" (@Ezekiel 4: 4 - 6). So that it would look as if the second sign in the chapter is one of grace; how God, while proposing to destroy the apostate state of things, has yet a foundation on which He will introduce another state of things; another world, you might say. So that it is very touching to see how God, beforehand, portrayed Christ in Ezekiel, in causing him to lie those three hundred and ninety days on his left side, and forty days on his right side. It is a very remarkable sign.
C.A.M. So that there would seem to be two things that would work for the blessing of the world around: the starvation condition of things that you get with the siege, and the sufferings and spirit of Christ in grace. Is that the thought?
J.T. Yes. There does not seem to be any suffering for the prophet in the portraying of the siege; but in what suggests vicarious sufferings and atonement, there is suffering. He suffers beyond mere human endurance, I apprehend; for really no human strength could go through this. It could only be gone through in the power of God.
A.N.W. So the apostle says, "I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh; who are Israelites", @Romans 9: 3.
J.T. And Moses, too, wishing to be blotted out. It is that same spirit, but here it is a superhuman *experience*. No one, I am sure, in mere natural strength, could endure this; being bound down with bands for three hundred and ninety days on one side and forty
{31}
days on the other. He was not to turn from one side to the other.
J.S. Have we here the vicarious sufferings of Christ portrayed?
J.T. That is what I understand. It is a very important thing, that God's testimony to man is not only of judgment. Whilst God has judgment in mind for the apostate system, He has His own purposes in mind, too.
C.A.M. When Stephen so beautifully portrayed the suffering side, he also went into all the history of the apostate nation. Saul of Tarsus must have seen in him a wonderful portrayal of this in the spirit of it!
J.T. Quite so; Stephen's sufferings were not vicarious; yet it was the spirit of Christ suffering in him; so that he was like Christ in his suffering -- kneeling down and praying for his murderers. Whether the portrayal is before the atoning sufferings of Christ, or after, it is the same thing. Paul said "to whom, as before your very eyes, Jesus Christ has been portrayed, crucified among you", @Galatians 3: 1. That must have been in himself; he *portrayed* Christ crucified among the Galatians.
Ques. Would the three hundred and ninety days go back to the time that they departed from God, rather than to the time they went into captivity?
J.T. The forty days would allude to Solomon's reign. It would allude particularly to Judah, and the choice part of the history of Israel. The three hundred and ninety days would be Israel, including Judah later; meaning that there is a sinful condition to be dealt with in the very best and brightest days of Israel, as well as the darkest. That is a very solemn suggestion.
C.B. How do christians press the siege today? Is it done by heeding Paul's word to Timothy: "The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2: 19?
{32}
J.T. Well, that would be a testimony to it negatively, but then there is the wonderful ministry that God has given to those who have departed from iniquity; the *Collected Writings*, for instance, and what the Lord has given since. There is the positive side in the ministry, as well as the negative side in withdrawing.
Ques. And would you say that the feelings expressed in withdrawing from iniquity in the assembly should be of this character?
J.T. I think so; you are judging that which you are leaving, and that means that God presently will judge it.
Rem. We really take upon ourselves, as judging it, the occasion of the siege.
A.R. Would you say that the Lord's service in Matthew's gospel was, in principle, a siege against Jerusalem? He operated outside of Jerusalem, according to Matthew.
J.T. Yes. His ministry in the synoptic gospels was mainly outside of Jerusalem. John gives us more in Jerusalem than the others, but He operated outside of it; and His ministry invariably pointed to the destruction of the current system, and when He drew near to Jerusalem, He formally stated that her enemies would come and build a palisaded mound against her; "these are days of avenging", @Luke 21: 22. But then He was about to die in the midst of it, as Ezekiel was here, in type; so that the besieging was really in the ministry of Christ. The atoning sufferings typified in chapter 4 of Ezekiel were also fulfilled in Him.
R.W.S. Is this extended time compressed in the three hours of forsaking on the cross which the Lord Jesus went through?
J.T. That is the idea, I think; the atoning sufferings were there as well as the testimony to the siege. The Lord could say, "for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?" @Luke 23: 31. That was the testimony to the siege; the destruction of the city.
{33}
J.S. So that the food supply would have been entirely cut off from the religious leaders of the city, according to Matthew: "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" (@Matthew 11: 25).
J.T. Just so. It is remarkable how Matthew exposes the religious system at Jerusalem, and shows the Lord preaching to the city, and indicating its doom; but He was also going to die in it.
Ques. What would you say about the bands: "I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other" (@Ezekiel 4: 8)?
J.T. It was really the finality of death, setting forth how the Lord Jesus was held in death, as we have often remarked -- the *bands* of death were there -- real death; the grave was real to Him. So that the "bands" accentuate the type.
C.N. It says of Ezekiel, chapter 4: 7, "thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it" @Ezekiel 4: 7.
J.T. That would refer to the time when the days were completed; his arm would be uncovered. I suppose that would be a sign of release, like the resurrection. There is testimony after Christ rises from the dead. And then, the besieging would mean that there would be a scarcity of food in the city, but Ezekiel, in going through these sufferings, has food, and a variety of it; but measured food. It says, "thou, take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou liest upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink" (@Ezekiel 4: 9 - 11). It is very instructive, I think, to consider what typifies Christ as going through the atoning sufferings; how the thought of
{34}
food is introduced; a variety of food is under Ezekiel's hand, yet everything according to measure. It is not for enjoyment; just enough to sustain life. No doubt there is allusion to siege conditions, but the reference to food goes further.
A.F.M. But was not the food distasteful to the prophet?
J.T. It was, in the sense of what he had to prepare it with; that is, I think, the awful feelings the Lord had to endure as bearing our sins in His own body on the tree. It represents what He felt when He was made sin. Think of the feelings that arose in connection with Ezekiel taking this food and preparing it with dung; but at the same time there was food, and a variety of it; not animal food, but vegetable food, and water. The point in it, I think, is that He does not succumb. The allusion would be to the power there was in Christ. He was able to cry with a loud voice twice while on the cross.
Ques. And was He able to rise in the same power?
J.T. Yes; but what is stressed is the endurance, going through the unspeakable ordeal; as He was forsaken He cried with a loud voice, and as He was about to die, He cried again with a loud voice; that is, His strength as a Man was maintained. He did not succumb to the terrible pressure; He rose again from the dead. He rose of Himself, although His resurrection is generally presented as by the power of God.
C.A.M. Do you think the food would refer in any way to the effect that the awful atmosphere and happenings of Calvary had on others, such as the thief and the centurion? The "dung" was the fuel used for baking, I understand.
J.T. But it would *enter into* the food, whatever it was. That is the way you have to look at it, as part of the food; whether it was for fuel for baking or preparation; it was there! Verse 14 shows this. It was mitigated on Ezekiel's complaint, but not in the antitype. The

prophet having to do in this way with what came out of man is a suggestion of what Christ dealt with on the cross and what He had to terminate judicially, for He was *made* sin.
A.F.M. During the whole period of suffering that the prophet passed through, was there not an activity of a constant kind, whether prophesying or enduring the trial as being bound? The bands were laid upon him. It seemed to be an experience which designated that he was going through some deep exercise through the whole period, from beginning to end.
J.T. It has been remarked that time is *condensed*; on the cross the condensation was infinite. There were three hours of darkness. He was actually on the cross longer; nevertheless the three hours of darkness and the three days and three nights in the heart of the earth would all be real, but how much was compressed into it! In a divine Person, compression may be infinite, as is suggested in the size of the ark of the covenant.
C.A.M. I suppose it must have been infinite in the case of Christ because the cross involved all the eternal darkness of the judgment of the lost.
J.T. It was dealing with the judgment of God, and who could measure that? Only He could do it!
Ques. Do you think His consciousness would have entered into the grave? I would like to know how the thought of His death, burial, and resurrection, and what entered into that, would connect with His words, "I lay down my life that I may take it again" @John 10: 17. Just where does His consciousness come into His death and burial?
J.T. It is not easy to say much about consciousness in the grave; but we read of the pains of death, which were loosed. In this as always we have to think and speak according to the language of Scripture. He says to the thief, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise", @Luke 23: 43. His death in that way is like that of believers; He departed from the body for the moment.
{36}
But, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay", @Matthew 28: 6. He was there, and in coming in and taking His body in resurrection, of course, there was that feeling, however brief. Death was there, and it was felt by Him: the pains of death were loosed. It was not possible that He should be held by death's power; the allusion to the pains of death is very solemn and touching; they were real pains.
J.S. So that we must go to various scriptures in the Old Testament to see what He went through in those three days and three nights?
J.T. Yes; the thought of burial attaches to the atonement. The apostle said, "I delivered to you ... that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures", @1 Corinthians 15: 3, 4. All that is included in the thought of atonement.
A.R. Would entering into death and rising the third day be for the breaking of the power of death?
J.T. Yes; the three days would mean the actuality of the Lord's death. How actual it was, and prolonged! He tasted death; it was a real thing; not only on the cross, but in the grave.
C.A.M. As I understand it, the expression "pains" used by Peter, that you alluded to, is the pain that brings life into the world.
J.T. Quite so; that would be Himself coming into resurrection.
Ques. You connect the three hours of darkness with the abandonment?
J.T. Quite so; it was a period of realisation of God's abandonment of Him; so that He really endured the full weight of divine wrath. The first cry with a *loud* voice, I have thought, is that He had exhausted the judgment of God; and the second, I think, is that He was terminating the man that caused all the dishonour and sorrow. I believe that is the significance of the two cries.
{37}
A.R. And would you also say that He terminated all that is religious in a pretentious way against God?
J.T. Exactly; all was involved in that.
Ques. At what point does the abandonment cease and God enter into the matter again?
J.T. Well, of course, there is nothing said as to God's intervention until He raised Him from the dead; that is, the idea of atonement runs through. The Lord would not be in death for an instant, were it not that He was suffering vicariously. You could not apply death to Him personally, except in a vicarious sense. It would be derogatory to connect death with Him for the smallest possible space of time, save in a vicarious sense.
A.N.W. Would you care to distinguish, as a matter of time, His bearing sins, and His being made sin, or are they entirely concurrent?
J.T. I think they are concurrent. He actually took on man's condition, and no doubt that is what is alluded to in Ezekiel, in the reference to what came from man. It refers to what His experience was in being made sin; how awful it was to Him! He did not ask for any mitigation of it. Ezekiel did, and got it; but Christ did not. He experienced the thing in being made sin. So I suppose the final cry would be the termination of that; although man had to go into the grave, as well. The first penalty included, "For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return", @Genesis 3: 19. So that the Lord had to go into the grave and enter into the full extent of God's judgment on man. It is important to keep the grave in mind as part of the vicarious sufferings of Christ in connection with the judgment of God.
A.F.M. At what time were the sufferings completed? The Lord said, "It is finished" @John 19: 30. But then He went into the grave, and He was there three days and three nights; would that be vicarious?
{38}
J.T. It was; it would be negative or passive on His part, but still it was part of the whole thing. The three days and three nights had to do with atonement.
J.S. Do we not have to see what is positive in regard to the overthrowing of the powers of evil -- death and hades; so that He is seen coming out as having the keys of death and hades?
J.T. Implying administrative power as to them. I believe this type is to impress upon us how real the Lord's death and burial were as atoning suffering.
G.MacP. What would be in the mind of the Spirit of God giving this detailed testimony to the death of Christ before it came to pass?
J.T. From the very beginning of Scripture we have testimony to it, but here we have a remarkable testimony in the sense of this sign; a man lying on his side three hundred and ninety days and forty days. What a remarkable thing that a man should experience this in testimony long before the Lord Jesus died!
Rem. And there was no release from this, the prophet not turning until the periods were completed. We sometimes try to swerve out of difficulties, but Ezekiel was, as it were, bound in it.
W.B-w. Will you say something about the barley-cake in verse 12? Does that connect with the second cry, in that it was baked with what comes out of man?
J.T. Well, I suppose so. The barley was the first-fruits of the cereals. The variety of vegetables mentioned here is striking, and the measurements are instructive, too. It is no question of feasting, but enough to sustain life; it suggests what the Lord Jesus went through as Man, having divine power, but nevertheless a Man going through and bearing this awful load, and coming out of it as Man.
R.W.S. He refused the draught given Him which might tend to stupefy the sensibilities.
J.T. That is right; He retained Man's sensibilities right through, so that the last cry is Man's cry. He is
{39}
laying down His life, but He has power. No creature can do that because there is positive weakness with us as one is about to die.
J.S. What do you have in mind in respect of variety?
J.T. I think it is the deliberateness that was seen in Christ as Man; He was never overcome by circumstances, no matter how varied. The deliberateness with which Ezekiel was to draw on this variety of vegetable food is suggestive. The remnant will go through all this too, only in a limited way.
A.R. And would you say that the four hundred and thirty days represent not only the history of man, but of the apostate system and its failure before God?
J.T. Yes; and how the Lord felt things; how He went through Israel's history as working out atonement. The whole history would be in His mind. Think of the sins! How they were all counted! As we contemplate the deliberateness with which Christ faced the question of atonement in Gethsemane, it becomes food for us; how deliberate He was about everything, but feeling things profoundly; yet He was never overwhelmed. He was deliberate and His senses were always with Him. Even on the cross, He refused, as has been remarked, to take the vinegar, having tasted it. He retained His taste and power of discrimination to refuse what might be an opiate to Him. Although a divine Person, He is a real Man going through all these sufferings.
J.S. Showing the greatness of the Man!
J.T. I think it should bring Him before us as food, because in pressure we are so apt to be irritated, like Moses, and be flustered and not know what to say, like Peter on the mountain. The Lord was never anything but Himself.
Ques. I want to ask about the blood of the bullock in @Leviticus 16, being taken in and put on the mercy-seat, by the priest. What does that place refer to?
J.T. The mercy-seat was under the eyes of the cherubim, but it was the mercy-seat. It denoted mercy.
{40}
The blood was sprinkled *on* the mercy-seat and then seven times *before* it, meaning I suppose, that there was testimony under the eye of God as to the atoning death of Christ, so that He could look out on the sinner as He does in Chronicles, where the cherubim looked toward man. Jehovah looked out; He could look out on man in grace, being satisfied or appeased with the blood.
Ques. Does the mercy-seat represent heaven? Is it before God as to position?
J.T. Well, you could not say it was in heaven. It was here on earth.
Ques. But where was the blood taken in?
J.T. Well, the idea of place is moral. There are some who say the blood was taken into heaven, but that is forcing Scripture. It all happened, as from Jesus as dead, "immediately there came out blood and water", @John 19: 34. God saw it; "and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin", @1 John 1: 7.
J.S. So that in @Romans 3, the Person is the mercy-seat.
J.T. Just so; it is Christ risen. "Whom God has set forth a mercy-seat" (@Romans 3: 25). That is the idea, so that we must dismiss the literal thought of place. It is what He is before God, in resurrection. But atonement was effected on earth.
C.A.M. As the blood was taken in, so the body was burnt in its entirety outside the camp; so that it must be looked at in a moral way.
J.T. Quite so; all the victims, whose blood was taken inside, were burned outside the camp.
J.S. God making such provision for the sinner's approach?
J.T. Quite so; and so @Romans 3 is the opening up of it for the believer.
A.R. What did you have in mind to say about @Ezekiel 5?
{41}
J.T. These three chapters, 5, 6, and 7, denote the actual carrying out of the judgment. One is struck, in reading them, with the finality - the completeness -- of the judgment. Chapter 7 says: "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel: An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land". @Ezekiel 7: 2. It is a complete matter, and the whole position is in mind; none are exempt. It is the land now. "Now is the end upon thee: and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations. And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil! behold, it is come. The end is come; the end is come"; (note the repetitions); "it awaketh against thee: behold, it cometh. The doom is come unto thee, inhabitant of the land; the time is come, the day is near, -- tumult, and not the joyous cry from the mountains. Now will I soon pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee; and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations. And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity ... and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that it is I, Jehovah, that smite" (@Ezekiel 7: 3 - 9).
It is the description of the unmitigated judgment on the land -- the whole position. And chapter 5 begins this matter with the figure of a razor being used to shave off the hair and the beard, and the hairs are to undergo a peculiar process. It says in chapter 5: "And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife; a barber's razor shalt thou take; and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: and thou shalt take balances to weigh, and divide the hair. A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days
{42}
of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts; and thou shalt take of these again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: from it shalt a fire come forth against all the house of Israel" (@Ezekiel 5: 1 - 4).
This is the initial thought of these three chapters; the process Jerusalem is to undergo. But, finally, some are taken in the skirts of the prophet; and then we have the pronoun "it" in verse 4, "from it shall a fire come forth against all the house of Israel" @Ezekiel 5: 4. It would seem that as a result of that process there is something with which God can again begin to operate; so that we have in chapter 6, "And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they have been carried captives, when I shall have broken their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed, in all their abominations. And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them" (@Ezekiel 5: 9, 10). So that I think we see a remnant now, owned first in the hairs that were taken into the prophet's garment (which would suggest *personal* identification with them), and taken on in a peculiar way, yet suffering; but a fire comes out in that connection, as if God now has a new starting point.
A.R. They are with God now in His governmental dealings against the city.
J.T. It is the idea of a remnant; God begins to operate again in that connection.
Ques. Why is the hair divided into three parts?
J.T. Well, I think it is to bring out testimony to the prolonged process of judgment, and yet a definite end is to be reached in a remnant
{43}
Rem. In @Zechariah 13: 8,9, the people are divided into three parts also; "two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried".
J.T. That passage helps as to what is meant here. It is more definite as to the remnant; they are tried as gold is tried.
Rem. The word here seems to have a future bearing. The people are to be reduced to a very small number.
J.T. Quite so; and note the process of reduction, it implies ornamentation being taken away; the shaving of the head and the beard, which to the Jew would be the loss of ornamentation in personal appearance. All that is negative. In this process one loses all caste or standing, whatever it may be, and starts over again; you have to take on new ornamentation.
Rem. Does it not refer to that in chapter 7, "And he set in majesty his beautiful ornament; but they made therein the images of their abominations and of their detestable things" (@Ezekiel 7: 20).
J.T. That helps as to the word "ornament" We shall see it later in connection with the death of Ezekiel's wife, suggestive of what Jerusalem was. Apparently this shaving process means that any of us who have part in that which imparts natural distinction, are to be shorn of that sort of ornament, to be prepared for another; so that when we come to chapter 8, the hair is again referred to, but in another aspect; it represents *power* now. It is not ornamentation now; it denotes the power of life operative; hence there is strength in it -- Ezekiel was lifted up by it.
Rem. Even when a remnant is procured, it seems as if God is not entirely satisfied, for the hair is first put in the skirts, and some of these are put into the
{44}
fire, as if they are the ones to be more thoroughly disciplined.
J.T. One is impressed with the history of the people of God in the Old Testament; God's extraordinary dealings with them as subjected to continual sufferings, one after another, covering an immense period; and what can it be but that they represent what *we all are*, only they are taken on as an example, in order that God may show how incorrigible the flesh is, and how patient He is -- in reaching His end in us notwithstanding. If He is to reach His thought in any of us, what a process He has to go through so as to reach, in a small way, what He has in His mind.
Rem. Even though the Jewish people superabound in wealth today "their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah's wrath; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their belly; for it hath been the stumbling-block of their iniquity" (@Ezekiel 7: 19).
J.T. It is very remarkable; even the idea of buying and selling is to be abandoned. Their great characteristic is their aptitude for commerce, but this suffering implies that it all goes for nothing.
W.B-w. Do you think the climax of the abominations in this section would be seen in the image of jealousy and sun worship in chapter 8?
J.T. Yes; but then, in regard to the terrible judgment of chapter 7, as though the commercial ability of the Jew were in mind, it says, "The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof. For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, even though he were yet alive amongst the living: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof; it shall not be revoked; and none shall through his iniquity assure his life" (@Ezekiel 7: 12, 13). The allusion is to mercantile pursuits, which so characterise that people,
{45}
and of course these features come out in all of us. The feature is seen here as withering away; it is nothing.
Ques. Do you think that the expression, "none shall through his iniquity assure his life" would include the thought of unions in the commercial world?
J.T. Quite so; they set forth the idea of iniquity assuring your life, but the saints cannot do things on those lines, for it is iniquity, as has often been pointed out. Trade unions involve iniquitous associations and murder.
Rem. The purpose in the back of one's mind in connecting with a trade union would be to "assure" things.
J.T. Quite so; so you can see that the judgment in chapter 7 is a complete breaking up of that sort of thing, including commerce.
C.A.M. No traffic or trafficker is allowed in God's house. It would seem to preclude any feeling that there is self gain in these holy things.
J.T. Quite so. Now, in regard to chapter 8, it says in verses 3 and 4, "And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the valley" @Ezekiel 8: 3,4. It seems to me that this links on with what we have had before us. The hair in chapter 5 is ornamentation, but the person is shorn of it with a razor, and a terrible process of discipline is seen in what follows there, but now we have the hair on the head and strong enough to be used to hold the man up.
A.F.M. It is referred to as a "lock".
J.T. Quite so. The strength of Samson's seven locks is seen in @Judges 16:13, 14. I believe Samson,
{46}
as a type, instructs us as to what hair means. It is the testimony to the power of life in a person. Samson's hair began to grow and that is where the power lay for his final victory. So here: "He stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens" @Ezekiel 8: 3. It would seem to suggest the power of resurrection. There would be the idea of power in the person: he says, "a lock of my head". We have hair frequently alluded to in Scripture and especially in Samson -- seven locks shaven off by Delilah -- but Scripture does not say it grew afterwards as a lock, it is simply, "the hair of his head began to grow" @Judges 16: 22. But here it is a lock, and the hand holds Ezekiel by it. It says, "the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens" (as if it is not only resurrection but ascension), "and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the valley" (@Ezekiel 8: 3, 4); that is, God is in the valley, but now in relation to resurrection. It seems to be what God is in relation to death, as having effected resurrection, It is divine power viewed thus that is seen in the following chapters.
C.H. Would that power be suggested in "for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power", @2 Corinthians 13: 4?
J.T. Yes. The testimony of Ezekiel was really the Spirit of Christ speaking in him. Christ was crucified in weakness, but He lives by God's power; but then the apostle goes on to say, "for indeed we are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God's power towards you", @2 Corinthians 13: 4. His ministry was in the power of resurrection.
{47}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (3)
@Ezekiel 9: 1 - 11; @Ezekiel 10: 18 - 22; @Ezekiel 11: 13 - 25
J.T. Although we have read in chapters 9, 10, and 11 tonight, it should be kept in mind that our section begins with chapter 8 and is a sub-division of a great section that runs from the beginning of chapter 8 to the end of chapter 19. According to what has previously come before us, the testimony is presented in the power of resurrection, as typified in the lock of the hair of the prophet.
The last verse we have read tonight should be kept in mind as we proceed with our reading. The prophet says, "And I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shewn me" (@Ezekiel 11: 25); showing that what is received from the Lord by those who minister amongst the saints is shown to all; here those of the captivity are particularly in view. This verse closes the section we are considering and would help us to bear in mind that ministry is the outcome of what we receive from the Lord, and that we do not reserve it for any special or personal reasons, but give out what we receive.
Chapter 8 shows that what is current at Jerusalem is the spirit of idolatry, provocative of jealousy. So that we have: "And he brought me to the entry of the court, and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall. And he said unto me, Son of man, dig now through the wall; and I digged through the wall, and behold, a door. And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. And I went in and looked, and behold, every form of creeping thing and abominable beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about. And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his
{48}
hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. And he said unto me, Hast thou seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land. And he said unto me, Yet again shalt thou see great abominations which they do" (@Ezekiel 8: 7 - 13).
Thus it will be observed that these chapters have in mind personal conduct; names of specific persons are mentioned, one of whom dies in chapter 11, and Jehovah is seen calling attention to the evil, and directing the judgments against it in a personal way. So that this section would call upon us to *be with God* in what He is doing today. There is the general evil condition, but there are also certain persons who are prominent in the evil, and then there are certain persons, beside the prophet, who are brought into the service of judgment with God. Personalities are stressed as being involved in the evil, but in these circumstances, God Himself acts directly and calls others in a personal way into action with Him; so that they become workers with God.
A.B.P. Is there significance in the fact that the living creatures, and other details of the vision which the prophet saw at Chebar, are referred to in this section?
J.T. I think so. It is to bring out that it is all one matter. It began at the river Chebar, where the saints were in captivity; the scene now is transferred to Jerusalem, but it is the same array of power; the same instrumentalities; the same system of judgment. That is not to be lost sight of. But I think this section brings out, peculiarly, individuality in God Himself, and in persons He uses. The idea of individuality has a great place in the Scriptures, set out in persons who minister and who call attention to themselves. For example, we find the expressions, "I Daniel", "I Paul", "I John", and the Lord Jesus uses the same expression, "I Jesus".
{49}
All that is to stress the idea of individuality in divine service. This is confirmed in the reference (@Ezekiel 8: 2), to "the appearance of his loins" downward and upward.
W.B-w. You referred to resurrection in chapter 8, and the glory there. Does that connect with this section?
J.T. Yes. These chapters present the glory seen in judgment and show that the divine lustre does not deteriorate. It is seen in judgment later in Stephen, when his face shone as an angel. The glory was there -- judicial glory -- and, of course, God's glory does not deteriorate when it enters into judgment. God's glory shines unchangeably; so that in the scripture before us the glory appears, and Jehovah Himself comes in and directs everything in a personal way.
W.B-w. In chapter 8 both the image of jealousy and the glory are seen, but later, the glory departs.
J.T. One of the thoughts that run through this section is the departure of the glory, It is a humbling and sorrowful contemplation. The wife of Phinehas, when dying, named her child Ichabod, saying, "The glory is departed from Israel", @1 Samuel 4: 21. But its departure is in view of the recovery of the people and its return. Here it is very slow to leave, for judgment is God's strange work, but alas! the glory has to leave: "And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city" (@Ezekiel 11: 22, 23). It is the glory, but it is gradually departing; it is not *ceasing*; we shall see it coming back later.
C.A.M. You spoke of individuality and of God Himself coming in; do you think that would be a feature of latter church history, which would conform to what was at the beginning? We read of distinctive persons in the Acts, but we might be slow to realise that the same idea is in the mind of the Spirit for the present time.
{50}
J.T. I thought we might see that there is such a thing as that; that God Himself is acting. There is the general thought of judgment in the siege; but God is not seen in the siege. It is rather that others are besieging, but this section, from chapter 8 on, I think, brings out that God Himself acts, and others are brought into it, in the sense of personality. The section stresses judicial action, but at the same time has in view that another order of things is presently to come into view. The Acts would give us this same view of things; judicial action on the part of God against Jerusalem, but, at the same time, another order of things in view -- "Jerusalem above" -- awaiting Paul's ministry for its introduction and development. Our part is to carry on the *positive* side of the truth.
A.N.W. Would the thought of the individuality of God which has been referred to, be illustrated in the matter of the sin of Ananias and Sapphira, as being against the Holy Spirit?
J.T. I think that is good; God is seen in the three Persons there; divine personality is seen in @Acts 5; "God" in verse 4; "the Holy Spirit" in verse 3; and "the Lord" in verse 9. Peter alleges that the sin was against each. Divine personality is clearly brought in there.
Rem. Then also in @Acts 1, the thought of personality is stressed, where the upper chamber is alluded to, where were staying "Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude the brother of lames" (@Acts 1: 13). And then also "the crowd of names who were together, was about a hundred and twenty"; each one is distinguished.
J.T. Quite so; personality is in mind in the *names* mentioned, and then in the *crowd of names*, too; and I think, at the end of the dispensation, it is very suggestive that God is helping us as to the Persons of the Godhead, and how They stand in the testimony. I think we may
{51}
refer to that here, because it is touching that God Himself is directing everything in our scriptures, especially in chapters 9 and 10.
C.N. The scriptures read seem to make a difference between those who dwell at Jerusalem and Judah, and those in the captivity. Would you define that for us?
J.T. Well, we have a word in @Jeremiah 24 about two baskets of figs; one basket full of very good figs, and the other basket had very bad figs. The latter would refer to those who were left in Jerusalem, for the principle for the moment was to leave Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar was said to be Jehovah's servant; not Zedekiah, the reigning king in Judah. Zedekiah was regarded as lawless, and those remaining with him in Jerusalem were viewed in the same way; as bad figs. They did not submit to the governmental dealings of God. They stayed in Jerusalem, as though things were right there. @Ezekiel 11 is the same thing; they suppose the position is right, when it is wrong.
Now the figs were said to be very bad -- a very remarkable word and it applies as much today, where there is disregard for the governmental dealings of God. It is a time for governmental dealings, and there are those who disregard them altogether, paying no attention to them, assuming that things are all right, when they are *not* right. God is dealing judicially with them, as it says, "whosoever has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him", @Luke 8: 18. That is what is going on all around us, and people are paying no attention to it. But then, there is the other side, for it also says, "whosoever has, to him shall be given". So that in the prophet Jeremiah, the good figs are those whom Nebuchadnezzar took away in the first captivity: the king, the princes, the craftsmen, and the smiths; they were honoured in that way, being persons of usefulness, constructive persons. They were carried away captive, but were viewed as
{52}
submissive to the government of God, and God's hand was over them for good.
Now the same idea is found in Ezekiel, for those who were in Jerusalem were not subject to the government of God, and God Himself directed the judgment against them, whilst those in the captivity are viewed in the light of favour, and the message through Ezekiel is taken to them, namely, "all the things that Jehovah had shewn me" (@Ezekiel 11: 25).
C.N. Referring again to Jeremiah, the good figs as brought back and presented at the door of the temple would be for food.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord sought for figs when here; He was hungry, but He found none. But now there are good figs in one basket -- those viewed as subject to God's dealings, as we have seen. But those actually at Jerusalem were very bad; worse than if there were none.
Rem. The condition is called "wicked" in this book: it says, "she hath rebelled against my judgments in wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for mine ordinances have they refused; and my statutes, they have not walked in them" (@Ezekiel 5: 6). I was thinking of what you were saying about what is committed. In @Matthew 25, the bondman who disregarded the proper use of what was committed to him was called a "wicked bondman".
J.T. Yes; an ordinary judge would hardly pronounce that upon him. He just hid the talent in the earth; did not use it. That is wickedness, for he is called a "wicked bondman". I think we are perhaps too slow to recognise that insubjection to the government of God is wickedness, whatever form it may take.
Rem. So that the image of jealousy at Jerusalem, which disputes the rights of the glory, renders the city wicked.
{53}
J.T. Quite so. Then, referring to chapter 9, we have a cry, "And he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Draw near, ye that have charge of the city", @Ezekiel 9: 1. There must be something of importance in that *voice*. "Ye that have charge of the city". These would not be the princes, whose names we get in chapters 8 and 10. These are they whom God regards as responsible, and He is calling them into action, "every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand" @Ezekiel 9: 1. These weapons, and the persons who hold them, are not looked upon with favour by us unless we are really with God. But God would call us into this, as to the general position in the profession.
C.H.H. Would they correspond with the angels of the assemblies?
J.T. It would be the same sort of thing, I think; those who are responsible representatively, so that the Lord calls upon each angel to do something; He charges them to deal with evil. The angels of the assemblies are not, however, viewed as apart from the evil that may exist in the assemblies, but they are responsible and called upon to act.
Rem. Chapter 4 seems to present Ezekiel as doing things, whereas here it is the responsible element in the city that acts.
J.T. Well, God is here calling individuals into service, not simply one, but several, and these are persons regarded as having charge: "Ye that have charge of the city" @Ezekiel 9: 1. It is a special class of people, and they are armed. God has taken the thing in hand Himself, in a personal way, and He has taken qualified persons for the service on hand. And then, there is a special person clothed in linen with a writer's ink-horn. He is a very interesting man, for he has a great place in this chapter and in the next one too. We should keep our eye upon him; he is clothed in linen, and is told to mark off the people who are not to come under judgment. He is a peculiarly interesting man, for he
{54}
represents grace, and also divine discrimination. It is a service to be specially desired. He is furnished. He has what is needed, and he is able to mark off the people that sigh and cry. He has a good ear for sounds, capable of hearing sighs and cries on account of current wickedness.
J.S. That would be those *feeling* the evil; not such as would make merry.
A.N.W. Is he the seventh in the midst of the six -- a complement of the six? The six are executors of judgment, whilst this man looks for what is to be saved.
J.T. Yes; that is a very interesting point. He represents God in *discrimination*. The six men represent God in *judgment*, particularly as being in charge of the city. It is a time of judgment, but it is lighted up by this man who is clothed in linen and has a writer's ink-horn by his side. He is in the midst of the others, but he has a distinctive work to do.
Rem. In @Matthew 13, the fishermen gathered the good fish into vessels and cast the worthless out.
C.H.H. Would the weeping in verse 14 of chapter 8 be in a *wrong* sense? It says that the women were weeping.
J.T. Quite so; they were weeping for Tammuz, which would refer to idolatry. There is much of that kind of religious feeling around us.
J.S. What would the position of the brazen altar in verse 2 indicate?
J.T. The altar was the place of judgment in a sacrificial sense; at the cross Jesus suffered the extreme judgment of God against sin; hence the consistency of God in this action. The great white throne is in keeping with the altar, and the sufferings of Christ, where God meted out judgment to His own Son on account of man's disobedience. How can He tolerate disobedience in men now? That would seem to be the idea; the altar represents God's consistency with what He is doing.
{55}
R.W.S. In chapter 8 there seems to be a thorough discovery of what is in the city. Verse 7 reads, "he brought me to the entry of the court" @Ezekiel 8: 7, then in verse 14 it says, "he brought me to the entry of the gate of Jehovah's house" @Ezekiel 8: 14, and in verse 16 it refers to "the inner court of Jehovah's house" @Ezekiel 8: 16; then in chapter 9 there seems to be a thorough knowledge of conditions in the city. How would that apply today?
J.T. Is it not that God would help us to judge things? For, if we withdraw from iniquity, we must know it exists; not that one is to be an iniquity-monger; not that we are looking for it, but God leads us to see it; it is a question here of what God shows His people. One would not like to go through the world looking for the iniquity that is current, but God shows us what is there. We are with God as to the general position, and He is with us.
J.S. That would be iniquity in high places?
J.T. Exactly, chiefly in the house. Think of what was going on inside Jehovah's house! Today it is the "great house" @2 Timothy 2: 20.
J.S. I was thinking of the Lord going into the temple and driving out all those who bought and sold; they were making His Father's house a merchandise mart.
J.T. We do not hear of Him going into the slums of Jerusalem to find out what the underworld was doing. It was those professedly in relation to God that He dealt with, because that is where Satan will work against God. Of course what is in the underworld is against Him, too, but it is not specially so. The enemy gets as near as possible to what is nominally of God. Satan gets as near to God as he can in his operations against Him.
J.S. And that would be to hinder the service of God?
J.T. Exactly; to nullify what God is identified with. Everybody knows that God is not identified with the
{56}
underworld, but the cathedrals and the so-called churches and the like provide room wherein Satan can operate, and, indeed, wherever the people of God are, it can be said that "Satan also came" @Job 1: 6. He would corrupt, if possible, what is connected with God; especially His house. God shows the prophet the corruption which had been introduced in relation to His house and His city.
A.F.M. These men with the slaughter weapons were told to slay utterly the old men and the young men, and maidens and the little children and the women. I was thinking of how complete this judgment was, that it took in even the little children. We have just heard about the temple, where the children sang His praises. You could not think of judgment falling upon them, but what a remarkable thing it is that there are little children here! How ready the devil is to influence even little children!
J.T. What a voice it is to us as to our children! And it is lest they should be found in these ways, not lest they should have part in the underworld, but lest Satan should corrupt them in these ways, where God is outwardly owned; in places having a reputation that God is there. According to Ezekiel, the little children are brought there, the women are there, and the old men, and the young men; they are all there; all in the wickedness!
Rem. It says in @Revelation 2: 23, "her children will I kill with death". And of Babylon it says that her sin reaches to heaven. I suppose there could be nothing worse in the sight of heaven than spiritual fornication.
J.T. That is what is in mind here; the prophet is shown things which are about to fall under the execution of judgment. Today our judgment is executed in withdrawal from these things -- rigid withdrawal. It is a moral judgment, but the things are known. God shows them to us; we do not have to ferret out evil.
{57}
God shows us the things that affect Him, and calls us to be with Him in the judgment. Of course, as gathered to the Lord's name in the recognition of the assembly, if evil shows itself in any way we are bound to investigate, in a priestly way. Hence if evil is found to exist, we have witnesses, and thus ground on which to move in judgment.
C.H.H. Would 2 Timothy correspond as indicating our responsibility to exercise judgment in relation to what is in the house?
J.T. Yes; the different kinds of evil are recorded in chapter 3, particularly.
A.Pf. There are those who are marked out by the man with the ink-horn; would that be a remnant?
J.T. The suggestion is that we are to be able to determine those that are immune from this judgment. So that 2 Timothy is, "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2: 22). The suggestion is that you can locate such; you can discover them; and withdrawing from iniquity is in keeping with the thought of judgment here. We do not do violence to people who are in iniquity; we *leave* them. God will deal with evil in His own time. Our position is a moral one; we act on the ground of withdrawal, but, on the other hand, we are to discern those who are calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart. It is not now that they have a mark in their foreheads; it is a question of what is in their *hearts*, and you must get near to them to discern that.
A.R. Is the mark on the forehead a result of what is inward?
J.T. It would be, as indicating the work of God, but you must get near to people to discover what is in their hearts. Jehu said, "Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?" @2 Kings 10:15. That is the way it works out today, by getting near to people and finding out where they are. Otherwise, many may
{58}
come in amongst us whom we may have to sorrow over later.
C.A.M. Jehu did not shake hands with him until he was sure. He extended his hand on the basis that the other man's heart was right.
J.T. Quite so. Well, then, our chapter goes on to say, "And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house" (@Ezekiel 9: 3). That is, God is moving; the whole position is made plain. Attention is called to the brazen altar; the place where Christ bore the extreme judgment of God on account of sin. And now God is moving; leaving the house, and so the passage goes on to say, "and he called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer's ink-horn by his side; and Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have pity" @Ezekiel 9: 3 - 5. There are many who would be inclined to listen attentively to what is said to this man with the writer's ink-horn, who is going to relieve some of judgment, but they would recoil from the idea of judgment, and no doubt that is why Ezekiel says, "in my hearing", as we have noticed; "And to the others he said in my hearing, Go after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have pity. Slay utterly the old man, the young man, and the maiden, and little children, and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary" (@Ezekiel 9: 5, 6).
F.N.W. Peter speaks of the judgment beginning, "from the house of God" @1 Peter 4: 17. Would these men who come and stand beside the brazen altar be such?
J.T. Yes; those with the slaughter weapons. But first they stand where there is a judgment of sin,
{59}
according to God. They stood beside the brazen altar. It is the standing testimony to the judgment of God. At the present time this should be maintained; indeed, it is, to some extent at least, in our care meetings and our assembly meetings convened for the purpose of dealing with sin. All this is in keeping with the brazen altar.
A.C. Does the man clothed with linen appear at a certain crisis? Daniel, at the end of his book, speaks of a man clothed in linen who was able to give a definite answer to the prophet's inquiries.
J.T. I think the idea of being clothed in linen is that you are qualified. The Lord said, "Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone", @John 8: 7. If we execute assembly discipline, surely it implies that we ourselves are judging the thing, and not only the particular matter in hand, but everything like it; that we are thus morally clear. The man clothed with linen represents what God can approve and use in this service. It is a question of holy discrimination. The executors of the judgment follow this man with the linen garment, for discrimination is most important, else we might execute judgment on persons who are not guilty. This is quite possible; the question as to whether the facts, stated as to a given person, are so or not, comes up frequently amongst us, and it is important that there should be the state amongst us that is represented by the man in linen, with a writer's ink-horn, who is able to discern a person that is immune.
W.B-w. It is said in verse 11 that the man with the ink-horn came back and "reported the matter". Is that a good feature?
J.T. Yes, and he said, "I have done as thou hast commanded me" @Ezekiel 9: 11. It is a finished matter. The chapter outlines the whole matter, and what you have just quoted is the finish of it. The matter is reported; it is all settled in heaven.
{60}
W.B-w. So that when a case comes up before the general meeting, it is, as it were, reported, and the brethren can judge according to the facts.
J.T. Here all is done as divinely commanded; that is the true basis for judgment.
A.F.M. Is not the attitude of Ezekiel a good one? He says, "while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?" (@Ezekiel 9: 8). He *felt* things; that is another feature according to God.
J.T. Yes; and you have a counterpart of that in chapter 11, when Pelatiah died; "And I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?" (@Ezekiel 11: 13). It is surely right that we should *feel* things; God, I think, values that and honours it.
Rem. There does not seem to be any alleviation here.
J.T. You mean on account of Ezekiel's feelings? No; that is to be noticed; there is no alleviation. This book says that "though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness" (@Ezekiel 14: 14). The severity of God's judgment is stressed, but it is all on the principle of perfect discrimination. The evil is shown; God Himself takes part in showing it, and the judgment is on the ground that the thing is manifest.
Ques. Moses says, "And now, if thou wilt forgive their sin ... but if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book that thou hast written. And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book", @Exodus 32: 32, 33. Is that not the point: every one must bear his own sin?
J.T. Quite so; that is stressed in this book.
W.B-w. Pelatiah, whose death is recorded in chapter 11, was a prince supporting the wickedness. His death is God's government.
{61}
J.T. That is right; personality, in a bad sense, is seen in chapter 11. The names of two princes are given: "And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looketh eastward; and behold, at the door of the gate were five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people" (@Ezekiel 11: 1). These represent the public men of Jerusalem. The book of the Acts brings such before us too, as also the epistles; certain men of distinction, in a bad sense. One of these, Pelatiah, died; that is, God discriminated against him. Ezekiel's sorrow did not alter that. But God went on immediately to speak to Ezekiel about his *brethren*. It is as though God said, Never mind these distinguished men; it is your brethren that you are to think about.
W.B-w. Would these men be paralleled in Herod in @Acts 12, who was eaten of worms?
J.T. Just so. There are many mentioned in the Acts, but he is an outstanding case of one who came under the judgment of God, and we have similar instances in the history of God's government -- weakening the power of evil until it is finally dealt with.
A.B.P. Does the execution of this judgment fit in with the straight feet and the straight going of the cherubim?
J.T. Quite so; there is no discrepancy on that side; everything is infinitely accurate Now in chapter 10 we have a most interesting set of facts, which require to be followed very closely. The matter outlined in chapter 9 is reported and finished in the last verse. In chapter 10 we read: "I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Come in between the wheels, under the cherub, and fill the
{62}
hollow of thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. And the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, and came over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory" (@Ezekiel 10: 1 - 4).
Now, this is most interesting, for God is acting Himself, and one cherub is singled out. We have been speaking of personality, but now we have a cherub acting, but the man with the linen is also here, and he is invited in, and told to fill the hollow of his hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. Now he is *not* discriminating in favour of the persons with the mark; it is the same man that we saw earlier, but he is now engaged in a general act of judgment, which would show how we are to he usable, as God may need us. He is a man who is fit to be called in to the inner circle of things, and to be used in a general act of judgment over the city, but in doing so he is to take the coals in his hands; that is, he is a feeling man; he feels, himself, what he is doing, for the palms of one's hands would feel coals of fire. It is not like the *tongs* which are used in @Isaiah 6. The seraphim there did not feel the heat of the coal, but this man takes them in the palms of his hands; and he is a useful man, for, as we have seen, he is discriminating, and he can be used for judgment, and he feels what he is doing.
W.R. In @Luke 24 the disciples were directed to remain in the city of Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high. Similarly to what you have said, this stay in the city would tend to effect in them right feeling and judgment in view of their service.
J.T. Yes; they were to stay there until they were clothed with power from on high. Jerusalem was a
{63}
guilty city, and they were to stay in it, as if to become fully aware of the actual conditions which existed in it after the death and resurrection of Christ. But if they are to represent the Lord, an accurate knowledge of conditions is not enough; they need the clothing from on high as well. They get that in the coming down of the Spirit.
C.N. Would the two positions of this man refer to the end of the dispensation; that he *had been* marking those who were immune from the judgment; now he takes the fire and scatters it?
J.T. Yes. It would now seem as if the time has come for general application of judgment. When Stephen was put to death it would seem as if all the apostles should have left Jerusalem. "When they persecute you in this city, flee to the other" (@Matthew 10: 23), was the word, but the apostles did not leave. The saints generally did. But later there was a great number, as the elders say to Paul: "Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who have believed", @Acts 21: 20. The destruction of Jerusalem was near: are they really immune? Has the man clothed in linen marked their foreheads? Scripture somewhat reflects on this condition. It mentions no support from them for Paul in his last visit. The epistle to the Hebrews urged them to leave the camp -- had they done it? If not, as applied to that time, the scattering of the coals indiscriminately over the city would suggest that there was no provision for them. @1 Corinthians 11 points to the danger of christians who do not judge themselves, being judged with the world. If the fire is scattered by a feeling man, a man who would have discriminated if he could; if he scatters the fire indiscriminately, what does it mean? If there are those belonging to the Lord there, they are judged with the rest. If I stay in an association that is contrary to God, I am judged with it. Of course, the Lord will take all His own with Him when He comes for the assembly, but in the meantime
{64}
they are *morally* under judgment: their salvation will be so as by fire. They will be of *that class*.
Rem. They were enjoined to flee to the mountains, as Jerusalem was encompassed with armies.
J.T. Quite so; those in Judaea, and those in the midst of the city were to depart out of it.
C.H.H. "Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins", @Revelation 18: 4.
J.T. That is in keeping with the direction in @Hebrews 13: 13, to believers among the Jews, to "go forth to him without the camp".
Ques. So in receiving anyone now from christendom it is necessary to be more discriminating than was the case a hundred years ago?
J.T. Just so; conditions have greatly changed for the worse, and continue to grow worse.
A.N.W. This man of whom we read is personally the same as he was, minus the ink-horn; he still has the linen.
J.T. That would mean that the time for the ink-horn, with its corresponding discrimination, has gone. We should be concerned that we are amongst those who have been marked. We see this man with the mark, and that one; why have not I such a mark? This searching matter should be thus faced. If one has not been marked by the man clothed with linen, he will be judged with the world.
Ques. Would you say it is a serious matter for christians to be linked up with systematised religions, because of what is foretold in this scripture?
J.T. I think this chapter shows the exercise of *undiscriminating* judgment. The fire is to be cast over the city; he would not do it if it could be avoided; the judgment is felt in the palms of his own hands.
R.W.S. The Lord says later, "I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a
{65}
little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come" (@Ezekiel 11: 16). Is that where they should have been -- in the "little sanctuary"?
J.T. That is what those outside, having a remnant character, come into. They are in view throughout. In chapter 11 the sanctuary has a very distinct place. It is peculiarly interesting because of Ezekiel's lamentation; he "cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, it is thy brethren, thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, the whole of it, unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem say, Get you far from Jehovah: unto us is this land given for a possession. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Although I have removed them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. And they shall come thither, and they shall take away from thence all its detestable things and all its abominations. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God" (@Ezekiel 11: 13 - 20).
That is the position; the remnant is to come in for the full divine consideration, and all this comes out in relation to Ezekiel's concern about the death of Pelatiah. Jehovah says, "it is thy brethren", and He shows what they are coming into.
J.S. Is God establishing a new covenant with the people of Israel here?
{66}
J.T. It has that character, only it is the remnant, and it seems to be an answer to Ezekiel's wail because of Pelatiah, the prince, who died.
G.MacP. Sorrow occasioned by the governmental dealings of God would fit us to have part in these gracious provisions for the remnant.
J.T. That is right. What is said about the remnant here is, you might say, what the saints enjoy now; that God takes those on who are truly the remnant.
A.R. Perhaps like Philadelphia, do you think?
J.T. Very much like it; it is brotherly love. It is the thought of brethren: "thy brethren" is repeated in the text as if the Spirit of God is calling attention to that word.
Rem. It seems to be a private matter now -- "little sanctuary" -- and fits in with John's gospel where the Lord says, "Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day", @John 1: 39. It is in a limited way, but very precious.
J.T. Quite so; God Himself is the "little sanctuary". Think of God coming down to be that! How touching that is! And then we ought to see, before closing, that the glory leaves entirely. The description of the vision here varies somewhat from what we have earlier. Instead of an ox, there is a cherub. It is not an earthly position; it is more elevated, more the heavenly side in chapter 10. The glory is departing, but departing in that upward way. It is heavenly power and movement; we read in the end of chapter 11: "And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. And the Spirit lifted me up" (@Ezekiel 11: 22, 23). The prophet is taken off to Chaldea again; so far it is a finished matter now. The matter of chapter 9 was finished and reported; and now *this* is a finished
{67}
matter. The glory has departed, and now the prophet is among the captives and tells them all the things that Jehovah had shown him. This would include what he and they were to come in for. Thus they would be strengthened and encouraged through the prophet.
Ques. Would there be an inference in the "little sanctuary" that the glory has returned to the remnant?
J.T. Well, in the presence of God you get everything. What more could you see than what God is?
F.N.W. Would the sanctuary at Jerusalem, where the judgment began (@Ezekiel 9: 6), correspond with Sardis, "a name that thou livest, and art dead" @Revelation 3: 1; and the "little sanctuary", with "the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God" @Revelation 3: 12, in Philadelphia?
].T. Yes; it is good to link those passages with the scriptures before us. @Revelation 3: 12 contains the greatest things, and it is said to one man -- an overcomer.
J.S. Where would you say the departure of the glory is indicated in the New Testament?
J.T. Finally from Jerusalem; I suppose it would be in @Acts 7. The death of Stephen, I think, was the finish, really. Stephen saw the glory of God. He saw it above -- the heavens were opened upon him, and, the passage says, "he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God", @Acts 7: 55,56. That was the transfer from Jerusalem to heaven, and henceforth Jerusalem is in principle given up. Although the apostles went on there for a long time after Stephen's death, Jerusalem on earth was superseded by the heavenly Jerusalem.
J.S. Did Stephen in his intercession at the golden altar stay the judgment for the moment?
J.T. Well, he asked that his death should not be laid to their charge, but I think the testimony in Jerusalem was morally finished; according to the Lord's direction, the apostles should have left it. The Lord had told them that if they were persecuted in one city to flee to another; the saints generally went out,
{68}
but the apostles remained. God, of course, went on with them, but henceforth the energy of the Spirit is seen elsewhere.
J.S. I suppose you see it in principle in Peter's word: "Save yourselves from this untoward generation" @Acts 2: 40.
C.H.H. Would the fact that the throne is seen above the cherubim be to justify the throne? Judgment is to be justified in all this!
J.T. Just so; the majesty of the throne is maintained in all that happens. The actions of the cherubim are in full keeping with the glory which is seen leaving Jerusalem; it is going up. I think Stephen shows us where it went to; now it is in the assembly; it was already there from Pentecost, but still connected with Jerusalem, but now there in a peculiar way through Paul's ministry.
A.R. Would Ezekiel's return to those men in captivity be like the book of Revelation, sent by the Lord Jesus to His bondmen? I was thinking of what a time they would have going over all this with Ezekiel, for it would seem that he told them about it.
J.T. Well, if you were to ask them, they would, no doubt, speak of 'good meetings' in Chaldea as listening to Ezekiel going over these things. As a good Levite, he would not give them all at once. Spiritual ministry is "in part". The little sanctuary would imply that the remnant is on the way now to the full thought of God's purpose. What is said implies that they are to be brought back to their own land, and His law is to be written in their hearts, so that we have the great prospect of the return to the land, and the fulfilment of God's mind. But it is striking that God starts with the remnant in view of ultimate recovery and blessing in the land.
W.B-w. The truth we have today, in the epistle to the Ephesians, for instance, brings us back to the land by the Spirit, does it not?
J.T. We ought to touch it in our assembly services.
{69}
Rem. There would, no doubt, be a condition necessary among the captives for the communications made through Ezekiel.
J.T. What has been said from Jeremiah helps in this matter; that those who have gone out in the captivity are the good figs, as submitting to the government of God. This would indicate a state in them enabling them to value what Ezekiel would present to them.
C.H.H. Is the thought of God being "a little sanctuary" like the thought of the latter glory of the house being greater than the former (@Haggai 2: 9)?
J.T. Yes. If God is with us the glory is with us; it is a question of expansion. We need to make room for Him. @John 14 says that one believer who keeps Christ's word may be an abiding place for God; here God says He will be to them a "little sanctuary". That is what God can be to us. How comforting, especially for any in apparent isolation!

READINGS ON EZEKIEL (4)
@Ezekiel 12: 1 - 11; @Ezekiel 16: 1 - 8, 60 - 63; @Ezekiel 19: 10 - 14
J.T. The section to be covered this evening is quite extensive and follows the record in the end of chapter 11, that "the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city" (@Ezekiel 11: 23). It had *left* Jerusalem. These following chapters, therefore, are to be regarded in the light of that solemn fact; hence we have "captive's baggage" referred to in chapter 12. The first thing to be considered, therefore, is the condition of captivity and what goes with it -- captive's baggage -- which, in view of the facts given here, would be very poor belongings.
And then the next chapter speaks of the false prophets and prophetesses; elements which may be expected where the glory has departed. In chapter 14 the responsible element in Israel makes inquiry, and the state of things is said to be so bad that even such godly and honoured servants of God as Noah, Daniel and Job could but save themselves from such a state of things by their righteousness. Chapter 15 teaches that unless there is fruitfulness, profession is worthless -- the wood of the vine is of no value save as it bears fruit. Chapter 16 outlines the moral history of Jerusalem as in relation with Jehovah; her unfaithfulness from the outset. She is to be caused to know her abominations. The reinstatement of Jerusalem is in prospect, too; it is a chapter of great length, bringing out the faithfulness and love of God, and the solemn fact that, in return, He received nothing but rebellion and corruption. The concluding chapters of our section, chapters 17 to 19, hinge on the disclosures of chapter 16. Chapter 17 refers to the Babylonish captivity. Chapter 18 shows that sins of the fathers are not now regarded as coming upon people, but each one is liable on account of his
{71}
own conduct. Then the concluding chapter in this section (chapter 19) speaks of the dearth of rulers. The house of David has failed in rule: "so that it hath no strong rod to be a sceptre for ruling" (@Ezekiel 19: 14). Then it says, "This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation" @Ezekiel 19: 14; that is to say, right feeling as to the whole position comes in at the end of this section.
C.A.M. The glory having moved from the city would give colour to the whole section?
J.T. That is right; the glory had departed. So if we apply it to our own times, it would mean that God has left the public profession. He is no longer characteristically there. Throughout these chapters, provision is made for the remnant. In chapter 11, it says: "yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary" (@Ezekiel 11: 16). But generally, the glory has departed, and these chapters have to be read in that light.
J.S. So you would read chapters 12 to 19 into the history of christendom?
J.T. I think so. Viewed from the standpoint of the captivity, it typifies the world as captivating the profession, which has become just a phase of the world system -- the Babylonish captivity. Hence it becomes a question of whether we carry "captive's baggage"; are we captives characteristically? I am using the word "baggage" because that is how the New Translation renders it: "And thou, son of man, prepare thee a captive's baggage, and go captive by day in their sight; and thou shalt go captive from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house" (@Ezekiel 12: 3). The prophet acts the thing; he is a sign in that way. To act at all for God in a representative way, one requires to be priestly. And of course we know that Ezekiel was characterised as being such. He is introduced to us as "the priest" (@Ezekiel 1: 3), and that thought runs through the book. The word "burden" has a somewhat varied meaning. Here it would convey
{72}
the thought of "word" or prophecy. But it is something to be borne -- a weight -- and the prophet would feel it; we are told it concerned "the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them" @Ezekiel 12: 10. The prince in Jerusalem would himself go forth as a captive, as, indeed, Zedekiah did, later.
Ques. Does the taking of this captive's baggage refer to what is right, or rather to what is the outcome of the government of God?
J.T. It refers to the government of God; to the humiliating spectacle of a prince, or king, and the people of Israel going forth in this way.
Ques. You do not suggest that in separating from evil we should pursue this line?
J.T. I would not like to be found with captive's baggage. Those who have it are persons who are characteristically in captivity. Spiritual persons are not like that; they are dignified, according to chapter 11. They are said to be the brethren of the prophet, to whom God would be a sanctuary in their captivity; for while the government of God involved the captivity, and the spiritual in it would own this, yet I think that the "baggage" is an index to the spiritually sorrowful side of the position.
A.F.M. It would be very humiliating to Zedekiah to be deported with captive's baggage, deprived of eyesight, to Babylon.
J.T. Yes; to apply it today, it would be like the paraphernalia which is to be seen in the profession about us, as compared with what the saints had at Pentecost. What moral dignity attached to the early saints as in @Acts 2! They were not in captivity! It was a new order of things in deliverance from the world. The same dignity in a moral sense attaches to those at the end, having the character of a remnant.
J.S. Is this an added burden put upon them in the government of God?
{73}
J.T. Clearly; humiliation attaches to the position now, I think. If anyone is awakened to what is current abroad, he sees that the cathedrals and choirs and organs and paid ministers and other accompaniments and paraphernalia are just a mark of the world, a mark that the profession is in captivity. There is nothing of spiritual dignity about it.
A.B.P. The use made of possessions by the saints at the outset was apparently so pleasurable to God, that a lie in relation to it met with stern judgment.
J.T. Just so; and in Luke the Lord's teaching would show that if we have temporal things, we are to use them in view of the future. The world uses money in view of the present, to add to self here, whereas the "unjust steward" used what came to his hand in view of the future; the Lord using what he did to teach us to use temporal things in relation to what is eternal. Luke speaks much of money, especially after chapter 15.
Ques. Would this baggage be like the systematising of certain features of the truth, possibly to the point of naming it, such as the naming of denominations today?
J.T. Yes; such names are marks of the world.
A.R. Does the sign, which Ezekiel becomes, represent the faithfulness of God, appealing to Israel as a nation before they go into captivity?
J.T. Just so; it is a testimony to them beforehand; and nothing appeals to and affects one more, in reading the prophets, than the pains taken by Jehovah through His prophets, bringing things to bear upon the people from many different viewpoints; using so many different similes, and symbols; resorting to such a variety of things in order to get at them, so that they might judge themselves.
A.N.W. So that if they refuse to hear they are given opportunity to see. All this is to be done in their *sight*.
{74}
J.T. The verse reads, "In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, and thou shalt not see the ground: for I have appointed thee for a sign unto the house of Israel" @Ezekiel 12: 6. It is a characteristic of the captive. He is not showing himself He depicts the shame of such circumstances.
A.R. Does John's gospel fit in with Ezekiel, in that he employs signs? "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee", @John 2:11.
J.T. Quite so. It marks his ministry. The other evangelists are marked by works of power -- miracles -- but John confines himself to the word "sign" in his gospel; and then in Revelation it is the same thought -- "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it", @Revelation 1: 1. It is presented by signs and symbols by His angel through His bondman John. Signs are a feature of John's ministry.
Ques. Do you regard this sign as partly ironic and partly right? Would the captive's baggage be ironic, and the hiding, what the saints should be doing today?
J.T. The whole thing is a sign as to what would mark an ordinary captive. It says in verse 7: "And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my baggage by day, as a captive's baggage, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it upon my shoulder, in their sight. And in the morning the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou? Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them. Say, I am your sign: as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall go into exile, into captivity. And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the
{75}
dark, and shall go forth; they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby; he shall cover his face, that he see not the land with his eyes. And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans" (@Ezekiel 12: 7 - 13).
What Ezekiel did as a sign, was just what happened to Zedekiah later; a most humiliating thing for a man of such dignity. Christendom in the same sense has become captive. The Roman power captivated christianity; that is what is meant. And all this baggage -- this paraphernalia that we get today in the form of cathedrals and other things already mentioned -- would correspond to the captive's baggage. Spiritually the whole position is most humiliating and degrading.
J.S. In @Luke 10, the seventy went out as being free from every burden.
J.T. They were to carry nothing. They had no captive's baggage; they were representative of Christ. "When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything?" @Luke 22: 35. So that the more baggage we have of this kind, the more we show that we are subservient to the world. We have to comply to the world's requirements. What belonged to the people in Jerusalem is now in Babylon.
J.S. Showing that the glory has been entirely lost sight of, and hence all these accoutrements are outside.
J.T. Yes. That is the lesson in chapter 12, and then what follows would go with it. What followed upon the Romish captivity of christianity was false prophesying -- a system of man-made ministry, especially from the time of Constantine. He himself had to do with the formulation of the creed. Think of the emperor himself having to do with it! The very councils were a testimony to the captivity of the church! Think of an unbaptised man -- possibly unconverted --
{76}
a murderer really -- presiding at the christian councils! Thus in chapter 13, as I said, you have a system of false prophets and false prophetesses, too. Jezebel herself (@Revelation 2: 20), was a false prophetess.
A.R. Did the judaising teachers introduce the idea of baggage, in trying to bring the saints back to circumcision?
J.T. I think that would be the thought. Under the Roman emperors there was complete captivation of christianity; and concurrently with that, there has been introduced the system of false prophecy -- persons assuming to be prophets who are not prophets in the true sense.
J.S. Is not christendom today full of false prophets and prophetesses?
J.T. That followed historically; chapter 13 presents that feature. The conditions are seen to be so bad that there is no hope. Jehovah would have spared Sodom for ten righteous persons, bad as it was; but there is no hope for Jerusalem here. If Noah, Daniel and Job were there, they could only save themselves by their righteousness. That seems to me to be very much like conditions under Jezebel. The position is given up. There is no hope at all.
R.W.S. Why is this ministry given to the captivity here? At the last reading, we noted that Ezekiel was in Jerusalem, but now he is taken back in spirit to Chaldea, and gives this ministry there; "And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity; and the vision that I had seen went up from me. And I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shewn me" (@Ezekiel 11: 24, 25).
J.T. The captivity of Jerusalem had not yet actually occurred, so the people there were ministered to. It is a ministry to them, but calling attention to what is about to happen to the city. It is in vision, of course.
{77}
During the vision the prophet is transferred by the Spirit into Chaldea. Then the vision went up from him and he spoke of it to those of the captivity. The actual testimony of the prophet would reach all in this way.
It says, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not, which have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house" (@Ezekiel 12: 1, 2). His ministry is to the rebellious house. In chapter 14 we have: "And there came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?" @Ezekiel 14: 1 - 3. Here we are in the presence of the representatives of Israel -- the elders.
C.A.M. The matter seems to become intensely individual; the citing of these men who could only save themselves, would seem to make it a very strenuous matter, and intensely individual!
J.T. Yes; and I think that if we apply the prophetic part of this to the history of the assembly, we shall see how the captivity is followed by a system of false prophecy; by a ministry that is false, as seen in chapter 13; so we have in verse 8: "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye speak vanity, and have seen lies, therefore behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah. And my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah. Because, yea because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace! and there is no peace; and one buildeth up a wall, and lo, they daub it with untempered mortar -- say unto them
{78}
which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall; there shall be an overflowing rain, and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall burst forth. And lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed it? Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will cause to burst forth a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing rain in mine anger, and hailstones in fury for utter destruction" (@Ezekiel 13: 8 - 13).
It seems to me, as having an application to our times or to the history of the assembly, that the captivity was followed by the establishment of a false system of teaching, both in men and women. Then in chapter 14 we have a condition that is so bad that no one can influence for good or save anyone but himself by his own righteousness. But they were building; there was a building going on in connection with that system, "And lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed it?" @Ezekiel 13: 12. That, we might say, is over against the real building of the house of God by the Spirit. That sort of thing had gone on, and it is to be tested, and I have no doubt that God has brought one scourge after another in the history of christendom to bring some back to righteousness. So that the Saracens and the Mohammedans, for instance, were allowed to come in, in the public history of christianity to almost overrun christendom. God, in faithfulness, allowed that, in order to bring some to repentance, as it says in chapter 13: "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will cause to burst forth a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing rain in mine anger, and hail-stones in fury for utter destruction. And I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be destroyed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 13: 13, 14).
{79}
It seems to me that there is a remarkable analogy there to what has transpired in the public history of christianity.
Ques. Would the words, "untempered mortar", used to hold the parts together, be in contrast to the idea of tempering in @1 Corinthians 12: 24, "But God has tempered the body together"?
J.T. That is the contrast. This untempered mortar is the false thing; it is very much like the slime that was used for mortar at the building of the tower of Babel. It is the same sort of thing that goes on here. It is the whole Babylonish system that has been built up, according to the history we have, since the captivity by the Romans; there is the false system of teaching and the building attached to it, and then the terrible scourges that have followed, which are premonitory of the final judgment.
J.H.E. How faithful of God to bring the wall down, to discover that the foundations were not right!
J.T. Yes; @2 Timothy 2: 19 speaks of the firm foundation of God that stands. That is in contrast to this foundation that does not stand.
J.S. Would the untempered mortar be like the doctrines of today that cannot hold the sects together?
J.T. That is the idea; the so-called councils and the hierarchy and all that kind of thing which was designed of man to hold things together; but God brought scourge after scourge to show there is no true foundation, and presently the whole thing will be destroyed. I think it is well to see that, and then the terrible consequences which follow in chapter 14; the state of things being such that men like Noah, Daniel, or Job could only save their own souls. They could not have done so much as could have been done in Sodom in Abraham's time.
Ques. Does the plain of Ono, referred to in Nehemiah, enter into chapter 14 -- the idea of compromise?
{80}
These elders sit down and try to find out what is the mind of God.
J.T. In a certain way, for they are not judging themselves. They are, no doubt, under pressure. "And there came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me". @Ezekiel 14: 1. They are ready to listen to the prophet. "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them? Therefore speak to them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet, I Jehovah will answer him according to this, according to the multitude of his idols: that I may take the house of Israel by their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols" (@Ezekiel 14: 2 - 5).
There is no answer from God in spite of their inquiry.
It is important to see that in these chapters there is an analogy to what is current today, so that we may get practical gain out of them. We want to get gain for our souls. These scriptures refer to the history of the assembly, and chapter 14 is a condition of things that is irremediable. Even men like Noah, Daniel and Job, in such circumstances, could do nothing but save their own souls. No doubt there were saints right through the Middle Ages that did save their souls by faithfulness, but Jezebel being allowed, there was no hope. Even the Reformation did not change the position in this sense. God did much through it, making way for the remnant, but the judgment on the professing body remains.
J.S. So eventually it will end up in the Laodicean condition which the Lord will spue out of His mouth.
A.R. @Revelation 18 says Babylon has fallen, and God appeals to the saints: "Come out of her, my people" @Revelation 18: 4.
{81}
I suppose this would be an invitation to leave the thing, would it not?
J.T. Yes. There were those that saved themselves, morally, at least, right through from the very outset of the captivity, through their righteousness; that is what counted. The ecclesiastical system was hopelessly involved. This section contemplates the glory having departed from Jerusalem; the state of things that ensued is in mind. But in our times it is what has come down in the history of the assembly. The condition has become hopeless. And then in chapter 15 we have stated the uselessness of the wood of the vine. What is a merely nominal christian more than a Mohammedan or a Hindu? He is not a bit better. Mere nominal christianity has no value in itself. The wood of the vine is of no value unless it bears fruit. Nominal christianity in itself has become a worldly religion on the same level as Mohammedanism. What really differs is the new man, and that is connected with another order of things; it is a new creation.
G.MacP. Is this what the apostle had in his mind when he said: "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2:19? The system itself was under judgment.
J.T. Quite so.
R.W.S. The end of all this is given in verse 4 of chapter 15: "Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel: the fire consumeth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned" @Ezekiel 15: 4.
J.T. That is very striking. The question of humanity comes out in the history of the assembly. The so-called ministers, the priests and nuns and the like take up a religious attitude. But what is the humanity underlying it? Is it the natural man or the new man? Jude says of them, "These are they who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit" (@Jude 19). What is taught in the chapter before us is, that unless there is real fruit for God the profession of christianity is
{82}
of no value at all, any more than Mohammedanism, for instance.
J.S. Except that they are much more responsible.
J.T. Exactly; but as regards the wood, what is it? "Son of man, what is the wood of the vine more than any wood, the vine-branch, which is among the trees of the forest? Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel" (@Ezekiel 15: 2 - 4). It is a very striking figure.
Ques. The beast and the false prophet, who represent the heading up of this system, are cast into the lake of fire. Is that the final public judgment?
J.T. That is very striking. That gives particular force to the meaning of the fire, undoubtedly. That sort of humanity has not been helped by christianity.
W.R. Does Simeon take on the character of the new man in the second chapter of Luke's gospel? He holds the Babe in his arms.
J.T. That is the thought exactly. The new man is the only hope now. And God has graciously brought that in, as seen in the epistles to the Colossians and the Ephesians.
Rem. Christendom expects special favours from God; whereas, these and other scriptures show that God is against it.
J.T. Exactly; Israel had the place of the vine, but there was nothing there for God; it is judged and burned. Now christendom has taken that place according to Romans, but it is only fit for the fire. There is no fruit and the wood is of no use. You cannot make anything out of the wood of the vine. It is only of value as bearing fruit (compare @John 15).
A.R. Perhaps the contrast to what you are saying is seen in Aaron's rod as laid up before Jehovah; it budded and blossomed and ripened almonds in contrast to the other eleven rods.
{83}
J.T. It was the only rod of real value in that sense, that is, as representing true priesthood.
Chapter 16 is the history of Jerusalem from the outset; it goes back to the beginning -- what Jehovah had been to her. As applied to ourselves, it is what God was to the assembly in the early days; and, alas! what the result has been; which corresponds to what we have been saying. It is the practical, or responsible, history of christendom. There was nothing but corruption, utter faithlessness on the part of her who was so highly favoured and cared for and ornamented by God. So that she corresponds with what we have just said, that is, the wood of the fruitless vine, as compared with Sodom and Samaria. She is just on the same level. At one time, she would not take their names into her mouth in pride; but now God says, You are just on that level. Sodom and Samaria are looked at as her sisters. It is the profession as corrupt, viewed in this light. The marital relation with God must be abandoned. She is utterly unfaithful. That is what chapter 16 means, but with the beautiful promise at the end that she is to be restored on the principle of the covenant. "Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be confounded, when thou shalt receive thy sisters who are older than thou, together with those who are younger than thou; for I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by virtue of thy covenant. And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; that thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I forgive thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 16: 60 - 63).
I think it is a beautiful ending of a long chapter, beginning with what the assembly was in its brightest days. I suppose the ministry of the twelve would refer
{84}
to Israel as a whole, but this is Jerusalem. It is not simply the church of Pentecost; but Paul's church, I think, would be the analogy in christianity. How beautifully ornamented she was, when God took her up and made a covenant with her! It was a time of love and He covenanted with her, and said, "and thou becamest mine" @Ezekiel 16: 8. It seems to bring out the place the Lord's supper has in the history of the assembly as seen in Paul's ministry; the *public* result, on the other hand, is dreadful unfaithfulness, so that she is compared with Sodom and Samaria.
A.B.P. Would this beginning, then, be the assembly as seen in Antioch?
J.T. I think that is the way we may look at it. It not Israel brought out of Egypt; it is Jerusalem -- the most delightful and ornamental side of the position -- and what God effected there.
J.S. The epistle to Ephesians would give us the heavenly ornamentation.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. That is why I think it is Jerusalem here in contrast to the idea of Israel. The elders of *Israel* came to the prophet in the beginning of chapter 14, but this is Jerusalem; that is, it is the brightest and best side of Israel's history. Applied to the present time, God wrought in love, beautifying the assembly wonderfully, but this is the public result down here.
Rem. God had already spoken through the prophet to Israel in chapter 12, and then to the prophets, and then to the prophetesses, and then to the elders of Israel, and now to Jerusalem.
J.T. It is the best side of the position, the brightest and best side of the assembly's position that is in mind in this chapter. Paul brought out in his ministry, in a peculiar way, the love that was lavished upon her.
Ques. Is this covenant made with the remnant at the end?
{85}
J.T. That is the way it is stated. First it says, "I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant" (@Ezekiel 16: 60). It seems to me that it applies, typically, to Paul's ministry in relation to the Lord's supper; how the ministry comes into that. It is not so much a question of the new covenant or of the old one that was given at Sinai, but rather the idea of a covenant that God made with the saints; how His love is brought to the attention of the saints through Paul's ministry, and then we see the public consequences of unfaithfulness in the whole chapter, and at the end the promise of recovery. This promise is very applicable in our own times.
Ques. Would we get the force of that in @1 Corinthians 11? There seems to have been a falling off in regard to the Supper; whereas the apostle says he received it from the Lord, emphasising the freshness of the Lord's love.
J.T. Quite so; the Supper was celebrated from the outset, but it was not seen in relation to the assembly. The idea of the covenant was not stressed in the ministry of the twelve; it is developed in Paul's ministry.
Ques. Would not the whole chapter help us to be very humble as to the conditions that have prevailed since Paul went off the scene?
J.T. I think that is the lesson; that we might see what has been expended on the assembly, particularly in Paul's ministry. We are apt to regard this as referring to the beginning of Israel's history, but it is *Jerusalem* that is in mind; typically the brightest and best in the history of the assembly, which would involve the full disclosure of the truth through Paul.
A.N.W. Would you say a word about the name Lord Jehovah, in which He repeatedly presents Himself in these chapters? What is the significance of the title?
J.T. It is *Adonai*. It is a name of God; authority expressed alongside the covenant name. @2 Corinthians 3
{86}
carries the thought, perhaps as concretely as any passage we can get. There the authority of the Lord is allied with the ministry.
A.R. Does the end of the chapter suggest that God remains true to Himself in spite of the unfaithfulness of the church? He says, "Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee" @Ezekiel 16: 60.
J.T. That shows His faithfulness; "and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant"; meaning that it goes through. That is very comforting! We are now on the ground of the covenant that carries us through all time.
W.R. Would you say that many who fell out in the early days of the recovery, one hundred years ago or so, were not prepared to take on the covenant?
J.T. That is true. God is faithful on His side, and He has established a covenant; not only for time, but an everlasting one. He will carry us through on the best terms. It is a very comforting thought.
R.W.S. Would the word "youth" being mentioned here suggest how short-lived assembly fidelity was, even in the apostle's day? He saw the deflection coming in.
J.T. The greatest and very best assembly -- the greatest result of his work -- was Ephesus. It was with Ephesus the Lord began when He says in Revelation, "I have against thee that thou hast left thy first love" @Revelation 2: 4, showing how short-lived the result was. For Paul says, all they that are in Asia have turned away from me. The love of union -- the real personal affection of the assembly thus viewed -- lapsed very early.
Ques. The breaking of bread was neglected for many centuries, was it not?
J.T. Exactly. The state for it was not there. In stressing the lordship of Christ in the epistles to Corinth, Paul was seeking to promote and maintain assembly conditions suitable for the Supper. He also stressed fellowship and the faithfulness of God. "God is faithful,
{87}
by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", @1 Corinthians 1: 9. That thought runs through the two epistles. So the assembly under Paul had an excellent start. It could not have had a better, but how quickly it lapsed, not only in Corinth, but in Ephesus! It would seem that almost as soon as he left Ephesus, the personal touch was lost! "All who are in Asia ... have turned away from me". @2 Timothy 1: 15.
A.F.M. This passage (verses 60 - 63) must involve that great depths are reached in repentance to enable Jehovah to make overtures to them in regard of the covenant.
J.T. He is asserting His own faithfulness to His covenant. And then He will make an everlasting one which will carry us right through. *God is faithful*; that is how 1 Corinthians begins. God is true to His own engagements, but then He goes beyond that and says, I will make an everlasting covenant with you.
A.R. Would the knowledge of the everlasting covenant help us to depend on God as long as the assembly is here on earth, knowing that He will be true to His promise?
J.T. That is the one side of the position; He is *faithful*. But He goes on to an *everlasting* covenant.
A.B.P. Do the last two verses of chapter 16 suggest the proper attitude of the saints, considering the public breakdown, so that we should go on in shamefacedness and humility?
J.T. "And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; that thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I forgive thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 16: 62, 63). It seems to bring home to us the idea of humiliation in the light of past history. After all, whatever we are or have, God has effected it. And He is going beyond that to an everlasting covenant, which, as I said, is very assuring -- that He will take us right through.
{88}
Rem. And especially in view of the fact that the sin committed was worse than Sodom and Samaria. It is a most remarkable thing.
J.T. Jerusalem's sin was not worse than the history of the assembly; "the depths of Satan" @Revelation 2: 24. There is really no worse conduct than that of the public assembly.
Rem. Mr. Darby has a reference to @Deuteronomy 21, where the elders of the city prayed for forgiveness on the ground of sacrifice.
J.T. Yes. There is a note on the word "forgive", or "make atonement for", as in @Deuteronomy 21: 8. All is therefore on the most solid basis for Jerusalem.
And then, after this great ministry of chapter 16 which we have sought to apply, carrying it down to our own times, to an everlasting covenant, chapter 17 brings in a "riddle" and the allusion is to Babylon: "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings, long-pinioned, full of feathers, which was of divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar. He cropped off the top of its young shoots, and carried it into a merchant's land; he set it in a city of traders. And he took of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, he set it as a willow tree. And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, so that its branches should turn toward him, and the roots thereof be under him; and it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. And there was another great eagle with great wings and many feathers; and behold, from the beds of her plantation, this vine did bend her roots unto him and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it. It was planted in a good field by many waters, that it might bring forth branches and bear fruit, that it might be a noble vine. Say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall he not
{89}
pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither? All its fresh sprouting leaves shall wither, even without a great arm and many people to pluck it up by its roots. And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew" (@Ezekiel 17: 1 - 10).
And then we are told the king of Babylon and Pharaoh are in mind; that is, these great powers look at Israel from *their* point of view, to see what they can make out of it for themselves; showing that the powers of this world would endeavour to reap from whatever there is of God. We must not overlook that.
And then we have in chapter 18, "What mean ye, ye who use this proverb of the land of Israel, saying, The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have any more to use this proverb in Israel. Behold, all the souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die" (@Ezekiel 18: 2 - 4).
Now we come to a point where everyone is responsible. Let us not be talking of inherited sin or inherited judgment! Whatever happens to me is because of what I am, so that I have to see to myself. That seems to be the lesson of chapter 18; not to bend towards Babylon or Egypt, but to see to myself as responsible individually before God.
Ques. Is there a link between chapters 17 and 18?
J.T. I think so. "All the souls are mine", God says. At the present time certain governments of the world are making a great deal of their subjects. They are making their subjects mere pawns for their own use, but God says, They are all mine; every one is mine, and the soul that sinneth it shall die. The thing for us is to be in right relations with God in the midst of all these things.
Ques. Do you connect chapter 17 with Zedekiah in chapter 12 -- the carrying away of the baggage?
{90}
J.T. Yes. Zedekiah is the one in mind, but we are bringing the teaching down to ourselves; and in chapter 17, after the wonderful ministry of chapter 16 looking to recovery in an everlasting covenant, we have the great powers of the world endeavouring to have this vine look toward them, to contribute to their greatness. It was for God, but they want to make it yield something for themselves. That seems to be the lesson of chapter 17.
J.S. Is it commercialism?
J.T. Exactly; each of these great monarchs makes as much as he can out of this vine.
A.B.P. Does not John, in chapter 9 of his gospel, in indicating the recovery of the truth of sonship, suggest that the disciples were hindered by this thought of the sins of the fathers being visited on the children? The disciples asked, "who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?" (@John 9: 2).
J.T. Quite so; that is the point raised here. "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him" (@John 9: 3). The Lord selected this man for a purpose. I must recognise God's claims. "All the souls are mine", God says @Ezekiel 18: 4.
A.B.P. Does not the teaching of @John 9 apply practically to the present day?
J.T. Yes; the man in that chapter is an example. He stands up by himself. He has not a bit of support from anyone, not even from his parents. That is the man, as cast out, that the Lord takes up. He represents the only man that will stand.
E.E.H. Is that Timothy's line: "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", @2 Timothy 2:19?
J.T. Yes. @John 9 is a very concrete example of one who stands in the presence of opposition, excommunicated. No one supported him at all, not even his parents, but the Lord took him up.
Ques. Job, Ezekiel and Jeremiah would be in good company with that man in @John 9, would they not?
{91}
J.T. Just so. A man in whom the works of God are manifested. The works of God manifested in one person!
J.S. He finishes up as a worshipper!
Ques. Would the chapter we are considering show that christians should avoid all appearance of being national?
J.T. It is a question here of God's rights. "All the souls are mine", and "the soul that sinneth, it shall die" @Ezekiel 18: 4. Individual responsibility to God is stressed.
C.A.M. It is remarkable that @John 9 goes back to the very beginning: "One thing I know, that, being blind before, now I see" (@John 9: 25). It is really like the "new man", is it not?
J.T. All that he says shows that he is, in principle, a new man. He is *so* different!
Ques. Do you think there might be a prophetic view in Paul in relation to "the powers that be", in that Felix wanted him to lean towards him, whereas Paul refused? In desiring a bribe, he wanted Paul's branches, as it were, to lean towards him.
J.T. I have no doubt that the Roman emperor Constantine wanted the assembly to lean towards him. Instead of destroying the christians, he evidently decided that he could use them.
Rem. Do you get the same idea with Micah in @Judges 17? Micah said, "Now I know that Jehovah will do me good, because I have the Levite for priest" @Judges 17:13.
J.T. Yes; he had a Levite as priest in his house to serve his idolatrous system, and assumed, on that account, that Jehovah would do him good.
Rem. Referring again to Felix: he says, "I will send for thee; hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul", @Acts 24: 25, 26.
J.T. He intended to make something out of the matter. It is an apt incident to apply here, for he represents the powers that be as making something out of the people of God.
{92}
A.N.W. Pharaoh, too, used God's people for his own ends, and God claimed them from him, saying, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" @Exodus 4: 23.
R.W.S. What is this "lamentation" in @Ezekiel 19: 14?
J.T. The teaching in the parable, or simile, is "for the princes of Israel". The chapter begins and ends with it. There is no ruler of the house of David (verse 14). The want of a ruler and of true rule among the people of God is great today. Of course, Christ is the true Ruler, but He has been displaced, and the public body is wanting of true rule. The Pope might say he is the ruler, but he is not. The whole position as regards rule is withered up, so it says at the end of the chapter, "And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground; and a fire is gone out of a rod of its branches, which hath devoured its fruit; so that it hath no strong rod to be a sceptre for ruling" (@Ezekiel 19: 13, 14).
J.S. They have lost all sense of connection with heaven.
J.T. I think that is it. Christ is displaced. It is a wilderness position. Babylon is seen as a wilderness. There are no springs there to produce anything for God; that is the position.
A.R. Like Daniel's vision; the toes were mixed with iron and clay.
J.T. That is what the idea of rule has come to. Outwardly there is none to bear rule in the house of God.
Ques. Who are the lioness and the two whelps?
J.T. They would represent Israel and such as the princes that had arisen in Israel. There had been Zedekiah and his like, but there are none now. The chapter finishes with that; there is no branch, no rod, to be a sceptre for rule. And the word for this is "lamentation". It is the lamentation with which the chapter began, concerning the princes, but in verse 14 it says, "This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation" @Ezekiel 19: 14. There is nothing to follow it in the public sense. We
{93}
may thank God for anyone who laments. That is a saving element, I believe.
W.F.K. Should we lament the position of the assembly today?
J.T. I think that is the idea. God furnishes the lamentation for us and we should take it up.
W.F.K. It has moved away from the lordship of Christ.
J.T. That is right. You feel there is no one to rule for God. Every true christian feels it.
N.P. Do we get a similar thought in Judges? "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes" (@Judges 21: 25).
J.T. Exactly. Here the "lioness" refers to Israel, and she produced rulers, but now she is failing to do so. The whole position in this sense is withered up.
R.W.S. The Lord lamented, weeping over Jerusalem.
J.T. The principle of lamenting is important in the history of the testimony. It is strikingly seen in relation to Josiah. There was more lamentation for him than for any of the other kings. This chapter alludes to his posterity. The line died out. Zedekiah was the last, and there was nothing there for God. Of course this does not interfere with @Matthew 1, where the royal line is seen as having come down and is established in Christ.
A.B.P. Is there some significance in the lamentation being introduced in the early part of Matthew, the kingly gospel? It says, "great lamentation: Rachel weeping" (@Matthew 2:18).
J.T. I am sure there is. The link with Rachel, mother of the son of his father's right hand, is striking. This chapter is the end of the section which has been before us and it ends with a lamentation. We shall get other features as we go on. We should never tire of keeping the truth in a variety of phases before us so that we might be affected by it.
{94}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (5)
@Ezekiel 20:1 - 9, 33 - 44; @Ezekiel 24:15 - 27
J.T. It is thought that we should at this time cover the section from chapters 20 to 24. There is a correspondence between chapters 16 and 20, a noteworthy distinction, however, being that chapter 16 deals with *Jerusalem*, enlarging upon the divine service in taking her up, beautifying her, and entering into marriage relation with her, and then stresses in great detail her unfaithfulness; whereas in chapter 20 it is the *nation*, taken up from Egypt, to stress its history from the side of the incorrigibleness of the flesh. The chapter takes up the history in sections: they began to sin in Egypt -- even before they entered the wilderness they sinned; and then as in the wilderness they sinned (the wilderness period being enlarged upon), and then they sinned as in the land; as much as to say that the flesh is incorrigible under all circumstances. It becomes a most important chapter in the book from that point of view.
Another thing which we should bear in mind in a practical way, is that this chapter calls upon Ezekiel to judge, as does also chapter 22. Verse 3 of chapter 20 says, "Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel", and then in verse 4, "Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man?" @Ezekiel 20: 3,4. Also in verse 2 of chapter 22: "And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?" @Ezekiel 22: 2. It seems as though these verses are a call to us now to have a judgment as to the whole professing position. God has judged it, but is there any one in accord with His mind? "Wilt thou judge them?" It would seem as if God, as acting judicially, brings His people, however few, into accord with His mind. We read in @Revelation 18: 20, "for God has judged your judgment upon her".
In chapter 21 we have Nebuchadnezzar as an instrument of judgment; he is relentless! In chapter 22 we have
{95}
the judgment of what was in the city; right through the chapter we find the expression "in thee". It is a matter of what was done *in* the city; not simply what the city did, but what was done *in* it. And then chapter 23 treats of Oholah and Oholibah, and corresponds to Jezebel; that is, it is the analogy of two corrupt women, daughters of one mother. It is the utter unfaithfulness of Israel, viewed now in its divided position in the two kingdoms, and *both* utterly and equally unfaithful to God in their moral relationship. Then finally, in chapter 24, the word as to the destruction of the temple in the city, the desire of their eyes as symbolised in Ezekiel's wife. It prefigures the sorrow which would come upon them with the destruction of the system which was the desire of the eyes of the godly; it was an adornment in the eyes of Israel, and what sorrow it would be to them to have it destroyed. The disciples said, "Teacher, see what stones and what buildings!" @Mark 13: 1. They called the Lord's attention to the temple. It had a great place in their eyes, but all should be destroyed.
C.A.M. Chapter 16 refers to a son of origin, does it not? It is somewhat similar to the word, "Behold, in iniquity was I brought forth, and in sin did my mother conceive me", @Psalm 51: 5. And the chapters which follow give the workings of the flesh in every place?
J.T. Yes. The history of the people, from the standpoint of their inherent guilt, showed itself in every circumstance, even in Egypt. Chapter 20 says, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God, in that day I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the ornament of all
{96}
lands; and I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt ... But they rebelled against me ... neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt" (@Ezekiel 20: 5 - 8). That is a most striking thing. Before the law is given, by which is the knowledge of sin, while they were still in Egypt, they sinned idolatrously.
J.S. Is this said so that we might learn what is set forth in the New Testament -- "flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom", (@1 Corinthians 15: 50)?
J.T. That is the thought. It is enlarged on in Romans and other portions of the New Testament, as, for instance, "by law is knowledge of sin", @Romans 3: 20. The law peculiarly brought out what was there, but this is more extended than that. It is the full picture, even before the law was given; before they were actually taken out of Egypt, they were sinning -- committing idolatry and rebelling.
Ques. Do divine Persons, in Their service in the gospel, teach us very early the thought of having a judgment according to God?
J.T. That is the thought in this section; to draw us into accord with the mind of God about sin, and what the flesh is under all circumstances. It seems to underlie Israel being taken up by God, to portray this whole question palpably before the eyes of the universe; that race has been taken up for this purpose; and that, I believe, accounts for the extraordinariness of their character, how they obtained that character, and how they continue in it to the very end, returning now unchanged to the land. But then, it is that everyone might look into his own heart and realise that is just what we all are after the flesh. It is incorrigible.
A.F.M. It would serve as a standard of what we are as lawless.
J.T. Yes. That comes out in the chapter. What they were manifested itself in Egypt before the law was given. God said, "Then I thought to pour out
{97}
my fury upon them, so as to accomplish mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt" (@Ezekiel 20: 8). He actually thought of doing it there before He brought them out, but He says, "But I wrought for my name's sake". That is the delivering side, upon which to rest; that God acts from His own point of view and defers judgment. "But I wrought for my name's sake, that it" (His name) "should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I had made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt" @Ezekiel 20: 9.
Ques. Would you also say that there is a suggestion here as to those to whom the gospel should be preached?
J.T. How you present the truth is a question of levitical skill. This teaching would help in understanding the working of sin in man. Of course, from the beginning the devil sinned, and he injected it into man; but this chapter shows how it works in man, so that, in preaching the gospel, we are to know what truth to present, and how far to go. It is levitical education in understanding, and is most important, for the preacher should have a true understanding of the working of sin in man. So this very long chapter is peculiarly intended to provide a full-sized picture of the working of sin in man in varied circumstances in which God was with him.
So, as we said, in Egypt Israel sinned; and then, verse 10: "And I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. And I gave them my statutes, and made known unto them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them. And I also gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that hallow them. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness". That is the next stage -- "they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them" (@Ezekiel 20: 10 - 13). They rebelled
{98}
against Him in the wilderness; that is, in the presence of the laws and the statutes He had given them.
Then again, "And I also lifted up my band unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the ornament of all lands; because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. But mine eye spared them so as not to destroy them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness" (@Ezekiel 20: 15 - 17).
Then we have a second point as to the wilderness in that the children who are later brought into the land are appealed to. "And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk not in the statutes of your fathers" (@Ezekiel 20: 18). But then it goes on to say: "I lifted up my hand also unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; because they performed not mine ordinances, and rejected my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers¬ idols. And I also gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live" (@Ezekiel 20: 23 - 25). That is, God dealt with them in a judicial way also in the wilderness.
Then it goes on to say, "When I had brought them into the land which I had lifted up my hand to give unto them, then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; and there they placed their sweet savour, and there poured out their drink-offerings. And I said unto them, What is the high place whither ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day" (@Ezekiel 20: 28, 29). So that they are tested in Egypt, in the wilderness, and then their children are tested in the wilderness, and now in the land, and it is all with the same result. It is a remarkable picture of the working of sin in man
{99}
as placed in favourable circumstances; not left to himself as among the heathen, but cultured, and in every way cared for by God Himself.
J.S. The law was given in the wilderness that sin might appear exceedingly sinful; in that way it was designed to help them.
J.T. Quite so; the sin was there in Egypt; then the law made it exceedingly sinful, and yet it went on.
R.W.S. Is this like Stephen's summary? He spoke of Egypt and enlarged upon the wilderness, speaking of what happened during the forty years.
J.T. Yes: Stephen's address is parallel with this. It was an indictment; an arraignment of Israel; but I think there is a wider thought here; it is Israel taken up by God, given all these advantages, and yet this is the result.
A.R. Perhaps like @Romans 3, would you say? "That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God", @Romans 3:19.
J.T. That is the idea; so that, like Ezekiel, we are to have a judgment about it, and, of course, if we are to have a judgment about the whole world, we must begin with ourselves. What need I expect from myself? This is what I am; for I am capable of doing this very thing of which God is here presenting a full-sized picture.
W.F.K. What would you say about the inquiry of the elders in verse 3? Must they have a proper state to inquire of Jehovah?
J.T. He would not be inquired of by them on account of the things with which they were going on. We perhaps make a good deal out of what the world may do in a crisis, when war is imminent, or famine, or sickness, or the like; men turn to God and pray in the churches, but of how much value is it to God? He will not be inquired of by these elders on account of their evil history.
{100}
W.B-w. Is sin concentrated in Jerusalem in chapter 16, whereas it is more extended and universal in this chapter?
J.T. Yes; it is more extended. I think we noted at our last meeting that Jerusalem there, as applied to our own times, is typical of the assembly viewed under Paul's ministry. This is man as seen in Israel's history. The son of man is called upon to judge the whole nation in view of its history. Jeremiah gives the other side; there was something there for God, but that side is ignored here. John's ministry, viewing things abstractly, whether on the side of evil or on the side of good, helps here. This is, abstractly, Israel's sinful history. Jeremiah quotes Jehovah saying, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown. Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the firstfruits of his increase", @Jeremiah 2: 2,3. That is the other side, because God had worked in some of them and, in grace, was regarding the nation favourably on account of them. This is an abstract picture of the flesh working in them.
W.B-w. A total exposure of what the flesh is in man!
J.T. That is right. It is not a mere academic presentation of the thing; it is portrayed in the history of man covering hundreds of years, and it is before our eyes today, in this race, in this city; but then it is not in them only; it is a picture of all of us. God has taken them up to show us the thing in a most palpable way.
Rem. The flesh in us before we are converted is the same as that which comes out at times when we are in the assembly with the brethren. The flesh is unchanging in its character.
J.T. Quite so; it is the same; it is incorrigible.
J.S. John's ministry goes back to sin in its very introduction -- "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in
{101}
the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up", @John 3:14.
J.T. That is a good point to bring up, because it goes right back to the origin, "for from the beginning the devil sins" (@1 John 3: 8); and so it is the serpent that is lifted up. It is to show the origin of sin; but it is the *working of it in man* that is in mind.
J.S. So the working of sin in man necessitates the incoming of the Son of man; He is in relation to man.
J.T. That is right; so that we should have a judgment about it.
W.B-w. Why is the history traced back in chapter 16 to the Amorite -- "Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite" (@Ezekiel 16: 45)?
J.T. Chapter 16 has the same theme as chapter 20, but with a nearer view; it is Jerusalem, which is not so extensive a history as that of Israel, but it is an extraordinary thing that, in spite of the reigns of David and Solomon, the real state of things was Amoritish; that the father was an Amorite -- of the cursed race. So that the Jewish history is really a tentative state of things to bring out what the flesh is and how patient God is.
J.T.Jr. Does @Romans 8:3 apply here: "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh"?
J.T. Exactly; the whole thing is portrayed. God was waiting for this portrayal, to bring out its condemnation *sacrificially* in Christ. It is sin *in the flesh*; that is its character; that is its name in the universe before God. So that it goes on to say, "in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" (@Romans 8: 4).
Ques. Do the teachings of John and of Paul coalesce in this matter of which you have been speaking?
{102}
J.T. Quite so; John gives an abstract view of it. From the beginning, he says, the devil sins; and then, "We know that every one begotten of God does not sin", @1 John 5:18. Those begotten of God are wholly cleared of it, viewed abstractly. But regarded in his actual, or mixed, condition down here the believer has sin, for @1 John 1: 8 says, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us".
A.B.P. Jehovah indicates that He was prepared to commit Himself to anything that was of Himself amongst them.
J.T. Yes. Of course we know from Jeremiah's view that there were those who obeyed, as Moses and many others, and God was with them, so that we have to take this as it is. As already said, it is an abstract view in the sense that the work of God is not before us, but rather the working of the flesh, to portray it and make it palpable before our eyes.
Ques. Would the judicial attitude of God as seen in @Psalm 22 show the rigid position that we should maintain in regard to the flesh?
J.T. Quite so; God forsook Christ as taking our place on the cross.
Rem. God turned His face away from Jesus judicially, and we too should have the same attitude of mind towards what is not of God.
J.T. God is seeking now to bring us to a judgment of the guilt of the world -- the religious world particularly -- so that this question, "wilt thou judge, son of man?" (@Ezekiel 20: 4) was perfectly answered to in Christ on the cross. He did judge them; He had a perfect judgment of the whole matter and entered into death to deal with it sacrificially. But now as we are in the midst of evil conditions, God is asking us to judge them today. As we judge this whole matter God will deal powerfully against it. That is what I think we ought to look for.
J.T.Jr. There was no power in the beginning to cast away the abominations. "Cast ye away every man
{103}
the abominations of his eyes" (@Ezekiel 20: 7). There is no power in the flesh to cast evil away. Must we not learn that power lies in the Spirit, as in @Romans 8?
J.T. Yes; "but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live", @Romans 8:13. One important point is, to have a judgment of sin. With holy fear we should think of the Lord in the perfect judgment He had of everything as in the garden of Gethsemane: He had a true judgment always, of course, but it came out there, and He took it up sacrificially. "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world", @John 1: 29. He took it up sacrificially, but He took it up *as judging it*; as having a thorough judgment of the whole matter.
Ques. Would the three epistles, Romans, Corinthians and Ephesians, fit in with these three sections -- Egypt, the wilderness, and Canaan? Whatever be the point reached by the people of God, sin may show itself; but the root of it is the same flesh.
J.T. Yes; it showed itself thus in the history of the assembly, and now it permeates the whole professing body, and the word is, "Wilt thou judge, son of man?" @Ezekiel 20: 4. The Lord is calling upon us to judge it (first in our own hearts, surely), and to see the moral reason for the forsaking of Calvary. God forsook the Lord Jesus when on the cross as dealing with the whole matter; but it is important to see that Christ had a judgment about it on the cross, equal to God's judgment, when He forsook Him.
A.B.P. To what extent did He enter into the feeling of what sin was, when in Gethsemane?
J.T. He felt and measured accurately what was there. Of course, He always maintained a judgment of sin; all His teaching involved that -- what the flesh was. The flesh is judged in His teaching, but you can understand how He felt it peculiarly as about to bear it away sacrificially in His own body on the tree.
{104}
A.F.M. The experience was summed up in the apostle's word in @Romans 8: 3: "God ... condemned sin in the flesh".
J.T. Quite so; "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin" (it is *flesh of sin*), "and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh" @Romans 8: 3; that is, He condemned it in the flesh of Christ on the cross. Christ became a sacrifice. He was made sin. It is an awful thought, but how we need to take into our souls what the Lord entered into. He was made sin sacrificially.
C.A.M. Would you say that this question of sin having been brought into manhood, shows where God had in mind to deal with it? When He speaks to the prophet, He says, "Son of man". Do you think that indicates that in God's mind there was One who was about to come as Son, who would solve this great question?
J.T. Exactly; it was in God's mind that it should be solved morally in man; not in a moral sense in Satan; for though the serpent is lifted up, the moral process was not in Satan; the moral process was in Man. It is sin in the flesh, according to @Romans 8, that is dealt with; not sin in Satan. He will be consigned to eternal fire, but the moral process is not in him. Christ became a Man, and in Him the question of sin is thoroughly solved on the cross. @Romans 7 and @Romans 8 also show how it is solved in believers.
Ques. You begin to see, in the thief on the cross, the moral process in an ordinary man; and in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, where sin occurring in the assembly is dealt with, all is in keeping with @Romans 3, @Psalm 22 and @Revelation 20:10. They all connect, do they not?
J.T. Quite so; the thief on the cross is an excellent example. He says, "*we* indeed justly", @Luke 23: 41. He had a true judgment of the matter. It is a judicial thought. He judged the other man as well as himself.
{105}
Rem. There is no *moral* issue with angels that have sinned. They are *reserved* for punishment.
J.T. No; there is no moral process with them at all. Their matter is settled. God has dealt with the question of sin in the flesh; it is in man.
A.B.P. Was this history, and the appraisement of what sin was, *gone into* by the Lord in Gethsemane, or was it more in the general thought of death and forsaking?
J.T. The Lord would have it in His mind. That was written long before, but then, it was written for *us*. The Lord would have this all in His mind, however, in Gethsemane; the thought of sin in the abstract way in the flesh. It is sin in the flesh under the best circumstances here, that is, in Israel, under the care of God.
A.B.P. Would it be right, in referring to the cross, to say that, although it was entered into sacrificially there, it had been fully appraised before?
J.T. That is important. The Lord had a perfect judgment of it before He took it on at the cross; in the state of His mind on the cross, there was a perfect judgment of the sin for which He was suffering.
J.S. Was it the pressure of death that was on His spirit in Gethsemane? Death, as far as we are concerned, is a penalty, but He, as laying down His life sacrificially, would feel it more keenly than any other man could.
J.T. He had a full estimate of what sin was in its enormity in the eye of God and the penalty it deserved, and that is what He felt and expressed: "Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: -- but then, not my will, but thine be done", @Luke 22: 42.
J.S. There was a pressure peculiar to Gethsemane?
J.T. Yes. Satan came there, too, which should be borne in mind. "For the ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing", @John 14: 30. There was nothing in Christ for Satan, but still he came to press the thought of death on Him. He attacked Jesus in the wilderness at the beginning of His ministry; but at the end, he
{106}
came back to press the awfulness of death upon Him, to divert Him, if possible, from the will of God. Think of the terribleness of that! He went through it, notwithstanding.
A.R. In having a judgment of sin, it is not only judging evil in the world, but judging what is in myself constitutionally. Is that right?
J.T. Yes; we are called upon to have a judgment of the thing. I think that is the word for us tonight -- "wilt thou judge, son of man?" (@Ezekiel 20: 4) as if Ezekiel was not thoroughly in the mind of God in relation to what he was condemning in his ministry. God has taken up the Jewish nation in this remarkable way to show to the whole universe what sin in the flesh is.
Rem. It should also help us in the view we take of our children. We may think that they do not need certain exercises because they have not been in the world, but the flesh in them is the same as in others.
J.T. "The flesh profits nothing" (@John 6: 63) is a mild statement. "Flesh of sin" is the full judgment of it, and the Lord Himself (one would touch it reverently) was made sin: "him who knew not sin he has made sin for us", @2 Corinthians 5: 21.
A.R. Would you say what the flesh is as we are viewing it?
J.T. It is man's condition, but sin, having come into his constitution, has given character to it, hence "the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be" @Romans 8: 7. So that the process in @Romans 7 brings out, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell", @Romans 7: 18. The mind of the flesh is death, we are also told. The instruction of Scripture throughout leads to this judgment.
Ques. Will you tell us the difference between what is natural and the flesh?
J.T. Well, sometimes they run together, but @Romans 7 is the lesson for us all, as to how we reach
{107}
this chapter in our own experience. We may reach it mentally or doctrinally, as here tonight, but to reach it in our own experience requires the process, or analysis of @Romans 7. Through it we reach the judgment that "in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell" @Romans 7: 18. We need to *learn* that. There are very few of us who will admit, in a practical sense, that no good dwells in us.
A.R. It means its abandonment, does it not?
J.T. It does -- a total non-recognition of the flesh. It is imperative, and it can be disallowed the more readily as we see that God has dealt with the flesh judicially in Christ. So I, by the Spirit, do it also. "But if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live", @Romans 8:13.
A.P.T. Is the sweet psalmist of Israel one of the Old Testament saints who learned this principle more than others?
J.T. That is right; that is what the Psalms bring out. David, I believe, is one of the best examples you can get of a man who learned it. He learned it, alas! through his failures. @Psalm 51 shows that in a remarkable way, as does also @Psalm 22.
F.H.L. Does not @Psalm 106 in reviewing this history go back to Egypt and lead through to a doxology? "We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. Our fathers in Egypt considered not thy wondrous works" (@Psalm 106: 6,7). And then it closes with the triumph of God. "Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise ... Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!" (@Psalm 106: 47, 48).
J.T. That shows how faith went back in the history of the people.
W.B-w. @Ezekiel 20: 9 says, "But I wrought for my name's sake", and then @Ezekiel 20: 44 says, "when
{108}
I have wrought with you for my name's sake". Would the first refer to the cross, and the second to the moral work in the saints?
J.T. I think so. "And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 20: 44). That refers to God's sovereign work in recovery. I suppose verse 9 would involve the passover, for they had the passover in Egypt. That dealt with sin in the flesh in type, in view of the cross, linked, of course, with the power of God exercised in delivering Israel out of Egypt. So that God had before Him throughout, in type, the judicial termination of the flesh, but you do not get that side of the truth here. This is the actual *history* of sin in the flesh.
J.S. As early as @Genesis 6:13, it is said, "The end of all flesh is come before me".
J.T. And so in verse 9 of our chapter, as has been remarked, God wrought for His name's sake. God could speak thus in view of Christ's death. "And when I see the blood, I will pass over you", @Exodus 12:13. God could go on with them on sacrificial lines. Morally, He could not otherwise do so; He could not go on with man after the flesh as such. But in the types of Christ's atoning death the whole matter of sin was dealt with anticipatively, and hence God went on with Israel.
Rem. It is very helpful to see that application of the blood in connection with the covenant in @Exodus 24, indicating that God is prepared to go on with us, not on our profession merely, but on the basis of the death of Christ.
A.R. It also speaks of them sinning in the land (@Ezekiel 20: 28, 29); God rebuked them for offering sacrifices on hills apart from the house of God. Would you say something about that?
J.T. That is the final feature of the indictment here, and we come to the word "Bamah", or "high place",
{109}
which, I suppose, would be seen in what was set up in the land in Jeroboam's time. He carried on that sort of thing away from Jerusalem, but it was carried on in Jerusalem, too. It is the working of sin in high places. Today it would be such as a cathedral or a church or anything that is marked off as distinctively religious above the level of the ordinary world of sin, but as contrary to the mind of God.
C.A.M. Do you think it is really worse than what is ordinary, in the sense that, being in "high places", it is really nearer Satan's domain? In Ephesians, the spirit of the ruler of the authority of the air works in the sons of disobedience. It is really above the ordinary level of everyday life.
J.T. I think that is the way to look at it. I believe idolatry was introduced in connection with the tower of Babel. There is nothing said about idolatry before the deluge; it apparently came in afterwards. It seems as if Satan took up the elevated idea in government which was introduced in Noah. The ark rested on Mount Ararat, giving the thought of elevation on earth. Before the flood nothing is said about mountains. It is primarily in connection with the ark and Noah that we get elevation in this sense.
C.A.M. So that Satan was really using an attempt by men to get into the region from which he had been cast out.
J.T. That is the idea; and he actually got there. So the book of Revelation tells us that he is to be ejected from heaven. Babel marks man's mind as ascending; the tower was to reach to heaven; not literally, but in the thought of man, who said, "let us make ourselves a name" @Genesis 11: 4; and then religion was attached to that, but still retaining man's will and its workings, which is always sin in principle.
A.R. What do you have in mind about government?
J.T. The idea of government was introduced in Noah. Elevation was introduced in the ark being above
{110}
and resting on the mountains of Ararat. The ark rested there; indeed, I suppose it remained there, and may have acquired a place in man's mind; at any rate, the idea of elevation was there. Hence the idea of the tower of Babel, the top of which would reach unto heaven, which represents elevation; not simply going up literally, but man's mind ascending apart from God, and Satan agitating it to that end. I apprehend he thus found a footing, through the principle of government, which involves elevation. Nimrod's kingdom began at Babel. In the history of christendom the hierarchical system is representative of the striving for elevation; climbing up. The world's glories are eclipsed by the splendours of the head of the so-called professing church.
Ques. Would you say it is professedly high and morally low?
J.T. It must be; for it is *sin* in high places.
C.A.M. Whereas, when God fills the universe, it will be from top to bottom.
J.T. That is right; man, as illustrated in the building of the tower of Babel, works up.
A.B.P. Is it the thing that is met by the Lord Jesus in @John 4?
J.T. Quite so; "neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem" (@John 4: 21).
Ques. In Zechariah, the ephah is lifted up between the earth and the heavens, and the question is asked where it is to be carried, and they say to the land of Shinar. It is going back, is it not, to Babel?
J.T. Quite so; that is where it began. Babel is really the beginning of Babylon.
G.V.D. @Revelation 18 speaks of the sins of Babylon reaching up to heaven.
J.T. Yes; "heaped on one another up to the heaven" @Revelation 18: 5.
F.H.L. Do you think as to @Matthew 4, that what is being said as to the high places enters into the enemy's
{111}
attempt, which goes from the wilderness to the pinnacle of the temple and then up to the very high mountain?
J.T. Yes; that is Satan's way.
J.S. So that if light is cumulative, so is sin.
J.T. Quite so; the light of christianity is taken on by man's mind, allied with "philosophy and vain deceit" @Colossians 2: 8; and that is what christendom has turned to; Satan inflating it and energising men above their ordinary level.
A.R. The apostle writes to the saints at Ephesus about spiritual wickedness in heavenly places. Would that fit in with what you have here?
J.T. It would.
W.B-w. Why is Samuel linked on with Ramah (which suggests elevation) in his prophetic ministry? Would his prophetic ministry help to bring down the high places?
J.T. Quite so; by bringing in the idea of elevation according to God -- in which Samuel *lived*. The epistle to the Ephesians has this in view. We are blessed with every spiritual blessing *in the heavenlies* in Christ. The apostle Paul went beyond any point Satan could reach. He went to the *third* heaven; there is nothing said about Satan being there; it is more the outer or sidereal side of the position he enters into, I understand.
Well, we must hasten on to the final section of the chapter, beginning with verse 33, where we come to God's intervention in the presence of all this. He says, "As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I reign over you" @Ezekiel 20: 33. I believe He means that He will reign over us in power to preclude any uprising of the flesh. He is going to act for Himself, but He will do it in such power as to preclude rebellion. "And I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out; and I will bring you into the
{112}
wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face. Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah. And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel". (It is a remarkable thing that He brings the unregenerate out, too.) "And ye shall know that I am Jehovah. As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols henceforth also, if none of you will hearken unto me; but profane my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols. For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, the whole of it, in the land; there will I accept them, and there will I require your heave-offerings and the first-fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things. As a sweet savour will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be hallowed in you in the sight of the nations. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have brought you into the land of Israel, into the country which I lifted up my hand to give to your fathers. And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils which ye have committed. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 20: 34 - 44). I think we can see clearly how the end is to be reached in power and in righteousness. He deals with them face to face,
{113}
and as verse 44 says, He works with them, which would imply His work in them.
A.F.M. Would this coincide with the end of the book, where Israel is recovered, and Jehovah is there?
J.T. Well, this runs on to that, where it is Jehovah-Shammah -- "The Lord is there".
J.S. This really corresponds with the judgment arrived at by Job. He says, "I abhor myself" @Job 42: 6; he becomes conscious of his moral condition.
A.N.W. Does "for my name's sake" suggest that God retreats into His own rights in mercy?
J.T. I think that is right. The recurrence of these words in this chapter is striking.
Ques. What is the force of the expression, "bond of the covenant" (@Ezekiel 20: 37), which is used in the passage you have read?
J.T. It indicates the completeness of the recovery; God is coming in for recovery. If the judgment of the earlier part of the book is accepted, there is hope; that, I think, is the way the thing stands. They accepted the judgment already indicated in the earlier part of the book.
A.R. Does the passage also show that whatever Israel's attitude toward God's "holy mountain" and Jerusalem may have been, God's thoughts about it have never changed? The same thing applies to the assembly; in spite of the failure, recovery indicates that God has never given up the idea of the assembly.
J.T. Yes. When recovery is effected in any one of us, it is with a strong hand against the flesh, for the flesh is so strong in us, and we are so slow to give it up. The same spirit is in every one of us. "As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I reign over you" (@Ezekiel 20: 33). We thank God for that. It involves His discipline; His governmental dealings with us, so that He helps us to overcome the flesh in ourselves. But all is that we might reach His holy
{114}
mountain, the mountain of the height of Israel, where all the house of Israel shall serve Him (verse 40).
Ques. Is there not the suggestion here, too, that He has abandoned them? Do we not have to learn, that under such circumstances God will not hear us?
J.T. He said He would not be inquired of by them. The people must accept the state that they are in. God cannot answer us until we judge the flesh.
N.P. In another prophet He says, "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart", @Hosea 2: 14. Is that on the same line as we get here?
J.T. Hosea stresses the work of God in His people. In the passage before us we have His work, too. He brings them into the wilderness, into the bond of the covenant, and brings them under the rod, which means, I think, that everyone of us is counted and taken up in love for blessing.
G.L. Peter says, "he that has suffered in the flesh has done with sin", @1 Peter 4: 1. Does that correspond?
J.T. It does; you have done with sin, as having judged it, but as having suffered in the flesh. We arm ourselves with the mind of Christ as having suffered for sins.
Ques. Is there any suggestion of the epistles to the Corinthians in the verses you read, in the thought of God coming in, in His authority in Christ, and then the rod in Paul's ministry; in love, and then the bond of the covenant following?
J.T. I think that is all very instructive, because it is a question of the kingdom. Romans is the kingdom in its relation to us individually; how God deals with us. It is in our favour to be ruled over with a strong hand. Then Corinthians brings in the kingdom, collectively. So that we have the rod, in the sense of severity, and the judgment of sin in chapter 5; and the second epistle develops the thought of the covenant.
{115}
J.T.Jr. *We* are told to purge out the old leaven in chapter 5 of the first epistle, but here *God* does it. He purges out the rebels Himself (verse 38).
Rem. In the land, as returned, they loathe themselves: "And ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils which ye have committed" (@Ezekiel 20: 43). It is not now in the sight of God only; it would be as though, at this point, our sight and God's coalesce.
J.T. It is "when I have wrought with you for my name's sake", as we have seen.
{116}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (6)
@Ezekiel 25: 1 - 17; @Ezekiel 28: 24 - 26; @Ezekiel 29: 21
J.T. In view of the ground to be covered, we should look at chapters 25 to 32 at this reading. These chapters deal with the subject of God's judgment on certain nations in proximity to Israel: Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyre, Sidon and Egypt. In chapter 32 other nations are mentioned as showing the judgment of Egypt, but she is in mind throughout chapters 29 - 32. The Lord would help us in the understanding of what is represented by each nation mentioned. Each is presented as representing some feature of the world with which we have to do. They do not include all the ancient nations, but rather those that were specially in relation or proximity to Israel.
And what should be before us initially is the position in which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is seen. He is called "king of kings", in the midst of these nations; and as about to be used of God in His judgment upon them, Nebuchadnezzar represents the element of government which is owned of God. This should be distinguished from the features of those nations mentioned; they are brought forward to represent different moral features of the world; whereas Nebuchadnezzar is on God's side in the midst of all that, as representing His government. He has the title "king of kings", that is, his is universal dominion, divinely given; an element which we should understand in our day, for he represents the rule that has come down to our times. The Spirit of God has grouped these nations together for our instruction at the present time, as representing the features of the world with which we must contend; whereas Nebuchadnezzar, as the universal ruler, is outside of all that. He is the emperor -- the beginning of the great system of government which God inaugurated, when He set Israel aside.
{117}
A.N.W. God describes him as "Nebuchadnezzar my servant".
J.T. That is how he is regarded here; he is not judged in this book. Babylon is not seen as judged. Other prophets speak of the judgment of Babylon, but not Ezekiel, in any precise way. So that Nebuchadnezzar would represent the element of government inaugurated by God, until the restoration of Israel, which we should respect and for which we should pray, whereas the other nations would represent features of the world, as the Lord said: "Woe to the world because of offences!" (@Matthew 18: 7); it is the world in a moral sense in its varied features.
The important subject in view of Israel's recovery, or in view of the saints of today entering on their privileges, is that we should understand the judgment of the world in these features which come near to us -- Jerusalem itself is included in the pronouncement earlier. The setting aside, in judgment, of the ornament of the earth -- the temple in Jerusalem, represented figuratively in Ezekiel's wife -- should affect us as it affected Ezekiel in chapter 24. What God primarily set up in a religious way becomes an object of endearment to us, and if we are unduly occupied with externals, we are apt to allow too great a place to it and contravene the judgment of God. So Ezekiel is told not to mourn the death of his wife. I believe that chapter 24 is to regulate us in our attitude toward what has been peculiarly of God in a public way, lest we overlook that it has come under judgment.
C.A.M. King Artaxerxes, in sending Ezra, describes himself as king of kings also. Do you think that idea will be carried on by men until the Lord arises from His Father's throne?
J.T. I think so; it looks on to the reign of Christ. The four gentile monarchies, whose functions are provisional, are in view of this. The Lord has the title King of kings, and Lord of lords, in Revelation.
{118}
Nebuchadnezzar is called king of kings here, and he is called the head of gold, in Daniel; that is, he represents, abstractly, the government of God. It is primarily of God. It is for us, in spiritual discrimination, to distinguish between that and those features represented in the other nations, that are dealt with here so ruthlessly as affecting God's people.
J.S. Would you name the features set forth in these nations as opposed to the testimony?
J.T. Well, the first, as you will notice, is Ammon. Ammon and Moab go together. They represent features of the world all around us and near to us as real christians; not heathendom, but those that are near to us by natural relation, for they descended from Lot. And then Edom is nearer still -- representing those who would claim the brotherhood. These three are forms of the world, with which we might readily contract relations and be defiled. But in our chapter they are presented as hostile to the people of God.
J.S. Do you regard them as in the profession at the present time?
J.T. Quite so; features of the world which are seen in the profession. Then we have the Philistines, who are not related to us; they have no natural link with the saints, but they are in Canaan and so in proximity to the saints. The Philistines have a nearer place than such as Tyre and Egypt. So we have to distinguish between these four features; they are grouped together in chapter 25. Comparatively small space is given to each of the four, but when we come to Tyre and Egypt, each has a large place in the book, especially Egypt.
Ques. Would there be certain features seen in the book of the Acts which would correspond with these in the history of the testimony?
J.T. I think so; there are those addressed as brethren; the term "brethren" was used between the Jews and the apostles; there was a recognised outward relation. There is something like that today -- a
{119}
recognised outward relationship -- but in our scripture each of these nations is presented as bitterly hostile to what is of God, whatever their outward attitude may be.
A.F.M. Why was Philistia so hostile to Israel, although not outwardly related?
J.T. Because of the ground they occupied. They were rivals in the same territory; the other three are rivals, not exactly in our own territory, but in lineal relation; but all four are against what is of God. So that with regard to Ammon it says, "prophesy against them; and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah ... Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity: therefore behold, I will give thee to the children of the east for a possession" (@Ezekiel 25: 3, 4). You can see what their attitude was. When God's people were under His judgment and discipline, there was a bitterness against them, and God takes account of that.
And then, of the Moabites, Jehovah says, "Because Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations, therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities even to the last of them ... unto the children of the east" (@Ezekiel 25: 8 -10). They say that the people of God have become like the rest, on the same plane as all the nations, there is no distinction; whereas God never gives up the thought of what His real people are to Him, whatever discipline they may be enduring.
And then of Edom He says, "Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath made himself very guilty, and revenged himself upon them, therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom; and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and unto Dedan shall they
{120}
fall by the sword. And I will execute my vengeance upon Edom" (@Ezekiel 25: 12 - 14).
And then as to the Philistines, "Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul, to destroy, from old hatred; therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I stretch out my hands upon the Philistines" (@Ezekiel 25: 15, 16). So that each of them has evidenced a certain kind of bitter opposition, and it is largely while God is dealing in discipline with His people. He is peculiarly jealous about us, even if we are under discipline; He will not allow others to attack us. He may find it necessary to discipline us, but He resents every interference.
Ques. Certain opposing elements seem to arise when there is trouble amongst the saints. Is your thought that we might see where this opposition comes from?
J.T. That is right; there was opposition, of course, when Israel was in prosperity, but when they were in difficulty these particular elements showed themselves. The feeling is there always, but it shows itself when opportunity arises.
A.R. Ammon and Moab are *saying* things, whereas Edom and the Philistines are marked by "taking vengeance". Though the latter may be the worse, yet God holds us responsible for how we speak against the saints, as well as for the way we act towards them.
J.T. The Philistines show "old hatred". It is hereditary.
A.N.W. Do the Jews, when speaking of the brethren in the last chapter of the Acts, have some sinister feeling? It says, "nor has any one of the brethren ... reported or said anything ... concerning thee", @Acts 28: 21.
J.T. It is an Edomitish position, I think, right through. Paul had spoken of the Jews as his brethren with the deepest feeling (@Romans 9: 3), and in Rome he addressed them as brethren, evidently with corresponding
{121}
feeling, but they used the term as designating the Jews at Jerusalem, where Edomitish hostility had been shown to Christ and His own in the bitterest form.
C.A.M. The divine record gives us ample information as to the origin of these enemies.
J.T. Quite so. Take Ammon and Moab, for example; we know their corrupt origin, and we know Edom, too. God says later, "I hated Esau", @Malachi 1: 3. His conduct was such as to draw out divine hatred, and it had shown itself at this time. The Philistines came from Caphtor, connected with Egypt; they are a people of great pretension. They make much of themselves and they are rivals of God's people on the ground of profession. They claim the same territory as the saints.
J.S. Would that be seen at the present time in the teaching of modernism; the levelling effect and equality which it brings in?
J.T. Yes; it brings everything down to a common level. I think the modernists would be all Philistines. They are inveterate enemies of the people of God. They occupy the same ground, and would by their investigations, higher criticism, and that kind of thing, bring out their claim as equal to what is of the Spirit of God. It is a very remarkable thing that in the past century, the revival of the truth came in the thirties, and almost concurrently there arose what is called the Tractarian movement in Oxford, developing high-churchism, leading to Rome. Some went to Rome, others became out-and-out rationalists. Satan was endeavouring to combat the work of God with a rival movement. Higher criciticism was also active, claiming to know everything as to the Scriptures, and so on. But the truth has come out in a wonderful development -- the truth of Christ in heaven and the Spirit of God here. And then there was the introduction of the doctrine of infallibility, which followed the Oxford movement -- all intended by the enemy to becloud and counteract the truth God was bringing out. Modernism
{122}
is largely the counter to this great movement which men felt was eclipsing them.
F.H.L. Would these four nations which are grouped together in the chapter suggest the "universal lords of this darkness", @Ephesians 6: 12?
J.T. Yes. It is well to notice that they are put together in the chapter. Edom is alluded to later, but they are put together concisely and form a combined feature of opposition.
A.B.P. And are they marked particularly by hatred against the people of God; whereas the other three -- Tyre, Zidon, and Egypt -- have more the character of shutting God out and usurping His place.
J.T. Well, exactly. Tyre is not marked by hatred of Israel; anciently, she was linked up with Israel in a most striking way. She had great advantages, but now she glories in the fact that Israel is laid waste; she will become enriched, as if Israel was a rival in commercialism and other interests, for Jerusalem is called "the gate of the peoples". And now it is out of the way, and Tyre exults, for she will have a freer hand in her projects.
J.S. The Lord says, "it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment-day than for you" @Matthew 11: 22.
J.T. Tyre and Sidon had certain advantages, but Chorazin and Bethsaida had much greater, for the Lord Himself had done mighty works in them. I suppose we should regard Tyre as typical of the modern world of commerce. It has a great place, and the Spirit of God devotes chapters 26, 27 and 28 to it. What is meant by it is, I suppose, the great place commerce has as affecting the testimony. The Spirit of God would give us understanding of what is in the mind of God as to this feature of the world. And then the word as to Egypt is given even more space. As many as six different dates of prophecies appear dealing with this great subject of Egypt. What should be noted particularly in this respect is the repeated occurrence of
{123}
the words "they shall know that I am Jehovah". That is, there is testimony to God in His judgments. He is to be known in the judgments that He executes; so that they are a testimony, even as the gospel is a testimony. God is made known in the gospel, but He is to be known in judgment also; not that, in the latter, the knowledge is formative in the persons judged, but that there is a testimony to God. God will be witnessed to, even in eternity, I suppose, in the lake of fire, for He is known in the judgments that He executes.
C.A.M. Tyre being the commercial world, do you connect its ruler with the god of this world? Is that why Satan has such a place?
J.T. I think so; there are two terms used, you will notice: the first is the "prince", @Ezekiel 28: 2 and the second is the "king of Tyre" (@Ezekiel 28: 12). The prince would be, I suppose, the historical king or ruler in the country, but the king is a fuller and more official thought, and seems to afford the Spirit of God an opportunity of speaking about Satan, as the god of this world.
C.A.M. When Paul acted against what was evil in Philippi he is said to have upset the commercial world there: "seeing that the hope of their gains was gone", @Acts 16: 19. The work of God would operate in that way, would it not?
J.T. Quite so. The account here is, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the seas, (and thou art a man, and not God,) and thou settest thy heart as the heart of God: behold, thou art wiser than Daniel! nothing secret is obscure for thee; by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures; by thy great wisdom thou hast by thy traffic increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up
{124}
because of thy riches" (@Ezekiel 28: 1 - 5). And then in verse 11, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, who sealest up the measure of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, thou wast in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was thy covering: the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the chrysolite, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle, and the emerald, and gold. The workmanship of thy tambours and of thy pipes was in thee: in the day that thou wast created were they prepared. Thou wast the anointed covering cherub, and I had set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou didst walk up and down in the midst of stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways, from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee" (@Ezekiel 28: 11 - 15). It would seem that the prince is the historical ruler, only through his great *riches* he became exalted to the place of God in his mind -- set his heart as the heart of God. But the description of the king is more personal. His heart was lifted up because of his *beauty*, according to verse 17. He is less dependent upon his wealth. The prince's greatness arises from his wealth, but the Spirit of God seems to move on to that which corresponds to Satan himself. The commercial world is inflationary; it inflates us, perhaps more than any feature of the world, because it affords such a means of power, such a sense of power; wealth being so deceptive.
A.R. Hiram, king of Tyre, was ever a lover of David; he served both David and Solomon. Is your thought that a man of means should hold his wealth in relation to the testimony?
J.T. By referring back to Hiram, we get a right principle. He was a remarkable man; he was ever a lover of David; that is, he was not diverted by his wealth. It is a great matter to be free from influences;
{125}
that one is ever a lover of Christ, whatever he may have; so that having means -- a good salary, and the like -- does not move one. Steadiness of love for Christ saves us, and of course the Lord's supper is the great steadying and refreshing influence that holds us and maintains us in our love for Him. Wealth has a most pernicious influence, and inflates us, so that we become independent, and even become rivals of God, in our own minds, at least; that is what the prince of Tyre says of himself.
Rem. So that the love of money is a root of every evil; whereas love for Christ is the spring of all good.
R.W.S. The commercial feature would be particularly used by the enemy against the truth on *this* continent.
J.T. Well, I suppose there is no country where money has a greater place than in this in which we are. It is really the standard of everything here. In other countries, hereditary titles, family lineage, and so on, have a great place, but here, money is the determining factor of greatness.
A.N.W. So your reference to the Lord's supper is striking. I was thinking of the wisdom of the apostle in asking us to consider our prosperity -- how God had prospered us -- on the first day of the week.
J.T. That is an interesting connection, as entering into the thought of the first day of the week. It is remarkable how much place the apostle gives to the idea of "the collection for the saints" for meeting need, even at a distance. He refers to it in his two letters to Corinth: it is to be laid by on the first day of the week, and it is according as one is prospered. However much one is prospered, as a lover of Christ he is to put by at home proportionately.
A.B.P. You mentioned that there was a testimony to God in the form of judgment which He brought in upon these various nations. Would you say more about that?
{126}
J.T. I think the judgments recorded here are designed to that end. Each of the varied phases is in its place, as the gospel is in its place. The gospel makes God known in grace, and affects our hearts; but that failing, He will be known in judgment. In these chapters there is a continual recurrence of the words, "they shall know that I am Jehovah". Each judgment makes God known; it is part of His testimony to Himself, that those under judgment know that He is God. And, as already said, I believe that will go on into the lake of fire, that God is known in the judgment that He executes.
A.B.P. And is the link maintained in the epistle to the Philippians, where it says, "every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to God the Father's glory", @Philippians 2: 10, 11?
Ques. When the gospel enters our souls in the Spirit's power, is the same power that judges these nations available in our souls to help us to judge ourselves and to judge the nations now, morally?
J.T. We are to take sides with God, as we said earlier: "Wilt thou judge them ... son of man?" @Ezekiel 20: 4. These chapters are to draw us to God's side and God's outlook and view, so that we might be with Him as to judgment as well as in the gospel.
C.A.M. To bring God in and make room for His discriminating judgment is a very helpful thought. If wickedness occurs, and we make way for God, it will be perfectly met.
J.T. Yes, and He is better known through the judgment of it; in all these cases we see how finality is reached, and it culminates in God having a free hand to set up what is of Himself, so that the chapters before us provide for that in the restoration of Israel: "And there shall be no more a wounding sting for the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn, among all that were round about them, that despised them: and they shall
{127}
know that I am the Lord Jehovah", (@Ezekiel 28: 24). That is a remarkable verse; that the judgments are in view of God having a free hand to set up what is of Himself; the house of Israel. It has come under His judgment, according to what we have already seen. But then, what is of Himself, either abstractly or concretely, is never out of His mind, and whenever opportunity offers in dealing with the world in its various phases, He brings this in. He implies that He is not going to leave a void. Through His judgments He is really making room for what is of Himself, and that His people should not be disturbed by such a thing as a "wounding sting". How much of that there is, as it is said, "they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips", @Psalm 59: 7. That is, there is a certain attitude in these nations, ready to come forward when the opportune time comes, but God says, I am going to take all that away, so that "there shall be no more a wounding sting for the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn, among all that were round about them" @Ezekiel 28: 24. God is telling us that in the judgment of these features of the world, He is removing these wounding stings that constantly come up and lacerate the saints. God is going to give us liberty and release from all that by His judgments. And then we have, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shalt have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be hallowed in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their land which I have given to my servant Jacob. They shall dwell in it in safety, and shall build houses and plant vineyards; and they shall dwell in safety, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despised them round about them: and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God" (@Ezekiel 28: 25, 26). Note, "I am Jehovah their God" -- it is His people. Now it is not only that He is known, but His people know that He is Jehovah their God.
{128}
E.E.H. "Commit it to Jehovah -- let him rescue him; let him deliver him", @Psalm 22: 8. Would that be a sting delivered to the Lord on the cross?
J.T. Yes. That psalm speaks of several such stings. The Lord was beset with them, even while He was on the cross.
R.W.S. Protection from them is in some sense known today in the promise to Philadelphia: "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3: 9.
J.T. That is most important now -- it is a promise. There are several promises to Philadelphia, and that is one of them. It is a marvellous promise, too; it is quite an exercise as to how it will come about. The Lord, I am sure, would help us to understand how it takes practical form.
J.H.E. Peter says, "For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God is come; but if first from us, what shall be the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God? And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and the sinner appear?" @1 Peter 4:17, 18. Peter had a right view of it, had he not?
A.R. How is the Lord causing those who say they are Jews and are not to worship before Philadelphia's feet? Will you say a word more?
J.T. Well, if He does it even in a small way, the end is reached. It would be very objectionable for us to be looking for this if we are not equal to it. It is a question of spiritual state. It requires balance and self-renunciation to expect it, but the Lord speaks about it to Philadelphia, so that we can count it as a promise.
A.B.P. Does that thought carry through to the judgment seat of Christ; so that matters that have not
{129}
been thoroughly bottomed or adjusted here, will *all* be cleared?
J.T. It would all culminate there, but I think the promise to Philadelphia is intended to be a present realisation; it is an act of the Lord's whilst we are here. "I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet" @Revelation 3: 9. That is a very wonderful promise, and I believe we should count upon it.
G.MacP. Does it indicate that these judgments of God on the nations will culminate in the expression of love to His people?
J.T. Yes. It is a necessity of love to clear the ground, as seen in our chapters. The ground is so encumbered that God cannot work out His thoughts as He did at the beginning of christianity. The ground is so encumbered with these features all around us, that He needs to bring us to His mind about them. So that as we come to it, we know in some measure that He is God in a *judicial* way, which is important: He is known *in His love* in the gospel. Both are testimonies to God. Those who know Him through the gospel love Him, but those who know Him through judgment may not love Him, they may be consigned to eternal punishment.
Ques. How do you regard the current commercial depression in relation to the judgment of God on Tyre?
J.T. The depression has been a help to the brethren. Of course it has involved temporal suffering to many, but I think it has greatly aided the brethren in seeing how the government of God works; to see, for instance, how in a moment great fortunes may collapse and come to nothing. I believe it has been a great help to many who are upright to see just what commerce is in this sense -- how quickly the results of it may disappear.
C.A.M. So that there seems to be two ways of arriving at governmental results. One is that economic conditions may take all away from us, but the collection
{130}
among the saints offers a way of being in a position where we have not very much to lose.
J.T. And I believe the way in which the apostle Paul presents the truth of the collection enables us to get the benefit of it by giving in a balanced way; on the principle of equality, as he says in the second epistle to the Corinthians; but in the first epistle, it is laying by at home on the first day of the week as God has prospered us. It does not imply that we lay by the whole amount acquired, because a man has obligations which he must meet righteously, so that he weighs the thing, and the sentiment entering into the first day of the week would tend to liberality. If you think of giving a certain amount, the disposition would be to increase rather than reduction. The tendency would be to give more rather than less, on the first day of the week. The drift of the sentiment that underlies the giving would tend to express more love.
C.A.M. That is excellent! So that really, you have no weights to keep you down; as a matter of fact, you are ready then to go up!
J.T. Just so.
A.R. Would @Numbers 7 enhance what you are saying? As a result of the princes giving, an eternal state of things is reached, is it not? Moses went in to speak to God, and God spoke to him.
J.T. Yes. The whole chapter is devoted to giving, and it is spread out; the offerings of each prince, although the same as the others, are given in detail, as if God is so pleased with them. He would have the offerings mentioned twelve times; and then the total -- including weight -- of each item is given. The brethren counting the gifts on the Lord's day morning is a holy matter. It should not be regarded as purely temporal. The gifts of the saints are holy, and heaven is pleased with them. So that as Moses goes into the sanctuary to speak to God, God speaks to him.
{131}
Ques. In @2 Corinthians 8: 5, Paul, speaking of the Macedonian saints, says, "but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will". Would that furnish the basis of the sentiment -- giving themselves to the Lord?
J.T. Yes; but at Corinth (@1 Corinthians 16), the basis of the sentiment is the first day of the week, which carries with it so much holy sentiment, involving love. There is the wonderful activity of Christ on that day; the wonderful self-sacrifice in the way He served, right up to late in the evening. I believe that would be involved in what the first day of the week would suggest.
J.S. Do you think it would encourage us, as was said, to give more as we see the Lord giving all; "This is my body, which is for you", @1 Corinthians 11: 24. He gives without reservation, does He not?
J.T. Quite so, and all that would enter into the first day of the week, according to the apostle's presentation of it; and his example as coming together to break bread on the first day of the week (@Acts 20: 7).
F.H.L. The first day of the week carries with it the thought of what is eternal, does it not?
J.T. I think it does: it has eternity in view.
A.N.W. And would not the doing of it at home guarantee that the home is in its right setting in regard of what is eternal, too?
J.T. I believe so; the family would be brought into it. I think balance enters into all that we are saying, that you carefully weigh the thing; it is not simply a matter of spontaneity, but it is a carefully weighed matter. Paul makes a striking allusion to the love of Christ: "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died", @2 Corinthians 5: 14. That is, you are balanced in the thing, in that sense. You look abroad and say, "that one died for all, then all have died". You are able to take account of the whole position, and you will also be able to take account of your money rightly, how it can
{132}
be used in the furtherance of God's interests, I think it is well to have in mind this question of balance, because christianity ought to produce a balanced state of things, that we are not fanatical in any sense; everything we do is done in a sober, intelligent way. The apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do *ye* judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10: 15. That is, we are to be careful and weigh what is presented to us. The scripture we have referred to says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this" @2 Corinthians 5: 14. He judged under the influence of the love of Christ, and what a judgment he had! And I believe that all that should be in the household on the first day of the week; that is, we are balanced. But then, the tendency created by the sentiment of the first day is to give more, rather than less.
Ques. Then is it in order for members of the family, when they are in fellowship to speak over these matters, to keep the thing in balance?
J.T. If they are contributors to the household, they should all be in it. It seems to be rather a question of the brother and his wife, although persons in fellowship in the house should, I think, be brought into it.
A.R. The apostle in referring to the collection, says of the Lord, "for your sakes, he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched", @2 Corinthians 8: 9. And then he says, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift", @2 Corinthians 9:15. That would help to balance the idea, do you not think?
J.T. The second letter goes into it more fully and brings in the word "prepare". The giving in the first epistle is according to their prosperity, on the first day of the week, but the second epistle stresses preparation. The apostle had boasted to the Macedonians "That Achaia is prepared since a year ago" @2 Corinthians 9: 2. The money laid aside should not be used for what is personal; it is not yours any more; the sacrifice is not to be recalled. It is the Lord's.
{133}
E.E.H. Would you regard the pound of ointment in @John 12 as a balanced idea?
J.T. I do. It was *a pound*; it was weighed, and *kept for a purpose*.
Ques. What about the money that Judas wanted to disburse later?
J.T. Well, he spoke commercially; he had no spiritual thought at all; and so was not fit to say anything in those circumstances; a man that is merely commercial cannot think or speak in a holy way. But Judas "was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into it" @John 12: 6. Those charged with the care of the collection of the saints should be marked by the opposite of this.
Ques. He referred to giving it to the poor. That might sound good in the care meeting, but was not the levitical side first in the Lord's mind?
J.T. Well, it does not say so there. It does in Deuteronomy; but Judas¬ word was simply foreign to the occasion, even though he spoke about the poor. It was foreign; he was really condemning a worshipper.
J.T.Jr. Some said, in Simon's house, "Why has this waste been made?" @Mark 14: 4. If there is waste it is what we use for ourselves, not what is used for the Lord's interests. We often waste what should be used for the box.
J.T. What we began with on this subject should be borne in mind. It is a question of a lover of David; a lover of Christ; Hiram was typically a lover of Christ. He used his wealth on David; he built David a house, and contributed largely to the house of God. Hiram is the type of a believer who has means; a man may be a christian and have means. We are told of some in Antioch who were "well off", and they contributed to the need at Jerusalem and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. So that I think we go back to Hiram in this way. He was not diverted by his wealth, even though it increased; he kept on loving
{134}
David, and gave more; he gave largely to Solomon, also, for the house of God.
Ques. Is there not the danger of getting into a routine method of giving; not going beyond a certain amount?
J.T. The tendency of love is to *increase*. The service of the Lord requires this very thing. Hiram was ever a lover of David, and that is the only thing that is worth counting upon in these matters. The root should be that I love Christ; and if I love Christ I love the saints, and what I have is to be used to promote the interests of Christ. But giving should be in a balanced, calculated way.
J.S. Hiram did not fluctuate in his affections, but was a constant lover.
J.T. He was really more affluent in his giving in Solomon's time; Solomon, however, provided food for his household, but all that Hiram did for Solomon is connected with his love for David (@1 Kings 5:1).
F.H.L. What would you say about the two mites? @Luke 21:1 - 4.
J.T. It is an incident that is brought forward by the Spirit of God as showing how far love will go. It does not interfere with what we are speaking of as to balance; Paul's thought is equality; not that you should be in want because of giving to another what you need, but the thought of equality; steadiness of love for Christ balances things. You say that this or that is needed and you can afford to give so much; and in wisdom that is the thing to do. But the sentiment of your soul is that your needs become less and your desire is to give more. Jacob's tenth was not bad for a young christian. I do not know that many of us go much further. He returned to Bethel and was pleasing to God *there* -- that is, in God's house. He ended as a worshipper of God and as putting the spiritual before the natural.
C.A.M. He went on giving in that sense.
{135}
Ques. How does the thought of balance enter into the care meeting? I ask in reference to giving.
J.T. The thought of balance certainly enters into it. In Exodus we have the principle of measure in the counting and weighing; these two things go together. It is a question of what the brethren *ought* to give; determined after careful consideration of the need, and of what we may reasonably expect the brethren to give as lovers of Christ. By experience you know what may be reasonably expected, and the distribution would be based on that.
J.S. And would not Hiram's example help us? He saw that Solomon had undertaken great things and so would require much more.
J.T. Quite so. And there was reciprocation in Solomon's time, for Solomon provided for Hiram, too, as we have seen. So that one gets back what he gives and more. "Give and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over", @Luke 6: 38.
Rem. Hiram did not like it very much.
J.T. That is another matter coming in later, but the principles are all there, and in Solomon's time there was a reciprocative feeling between the giver and the receiver. The apostle speaks of "giving and receiving", @Philippians 4:15. The two things should go together. So that giving is not continuously one-sided. Balance makes the giver and the receiver to gain.
R.W.S. Some meetings think of the levites all over the world; other meetings consider just for the levites in the district, and in the country. Is the universal position to be in mind more than we have it, possibly?
J.T. I think so; our giving ought to be universal, because the instructions we have deal with need a long way off, and the levites, according to Deuteronomy, should be considered first.
{136}
A.R. In regard of Tyre, in the scripture we read, this power seems to have acquired immense influence; it is power in the seas; whereas the king of Egypt speaks of his rivers, which is a more limited thought, is it not?
J.T. Well, chapter 27 is remarkable, depicting a wonderful scope of mercantile enterprises; the east, west, north, and south are laid under tribute by this great trading nation, and the sources of her wealth and variety of her wares are described in remarkable detail. But it is a "lamentation", as if spoken ironically. Then as to Pharaoh, it says, "the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against the whole of Egypt; speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which saith, My river is mine own, and I made it for myself" (@Ezekiel 29: 1 - 3). The opening verses on the subject give us the idea that God's creation -- rivers, mountains, lakes, lands, woods, or whatever they be -- are appropriated by man in the flesh, who leaves God out of his calculations. "My river is mine own, and I made it for myself", Pharaoh says. He would exploit it for himself. It is just man generally, looking at the creature of God as ministering to him, as though it were just for him, for his comfort, for his pleasure, to promote his greatness; that is all. That is the idea of Egypt, and there are so many prophecies concerning it, that the subject is more extensively treated than any other in these chapters. God is now speaking to us as to His creatures, which He has provided so bountifully, and man appropriates them deliberately, and says they are his own, that he made them for himself and uses them exclusively for himself, to promote his greatness and build himself up here in pride. That is Egypt, and in this moral sense it is abominable to God.
{137}
As one looks at the dates given in these chapters, he is impressed with the importance this feature of the world has in God's mind -- sometimes seventeen years elapsing between one prophecy and another; God would thus return to speak of Egypt: He would give her to Nebuchadnezzar as wages for his service against Tyre (@Ezekiel 29:17, 18). God is constantly bringing this matter before us, so that we are not to be selfish; that is, all God's creation is to be used to promote His interests, and in love. Pharaoh is not judged because of his hostility against God's people, although he caused them sorrow in failing them when they leaned upon him. He is judged because of his pride, arrogating to himself God's creatures in independency of Him; building himself up in greatness without God. The recurrence of the word "uncircumcised", covering Egypt and other nations, is to remind us that they were marked by unjudged flesh, and hence causing "terror in the land of the living". They had not been owned or supported of God. Hence they together have gone down to the pit, all of them slain, fallen by the sword.
Rem. This arrogance is really against the testimony; whoever it may come through, it is this Egyptian evil.
C.A.M. I suppose one of the evidences of this in the so-called christian world, is that the giving of thanks for one's food is practically dying out.
J.T. I have often thought of that -- God is left out. So much so that one is peculiarly refreshed as he sees one giving thanks to God in public for his food.
A.B.P. The rich man clothed in purple and fine linen living sumptuously every day, is the Egyptian feature.
J.T. Yes. It is just himself; he was not exactly persecuting the poor man, but he was living in his wealth, indifferent as to the poor man's need. Luke makes a good deal of material means affecting men in this way.
{138}
Returning to Ezekiel, attention may be called to chapter 32: "And I will destroy all the beasts thereof, from beside the great waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more, nor shall the cloven hoofs of beasts trouble them. Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah. When I shall make the land of Egypt a desolation, and the country shall be left desolate of all that was in it, when I have smitten all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 32: 13 - 15). God's creation goes back to its purity; to what it was originally. Egypt is dealt with and the waters are made clear. God has in mind that He will reinstate things after He has dealt with these features in the world; after the beasts are destroyed "from beside the great waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more".
H.B. Would the word in @1 Timothy 4: 4, with regard to the creatures of God, fit in: "being received with thanksgiving"?
J.T. That is what God has in mind. He would indicate that His creation is for those who love Him. He is tolerant of these evil influences, but these passages show how He will deal with them, and this is what the judgment of Egypt means. God is indicating here what is in His mind, and insisting upon it; His creatures are to be received "with thanksgiving" by those "who are faithful and know the truth", @1 Timothy 4: 3.
N.P. Would "the goodness of God", in @Romans 2, come in here? The goodness of God in a material sense abounds towards men, and yet the world appropriates it without thanksgiving; whereas the goodness of God should lead men to repentance.
J.T. Quite so; the creation abounds with the evidence of God's goodness, but men have appropriated it, as if it were consistent to use it for their own benefit, and leave God out.
{139}
J.H.E. In the beginning, Egypt was favourable to the people of God, but later she sought to appropriate them for her own good.
J.T. All these nations had opportunity of knowing what was right, but it is the departure that God is dealing with.
A.B.P. Is the sequel of God's ways in government seen in the fact that the nations shall bring their glory to the heavenly city in the day to come?
J.T. Yes. We have already alluded to @Ezekiel 29: 21: "In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I am Jehovah". In the people of God there is fruitfulness, and the liberty to speak, when God has dealt with all these elements.
Ques. Does @Psalm 2 deal with these things? It says that the Lord shall have them in derision, and they are admonished to "Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling" (@Psalm 2: 11).
J.T. Quite so; there, of course, it is the direct attack of the nations on Jehovah and His anointed. Here it is the world of the flesh in its varied phases; in its antagonism against Israel and its usurpation of God's creature benefits, and God is dealing with it. And if that kind of thing is in any of us, there is a voice for *us* in this, too. How prone we are to live to ourselves! The apostle says, "Having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised", @2 Corinthians 5: 14 - 15. These nations had to do with Israel, where the light of God was, and hence they had opportunity to know what was right, but they turned definitely to their own natural desires and ways, and hence His judgments upon them.
{140}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (7)
@Ezekiel 33: 7 - 13, 30 - 33; @Ezekiel 34: 23 - 31; @Ezekiel 36: 24 - 38
J.T. We looked at chapters 25 to 32 last time, and observed that they deal with the nations adjacent to Israel. These are all seen as divinely judged, Egypt being specially mentioned, as representing the world of the flesh, turning the resources of nature to selfish purposes -- causing them to promote man's greatness and pride. The nations being disposed of by the judgment of God, way is made for the chapters before us now. As we apprehend the judgment of God, seen in these details, the ground is cleared for individual faith. Chapter 33 places responsibility on individuals, particularly on watchmen, who would be responsible persons set up in this sense, to warn God's people, from an individual standpoint. Chapter 34 deals with "the shepherds of Israel". It shows how God Himself, in view of the unfaithfulness of the shepherds, becomes their Shepherd and finally appoints a shepherd. "I will set up one shepherd over them" (@Ezekiel 34: 23). So that the saints are viewed as directly under God's care. Chapter 35 deals with mount Seir, or Edom, representing false brethren, and shows that those who are in the position of brethren are in the way, unless they are real. For unless we are real, by taking on the name and the relation of brethren, we are cumbering the ground, and we are sure to persecute those who are real. Then chapter 36 represents God's work *in us*; that is, the fundamental state amongst the people of God, in virtue of His work in each of us, giving us a new spirit, and a new heart, and giving us of His own Spirit.
W.B-w. Do these chapters take up the moral question among the people?
J.T. Yes; first the responsibility of the watchman. Chapter 33 reads, "When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from
{141}
among them all, and set him for their watchman: if he see the sword coming upon the land, and blow the trumpet, and warn the people; then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood is upon him: whereas had he taken warning, he would have delivered his soul. But if the watchman see the sword coming, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, if the sword come and take a person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand" (@Ezekiel 33: 2 - 6). That is the first thing, and it relates to those who are in the position of watchmen, however constituted. And then verse 7 says, "So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel" @Ezekiel 33: 7. Ezekiel was a watchman that God had appointed especially, but first of all, there is given the responsibility of those who were to warn the people of God of impending judgment.
A.R. Those of the house of Chloe were evidently good watchmen, were they not?
J.T. Yes; there were others, too, apparently, who reported the evil. Here the watchman was to warn the people of judgment about to visit the land. In chapter 3 the responsibility of being a watchman was wholly on Ezekiel. Now it appears in a more extended way, as fitting in with the truth unfolded. The clearance of the ground in chapters 25 to 32 makes way for this ministry; that God is now set for the deliverance of His people, first of all on individual lines; but He stresses the responsibility of persons who are in the position of watchmen, to warn them. It makes it very solemn for the whole of christendom, I think, for there are thousands of persons in that position, but what are they doing? And then there is a voice for all of us who have any ability in this public way. Are we being faithful in warning souls?
{142}
A.C. Is the thought of the watchman here somewhat akin to @Isaiah 21:11, the burden of Dumah: "Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?"
J.T. Yes; and the watchman knows what to answer.
A.R. Would you say that Mr. Darby's ministry was like the blowing of the trumpet to warn christendom at large?
J.T. Just so, and all such ministry would be of that character.
A.N.W. This would go beyond the range of what we call gospel preaching, would it not?
J.T. It is not evangelical work that is alluded to, but watchmen's work; as those who watch for souls, as Peter says. It is a question of the saints knowing that God is bringing something to pass. "When I bring the sword upon a land"; that is, we are now at the end of the dispensation, and it is the time of judicial dealings; as with Israel then, so with ourselves now. God is acting judicially; and when He does this in any particular case, then it is the watchman's responsibility to call attention to it. We can see all around us the judicial actings of God in the nations, and watchmen -- whether appointed by the people or by Jehovah -- are responsible to warn them.
A.B.P. Would you distinguish between a watchman and a seer?
J.T. Yes; the word seer is more official, really involving a gift, I think. Of course, Ezekiel was a seer. The word "seer" was at one time applied to prophets, as we learn in the first book of Samuel. They were called seers because they could see, but it involved that they were prophets. A watchman is set up as a lookout for enemies or for anything of an adverse nature, and to warn the people of it; but a seer might bring in what is possible in the way of ministry. With regard to the watchman, it is a question of any one being recognised by the saints in this sense. Even persons in denominations, I think, would be called to account in this way;
{143}
whether the people have made them that (@Ezekiel 33: 2), or their appointment is by God, as in verse 7.
A.N.W. Would the individual withdrawal movement in @2 Timothy 2 be the result of this ministry?
J.T. Yes; that would be one of the results; one judges the evil one is connected with and abandons it. Now verses 21 and 22 read: "And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth of the month, that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten! Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth against his coming to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb" @Ezekiel 33: 21,22. The man was a messenger to report evil. Considerable time had elapsed since the overthrow of Jerusalem, so that it must have taken him a long time to come, but he evidently was a very burdened man who had a heart for the things of God, to take such a journey to bring the tidings to the prophet. But it relieved the prophet, for his mouth had been shut (according to chapter 24), and now it is opened in view of this man's coming. It would show how God acts in these circumstances; how those who feel things may serve -- as the man who brought the tidings; and then how the prophet is released and able to proceed with the ministry; his mouth is opened.
W.B-w. It seems to be a question of death or life in this chapter; death if one does not escape the judgment.
J.T. Yes; it is a very solemn, searching chapter, putting responsibility on individuals; first on the watchmen, and then on the persons warned; each of us is put under responsibility. God says, in verse 11, "As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live" @Ezekiel 33: 11. God is now ready to pardon people and it is a question of each one taking the matter to
{144}
himself. If he has been going on in a course of wickedness, and he turns to God, all his past is overlooked; it is not brought up against him. It is a question of his *present state*. On the other hand, if a man has been going on in righteousness and sins, his righteousness does not count. It is remarkable instruction. What I am doing at the present moment is the point; it is a question of where I am *now*.
C.A.M. Is it in view of the fact that God is going to bring in another order of things? Perhaps it is on the same principle as Noah preaching righteousness, in view of a new world of righteousness being introduced. Righteousness is therefore an all-important matter.
J.T. Yes, and it becomes a question of how each delivers himself; the point is, what I am doing now. God says, in effect, The matter must be settled *now*. If you have been in unrighteous associations or your conduct has been unrighteous, turn to righteousness now, and the matter will be settled. I will not bring up the past against you. On the other hand, if you have been on the ground of practising righteousness and you turn away now, then your righteous acts will not be remembered. It is remarkable instruction.
Ques. To whom does this refer?
J.T. Anyone; primarily it is a question of God's dealings with Israel, but it is of interest to note that the first verse says, "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, speak to the children of thy people" @Ezekiel 33: 1,2, so that the matter was on Ezekiel. It is the people that stand in relation to him. And then God says, "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" (@Ezekiel 33: 11). God says in effect, You can see the line I am on: I am on the line of saving, and the way of salvation is open to all now. Verse 10 shows the people were lethargic, taking up the attitude of despair.
{145}
A.R. Does not verse 14 show that even though the verdict may be already passed, yet, if the sinner repent, grace is shown him? It is remarkable how far God is prepared to go with men.
J.T. Yes; this is a good chapter for evangelical work because it shows the attitude of God; according to the earlier chapters He had cleared the ground through His judgments, and now it is a question of individual faith and self-judgment. This principle always applies, as seen in chapter 18. Governmental wrath on Israel was announced by the Lord (@Luke 21: 22), but Peter could say to his hearers at Jerusalem, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", @Acts 2: 38.
Rem. Verse 13 speaks of a man trusting to his own righteousness and doing what is wrong.
J.T. Yes; trusting to one's righteousness and doing what is wrong often go together. It might be said of someone that he has a good reputation, so that we must make allowance for him. But what is he doing now? "When I say to the righteous that he shall certainly live, and he trusteth to his righteousness and doeth what is wrong, none of his righteous acts shall be remembered; but in his unrighteousness which he hath done, in it shall he die" (@Ezekiel 33: 13). That is a serious position. He may be legalising what is wrong by his past righteousness. God says, about that man, "none of his righteous acts shall be remembered". So that wrong-doing is wrong-doing, whoever the wrong-doer is. God is showing that His ways are equal. Each one is judged "after his ways" (@Ezekiel 33: 20), not for those of his fathers.
W.B-w. Lot was told to escape for his life. He is called a righteous man in Sodom, but had he remained in Sodom, he would have come under the judgment of God.
{146}
J.T. Quite so; his righteousness would not have saved him.
E.E.H. Is the point that we are to *continue* in righteousness?
J.T. That is right; not to depend upon the past. God is dealing with us according to what we are *now*.
E.E.H. Peter, in speaking to Cornelius, remarks, "but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him" (@Acts 10: 35), meaning that he continues in the thing and so is acceptable to God.
J.T. That is right; not he that *has feared* and *has worked* righteousness, but he that *is doing* it.
T.W. What does death in this connection mean amongst the saints?
J.T. It is the governmental dealing of God. "When I bring the sword upon a land". @Ezekiel 33: 2. We are dealing here with externals. The question of the "second death" had not yet quite come into evidence.
Ques. Which is more serious: what we have here, or the wilful sin in @Hebrews 10: 26?
J.T. Sin in the epistle to the Hebrews is always regarded as apostasy; for which there is no forgiveness. What is before us here is what occurred in man living on the earth, and in relation to which God is appealing to him to turn from his unrighteousness. It brings one's moral status on earth up to date. Many of us are merely historical christians; but God says we must be up to date. I mean to say, it is what you are doing *now*. "Blessed are they that wash their robes", @Revelation 22: 14. That means that we are doing it today - and every day.
W.R. Is that where meetings for prophetic ministry are of help to us?
J.T. They help as bringing our conduct to our consciences.
J.T.Jr. Does David's history help us in this connection? He sinned, but he turned from the sin; he
{147}
did not die in it. He went through the thing morally and washed his robes.
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. Does our chapter refer to what is governmental rather than final and eternal judgment?
J.T. Well, we have to go to the New Testament really for the final thing, but it is a most serious matter here. He *dies*, the passage says, in his unrighteousness. "But in his unrighteousness which he hath done, in it shall he die". @Ezekiel 33: 13. I should not like to mitigate that. I think God is pressing upon us, now, this matter of being up to date with Him. I know full well that in the New Testament we are taught that a christian -- one of Christ's sheep -- never perishes (@John 10: 28). Then in @1 Corinthians 11: 30 - 32 it says, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep. But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged. But being judged, we are disciplined of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world". God takes His people away, I believe, in mercy; but how serious it is! In the Old Testament, we are dealing with death and life as here on earth; and of course nothing was more serious than that one should die in his unrighteousness.
T.A. Is that what John means when he speaks about the sin unto death?
J.T. Yes; he would mean death as occurring here -- not the second death. It is governmental.
A.Pf. Ananias and Sapphira died in their sin.
J.T. Yes; the same thing: they were undoubtedly believers, because they got a *burial*. I believe the way the Spirit of God records the fact indicates they were christians, but they died in their sin. Things are clearer in the New Testament. In Ezekiel God is dealing with the public position.
E.T.B. What would you say about Sardis? "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead", @Revelation 3: 1. Would that be the history of Protestantism?
{148}
J.T. That is a *state*; not that thou *shalt* die; but, *art* dead. Death there is not judgment, but a state of death -- no pulsation Godward; no spiritual life. Of Jezebel the Lord says, "her children will I kill with death" @Revelation 2: 23 -- *death* in a moral sense as a penalty.
J.T.Jr. The wicked one turns from his unrighteousness, and then the righteous one turns from his righteousness to wickedness: is that not the point here, that there is a turning one way or another?
J.T. Just so. In either case the turning is regarded as definite. God is establishing the fairness of His ways. He is not here treating of national guilt, but the present state of each person, and how the way of life was open to him. It was truth for the time. The attack was: "The way of the Lord is not equal" (@Ezekiel 33: 17).
A.B.P. Would the attitude of the apostle, when writing to the Philippians, fit in? It says, "if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead. Not that I have already obtained the prize, ... but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, ... I pursue", @Philippians 3: 11 - 13.
J.T. Quite so. He said elsewhere, "I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest after having preached to others I should be myself rejected", @1 Corinthians 9: 27. So that this public matter is most solemn; one is to be up to date with God. It is a most important matter where I stand today at this very moment. If I am shown to be wrong, why not *turn*? The way of adjustment is open. Paul says, "not having my righteousness", @Philippians 3: 9. He sought to have the righteousness of God. @Philippians 3 contemplates a man in the race, and he sees to it, from his own point of view, that he is kept fit and in the race. It is not the point of view of divine counsel here. Peter says, "in your faith have also virtue, in virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in endurance godliness, in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love", @2 Peter 1: 5 - 7. We are thus kept in trim: fruitful, and
{149}
we do not forget that we were purged from our former sins.
We should look at chapter 34 briefly. God has been challenging the watchmen, and now He challenges the shepherds. "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy; and say unto them, unto the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool; ye kill them that are fattened: but ye feed not the flock" (@Ezekiel 34: 1 - 3). It is a solemn matter. Persons who are regarded as shepherds -- who ought to be looking after the saints in a shepherdly spirit, are here arraigned as to how they were fulfilling their responsibility.
C.A.M. Was the last commission to Peter to feed the sheep, due to the Lord anticipating that in the course of time that feature of service would be lacking; particularly at the end?
J.T. Yes; "Feed my lambs", and then, "Shepherd my sheep", and then, "Feed my sheep". The shepherd's commission is given to Peter in John's gospel; in Matthew the Lord had earlier given him the keys of the kingdom of the heavens -- an especial administrative commission, but in view of the need of the last day, shepherding is brought in. Paul regarded the Ephesian elders on the same ground. So that it is a very important service, and what comes out here is that those engaged in it in Israel had failed. The shepherds are spoken to on account of their failure. And so, it is most touching to see that Jehovah undertakes to be Shepherd. It is one of the most touching parts of this chapter. It connects our thoughts immediately with Jesus in John's gospel; how the Lord Himself took on the service in which others failed. "For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, will both search for my sheep, and tend them. As a shepherd tendeth his flock
{150}
in the day that he is among his scattered sheep, so will I tend my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the water-courses, and in all the habitable places of the country. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold, and in a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel. I will myself feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah. I will seek the lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up the broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong: I will feed them with judgment" (@Ezekiel 34: 11 - 16). As I said, that, I think, is one of the most touching things in this book, especially in view of the gospel of John, which corresponds in this respect; that the Lord *does certain things Himself, others having failed* to do them. The synoptic gospels would make matters official in the hands of the disciples, but the Lord does them Himself in John. For instance, *He* feeds the multitude in chapter 6; *He* is the Good Shepherd in chapter 10; *He* finds the colt in chapter 12; so that it seems to me that this fits in with our own times when the shepherds have all failed. The Lord came in Himself and began to seek out His sheep and to bring them back, and He is doing that still. That feature seems to be the point in verse 23 of our chapter: "And I will set up one shepherd over them" @Ezekiel 34: 23. That is, God is referring to the place that Christ has personally. He is called David here -- "even my servant David". A great thought of Christ, according to John's ministry, is seen in allusions to David. @John 10 shows Christ's love for the sheep; the length to which He went, laying down His life for the sheep.
{151}
F.H.L. Would the opening of @John 5 connect with what you have in mind? It says, in regard to the man at the pool, "Jesus says to him" @John 5: 8, and then later "Jesus finds him" @John 5: 14.
J.T. Chapter 9 is much the same. As He passed on the Lord saw the blind man; *He* saw him; His attention is not called to him; He saw him, and the disciples asked, "who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him" (@John 9: 2, 3). That is, the Lord knows His sheep; He knew all about that man, and that man illustrates how the sheep come to light and follow Him; they move in the light. So that as the man in @John 9 is cast out because of his faithfulness to the light, the Lord finds him.
J.T.Jr. Are you connecting the official side with the shepherds in the first part of this chapter; whereas, what the Lord is doing today is connected with what is secret and unofficial?
J.T. Quite so; that is a good way to put it. *He* is carrying on this great work today, and it is most touching, for in @John 10 He says that He lays down His life for the sheep.
A.C. The thought of the shepherd and the commission that Peter had from the Lord so impressed him that he later exhorted the elders to be shepherds over God's flock.
J.T. The commission to feed the sheep was given after Peter was thoroughly restored; that is, the breakdown of the official side is seen in Peter prior to this. He said, "I go to fish", @John 21: 3. The Lord had said to Peter and Andrew that He would make them "fishers of men"; but He does not send Peter to fish here; He sends him to look after sheep, and that is a leading thought in John. He is to feed and shepherd the sheep after he is restored; that is, after the breakdown of the official side and the recovery in this moral way. He is
{152}
not seen as the *apostle* Peter in John; John's gospel does not employ the word "apostle" in that sense. The twelve are usually called "disciples", which is not an official term. The Lord might use any saint to feed the lambs and the sheep today, but behind the service lies the great thought that He is doing it. The verse we have read says, "I will set up one shepherd over them" @Ezekiel 34: 23.
C.A.M. In using the title "chief Shepherd", Peter would show that he had been impressed with the personal service of Christ to which we have been alluding.
A.R. Would you say that His washing of the disciples feet in @John 13 is the evidence of the personal care of the Shepherd for the sheep?
J.T. Just so; it shows what Jesus is *Himself* in John's gospel and how we are brought into that. John's reference to himself in the book of Revelation would show how fully he was in accord with that: "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus" @Revelation 1: 9.
W.B-w. Do not both sides of the truth go on today? You have referred to Jesus finding the colt in John and sending someone else for it in Matthew. Do not both sides work out today?
J.T. Quite so; we never can assume that Matthew's side is abrogated by John's. The whole truth of God stands. But because of the great failure of the public body, the Person of Christ is stressed; the Lord is helping us in that today, and particularly in John's gospel. It is a question of the Person of Christ; who and what He is. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", @John 1:1. That is what He is personally. And then we have what He became: He became flesh, and came down so low as to wash the saints¬ feet; to find the colt; to feed the multitude; that is what is so touching; and the commission to Peter to care for His sheep, I believe, carries all that with it. Then there is John, too. Peter
{153}
says, "Lord, and what of this man?" @John 21: 21. The Lord says, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me" (@John 21: 22). It is what He has in reserve in John, as has often been said; and I believe it is to bring out these great truths that apply to these last days, how the Lord is doing the things Himself; and how it is a question of being in accord with Him, and John *is* in accord with Him, according to Revelation.
W.B-w. Does it mean that if the saints who are sent to bring in the colt do not do it, the Lord will do it Himself?
J.T. That is the thought; He Himself finds the colt, according to @John 12, and sits upon it; and He is doing it all the time -- finding young brothers and sisters for His service. Any of us may be brought into it, but *He* is doing it.
F.N.W. Is it significant that the Lord refers to Himself as "I" seven times in @Revelation 22?
J.T. Yes; it is peculiarly a book of personalities, so that John introduces himself as "I, John", and soon. In the gospel he does not refer to himself in a personal way; it is, "the disciple whom Jesus loved", or, "the other disciple", and so on. But in the book of Revelation we have the personality -- "John", and "I, John". Personality is in mind. This is seen also in verse 23 of our chapter. "And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David". @Ezekiel 34: 23. It is a question of personality now; "he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I Jehovah will be their God, and my servant David a prince in their midst: I Jehovah have spoken it. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell in safety in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing"
{154}
(@Ezekiel 34: 24 - 26). And then it says in verse 29, "And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the ignominy of the nations any more. And they shall know that I Jehovah their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah. And ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men: I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 34: 29 - 31). Can anything be more touching than that? It covers the present moment -- particularly so. God has wrought to bring His people back to Himself, and He is developing this thought of personality; David, the outstanding personality of the Old Testament, being introduced to give character to it. Jesus is the Root of David. In addressing Himself to the assemblies He says, "*I* Jesus ... *I* am the root and offspring of David", @Revelation 22: 16. So it is a question of personality in that sense, rather than what is official.
J.T.Jr. Is there the need of being grounded in John's ministry as to the Person of Christ before we can take up active service as in Matthew, where He is seen as the Offspring of David?
J.T. Yes. It is a question of what one is. John, in his gospel, is out of sight. He does not advance his name at all; it is the "disciple whom Jesus loved". It is that one who is attractive to Jesus.
W.B-w. Jehovah sets David over the flock which He Himself has found. Does that mean that He is carrying things out administratively at the present time?
J.T. I think so. What is coming to light at the present time is Davidic in character. The prophetic word teaches that David rules in Israel in the future; that is, Christ in Davidic character comes in before He is known publicly in Solomonic character. In relation to the assembly, as in the book of Revelation, He is seen as connected with David. His attractiveness is in mind. The history of David brings out attractiveness; his name means "beloved"; so that the man who gives
{155}
account of him to Saul says, He is "skilled in playing, and he is a valiant man and a man of war, and skilled in speech, and of good presence", @1 Samuel 16: 18. I believe that the Lord at present is ministering to us the Davidic character -- as "the sweet psalmist of Israel", developing the service of God. Presently He will act against His enemies. They will attack Him after the assembly is gone. He will take up a peculiar place amongst His suffering people, and in military power and prowess, so that He defeats all His enemies before He reigns as Solomon. We are in a wonderful time now; we are in David's time, so to say; that is, from the standpoint of *the service of God*, presently it will be from a military standpoint, as in relation to Israel. What I think is meant in the Lord saying, "*I* am the root and offspring of David", is spiritual *quality*, the service of God being in view.
A.N.W. That is very beautiful, and must explain the occasion of the bridal revival, for there immediately follows the word, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come" @Revelation 22: 17.
J.T. It does. It explains all that has been going on in these last one hundred years, referring to Christ as "the root and offspring of David" @Revelation 22: 16. He does not refer to Solomon, but to David; and then He says, "the bright and morning star", which links on with the incoming day.
W.B-w. What is the force of David being prince in their midst? He set him over the flock. And it says in verse 24, "and my servant David a prince in their midst".
J.T. Well, "prince" in such a connection is personality. "King" suggests what is official.
A.P.B. The words of Paul to the elders of Ephesus seem to cover the scope of what we have before us. He refers to being free from their blood, like the faithful watchman, having spoken to them of the whole counsel of God; he refers to their shepherdly responsibility,
{156}
calling upon them to watch, and warns them of what is about to come in, and then finishes up with the personality of our Lord Jesus Christ. "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said ...", @Acts 20: 35.
C.A.M. As to personality connected with a prince, I suppose in a prince there is ability for kingship if it is needed.
J.T. Quite so.
Chapter 35 reminds us of the sorrowful side of our position -- referring to Edom, the false brother and the appeal to us to be true. A true brother is born for adversity, which is the direct opposite to Edom; the brother who is characteristically adverse, as we have here: "Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword, in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end" (@Ezekiel 35: 5). Edom from his very birth was to be set aside, with the final result that God said, "I hated Esau", @Malachi 1: 3. The first epistle of John helps us as regards the true and false brother. We are to be like David; that is, like Christ as seen in David, we are to lay down our lives for the brethren. Today there are imitations of what is characteristic of brethren. There is no opposition more specious than imitation of what is of God.
W.B-w. In chapter 25 the Philistines are said to have an "old hatred"; and in this chapter Edom is said to have had a "perpetual hatred".
J.T. Is that not sorrowful? The word used has both senses; although "old", the hatred has not ceased; it is kept up. It is bad enough to have an old one, but in a perpetual one there is no relenting at all, so that it runs on to the end of the Old Testament and then it appears in the New Testament in the Herods.
A.R. The greatest opposition against the truth at the present time comes from so-called brethren; it is such that are specially opposing perpetually.
{157}
J.T. Well, the final word in the section we are considering is in chapter 36. One can see the force of it, that after the false brother is exposed and dealt with, there is now liberty for the work of God to go on; in fact, the end of chapter 35 seems to make way for chapter 36. "As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolated, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be a desolation, O mount Seir, and all Edom, the whole of it: and they shall know that I am Jehovah" @Ezekiel 35: 15. And then in @Ezekiel 36: 1, "And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah". Edom had its mountains, but the mountains of Israel are referred to now -- the spiritually elevated places of the saints are in view in chapter 36.
W.B-w. Was it right of Jacob, when going to meet his brother, to appease him with a present?
J.T. It was a right attitude; but it is remarkable that in @Genesis 33: 7 Joseph is mentioned before his mother as they came before Esau. Jacob in presenting his family before Esau presents what is of God in his family to his brother -- one after another, and in the midst of them is Joseph, put before his mother; that is, Christ has His place among the true brethren. Joseph is not merely Rachel's son; he is put before Rachel, as the Lord Jesus in John's gospel is put before His mother. The Lord calls His mother "Woman" in John's gospel. It is a question of the greatness of Christ, and that is what God is doing today; He is bringing in the greatness of Christ. He was *not* 'begotten before the worlds' by the Father. That is derogatory to Christ. That is what the creed says, but the truth is that Christ is a divine Person; He is Himself God: "the Word was God". He has taken the place of sonship here to carry out the counsels of God, but personally He is God, and that in type is what is seen in @Genesis 33. Joseph is put before Rachel in the presence of Esau. Did Esau understand? I do not think he did, nor do I think the
{158}
so-called "brethren" abroad who are persecuting today, understand the greatness of Christ in what He is bringing before us.
C.A.M. It is very evident they do not understand John's gospel. We can read Matthew's gospel more intelligently when we understand John's gospel.
J.T. I believe John is the first of the gospels to read. We ought to begin with Paul in the epistles, but John, I believe, is the first gospel to read *now*.
W.B-w. You mean that Joseph being put before his mother in the presence of Esau would meet the perpetual hatred?
J.T. Yes, if Esau understood. If you can get the brethren to see Christ they will be helped. If a brother is genuine he will listen as you bring John's gospel before him. You begin with the Person of Christ -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", @John 1: 1. If a man does not go with that, he is disqualified; but every genuine brother will go with it.
C.A.M. You can see that brethren who do not understand eternal life as brought before the saints many years ago, cannot understand what the Lord is setting before us today.
J.T. No; in what has been mentioned as to @Genesis 33, there was the opportunity for Esau. He might stop and say, Why is that child before his mother? But there is no suggestion that Esau made any inquiry about it at all. We are freed of the false brother in @Ezekiel 35; he has been dealt with, and then God turns to what He will do for His people in their mountains; for a point of importance with Edom is his mountains. Esau's territory was a place of mountains, but then God says, Israel has mountains, too. Think of the mount of transfiguration, for instance. In keeping with this, what comes in in chapter 36 is the work of God. That is the next thing -- what God does *in* us. He says, "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye
{159}
shall be clean. ... I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you ... and I will put my Spirit within you" (@Ezekiel 36: 25 - 27). That is all according to the teaching of John's gospel.
J.H.E. The woman in @John 4 said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain" (verse 20), which was but dark national sentiment, but the Lord would clear her mind as to it.
J.T. Quite so. The verses read in chapter 36 require special attention; verse 24 begins, "And I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances, and ye shall do them. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God" (@Ezekiel 36: 24 - 28). We are on the line of purpose now; these features being there, God is not ashamed to be called their God, nor to call them His people.
J.T.Jr. Is the water ignored in a general way amongst christians? That is why John makes so much of the water and the Spirit; and then in his epistle, it is the water and the blood.
J.T. His ministry would make us inwardly and outwardly according to God, so that God is not ashamed to be our God and to call us His people. The Lord says, "my brethren ... my Father and your Father ... my God and your God".
C.A.M. In that way this prophet seems to be a sort of advance on Jeremiah. The latter speaks of the new covenant, but Ezekiel speaks of the Spirit given.
{160}
J.T. Yes; undoubtedly this is the chapter the Lord spoke of in His talk with Nicodemus; it is a most important chapter.
W.B-w. It ends with the cities being "filled with flocks of men" (@Ezekiel 36: 38). Does the use of the word "men" suggest the development of intelligence?
J.T. It is very beautiful; we can have no doubt as to what these figures of shepherds and sheep mean; it is a question of men. We have "the holy flock" in verse 38; and, as has been quoted, "flocks of men". The Lord says, "the men whom thou gavest me", @John 17: 6. That is the thought of development. We are no longer babes; it is *men* that God has in mind.
A.B.P. The thought of sprinkling would suggest a limited quantity of water. The quantity of water in the wash-hand basin in @John 13 would be limited, but the quality is equal to the Red Sea.
J.T. Quite so. It is in a basin that could be carried around; a portable one; that is, *love* is seen in it more than the Red Sea. It is *power* in the Red Sea.
Ques. Had you in mind to refer back to chapter 33 before we close?
J.T. Yes; just to the word at the end. "And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people keep talking of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah. And they come unto thee as a people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their dishonest gain. And behold, thou art unto them as a lovely song, a pleasant voice, and one that playeth well on an instrument; and they hear thy words, but they do them not. And when this cometh to pass (behold, it will come), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them" (@Ezekiel 33:30 - 33). I thought we might have these verses
{161}
before us in closing; how we may sit and listen to what is of God and yet be unaffected by it. It is that kind of thing that these verses refer to, and they often apply at our meetings.
J.H.E. It would be like the Lord saying to Israel, "We have piped to you, and ye have not danced", @Matthew 11: 17.
A.R. After a meeting like this there should be a change in us.
J.T. That is the way it should affect us; not simply to say, It was a good meeting; but, What have I received in my soul, and am I moving in relation to it?
Rem. The prophet evidently discerned that the people were in this state and he prophesied accordingly.
J.T. Quite so; God saw they were in that state. He took account of the prophet, too; for it was a word for the prophet, to comfort him, I suppose.
{162}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (8)
@Ezekiel 37: 1 - 28; @Ezekiel 39: 11 - 16
J.T. In our previous readings we have been mainly occupied with the judgment of God on Israel, and Jerusalem in particular, and then on certain nations in proximity to Israel; that is, we have traced a judicial course of dealings from God. At our last reading we touched on chapter 36, in which is begun what may be termed the constructive work of God in the book. It is God's way, in His dealings, whether with nations or individuals, to first pull down and then to build up. The book from chapter 36 onward mainly presents the constructive work of God, with a view to the final settlement of His people Israel in their own land, and the procurement of His dwelling place, or sanctuary, amongst them. Chapter 36, as we have seen, speaks of cleansing, and of God's proposal to give His people a new heart and a new spirit, and to give them His own Spirit, speaking of new birth. Chapter 37 continues on constructive lines and deals with resurrection; then the judgment of God in chapters 38 and 39; and following on that, the subject of the house, which will engage us at our next reading. What we have observed in regard to chapter 36 should be kept in mind as we consider chapter 37; particularly the thought of cleansing: "And I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you" (@Ezekiel 36: 24, 25). New birth carries with it not only the thought of "spirit", but cleansing.
W.R. @John 3: 5 says: "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God".
{163}
J.T. It was no doubt chapter 36 to which the Lord alluded when He spoke to Nicodemus about new birth; being born not only of the Spirit, but of water. Chapter 37 is more than new birth, but developing from it; it is life in a complete sense, of which new birth is the initial thought. First we have the figure of the bones, which came together and were covered with sinews, flesh and skin and then breathed upon, made to live and to stand upon their feet. So that these chapters are clearly constructive with a view to God having His people in resurrection in a national sense, in their own land, that He might dwell amongst them, as He says at the end of chapter 37. "I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. And my tabernacle shall be over them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I Jehovah do hallow Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever" (@Ezekiel 37: 26 - 28).
W.B-w. Would the expressions "new heart" and ''new spirit'' refer to new birth?
J.T. I think that the Lord, in speaking to Nicodemus, alluded to this -- first the cleansing, as seen in the water, and then the positive element; that is, a new heart and a new spirit. It is in principle a change of man.
A.N.W. It does not quite say that they shall live, in chapter 36. I notice you spoke of new birth, with a view to life.
J.T. Yes; whilst the cleansing can only be by the death of Christ, it is not the whole feature of redemption. The blood, which is not mentioned, is also necessary. We need the blood for completing the thought of redemption, and then the thought of life comes in in chapter 37. Life contemplates the whole person; the whole man. Chapter 36 lays the basis for the new man -- "a new heart" and "a new spirit" in the cleansing,
{164}
but there is more than that; there is the idea of bone coming to bone.
C.A.M. The thought is not complete until we get the body. Resurrection includes the body.
J.T. It does in chapter 37. That is what is in mind in the figure used, Of course it goes on to the whole house of Israel, but there is the idea of the body in bone coming to bone and the other details given. Life is primarily in view. It says, "And he said unto me, Son of man, Shall these bones live? And I said, Lord Jehovah, thou knowest. And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live" (@Ezekiel 37: 3 - 5). Life does not actually take place until bone comes to bone with sinews and flesh and skin. Then the life comes, for it says in verse 8: "And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them" @Ezekiel 37: 8. There is the whole body, with its constituent parts, and Jehovah's word that they should live, but as yet there is no life; "there was no breath in them". That is the main thought in life here.
F.H.C. Why is there no mention of blood in relation to the body in verses 5 and 6?
J.T. From another point of view, the blood is life, but that is not mentioned here; it is rather the thought of breath. Of course, in the life that we shall have in resurrection, there will be no blood. The humanity which God has in mind as answering to His purpose, is not blood and flesh, but that which Christ has now. He said: "Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having", @Luke 24: 39. Our eternal condition will be like Christ's -- not flesh and blood, but flesh and bones; a new condition altogether, and the Spirit, as given, agrees with that. It says here, "there was no breath in them", which, according to
{165}
the footnote to verse 5, would be "spirit"; it is not said that there was no *blood* in them. The Spirit carries the idea of eternal life, so the Lord breathed into His disciples the breath of life (@John 20: 22).
F.H.L. @John 5 speaks of resurrection and quickening. Is that suggested here?
J.T. I think so. Christ quickens and raises. "The Father raises the dead and quickens them, thus the Son also quickens whom he will". @John 5: 21.
A.R. Will you say something more about the thought of prophesying over the bones? They are affected by prophecy, and then Ezekiel also prophesies to the wind. It is a rare thought.
J.T. We have to view the whole scene as symbolic, but still we get the main thought of life, what is in the mind of God, whether for His earthly people or His heavenly people.
It is said in verse 1: "The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of a valley" @Ezekiel 37: 1. That is the first thing to notice -- it is "in the midst of a valley". If we are to get a true idea of anything, God will put us into the circumstances surrounding it. We may talk about death and resurrection in a mere academic way and never touch the thing itself in our souls; so that the prophet is taken by God, as he says, "and set ... down in the midst of a valley". It is necessary to get into the circumstances in which the thing to be understood is set out or displayed. This was a valley "full of bones". Verse 2 says, "And he caused me to pass by them round about; and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry" @Ezekiel 37: 2; that is, one is to get the full view of what is to be dealt with; whether it be himself or others, and to see how God operates. I do not speak in a theoretical way when I get this view; I see, in a practical way, how the matter stands. It is a figure, and suggests the place of death, by the condition of these bones; and the question is,
{166}
"Shall these bones live?" @Ezekiel 37: 3. Jehovah does not tell the prophet they are dry bones. He sees that they are dry. As brought into the circumstances, I name the thing as it is. That is where I think we ought to begin: to name what we see from the position in which God places us. He has placed us where we can see the thing as it is.
R.W.S. Is there a certain urgency about it? It is not the *word* of Jehovah, but the *hand* of Jehovah upon him.
J.T. Just so; God seems to be taking on this service Himself, so that His servant should get a full intelligent view of the matter, and so He allows him to name what he sees. He says, "And behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry" (@Ezekiel 37: 2). He is able to examine them and name the condition. There is to be another condition, but it is well to name the condition that exists.
C.H.H. That is what Nehemiah saw when he went out by the valley gate (@Nehemiah 2:13).
J.T. That is a good passage to bring forward here. He came to Jerusalem, and he remained there three days; indicating that he had a composed state of mind in view of what he had to do. God would bring us round carefully to a right view of things that our minds might be restful; and we are brought into the circumstances with which we have to do. Nehemiah had been three days in Jerusalem, and then he went out by night to make a survey of the conditions. He tells us in detail what he did. So it is like the circumstances in our scripture. God would place us in the circumstances that enter into the subject on hand, and would let us look around and name what we see. Are we able to do it, or are we merely dealing with things theoretically? If it be only this, we shall never arrive at the spiritual thought.
J.H.E. Was that the trouble with the Sadducees? The Lord says, "Ye err, not knowing the scriptures nor
{167}
the power of God", @Matthew 22: 29. "God is not God of the dead, but of the living" (@Matthew 22: 32).
J.T. That is what comes out in the gospels in a general way. The Lord was constantly speaking about current conditions in Israel, and anyone who sought to get a right view would listen to Him. So His disciples, as with Him, got a right view of things, as did Elisha by being with Elijah in the different points which he visited before he was taken up to heaven.
Rem. Nicodemus knew the Scriptures theoretically, but not concretely.
J.T. I am sure that is right. He was a sincere man, but had not a right judgment of things; hence, the Lord has to put it to him: "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!" @John 3: 10. He had never been in the valley to see how dry the bones were. At God's direction Ezekiel goes into the valley. He takes him there, and then, "he caused me to pass by them round about", and then, without God saying anything to him, he says, "and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry" (@Ezekiel 37: 2). He could name the *condition*. And that is what marked the Lord here below. He was in the midst of the condition and named it. The gospels are largely taken up with telling us how He named things; and then He changed the condition by dying.
W.R. Is not Jeremiah's career at the outset marked by this insight? He says in chapter 1: "And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree. And Jehovah said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watchful over my word to perform it. And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething-pot, and its face is from the north" (@Jeremiah 1: 11 - 13).
J.T. That is good. You get it constantly in Scripture, and more particularly in the Lord's ministry, because *everything* was then under review. The Lord
{168}
came into the position. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" (@John 1: 14); He was not at a distance, but amongst the people, and saw things just as they were and named them. The great burden was to bring the true state of everything into evidence; to name it, and then to deal with it sacrificially. The Lord did that.
Ques. Is this prophecy to be considered in two sections, the first of which relates to bringing the dry bones together?
J.T. Yes. It runs on to the end of verse 14, and then we have another part relative to unity.
A.F.M. This chapter refers to breath and to wind. Are the thoughts combined?
J.T. In the original here the word is the same for breath and wind. The word is, first of all, "Shall these bones live?" Ezekiel said, "Lord Jehovah, thou knowest". And then, "Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live" (@Ezekiel 37: 3 - 5). The proper name of wind when it is operating in the lungs, is breath. We have to notice here that it is not simply prophesying *about* the bones now, but *to* them. The ministry is to them; so that they are symbolic of a condition amongst God's people. The bones are really God's people, and the figure used indicates a condition in them under certain circumstances; hence, the prophecy is not about them, but to them, as I said. So he says, "and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a rustling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them" (@Ezekiel 37: 7, 8). It is now a matter of "breath", the word covering life in us by wind or air, which operates in the lungs. Although there was actual formation, there was no breath; and as has been remarked, blood
{169}
is not mentioned. It is not the state of man in blood and flesh that is in mind; it is in principle the state contemplated in the Lord's breathing into His disciples. As applied at the present time, that is what is in mind. And then he is told to prophesy unto the wind: "Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath" (@Ezekiel 37: 9). It is the wind, active in the lungs, that God has in mind; that is, life in the sense of spirit. The Spirit is life.
E.E.H. How would you differentiate between the life that we get in Genesis, and the breath we are speaking of here?
J.T. It is the same idea. God breathed into Adam's nostrils. He must have used the ordinary atmosphere; but then, think of *God* doing that. We can only accept the fact that God did it; that He breathed into his nostrils and Adam became a *living* soul by that procedure.
R.W.S. Would you say something more about these bones: they are made much of in this scripture.
J.T. They are figurative of Israel, of course; "these bones are the whole house of Israel" (@Ezekiel 37: 11). They are symbolic of the state of Israel; a dry condition amongst the people of God; but then, applying the thought to an individual, it is a question of arriving at his individuality. The epistle to the Romans teaches us how one arrives at his individuality; that is, *"I myself"* @Romans 7:25. The whole man is there before you get the idea of life in him. The writer arrived at the whole thought -- *"I myself"* -- in the end of chapter 7; and then in chapter 8, there is a state of life; life developed in him.
C.A.M. In @John 3 we have the thought of wind; in @John 4 the idea of water, and if I understand rightly, what is before us now is the idea of the wind in the upper part of the body -- the lungs.
J.T. The lower affections are in view in the water, as a figure of the Spirit, in chapter 4, but in the upper,
{170}
the wind or breath represents the Spirit; only @John 3 does not say the believer gets the Spirit, it is rather the effect of the operation of the Spirit in him. "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God", @John 3: 3.
C.A.M. You were referring to @John 20, to the Lord breathing into His disciples; but does it not seem that there is a sort of intimation in chapter 3 as to what was coming finally?
J.T. There is; "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" @John 3: 6. That is the principle of the believer's being. The water does not produce what is positive. It does not say, Whatever is born of *water* is water. There is no positive thing produced by water; it is negative, as you might say. The Spirit brings in what is positive; new birth by the Spirit is a positive thing. It is *spirit*, the passage says; not *Holy Spirit*, but rather what corresponds to what we have in @Ezekiel 36: 26. "And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you". In addition to that, redemption makes way for the reception of God's Holy Spirit; so chapter 36 also says, "And I will put my Spirit within you" (@Ezekiel 36: 27). That contemplates redemption.
A.N.W. When the Lord speaks of the wind blowing where it will, has He not the sovereignty of the Spirit in mind?
J.T. Yes; the wind is a symbol of the Spirit; indeed, it is the same word. The wind blowing is the inscrutable working of the Spirit in man; "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes", @John 3: 8. That is very much like what we get in @Ezekiel 37, only it does not imply the Spirit given to the believer: "Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live" (@Ezekiel 37: 9). The winds are prophesied to. So that it is undoubtedly
{171}
the divine operation that is in view. But chapter 37 is more than new birth. It is that the Spirit of God is within them, symbolised in the winds.
A.B.P. Would you say new birth disregards past history, whereas resurrection embraces it?
J.T. Well, it deals with a condition of past history, the condition of the dryness of the bones, and they are going to be changed. Bone is coming to bone, and sinews and flesh and skin coming on, so that you have a body in result. Past history is really obliterated. The identity, of course, goes through, but as regards past history it is, in principle at least, obliterated, because it runs into this: "Behold all things have become new: and all things are of ... God", @2 Corinthians 5: 17,18.
The inner organs are not mentioned here. It is just the general idea of a body -- a person. We do not get the inwards at all -- the lungs and reins which operate automatically inside -- but they are assumed to be there; otherwise the wind would not become breath. It is in the lungs that the wind becomes breath.
J.T.Jr. Would you connect @1 Corinthians 15 with this subject? It tells us that the body is sown a natural body and raised a spiritual body.
J.T. That chapter treats of the resurrection of believers in a literal, physical sense; what is before us now, as already said, is the resurrection of Israel in a collective or national sense. The application of this passage today therefore can only be in a moral and spiritual sense; it may be used profitably in relation to christians in whom there is little or no life or spiritual freshness. Help may come in through prophecy. That could not refer to literal death and resurrection. The Lord does not prophesy to those in their graves. They hear His voice and come forth. The use of prophecy here would show that these dry bones are symbolic of a condition among God's earthly people, and, as intimated, amongst ourselves at times.
{172}
A.R. I was wondering if we could say that prophecy amongst us today brings about a condition of life and freshness. Our prophetic meetings have this view.
J.T. Yes. We may find gatherings which are "dry", like this symbol suggests. You come to a given place, look around at the brethren, and you may be obliged to say, There is a very barren state of things here; although there is the breaking of bread, the condition is not right. What this chapter presents would cover circumstances of that kind.
Rem. The woman in @John 4 seems to be an apt illustration of what you are saying. She perceived that Christ was a prophet, and life began to come into evidence as the result of the searching words He used to get at her condition.
J.T. Yes. But primarily this is "the whole house of Israel". It is not literal death that is in mind. It is symbolical of their actual national condition; and as we were saying, we might find that state among brethren in many localities, and what is needed is prophetic ministry.
Ques. Would the condition at Corinth be similar in a sense -- the apostle Paul being one who looked around?
J.T. Yes; he discerned what was there, and stressed the necessity for prophecy.
F.H.C. Is there a parallel thought between what comes out here and @Acts 2: 2, where we get the "violent impetuous blowing"? It is explained: "this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel", @Acts 2:16.
J.T. Yes; that was the gift of the Spirit; the Spirit from heaven, for testimony here. It brought about living conditions amongst the saints, too. This is strikingly a symbol of dry conditions among the people of God.
F.S.C. Should a prophet understand the condition in a locality before he prophesies?
{173}
J.T. Yes. We were remarking about Nehemiah. He stayed in Jerusalem three days before he did anything, and then he went out by night and viewed the walls of Jerusalem. We should notice how God brings a servant into accord with His mind in placing him in the conditions that have to be dealt with, and then He indicates what He is going to do. He questions him as to whether these bones can live, and the prophet replied, "Thou knowest"; and then Jehovah directed him to prophesy. There was to be prophesying to the bones, and then to the wind. The mind of God appears in the power of prophecy so that the divine results are reached. Ezekiel says, "And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army" (@Ezekiel 37: 10). That is the result. They are acting themselves now. *They* stand up on their feet, "an exceeding great army".
Now having reached that point, we shall have to go on to the second half of the chapter which involves unity in the hand of Christ, that all these living persons gravitate towards each other and become one stick in the hand of Christ. That is the next lesson; how God will bring about unity in His earthly people; first, by bringing in a living state of things, and then unity in the hand of Christ.
Ques. There is a good deal of service today, and it is increasing, perhaps, but do you not think that if there is to be any result for God, the servants must be in the good of life themselves as Ezekiel was?
J.T. Exactly; being themselves in a place where they can form a judgment of what they have to deal with. That is what the prophet comes to here. He forms a judgment of what he must deal with, and then he prophesies, and the result is an army standing upon its feet. It does not say that they were told to stand up. They are acting of *themselves* now. Self-action is a well-known feature of life. They do what they should
{174}
do. Then the next thing is unity. "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel, his companions. And take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions. And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand" (@Ezekiel 37: 15 - 17). If you get the saints living, there will be self-action; it is expressed in the operation of the Spirit as living water, according to @John 4, and as this exists there will be unity in the hand of Christ. Thus He can use us as in assembly.
J.H.E. So the one who ministers, as remarked, must be in the good of the thing. Ezekiel and Nehemiah are examples.
J.T. Yes. The result -- unity -- is reached, as indicated in the two sticks becoming one, and then there is a place for the sanctuary; that is the order in which the truth operates. The prophet first forms a judgment, he prophesies, and then he has two sticks denoting all Israel, and they are one in his hand. God uses them in unity, and then we get David as their king (verse 24). We have already had it before us that Christ is to reign as David, but then He is to be known in the last days of the assembly's history as David, too, which no doubt alludes to the sanctuary -- the service of God -- which is going on now; for the Davidic character of Christ's ministry at the end of the dispensation is clearly going on now. "These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open", @Revelation 3: 7. So the unity here is marked by "David my servant". He is seen as king, and shepherd, and prince. We have already noticed this in chapter 34, but now Christ is seen typically, in a living state of things as "David my servant"; and He is King, and Shepherd, and Prince in this chapter as in chapter 34; hence the sanctuary is brought in. So the end of the
{175}
chapter says, "And I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. And my tabernacle shall be over them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I Jehovah do hallow Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever" (@Ezekiel 37: 26 - 28). I think what we have outlined is the teaching of this chapter. I believe it corresponds to what is going on at the present time. We shall have David ruling in Israel presently in a military way, but He is now operating in the assembly in relation to the service of God, which is the great feature of David.
A.F.M. Would that bring in the body according to 1 Corinthians? What is the difference between a stick and a rod? There are rods brought to Aaron earlier in the history of Israel; here it is a stick -- one stick.
J.T. "Stick" is more ordinary than the rod or staff used by Moses and Aaron. "Take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel, his companions. And take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph" (@Ezekiel 37: 16). It is material, wood, that can be written on, but it is in the hand as a stick. It is here symbolic of what, as in his hand, may be used for the expression of his will or thought. I believe the point to all this is being in the hand of Christ, in unity, for the service that He has in mind at any time.
Rem. The prophetic word comes first, and then the functioning of the assembly, in the latter part of the chapter.
J.T. I think we see from the passage that life takes place -- there is self-action -- they stand up on their feet. They are in liberty, we may say. Sonship, as applied, would enter into this in a practical way. And now we are in the hand of a Person who uses us for His own will or pleasure. That is the idea of the sticks, I think; they represent both houses of Israel. They are both in one hand; no more in a divided condition, but at the will of another. And then the sanctuary is
{176}
mentioned. It is very beautiful to see the function of David here. He is called "my servant", and he is king, and shepherd, and prince. As prince, I think personality is in mind, so that God might be known and have a sanctuary, and the nations should know that He hallows Israel. All this is in mind in God's disciplinary ways with His people.
F.S.C. Would you tell us the difference between the everlasting covenant here, and the new covenant in @Jeremiah 31?
J.T. The new covenant is with the house of Israel and Judah and would enter into this. The thought of *newness* is stressed there, the first being made old and abrogated: in the new covenant God began afresh with His people. The everlasting covenant implies permanency: it goes right through.
F.S.C. Is @Hebrews 13 the same thought?
J.T. That is right; the word "everlasting" would be that it goes through; it is not temporary. It marked God's covenants with Noah, Abraham, David, and (involving the new covenant) Israel. A covenant thus presented depends wholly on God Himself.
A.B.P. Does the word, "Let everything that hath breath praise Jah", @Psalm 150: 6, suggest unity and self-action?
J.T. Yes; the service of God requires persons in life and liberty. We are made to *live* in sonship. And, as seen here, we are in the hand of Christ. That is what you get in the second part of the chapter, where, as said, we have David the king, David the shepherd, and David the prince. So we have a sanctuary in full testimony to God (verse 28).
A.N.W. Would you say a word about the element of inquiry suggested in verse 18? "And when the children of my people speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not declare unto us what thou meanest by these?" @Ezekiel 37: 18. Would you think that in reaching the high level of
{177}
which we have been speaking, there was that incitement of inquiry, even before the prophetic word is given?
J.T. Quite so; the idea of inquiry runs right through. It indicates intelligence -- that we are thoughtful -- that we are not inert. Even the prophet here is inquired of by Jehovah, "Shall these bones live?" Thus He brings us into what He is unfolding, and normally the believer wants to know. It is a mark of intelligence when in this respect there is inquiry.
W.B-w. The prophet is called upon here to join them one to another. How does that work out today? Does the prophetic ministry come in to join one to another?
J.T. "Join them one to another into one stick" would be the Lord's action. It is the prophet, as a type; but he merges into the idea of Christ in David. The Lord is constantly seeking to bring us into unity.
W.B-w. Is it not through the prophetic ministry that it is being worked out?
J.T. Where the prophetic ministry is introduced, at the end of @1 Corinthians 12 we have, "But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet show I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence" (@1 Corinthians 12: 31); that is, before you have the effect of the gift of prophecy, you must have love. So that the way of "surpassing excellence" is the working out of love in chapter 13, and that has in mind the making of one stick, as seen here. How can we be joined one to another and made one, save as we love one another? We are of the same material; there is cohesion amongst us when love is operative and no foreign element is allowed place.
W.B-w. This would be in advance of "an exceeding great army". Joining one to another is the principle of Levi, is it not?
J.T. Quite so; Levi means "joined".
J.T.Jr. Would that be seen in Peter and John in Acts at the Beautiful gate? The thought of unity is in those two men, and the result of their ministry is really the sanctuary.
{178}
J.T. That brings up another important point: the insertion of the word "assembly" at the end of @Acts 2 is disputed, and no doubt rightly. It is probably "the Lord added together", in verse 47. It is the Lord doing it -- adding daily "those that were to be saved"; and then Peter and John going up to the temple said, "Look on us". It is a beautiful result that they are joined in holy love. There can be no true joining except in love.
Ques. If the summit is now reached in this chapter, what is the import of Gog and Magog?
J.T. Well, that is the next thing to observe. We must first reach the great position of chapter 37, which can only be entered into on the principle of life and unity and the service of God in the sanctuary. Gog is perhaps the most powerful enemy that comes against Israel, according to the description of him, but the point in these chapters is to show that God brings him up against His people to destroy him and to show in him His power on behalf of His people; so that the greatest display of opposition is ordered of God to manifest how much He loves His people. He says, in effect, I brought you up for that purpose. He is behind this great combination under Gog as He was behind the existence of Pharaoh. "And for this very cause have I raised thee up, to shew thee my power", @Exodus 9: 16. The greatest opposition of power against the people of God, as represented in Gog and Magog and Persia, Cush, Phut, Gomer, and the house of Togarmah only becomes the means with God of showing His power, and that He loves His people. That is the lesson in chapters 38 and 39. God says in effect to them, You are going up to the land that had been uninhabited because I had to deal with My people. Now the inhabitants have come back to it, and you think they are defenceless and you are coming up to take a spoil, and I am going to show you what I think of them by what I will do with you. So God destroys this immense army in the land of Israel.
{179}
The burial place is in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, according to the prophecy, and it takes seven months to bury Gog and his multitude, and all in the land are engaged in it. That is remarkable! It is simply a question of *burying* them; to put them out of sight for ever. In solemn irony (verses 17 - 20), God invites the birds and beasts to His "great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel" to eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. It is the fierce judgment of God against the enemies of His people. Thus He shows to all that He loves His people. Although He had to discipline them severely, He had brought them back now, and would not allow their enemies to touch them. He rained great hailstones, fire and brimstone upon them, as in the days of Joshua; so there is complete destruction of this the greatest enemy that ever came up against God's people. "And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every man's sword shall be against his brother. And I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many peoples that are with him, overflowing rain and great hailstones, fire and brimstone" (@Ezekiel 38: 21, 22).
Ques. Does it coincide somewhat with the attack upon the beloved city?
J.T. It is the same enemy. That attack will be a later one; it will be after the millennium, but still it is the same sort of thing. In @Revelation 20 the enemies come up on "the breadth of the earth". It is man generally, in Satan's domain, but this is a northern enemy.
C.A.M. Fire only is used for their destruction in @Revelation 20, which would be a feature of final judgment. I was thinking of the remarks made as to David; especially as relating to the service of God. It seems to give great meaning to what the Lord is doing at the present moment.
{180}
J.T. That is what I thought we might see. There is going on today, the service of Christ as David in relation to the service of God; presently, in Israel, it will be the military prowess of Christ as David. So that this immense invading army is brought on to the very territory of God's people, but they are utterly destroyed. It seems to be human power *combined* against the people of God. What can man do? The greatest military effort that he has ever made is seen here, and now they are lying on the ground unburied. Their carcases defile the land, and it takes seven months or more to bury them, so that the land may be cleansed (verse 16). And for seven years fires are made with the weapons of war (verse 9). In all this God pours scorn on modern huge armies and armaments.
Ques. Coming from the north would suggest discipline; but of a kind that would bring out favourable conditions in the end, do you think?
J.T. It is to bring out what God does for His people. He could have prevented this attack, but instead, He brought this immense army up so that He might show His power on behalf of His people in destroying it in their land.
R.W.S. Does this furnish material for praise in the sanctuary?
J.T. I am sure it does. The Psalms furnish such material as the result of victories granted to God's people. @Psalm 18 is a good example.
A.R. Do you think that we can count on divine intervention now, to the end of the assembly's history on earth, in order that the service of song may go on?
J.T. I think that is the lesson here in chapters 38 and 39; that God will deal with human power, however great, and He signalises His people in doing so, so we need not fear. God can deal effectively with the greatest array of human power against His people.
{181}
A.N.W. Does not the light of chapter 37 -- the bones becoming an "exceeding great army" -- have a direct bearing on this chapter?
J.T. I think so. The first, the *raising*; the second, the *burial* of their enemies.
W.G.T. Burial in this sense is important today as regards assembly judgment. It speaks here of a sign to be put up wherever burial is needed, as if the judgment is to be carried to the end, being divinely required.
J.T. Quite so; so that discipline amongst us ought to culminate in burial; the removal, in this sense, of what is offensive amongst the people of God. For seven months they will have searched the land, and if they find a bone, they will put a sign on it; that is, if anything is wrong with one, a sign is put on him to show he is a brother that has to be looked after, to see that what is offensive is *fully* dealt with. That can be brought about by faithful prophetic ministry.
A.R. Does the last verse of chapter 39 indicate how great the position is? God says, "I will not hide my face any more from them" (@Ezekiel 39: 29). The Lord hid Himself from Israel (@John 12: 36).
J.T. In the prophet Isaiah it says He hides His face from the house of Jacob; but He is not doing it at the time contemplated in our chapter. In Isaiah, Messiah says, "And I will wait for Jehovah, who hideth his face from the house of Jacob", @Isaiah 8: 17. Here we have, "And I will not hide my face any more from them, for I shall have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel", @Ezekiel 39: 29.
{182}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (9)
@Ezekiel 40:1 - 16; @Ezekiel 41:1 - 4; @Ezekiel 42:15 - 20
J.T. It has been suggested that we look at chapters 40, 41, and 42 at this reading. The detail of these chapters is unusually great, but, in general, the house and its precincts are in view. It will be observed that there are three gates entering the outer court; one from the east, one from the north, and one from the south; and three gates entering the inner court where the house stands, corresponding to those in the outer court. Those in the inner court have eight steps, whereas those in the outer have seven steps. There are a great many details as to the buildings: the house itself, the building before the separate place, which would be on the west side, the use of which is unspecified, and a large number of chambers for the use of the priests. Then in the end of chapter 42, a large area is described, which is five hundred reeds square. This is said to be the "separation between that which was holy and that which was common" @Ezekiel 42: 20.
It is needful to fit into our minds the general plan in order to follow the detail. No doubt but few of us have the complete plan in our minds, for it is very complicated, but we can take in the general idea. There are three spheres; the outer and inner courts and then the outer extensive area, which is around the outer and inner spheres, and measures five hundred reeds on each side. It is a spiritual matter, of course. The prophet was taken into the land of Israel and set by Jehovah upon a very high mountain, "and upon it was as the building of a city, on the south. And he brought me thither, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a flax-cord in his hand, and a measuring-reed; and he stood in the gate. And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy
{183}
heart upon all that I shall show thee; for in order that it might be shown unto thee art thou brought hither. Declare to the house of Israel all that thou seest" (@Ezekiel 40: 2 - 4). The last sentence conveys the moral side; what Ezekiel saw was to be declared to the house of Israel. Correspondingly, it has application to ourselves; the truth as seen here is to be known to us. This thought is enlarged upon in chapter 43, where we are told what Ezekiel was to show the house of Israel: "Thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be confounded at their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. And if they be confounded at all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its goings out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and all its statutes, yea, all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and do them" (@Ezekiel 43: 10, 11). This is the moral side of the subject, which the Spirit would apply to us; and if there is any self-judgment resulting from what is shown to us, *more* will be shown. The passage says, "if they be confounded at all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion" @Ezekiel 43: 11. So that as we receive the truth of the house of God, and it affects us in a moral sense, more will be shown. That is the principle. God is not ready to entertain our natural minds. Indeed, it is said in an earlier chapter that those who listened to Ezekiel regarded his ministry as though it were just a pleasant song. The ministry must have a moral effect upon us, otherwise there is no profit to us, but if it has this effect, more will be ministered.
A.B.P. Would the word "confounded" (@Ezekiel 43: 10), be the realisation of how far short we come of what the details of the house represent? Would not present ministry indicate to us how far short we come of what God's thought is?
{184}
J.T. It would. The intent of all the ministry the Spirit gives, is to convey the mind of God and the variety of it, as seen in the Scriptures. If there be moral response in self-judgment (for if we are true, we are bound to see that there is a great discrepancy between our moral condition and what is presented as the divine ideal) there will be growth. So that, as we are looking into these chapters, the moral and spiritual features are what the Lord would stress, and if I judge myself as I see the discrepancies, then I shall be helped.
A.R. Do these chapters set out what God has before Him? Ezekiel is taken up to this mountain and sees a city, and then he is shown the house and its measurements. Is that what God has before Him, and what we come into if there is moral correspondence?
J.T. Quite so; you are reminded of the mount of transfiguration. The three disciples were taken up, as Ezekiel is here, to a high mountain. Ezekiel saw the house; the three disciples saw more. It is noteworthy that in our chapter, the city is left for the moment; it is there, but the detail of the house is given first; the city comes afterwards.
F.H.L. Does all this follow on chapter 39, where God's face is towards them, and the pouring out of the Spirit is promised (verse 29)?
J.T. Exactly; the position is that the enemy is destroyed; there is no adversary or evil occurrent and God is now free to unfold His great thoughts in the sanctuary.
C.H.H. Ezekiel was *shown* these things. Would that correspond to teaching after prophesying? Would the gift of teaching follow the prophet?
J.T. Yes; there is no formal prophesying after chapter 39; it is *showing* now. We are on the mount with God. There is the instruction as to measurements, for He is the God of measure, and everything must conform to divine measure. He unfolded the details
{185}
of the tabernacle to Moses; He showed him "the pattern". Everything was to be done and made according to that pattern. It was *one* tabernacle. So also David had the pattern of the house by the Spirit (@1 Chronicles 28: 12). There was great variety of detail. And now Ezekiel is shown this abiding house, and we are impressed with *measure*, which relates to so much remarkable detail. The intricacy of it is remarkable and it must be owned that it is difficult to follow in detail, but there is a man here who *shows* it, which is very encouraging. It is the man who has the measuring-reed: "there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a flax-cord in his hand, and a measuring-reed; and he stood in the gate" (@Ezekiel 40: 3). We should pay attention to this man. His appearance, it says, is the appearance of brass; that is how he *appears*. We have already seen in this book that an appearance is intended to produce an abiding impression. We are formed by impressions received from what is presented to us. As the Lord said to Paul, "For this purpose have I *appeared* to thee", @Acts 26: 16. This man stands athwart the entrance as it were, he is *in* the gate, with two measuring instruments. The appearance of brass would remind us that there is no toleration of any fleshly activity, such as Israel had shown. God is now adhering to His own measurements, but still it is a man who is measuring; one who has sympathies, reminding us of all the teaching that has come to us with regard to the house of God. As Paul wrote to Timothy, "that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house", @1 Timothy 3: 15. In this connection it is striking that the Lord says that authority to execute judgment is given to Him *because He is Son of man* (@John 5: 27).
A.R. Would you say that Solomon stood in this way as seen in @1 Kings 1 and @1 Kings 2? Before he set out to establish his kingdom, there was the appearance of brass in dealing with certain men.
{186}
J.T. That is right; and God appeared to him twice. That is brought up at the time of his failure, @1 Kings 11: 9.
A.N.W. Would not the minuteness and intricacy of the details in our chapter impress us with how particular God is in regard to everything that pertains to His dwelling place?
J.T. Quite so; you are struck with that, the remarkable detail with which God reminds His people of their sins in the prophets. One has been greatly struck with that of late -- the detail you get in the different prophets -- the symbols and similes used to bring the truth home to the people of God. And so here, I suppose, the measurements being so extensive and detailed would be to remind us of divine accuracy. We are to be formed by the impressions received, so as to be in His sanctuary in a suitable way.
A.N.W. There is nothing in which man is so rude as in the intrusion of his own ideas in regard to the house of God and His service.
A.F.M. Does the law of the house summarise the general outlook from which to view the house? "This is the law of the house" (@Ezekiel 43: 12), and then, "its border round about is most holy". I wonder whether that implies a rule by which we should walk with God so as to see with Him what He is setting forth -- He is "most holy".
J.T. Yes: "Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy" @Ezekiel 43: 12.
R.W.S. Is it as our senses are exercised (@Hebrews 5: 14), that these things will be shown to us?
J.T. Yes; and we need to give ourselves to these things. We are often very casual as to divine things. One knows that in oneself. We come to a meeting like this and have no thought of contributing at all. We regard that as a matter for others to do, but if I am to get the gain of an enquiry like this, I ought to look into the matter myself; it is a matter of giving oneself
{187}
wholly to these things, as Paul said to Timothy; fully following up what is presented (@1 Timothy 4: 15, 16; @2 Timothy 3: 10 and note). As you dwell upon something that seems most difficult, it gradually opens up to you, for the Spirit of God is here for that purpose, to guide us into all the truth (@John 16: 13). We have to set our minds on these things, so verse 4 of chapter 40 says: "behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and *set* thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for in order that it might be shown unto thee art thou brought hither" @Ezekiel 40: 4. It was most important for Ezekiel to pay close attention. He was to declare what he saw to the house of Israel; so that the Lord would impress us with the necessity of paying attention to the Scriptures.
J.H.E. Would there be something akin to that in @Acts 19? Paul went through the upper districts to Ephesus; and then the school of Tyrannus and the *teaching* are introduced.
J.T. Quite so; the general idea is presented in his going through the upper districts, taking a wide circuit: he went up through Caesarea, saluting the assembly, then coming back by the upper districts to Ephesus, and what he found there led to the extended work in the school of Tyrannus. What an opening up of the mind of God would be there! We must *listen* to Tyrannus; there must be *real* learning.
C.H.H. Would the apostle Paul be like the man in appearance of brass, in the details he gives as to the law of the house in 1 Corinthians?
J.T. Yes; I think the brass is seen there, Paul is very plain-spoken in dealing with evil. One of the things he mentions first is that there were divisions among the brethren. Now we read of this man with the measuring-reed, in verse 5: "And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring-reed of six cubits, each of one cubit and a hand breadth. And he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height,
{188}
one reed". That would be the wall, obviously. It would be about ten feet thick and the same height -- one reed. "And he came to the gate which looked toward the east, and went up its steps; and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold one reed broad. And each chamber was one reed long and one reed broad; and between the chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate, beside the porch of the gate within, was one reed. And he measured the porch of the gate within, one reed" (@Ezekiel 40: 6 - 8). I think that one thing to notice particularly is the uniformity of measure which is apparent as you approach the house.
The flax-cord is first mentioned and then the measuring-reed. The flax-cord is pliable; having it, we miss nothing. We do not know how long it was, but the reed is measured; it was six cubits; so that there are two principles of measurement: the reed suggesting what is fixed, and the flax, which is undefined, needing more care in its use, but everything was measured. Paul says to the Corinthians, "according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach to you also", @2 Corinthians 10: 13. Most of us are very local, but the flax-cord, I think, would mean a more general measurement, that you stretch out and reach to people in an extended way. The flax-cord would augment the reed; it could be employed in circumstances where the reed would fail.
C.H.H. Would the thought of righteousness enter into the flax?
J.T. I suppose so; "the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints", @Revelation 19: 8. Sobriety is also implied.
A.R. Had you anything more in your mind to suggest in regard to uniformity in these measurements?
J.T. That is the first thing that impresses one -- uniformity of measurement -- one reed. A brother or sister coming into fellowship is, no doubt, impressed with the uniformity of the brethren; that is, if we are
{189}
normal, there is uniform measurement. There is also the effect of beholding the glory: "*We all*, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to *the same* image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 3: 18); there is uniformity among the brethren through the ministry of the Spirit. Paul says also, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", @1 Corinthians 7: 17.
W.B-w. What is the force of measuring the threshold of the gate? Does that refer to persons coming into fellowship?
J.T. I think so. It was a long and remarkable gate, and half as broad as it was long. The three outer gates were alike, and the inner gates were nearly like them. The size, or extent, of the gates, is striking -- fifty cubits by twenty-five. You go through many things to reach the inner from the outer. In the description of the house and its precincts the idea of *gate* is impressed upon you. It is not merely a door, or a gate in the ordinary sense: many things enter into each of these gates. You are conscious in going through, that something very great and blessed is to be reached. The extra step in each of the inner gates is specially to be noted.
A.N.W. By 'uniformity', do you mean that the brethren, if they are in order, are just as much concerned about administrative matters in the gate as they are in relation to the house, or dwelling place?
J.T. That is the thought. The same things appear in all the outer gates, and each gate is complete in itself. All is educational as one goes through. Spiritual suggestions are to be observed everywhere. You have no such description of the gates elsewhere, not even in the holy city.
A.B.P. Is there somewhat of a parallel in John's ministry? Would not his gospel suggest very early that if we are to know anything about the dwelling place of God, as in Christ, we must "come and see"? @John 1: 39. And
{190}
would the abode to which the two disciples went, who followed Jesus, be like one of the "chambers" that are spoken of here, imparting definite inward impressions of Christ?
J.T. Quite so; the Lord would not take those two disciples into the holiest at once. They say, "Where abidest thou?" He says, "Come and see"; but He did not take them into the holiest, if you understand what I mean. In @Ezekiel 41, for instance, we are told in verse 3: "And he went inwards, and measured the post of the entry, two cubits; and the entry, six cubits; and the breadth of the entry, seven cubits. And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place" @Ezekiel 41: 3,4. That is the holiest of all. Notice, the measurer does not take Ezekiel in there. He took him elsewhere to show what there was, but he did not take him *in* here. He goes in himself and measures. So that I thought the Lord would not take the two who followed Him very far at the outset. They would not be equal to it. The outer gate before us here had chambers. These chambers were not the holiest. We may have secrecy with the Lord, and yet not come into the holiest.
A.B.P. Would the disciples reach that in @John 17?
J.T. That reaches to the holiest; they are called "men" there. It is men who enter in there. Peter had owned Christ earlier as "the holy one of God" (@John 6: 69), and through Him as such they would enter the holiest.
A.R. He had to wait till chapter 43, did he not? It says, "The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house. And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man was standing by me" (@Ezekiel 43: 5, 6).
J.T. Well, that, of course, is the inner *court*, but it is not the holiest, although it is in the direction of it, and the passage may be used to show how the Spirit
{191}
leads us inwardly as in the assembly. But here Ezekiel is only taken to the inner *court*. It is clear that Israel does not enter the holiest even in the future.
A.R. How far does the inner court go?
J.T. The inner court is eight steps higher than the outer court, and the altar stood there (@Ezekiel 40: 47). It was into that court that Ezekiel was brought, but the glory of Jehovah filled the *house*. He could not see that from the court, and that is what we are dealing with. We have to go from one court into the other. And, as we suggested, when the Lord took the two disciples to where He abode, He would not take them into the holiest. He may have taken them, as it were, into one of these cells in the outer gate, but in @John 17 you have the holiest; I mean to say, the Lord is speaking there as a Man to His Father, and the disciples are viewed as men which the Father gave Him, and they are apparently listening to Him.
F.N.W. The Lord says in @John 16: 12, "I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now", and then He refers to the Spirit's coming.
J.T. Quite so; we have to learn patiently, and the Lord takes us as far as we can go at any particular time.
C.A.M. Does that not make the assembly's place very wonderful? As to Israel, if I understand rightly, the veil will be there in the day to come; they will not go right in.
J.T. It would seem so from what we get here. I think that only those who form the assembly have access into the holiest of all. That is a point that the writer to the Hebrews makes, that *we* can go inside. The angel does not take Ezekiel in, he goes in and measures it himself.
C.A.M. 2 Chronicles seems to confirm that. The veil is there, according to @2 Chronicles 3:14.
J.T. Quite so. After Numbers the veil is mentioned only once, that is, in @2 Chronicles 3: 14, until we come
{192}
to the New Testament. The account of the temple in 2 Chronicles points to the millennium, whereas 1 Kings contemplates the heavenly side, and hence there is no veil.
J.T.Jr. Would the object of the apostle in relation to the Corinthians correspond with this? In the first epistle he could hardly contemplate the Corinthians entering into the holiest, so that in @1 Corinthians 2: 7 he says, "But we speak God's wisdom", and, in verse 11, "thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God". Spiritual things would be understood by the spiritual, the natural mind would be shut out; it cannot know them.
J.T. He says, "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2). He would not go further. And that confirms what we are saying, that the Spirit of God takes us, according to His wisdom, as far as we should go in view of our state.
Rem. The apostle, as was said earlier, passed through the upper coasts and arrived at Ephesus; whereas Apollos was evidently left at Corinth on a lower level of the truth than the apostle was now entering on in continuing his service.
J.T. That is a good thought, because the position at Corinth needed to be held by a man like Apollos in the absence of Paul; whereas Ephesians involved the building according to the inward and spiritual side of the truth. The outward must be held, and Corinth represents that side. Even if they cannot go the whole way, they are to be held by proper ministry. All the saints are to be held, even though some do not go very far, but if one is spiritual he must not be hindered from going on himself The whole field of truth is open to us.
A.R. Would the idea of measurement be suggested in the way in which the apostle addressed the saints in each locality to which he wrote? So that Corinth's
{193}
measure would be according to his epistles to that assembly, and the same principle would apply at Colosse and Ephesus.
J.T. Quite so. Every epistle contemplates a certain state in those addressed, and that to Ephesus goes the furthest, because it says, "And has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", @Ephesus 2: 6. That is the full elevation purposed for us.
W.B-w. Would chapter 40 describe the public side of the assembly; whereas chapters 41 and 42 would be more what is private and inward?
J.T. That is right. It is generally the court and the gates in chapter 40. However, in verse 48 the prophet says: "And he brought me to the porch of the house" @Ezekiel 40: 48. He is now in the inner court, into which the porch of the house projects. "The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, even by the steps whereby they went up to it; and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and one on that side" (@Ezekiel 40: 49). That is all of the house that is described in chapter 40. Then chapter 41 opens, "And he brought me to the temple". Now we are getting further inward. "And he measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, the breadth of the tent" (the meaning of the word "tent" is uncertain here; it may be "porch"). "And the breadth of the entry was ten cubits, and the sides of the entry were five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits" (@Ezekiel 41: 1, 2). The prophet is brought into the temple viewed as a whole, but not into the holiest. The measurement here is forty cubits, like Solomon's temple, and the holiest is said to be twenty cubits square; also like Solomon's save as to height. In the measurements of Solomon's temple breadth and length and height are given; here it is just the breadth and length; the height of the house is
{194}
not given. Otherwise it corresponds in dimensions to Solomon's temple.
C.H.H. Would chapter 41 correspond to the Philadelphian position? "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God", @Revelation 3: 12.
J.T. Quite so; there are pillars here (@Ezekiel 40: 49), as in Solomon's temple.
J.H.E. You were speaking about going further inward. Paul says in @Ephesians 3: 3,4 "according as I have written before briefly, by which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ". Would that involve further truth which the apostle would have the Ephesians reach?
J.T. Quite so; it is a comfort to know that somebody *knows*. That is what he brings out in that passage. He would have them to know of *his intelligence* in the mystery of the Christ. If somebody knows, why not I? Well, as we have been saying, the gates, as described in chapter 40, are most important, especially for young people; the length is to be noted: fifty cubits. All the outer gates are alike; they all have the same dimensions. It would take considerable time to go through them; and there is much to see before one gets into the outer court. It is intended that we should be impressed with the fact that we are dealing with great things. We cannot take them in all at once. We must take the place of learners; learning "in part". There are "chambers", which would indicate places of privacy for prayer or meditation.
F.S.C. Why are there but three gates mentioned? The passage refers to only east, north, and south.
J.T. There is no gate at the west. There are but three gates entering to the outer court and three entering into the inner court. The west points to the setting sun. It is not the cheerful side of the position. You come in cheerfully; not under the dulling influence of your business, or your domestic affairs. The full thought of entrance is in the east gate; that is, toward the sun-rising.
{195}
The suggestion is that you are in the light of Christ; that Christ is shining on you all the time. Later it is stated that "Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it"; that is, by the east gate of the house (@Ezekiel 43: 4; @Ezekiel 44: 2). As the east gate is the one described, it conveys the general idea. The prince entered by the porch of this gate, also by the corresponding gate to the inner court, and as the God of Israel came in by the east gate it was to be kept shut. The inner gate was also to be "shut the six working-days" (@Ezekiel 46: 1), but opened on the sabbath and on the day of the new moon; the people were to worship at the door of it on those days (@Ezekiel 46: 3).
J.T.Jr. Would you say, then, that we come in according to David? Is David the model for us as entering into the house of God? He went in and sat before the Lord (@2 Samuel 7). And then what comes out, especially at the end of his ministry, leads to the service of praise. David seems to give a lead to the whole position.
J.T. David goes into the house in the light of the message through Nathan. The thought in Scripture is that we enter the assembly in the light of a message. The disciples did, according to @John 20. The Psalms say much about the house of God; they speak also of how we are to enter into it: "In the greatness of thy loving-kindness will I enter thy house", @Psalm 5: 7. "For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand", @Psalm 84: 10. And again, "Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise", @Psalm 100: 4.
E.E.H. How would you view the man in @John 9 in relation to the gates of which you speak? He develops very rapidly in his apprehension of the Lord.
J.T. He does; and as coming to know Christ as the Son of God he would come into the light of the house. Chapter 10 leads in that direction. What we are considering now is with a view to bringing before the young people especially, that we come in, in the
{196}
light of a message, to the greatest light there is for us. We enter into the house of God in the light furnished us for it. The Son sets us free indeed; we are thus in the house in liberty. David entered in the light of sonship, according to @2 Samuel 7, as we have seen.
A.B.P. The man in @John 5 missed the sheep gate, but the man of chapter 9 found it in chapter 10.
J.T. Quite so; but first, the Shepherd found him. Christ was the door to him into salvation, liberty and pasture. I believe the Lord is allowing much sorrow among us, because many do not come in rightly. They do not come in, in light. You wonder sometimes what people have in their minds in seeking to come into fellowship. The idea is *to come in in light*; the light is furnished to us. "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" the Lord said to the man. And he said, "I believe, Lord: and he did him homage" (@John 9: 38). That man will not cause trouble. He will not leave us; he will go on. He will know that the sheep's place is fixed. The sheep never perish; they are in the Son's hand, and also in the Father's hand.
N.P. In Revelation, the holy city has three gates on each side, but in the temple there are only three gates in all. What difference do you make?
J.T. This temple is a provisional thing; it represents what is down here, but the heavenly city comes down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God. Its bearing is *universal*. This temple with which we are dealing, will be on earth in the future, and does not correspond with the heavenly city. Indeed, it is not a city; it is a house. The tabernacle had but one door in it, as did also Solomon's temple. Here we have two added, so that there is increase, but in the heavenly city we have twelve gates -- it is an administrative and universal thought. As to gates here, we must note that they do not furnish immediate entrance to the house; only to the courts; the house itself has but one door or
{197}
entrance. These gates -- six in all -- are peculiar to this sanctuary.
A.R. I was wondering if the apostle in his first epistle to the Corinthians would support what you were saying about coming into the assembly: "For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you" @1 Corinthians 11: 23.
J.T. Quite so. There are many of these messages bearing on the assembly and they are most important.
F.H.C. Would you say that one coming into fellowship in any local position should have both seen the Lord and heard His voice, and in that sense he becomes a distinct asset to the position?
J.T. Yes. He has come to *stay*, as it were. He has come in. The scene presented to us here implies that you go in and in and in. The gates are long, and as entering we can go into one of the chambers in the gate and enjoy things there; but we do not yet reach even the outer court; so that we should be humble and learn from step to step, and thus be prepared for what is within.
Rem. Mark, the attendant of Paul and Barnabas, did not go very far before he found that the spiritual way was too hard; whereas Timothy seems to take things up from a more constructive standpoint, fully following up Paul's ministry.
J.T. Quite so; so that the dimensions of the gates, although for all of us, are particularly for young christians seeking to be with the brethren. Let each see if he can appreciate this gate before he goes in further; and let him consider the items mentioned. He will be impressed with one thing -- the measurement -- the uniformity of it; how, normally, the brethren are all alike. There is no contention among them. Paul found there was contention at Corinth, which is the negative of all we see here. They said, "*I* am of Paul"; "*I* of Apollos", but the description of the gates would condemn such conditions. There are living spiritual conditions
{198}
in these gates for a certain state of soul. If you are more advanced in the things of God, you will want to go further, but there are certain living conditions in the gates.
C.N. Would you say that the two going to Emmaus came to what you have in mind? That is, they were going from the company, but as they came in contact with the Lord they returned, and they had what corresponds to a message. They would never turn their backs upon the saints again.
J.T. I am sure they never left after that. I believe they would be strong supporters of the divine position henceforth; in fact, their remarks enter into the idea in the gates, you might say. They were speaking of the Lord having been made known unto them in the breaking of bread.
R.W.S. Was it normal for Jacob to say, "How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven"? @Genesis 28: 17.
J.T. It was very abnormal. There is nothing dreadful about the description of this gate; it leads to the house of God.
R.W.S. I raised that question because of the practical application of what you said about young believers; Jacob sets his face to go away from it.
J.T. Many young ones are seeking to come in amongst us because others are here; the needful moral process has not therefore been gone through. The gate described here is fifty cubits long; it is still a gate after you have walked fifty cubits, so that the idea of a gate is impressed upon you; there are many things in it; chambers, palm trees, and the like.
A.C-r. In regard to this long gate: it does not mean that we should be unduly slow in receiving anyone, does it?
J.T. Strictly speaking, we do not *receive* anyone. It does say in Romans, "Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you
{199}
to the glory of God" (@Romans 15: 7). That is personal; but as regards the fellowship, those who wash their robes have a *right* to enter by the gates (@Revelation 22:14).
A.C-r. We sometimes speak about being doorkeepers, but I do not think a person should ordinarily have to wait seven or eight weeks before he comes into fellowship.
J.T. You would not deny that the matter should be enquired into carefully, but you probably have in mind the legal element objecting. From the standpoint of John's gospel, the Jews are always kept out; they are always against Christ. The Jews represent the legal element and are not trustworthy; so that the doors were shut for fear of the Jews. To be afraid of the Jews, that is, people characterised by a hard, legal mind, is a wholesome thing. We should be able to discern in one or two visits to a brother or sister, or in their moving in and out amongst us, if these persons *wash* their robes. If he is washing his robes, he has a right to enter by the gates into the city, and to partake of the tree of life.
A.B.P. Do you have in mind that the passage through this gate would be like the consolidation of the position in the soul of the entrant?
J.T. There is nothing repellent about the gate. It is so important, that we might look a little at the detailed description that is given. "And he came to the gate which looked toward the east, and went up its steps; and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold one reed broad. And each chamber was one reed long and one reed broad; and between the chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate, beside the porch of the gate within, was one reed. And he measured the porch of the gate within, one reed. And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward. And the chambers of the gate which was toward the
{200}
east were three on this side and three on that side: they three were of one measure; and the posts on this side and on that side had one measure. And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. And there was a border before the chambers of one cubit, and a border of one cubit on the other side; and the chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. And he measured the gate from the roof of one chamber to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits, entry opposite entry. And he made posts, sixty cubits, and by the post was the court of the gate round about" (@Ezekiel 40: 6 - 14). The sixty cubits would refer to the height of the posts, so that we come to a point of *elevation*. That is to impress us; and then it says, "And from the front of the gate of the entrance unto the front of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits" @Ezekiel 40: 15. Now, all these items are intended to impress our souls in coming into fellowship, and there is nothing repellent; but there is great uniformity. There is a distance of five cubits from one chamber to the other; the chambers are all alike. You may feel that there is not much to learn there; it is easy to take in these details, but there will be much more intricate things inside.
A.R. There is the thought of victory. At each post there are palm trees.
J.H.E. Would @Acts 3 fit in here? The man who sat at the Beautiful gate went into the temple as having met Peter and John.
J.T. Yes, he really went in when he took hold of Peter and John, for that represents the idea of fellowship.
Rem. "The windows round about were inward", it says in verse 16, as if our gaze is not to be outward, but inward.
J.T.Jr. Is the thought of the gate especially developed in Peter? In @Acts 8, Philip let Simon in, but Peter came down from Jerusalem and really put him out, did he not?
{201}
J.T. Yes; I think the idea of the gate would be seen particularly in Peter and John at the Beautiful gate of the temple, where the man had been laid many times; but Peter did not say, Look on this Beautiful gate; he said, "Look on us" @Acts 3: 4. He and John represented the moral side -- the spiritual house -- that God had in mind. We have already remarked that the Lord had added to what was there; the features of the house were all there, only God, in patience, was waiting upon the Jews; but the thing was all there, and when Peter said, "Look on us", the *gates* were in evidence.
C.H.H. Would the epistles to Timothy represent the gates in our day?
J.T. The second epistle, particularly; in a negative sense first, and then the positive side in the pursuit of "righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", @2 Timothy 2:22. We are really occupied with the saints; the house of God is the saints, as builded together (see @Ephesians 2: 22; @1 Peter 2: 5). Even the gates are represented in the saints. You say, That brother is not so difficult, and another brother is like him, and thus we see uniformity being brought about. It is one reed, one reed, one reed. The new man is suggested. One coming amongst them begins to see the attractiveness of the saints.
R.W.S. The chambers are particularly interesting.
J.T. They would give opportunity to go in, as to your closet, and pray to your Father in secret. All that is seen is to be confirmed in the soul in secret with God, and that is what the young people need. They are following one another, which is right to a point, but we must get to God individually. Speaking to your Father in secret will bring confirmation.
Rem. The sheet let down from heaven was a difficult matter to Peter, but after he apprehended what it meant and worked it out in a practical way with Cornelius, it became intelligible to him.
{202}
J.T. Quite so; he says, "it came even to me" @Acts 11: 5.
In chapter 41 we are brought to the temple and its measurements, and there is much to learn; but before going on we should note in chapter 40 that the distance from each of the outer gates, on the north and the south and the east, to the corresponding gates of the inner court, is one hundred cubits. We noted the measurement of fifty cubits in the outer gates, but now there is a space of one hundred cubits from each of these gates to the gates of the inner court, which represents a further journey to be taken. And then the gates of the inner court have eight steps instead of seven as we observed in the outer gates. It is important to see that there is something beyond; we must learn what this eighth step means, for it leads to what is more elevated. The description given is: "he brought me into the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures: and its chambers, and its posts, and its projections, according to these measures; and there were windows to it and to its projections round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits. And there were projections round about, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits broad. And its projections were toward the outer court; and there were palm-trees upon its posts: and its ascent was by eight steps" (@Ezekiel 40: 28 - 31). This refers to the south gate and its ascent into the inner court. Then verses 32 - 34 similarly describe the east gate, and verses 35 - 37 the north gate. It will be observed that there are eight steps in each of these three gates.
W.R. Would you say what the tables are? We have eight tables mentioned.
J.T. There are twelve in all (@Ezekiel 40: 38 - 42). They are accessories for the offerings. They are on the north side in the outer court. Instead of the offerer slaying his offering, as in the tabernacle, the Levites did this service (@Ezekiel 44:11).
{203}
A.B.P. Would you tell us the difference between the seven steps in the first gate and now the eight steps?
J.T. Well, we are coming nearer to the house. The outer court is like the fellowship; it is more or less public; but when you get in, on to the level of the eighth step, it is more the spiritual side, I think. You are now on spiritual lines and the house is in view.
F.H.L. Solomon's throne had six steps only. It is interesting to see the seventh and eighth coming to light.
J.T. Well, I think eight means here that there is a great deal beyond what is public; so that from that point on it is more spiritual and inward. And then there are a great many accessories, and cells and chambers and walks, etc., as to which we could not enter into detail now.
R.W.S. The first measurement was fifty cubits through the gate, and then there is a space of one hundred cubits. What does that space represent?
J.T. That is the extent of the outer court from the first gate to the gate of the inner court. It represents a further journey or experience that the believer has to go through in reaching the house. @1 Peter 2 speaks of the house as *spiritual*. He says, "To whom *coming*", implying that a journey must be taken.
C.H.H. There is chamber above chamber in the house (@Ezekiel 41: 5 - 7). In that connection does the thought of higher and higher come in?
J.T. Yes; it corresponds to Solomon's temple -- places of enjoyment. "In my Father's house there are many abodes", @John 14: 2. That is the thought, I think; love is reciprocated in close quarters.
C.H.H. These chambers are on a higher level (@Ezekiel 41: 8), so in chapter 42 there are upper cells, as if there is promotion on these lines.
J.T. Quite so. And then a walk, too, for the priests m view of their offerings; and there are many other details which we should look into individually, as
{204}
opportunity offers. They bear upon our priestly position.
A.B.P. Would the application of this instruction to us today be like the responsibility in our daily business and home life; then our movements amongst the saints generally through the week; and then our service Godward on the first day of the week?
J.T. Yes.
A.F.M. We have the expression "toward the north" a good deal; is it to impress us with the greatness of the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. Well; that is the quarter that denotes discipline and judgment (compare @Job 37: 9, 10).
A.F.M. The sacrifices were prepared toward the north.
J.T. Quite so; judgment is from that quarter here, so that, as we draw near to the house, we are impressed with the sufferings of Christ. And then there is the wide area or "enclosure" outside, of five hundred reeds, which should be observed, in chapter 42. It gives a great deal of scope, but it is still relatively holy; we may say, it is like the place where our houses are. It is not the world; it is between us and the world. "And when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose front was toward the east, and measured the enclosure round about. He measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about. He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about. He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed. He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed. He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall round about, five hundred long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common" (@Ezekiel 42: 15 - 20). So that this is not the outer court properly, although it is a court in a sense; it is not called a court; it is
{205}
outside the "outer court" -- less holy, but still it *is* holy. So that it gives us a great radius in which to move in our houses and business, in the maintenance of holiness; otherwise in going to the meetings we would be dull and heavy, and thus a hindrance.
A.B.P. Are not the associations of man and wife, parents and children, master and servant in Ephesians, encompassed by a wall like this?
J.T. Exactly. There is a wide sphere with good scope in it, but you never allow yourself to be drawn into the profane side. Men have their way, and you have yours. Of course, it makes it very difficult in that sense to have to do with people in the world, but this is to enable us to have to do with them and maintain a good conscience; to keep our garments from being spotted by the world.
Ques. It says, "whose front was toward the east". Does that suggest keeping under the influence of Christ's reign in all our circumstances? "And when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose front was toward the east, and measured the enclosure round about" (@Ezekiel 42: 15).
J.T. That is the main gate; the first gate mentioned. That is the first impression you get as considering this great matter. We are not to lose sight of that, because the other outer gates are just like it.
C.H.H. Would the new covenant be seen in the east gate, according to Corinthians, where the glory of the Lord is seen?
J.T. Yes, there is a connection. The glory here, however, involves more. It is God Himself here. *His* voice is spoken of immediately (@Ezekiel 43: 2).
{206}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (10)
@Ezekiel 43: 1 - 27; @Ezekiel 44: 15 - 31
At our last reading we considered the dimensions of the sanctuary of God recorded in this book of the prophet Ezekiel, as seen in a vision by the prophet, who was taken by the Measurer to the various parts of the house. In chapter 43, which is before us now, we have the divine approval of the sanctuary, so measured, for we are told that the glory entered, "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east" (@Ezekiel 43: 2); and then, "the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose front was toward the east" (@Ezekiel 43: 4). And then the prophet hears one speaking to him out of the house saying, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever" (@Ezekiel 43: 7).
There is a certain correspondence in this instruction as to the incoming glory, with that which we have upon the completion of the tabernacle in Exodus, and the temple built by Solomon; so that the first element of teaching this evening refers to the conditions which God can approve amongst His people, enabling Him to be among us. Then secondly, we have the altar -- its dimensions and dedication -- having the service of God in view; and thirdly, chapter 44, which gives particulars as to the gate which looks toward the east, suggesting how exclusive it is, for it was to be kept shut and used only by the prince. Thus provision is made for the distinction of our Lord Jesus above the saints; provision is made for Him personally. Then the priesthood is referred to in verses 15 - 31 of the same chapter. The two chapters may be thus subdivided into these main sections, and what is developed in them deserves careful consideration, for it is a question of what is suitable to God, whether in the
{207}
assembly as a whole, or in a local company; what God can approve by coming in and taking up His abode with us.
A.B.P. Does verse 2 of chapter 44 connect with the glory coming in -- that it was really the divine presence?
J.T. Clearly; "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like the voice of many waters" (@Ezekiel 43: 2). The glory is personified here, for it involves that God is there. So that in chapter 44 it says, "Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in" (@Ezekiel 44: 2).
C.A.M. What would you say as to the points of the compass, referred to here in relation to the gates?
J.T. The tabernacle, we are told, was a figurative representation of things in the heaven. It really had in mind the created universe. "But he who has built all things is God", @Hebrews 3: 4. The "all things" there refers to the universe; that is, His house in the widest sense. The saints (@Hebrews 3), are God's house now, and the measurements before us and in Exodus refer to God's house in this sense.
A.R. In regard to God coming in by the way of the east, does it suggest that He comes in majestically, like the rising of the sun?
J.T. That is a good suggestion. "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was lit up with his glory. And the appearance of the vision that I saw was according to the vision that I had seen when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar: and I fell upon my face. And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose front was toward the east" (@Ezekiel 43: 2 - 4). So that it *is* majestic. It is God coming into His dwelling. It is much the same as in Exodus; God coming in and showing His approval of what was there (@Exodus 40: 34, 35).
{208}
The sanctuary is viewed as existent in the vision here, however. It is not that God *asked* for the building or for the materials to build as He did in Exodus; the thing is viewed as existent, and He accepts it as it is, and comes into it in this glorious way to be amongst His people.
A.N.W. Is the "cloud" in Exodus less personal than here? The cloud is accompanied with the glory in Exodus, but here in chapter 44 it is stated that Jehovah Himself has entered.
J.T. Yes; we have no cloud here. The glory being mentioned, which is the neuter thought, is immediately followed by a personal pronoun, which would show that it is God Himself, presented all-glorious; it is the glory presented as indicating Himself: "his voice", etc. We know how God can take on other characteristics, for He is pleased to humble Himself to behold the things in the heaven and things on the earth; and, indeed, in Jesus, He came down to the lowest depths of humiliation; but now He is seen as having conditions amongst His people which are suitable to Him, and He is coming in all-glorious. He is honouring what is there. It is Jehovah Himself.
A.F.M. "And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man was standing by me" (@Ezekiel 43: 6).
J.T. The man standing by him would be in the sense in which the Lord stands by us in the assembly; He Himself being divine as God the Father is, but standing by us to support us so that we might be in the midst of such a scene suitably and in liberty.
A.R. Does the prophet represent those that compose the assembly -- persons with whom God is pleased?
J.T. Yes. He has been shown everything, but now he is in the inner court: "And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court" (@Ezekiel 43: 5). It is the *Spirit* now, for it is a wholly spiritual matter. So Ezekiel represents all that are to be there, and the man
{209}
standing by him is representative of Christ, who stands by to support them there.
W.G.T. In chapter 43, free access is available to Ezekiel; but in chapter 44, there is exclusiveness in regard to the gate. How do these thoughts work out?
J.T. Ezekiel is lifted up by the Spirit. He is not said to be brought through the gate; it is a wholly spiritual matter. The gate is the public side. Chapter 44 brings out the exclusiveness of the east gate. The fact that Ezekiel is lifted up by the Spirit and brought into the inner court shows that it is an extraordinary experience. Coming in by the south gate or by the north gate would be the ordinary way.
J.H.E. Would the word in @Revelation 1: 10, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", be akin to this?
J.T. Well, it would be like it; it is an element entering into the service of God.
F.S.C. Is there a similarity to @Revelation 21: 23 -- "For the glory of God has enlightened it"?
J.T. Quite so; the temple is filled with His glory, and every whit says "Glory!" there. The whole domain is lighted up -- even the earth -- as He approaches. There is an enlightening, as it says in @Revelation 18: 1, "and the earth was lightened with his glory"; an immense thought; but inside, of course, the light is more intense. It shines down in relation to the cherubim and the mercy-seat.
A.B.P. In all the judgment that God had dealt out to meet the evil which existed, His glory had not been tarnished in the slightest degree.
J.T. Yes. It carried with it all that preceded as to God. We have often remarked that the ark never changes in dimensions. It does not present the idea of development. There is no idea of development with God; He is what He is, and no circumstances can alter that.
A.N.W. Do we see the Trinity in view here in Jehovah, the Spirit, and the Man?
{210}
J.T. Just so. All are divine. In the light of the revelation of God, the Man standing by is Christ. The Spirit and the Man are subservient to Jehovah in this great matter, that the worshipper, who is in the divine Presence, should be *sustained in it*. The mediatorial system is in mind. The Spirit and the Man standing by suggest what we experience in assembly as we draw near to God; we are supported in a subjective way by the Spirit, and then Christ, the Minister of the sanctuary, is by us; both of these divine Persons are on our side so that we might be there according to God and that the approach on our side might be equal to the revelation made.
J.H.E. In @2 Corinthians 3: 17 we have: "but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
J.T. That is necessary to assembly service.
J.W.D. Do you understand by @Ephesians 3: 21, "to him be glory in the assembly", that the glory is shining out?
J.T. It is what is Godward. "*To him* be glory in the assembly *in* Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". The two uses of the preposition "in" are suggestive of power: "*in* the assembly", and "*in* Christ Jesus"; but it is all Godward, I apprehend. It shows what accrues to God in the assembly. According to our chapter, God has come into His house; He has come in in the form of "Glory"; the idea of glory being almost personified. I think it is to show that He thoroughly approves of what is there -- what is described by Ezekiel, as shown to him. There is nothing to mar His feelings. All is perfectly in keeping with Himself, so that He can enter in the character of Glory.
C.A.M. The scene is all-glorious, and I suppose it is because alt that is necessary to come to this, is an accomplished thing. So when the altar is brought in later, it is in a commemorative way, would you say?
J.T. There would be that in it. The altar is greatly enlarged upon in these dimensions, as if the idea was
{211}
that the approach is to be equal to this great manifestation of glory. God has entered in glory, as if there is nothing to mar it. It is not moral glory, but what He is, shining out in conditions suitable to Himself, for the thought was, that every whit in the temple should say "Glory!". That all reflects what God is! There is nothing to mar the glory there. The Spirit took Ezekiel into the inner court, and the Man who stood by him would support him, as typical of the worshipper. The Two who thus serve him are equal to the One who has entered in glory, only They are seen as on a lower level, for the purpose of supporting the worshipper. Then the size of the altar shows it is altogether according to God. The settle was fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, and the upper part, which is called "the hearth of God" was twelve cubits square. We have two remarkable appellations of the altar; the one is the "Mount of God", and the other is "lion of God". What immense moral power there is in those two words! It is on our side; it is really what Christ is in self-sacrificing love. The dimensions of the altar indicate that we are approaching in keeping with this display of glory.
M.B-w. What is the force of one speaking to Ezekiel out of the house (verse 6)?
J.T. "And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house. And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house" (@Ezekiel 43: 5,6). Speaking out of the house would imply a characteristic of it, corresponding with @Leviticus 1:1.
W.B-w. What is the inner court, as distinguished from the house out of which the voice came?
J.T. Ezekiel was taken to the inner court, which in this house was the priestly place, and thus the divine speaking could be heard. The court is not in the house, but it is very near to it, so one in it could hear God speaking to him. And immediately Ezekiel goes
{212}
on to say, "and a man was standing by me", as if he would be supported, and then, "And he said unto me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne" @Ezekiel 43: 7. The prophet is to be instructed as to the house -- that it was the place of God's throne; the place of the soles of His feet, where He would dwell in the midst of the children of Israel *for ever* (@Ezekiel 43: 7). It is no longer "if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end", @Hebrews 3: 6.
W.B-w. The inner court is not the sanctuary?
J.T. It is not part of the house, it is where the altar is. The outer court was approached from the great domain outside, and then the inner court was approached from that court, so that there is gradation throughout in the approach, but Ezekiel is taken into the inner court by the Spirit -- an extraordinary thing -- so that he might have full opportunity to see and hear what was there; and then the Man standing by would make him quite at home in the place. I think that is the idea. He is supported by sympathy, and the speaking proceeds. The speaking is not in the court, but out of the house. That is how God speaks; as it says, "the Spirit speaks expressly", @1 Timothy 4: 1. The speaking today is in the house; hence, "If any one speak -- as oracles of God", @1 Peter 4: 11.
J.T.Jr. Would it correspond to Leviticus where God spoke to Moses out of the tent of meeting?
J.T. That is exactly the same; the tent of meeting having been set up and the glory having filled it, that is the place from which God speaks. It is from the house -- the holiest of all -- "from off the mercy-seat which was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim", according to @Numbers 7: 89.
R.W.S. According to chapter 41, Ezekiel has not reached that point; is that right?
J.T. He has not reached the holiest. He is only in the court, but it is the inner court.
{213}
R.W.S. Why is it that, with the support and sympathy mentioned, he does not go further than the inner court? You pointed out at our last meeting that he does not go inward; the measurer goes inward (@Ezekiel 41: 3).
J.T. The way to the holiest in the Old Testament was not yet made manifest, nor will it be for Israel, in the future, as far as these instructions are concerned. Even in the instructions as to the priests (@Ezekiel 44: 15 - 31), there is nothing to indicate "boldness for entering into the holy of holies".
W.B-w. That would be the difference in christianity -- we have access to the holiest.
J.T. What is taught here does not go so far as christianity, literally. We have to put christianity into it to make it applicable to ourselves, using these scriptures as types, which we are entitled to do. They are written for our learning. We noted last time in @Ezekiel 41: 3, 4: "And he went inwards, and measured the post of the entry, two cubits; and the entry, six cubits; and the breadth of the entry, seven cubits. And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place". He does not take Ezekiel in there. Ezekiel is in the court.
A.R. Does verse 7 help us to understand what you are speaking about? Jehovah says, "This is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet" @Ezekiel 43: 7. All His operations are millennial in character; it is government.
J.T. Quite so; He is speaking out of the house, where He is to reside. Ezekiel is in the court, but the voice comes out of the house. Jehovah, in speaking to him, brings in the thought of the throne -- "the place of my throne". In truth, I think the throne of God was in the tabernacle, too, it was where He was armed with power to enforce His rights amongst His people. That is the idea of it, and so it will be in Israel in the millennium. None of the Old Testament types,
{214}
in Exodus, 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles, or Ezekiel, gives us the full thought of the assembly. In every case, the way to the holiest is not made manifest; it is only in the assembly that it is made manifest. As we come to the subject (@Ezekiel 45), we shall see that the feast of Pentecost is not mentioned. That feast has special reference to christianity. It refers to the coming of the Holy Spirit as seen in @Acts 2.
A.N.W. Does the same remark apply to verse 27 of chapter 44? There it says, "And on the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall present his sin-offering" @Ezekiel 44: 27. Is that the suggestion of the priest's sphere of service?
J.T. Yes. There is not much made of the priests entering the house, in these passages. The altar mentioned in @Ezekiel 41: 22 would appear to be the equivalent of the "golden altar" of Exodus. In the Mosaic service the priests had access always to the holy place, but it is hardly mentioned here. God dwelling in the midst of His people in suitable conditions and His service, generally in a public sense, is the theme in these chapters.
J.W.D. Do you think there is any link between the name of God in the heavenly city -- "Lord God Almighty" -- and this setting of the glory in relation to service in the court? And would the glory of the inner sphere in christianity be suggested in @John 20? The Son of God comes into the midst of the disciples.
J.T. Quite so. What we have in Revelation is the outer or public side of the assembly. It is recognisable by certain marks, as the assembly, but it is presented as a *city*.
R.W.S. What had you in mind as to the size of the altar?
J.T. That it shows the correspondence in the approach with this wonderful display of glory. Solomon's altar was larger, which, I suppose, is to show the
{215}
approach that there will be in the millennial day, for it is a question of what God will effect in Israel; the marvellous result there will be in God's people; they will have a priestly place before Him here on earth. Solomon's altar was twenty cubits square, as large as the holiest in the square measurement. The height, length, and breadth of the holiest were equal, but in square measurement, the altar of Solomon was the same size as the holiest, showing that the approach is to be equal to the revelation, and how could that be save as Christ, a divine Person, is on our side?
Rem. The introduction of the altar here, and the mention of the sin offering would indicate that there is defilement and it must be dealt with.
J.T. Just so; it is introductory; it had to be purified and consecrated before the continual service began (@Ezekiel 43: 18 - 21). But we first see the dimensions of the altar and the remarkable words used as to it, not found elsewhere. One is "Mount of God" and the other is "lion of God". What power there is connected with it The passage reads, commencing at verse 14, "And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle was two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the small settle to the great settle" (the footnote at this point reads, "The entire base of the upper altar - Hebrew Harel or 'Mount of God' - was in two parts, the upper of which was set back"). You do not get that anywhere else, in this sense, that I know of. Then the passage proceeds, "And the upper altar" (another note here refers to the same word Harel); and then in verse 16, "And the hearth of God" (another note refers to the word "Ariel", which is "lion of God"); so that we have great thoughts in relation to this altar that we do not find anywhere else. They suggest that great power is involved; it answers to God. By comparing @Exodus 29 and @Leviticus 8 with what is now before us our understanding of the altar will be greatly enlarged. The former scriptures refer typically directly to christianity.
{216}
In @Leviticus 8: 11 we have the *anointing* of the altar, which we do not get here. Moses sprinkled the anointing oil on it *seven times*. The tabernacle was anointed, but the word is not used in connection with the sanctuary.
Ques. Would the glory here be equal to the glory to God in the assembly? Is the power down here equal to what is up there?
J.T. That is the idea. We draw near to God commensurately with what He is; not as so many mere creatures, but as related to Christ, He makes the approach suitable to God. It is equal to the revelation.
A.R. Does the lion refer to David?
J.T. It would be a symbol of strength. We have it in the prophets: "Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city of David's encampment!" @Isaiah 29: 1. It meant Jerusalem there; meaning that it was, at one time, a great power, and so the altar is here. We read that the returning saints in Ezra set up the altar because of the enemies round about them.
A.H.P. Is it significant that the doxology in @Ephesians 3 seems to be based on the idea of power?
J.T. Yes; it is the Father's power working in the inner man; a very strong correspondence to this: it is what we are inwardly as drawing near to God. There is glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus".
J.T.Jr. Would @Psalm 22 fit in? You have noted that the heading is feminine, and the psalm refers to the Lord being heard from the "horns of the buffaloes". Is that the strength Christ has, and then it as seen in the service that goes along with it, singing in the midst of the assembly?
J.T. Quite so; "the hind of the morning" is a feminine thought -- it involves power in agility.
E.E.H. What is the significance of the law of the house preceding the altar?
J.T. It is a general thought. "This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy. Behold, this is the law of
{217}
the house" (@Ezekiel 43: 12). It is a condensation of the law of the house. The whole law is bound up in this thought that the house of God is most holy and morally elevated.
J.W.D. What do you say about these steps to the altar? In the old economy steps were forbidden, were they not? There were no steps going up to the altar.
J.T. The explanation must be in the change of dispensation. They looked towards the *east* (@Ezekiel 43:17). The altar is very high. There is the idea of exaltation in the hill of God. The height of the altar here is about ten cubits, which would be equivalent to fifteen feet. To visualise it, it is about twenty-one feet square and fifteen high. Solomon's was twenty cubits square and ten high (@2 Chronicles 4: 1), but no steps mentioned.
J.W.D. I was wondering whether it would be intelligent understanding of the manhood of Christ, the altar built up in that manhood.
J.T. That is the idea, I am sure. There is more said about the component parts of this altar than of the others -- not the material, but the *measurements*, and how they are put together and supported, indicating, I think, that it alludes to what Christ is as offering Himself, and the offerers are in accord with that; so it brings up the whole question of sacrifice, whether we are sacrificing according to divine requirement.
C.A.M. I think this statement that you have repeated about the approach being equal to the revelation gives a sort of key to the whole position. Does that not involve that all the blessed knowledge of God that comes out in the gospels is going to be fully answered to? And I was wondering in that connection if Matthew's gospel would not answer to the "lion of God" here, the mountains, etc.; and Luke's gospel would be the service of the priest?
J.T. Yes. Matthew presents the specially strenuous and suffering side. There are seven mountains mentioned
{218}
in that gospel, and a line of truth connected with each, so that it is the idea of exercise and elevation. The gospels are like the coming out of God, in approach to man; that is, they were written after the teaching of the epistles. They show what God was in Christ and what man was in Christ. It is laying hold of that that enables us to see that the approach is equal to the revelation. God is not looking for ourselves simply. We are creatures. He has us in mind in relation to One who is equal to Himself. The whole universe is taken up in Christ as One that is equal to God. It could never be what it is to God save from that point of view. As merely creation, it could never answer to the heart of God. We must have the answer in keeping with the revelation. Hence the significance here of the dimensions of this altar and the much that is made of it, including the seven days devoted to its consecration.
J.W.D. They spoke of His decease on the mount of transfiguration, did they not?
J.T. Yes; we see Moses and Elijah there, speaking to Jesus about His decease. They understand what God has in His mind; that the decease is of such an One as that.
Rem. The mediatorial position brings the creature as near as possible to the Deity.
J.T. That is the truth. He went above all the heavens, and that is said of Him as it is stated, that He is *our priest*. "For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens", @Hebrews 7: 26. *We* are not made higher than the heavens, but *He* is and still He is our Priest. See what a footing we have; how God looks out upon us as engaged in His service! Growth enters into this. Ephesians makes much of growth: "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", @Ephesians 4: 13.
{219}
Rem. The thought of creature might tend unduly to make us feel inferior; the mediatorial position is to bring us into and maintain us in the full thought of God as to us.
J.T. Quite so; we never cease to be creatures, but then we are related to Christ, and what a status that gives us!
A.R. And so the writer to the Hebrews exhorts them to draw near; Ephesians is really to enable us to go inside.
A.B.P. In line with that, would you say John's gospel would fit in with the man that was standing by?
J.T. Quite so; the man denotes sympathy, but there is no doubt that Christ is in view, standing alongside of us, to show how we are supported.
F.S.C. Is all this description the filling out of the end of chapter 37, the everlasting covenant?
J.T. It would be; Jehovah says, "I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will ... set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever" @Ezekiel 37: 26.
J.T.Jr. Does the prostrate position of Ezekiel help? He prostrates himself in @Ezekiel 43: 3; the Spirit raises up that kind of man; according to verse 5.
J.T. Very good. We also have it later (@Ezekiel 44: 4). God speaks to such a man and opens up His mind to him.
A.N.W. The word in Ephesians is: "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (@Ephesians 2:18). Would you just say a word about the "*through* him" and the "*by* one Spirit", in this connection?
J.T. It is a question of instrumentality; that we draw near to God through Christ. Although we are sons, we do not draw near on our own ground. We have liberty to draw near to God through Christ; the mediatorship of Christ never ceases. The Spirit is
{220}
the *power* of it. Christ is the Mediator, by whom we draw near to God.
N.MacC. So, having a sense in our souls of what you are saying would sustain us in our worship meetings, would it not?
J.T. That is right. Think of the One who is sustaining us! We have been remarking about it lately in Canticles: "Who is this, she that cometh up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke?" (@Song of Songs 3: 6). She is coming up *herself*, she is not leaning on anybody; but in @Song of Songs 8:5, she is "leaning upon her beloved"; that is, the two thoughts enter into what we are saying now. The Beloved is the One by whom we draw near to God; that is, Christ. We *lean* on Him; but in chapter 3 she is contemplated as coming up in her own power; the strength the Spirit affords.
Ques. Is it right to say in regard to the Lord as Minister of the sanctuary that it is Deity brought into manhood? Is that a right statement?
J.T. Well, it is Deity in manhood, only the stress is on man when you look at Him on our side. "Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions" (@Psalm 45: 7), but He is, we may say, One of them. And that brings up the whole question as to conditions amongst the brethren, affording divine Persons opportunity to come in and take up Their abode with us. The conditions are primarily mutual relations with one another; right mutual feelings toward one another. The measurements in chapters 41 and 42 plainly indicate that everything is in proportion and that there is no interference one with another. There is a state of mutual feeling, and so at the very outset of creation we have it stated by Jehovah that the morning stars sang *together*. It is mutual; there is no leader there, no one above another; and all the sons of God shouted for joy; there is no one leading; they are all together. That is the first thing,
{221}
I think, the Lord would press upon us -- right relations one with another, that we are not in the assembly sitting down with extraneous thoughts in our minds as to what pertains to outside. We are there in control of our minds -- "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7: 25); and God's law, under these circumstances, is that I should stand and hold myself in relation to the brethren; in relation to Christ in heaven, of course, but I am speaking now of my relation to the brethren sitting as "in assembly". The introduction of the Supper shows that the Lord brought that about. They sang a hymn. *They* did it. He must have been there, but it is the mutual thing that is effected, and they move together to the Mount of Olives. These chapters would, I believe, impress us that God takes us on under these circumstances; His glory can come in, and now there are conditions among us for worship in keeping with the revelation; so the altar is very much stressed. And then, in chapter 44, there is abundant room made for the deity of Christ, the superiority of Christ over all others, for He alone can come in by a particular gate, that towards the east -- the one by which the God of Israel came in. In @Psalm 45: 6 Christ is addressed as *God* -- just before His "companions" are spoken of. This is surely striking.
C.A.M. So that the hymn at the Supper seems to show that there can be singing although all around be evil.
J.T. How wonderful that is for God that He can have that, a state of holy mutuality among us, that we can sing and move together! And now the Lord takes His place. The first great assembly service is @Exodus 15, and in it there is the thought of leader, but you have none at the celebration of the laying of the foundations of the earth.
J.W.D. I was wondering if we are practically delivered from what is extraneous as the sense of the Spirit among us collectively gives power.
{222}
J.T. Quite so, and that is dependent on our control of mind. One feels it is a most important item as to whether we are in control of our minds. If my mind is wandering outside, in my business and my house, I have not control of it and it is just lawless. It is not occupied with the great thing I am professedly engaged with. Throughout Romans, the great fundamental epistle, you reach the point of controlling your mind. We are to be able to control our minds, to fix them on one thing at a time -- "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law"; therefore I do not allow things foreign to the service of God to come in at all. I shut the door, and the Spirit in me helps me to do it, and that same Spirit is operating in everybody sitting down with me in assembly.
J.H.E. Is it for that reason that the doors are shut in @John 20, for fear of the Jews?
J.T. Quite so; I can only shut the doors as I have control of my mind.
A.F.M. That is found in the verse, "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of *wise discretion*",@2 Timothy 1: 7. Would you expect that to function as in assembly where all is in divine order?
J.T. It is one of the most important things for the brethren to take hold of, for if I am not in control of my mind, it will be lawless.
W.R. The apostle speaks of using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace, @Ephesians 4: 3. Would "using diligence" be like what you have in mind?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would @John 10 indicate the door being opened by the porter to let the right One in? Would that enter into this setting?
J.T. "To *him* the porter opens", @John 10: 3. The porter knows him. He would make room for Christ. The porter is a responsible element to shut out or let in.
{223}
Rem. I was wondering whether it would synchronise with @John 20; that where right conditions were prevailing, the Lord came in and they were all glad.
J.T. Quite so; the doors were shut, spiritually; that is an act of the mind.
N.MacC. At a certain time even past history is prohibited.
J.W.D. What is the link between this mutual state of things and the priests of the sons of Zadok?
J.T. Well now, we are getting on to chapter 44. So far we have had the incoming of the glory -- that is, God Himself -- into conditions suitable to Him, and we have a man taken into the inner court by the Spirit; one who had fallen down before the glory. He is supported by the Man standing by, so he represents those who go in as acceptable to God according to the measure of the revelation. And then we have the altar, as we have been saying, and now the sons of Zadok, representative of the priesthood, are considered next in order. The priesthood here, it seems, is based on moral qualities. Aaron was made priest in Exodus. His priesthood can hardly be said to be based on moral qualities. He is, of course, a type of Christ, but he failed seriously as Moses was on high receiving instructions from Jehovah, including his appointment as priest; and we know that the breakdown of the priesthood was in the lawlessness of his two sons. But here we have a tested and tried priesthood which represents the priesthood of Christ, not anticipating it, but looking back to it. Christ was made Priest on the ground of His sonship, but also on *moral* grounds, as Hebrews shows. So that in this scripture we are, as it were, taken on to the millennium and permitted to look back; it is a *tried* priesthood, as suggested in the faithfulness of Zadok.
A.N.W. Like Phinehas, too, I suppose.
J.T. Just so.
{224}
Ques. You have in mind the breakdown in Abiathar?
J.T. Yes; the allusion would seem to be what Zadok was in relation to David and Solomon when others failed. We have an allusion here to the general failure of the priesthood, the Levites.
R.W..S. The priesthood of Christ is looked back to, did you say?
J.T. Yes; we are taken forward here to the millennial day, so that it is a backward look; for all that appears there will have been tested out, Christ having already been here.
Ques. Melchisedec has to do with the millennium, has he not? On earth, Christ could not have been a priest, literally, since He was not of the tribe of Levi, but as having gone into heaven, He is made Priest.
C.A.M. It gives a wonderful idea of the millennium because we know that the last day will be a day of victory; and in the priesthood, as we have been saying, the approach is equal to the revelation.
J.T. What a triumph it will be! And that, I think, is why God brings in Zadok and makes so much of him as against others who went astray, which reminds us that we are all tested. All these lessons bear on ourselves; so that the word to Ezekiel in chapter 43 is: "in that they set their threshold by my threshold, and their post by my post, and there was only a wall between me and them, and they defiled my holy name with their abominations which they committed; and I consumed them in mine anger. Now let them put away their fornication, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be confounded at their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. And if they be confounded at all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its goings out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and
{225}
all its statutes" (@Ezekiel 43: 8 - 11). All this bears on ourselves, as to whether we can now take on this great service that is opening up.
Ques. Would @Hebrews 10 fit in? "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water" (@Hebrews 10: 19 - 22). Do you not think that has a present bearing?
J.T. Quite so. That is what these verses that we have just read mean; how God would bring the matter home to us now. What a wonderful time this will be when the millennium is established, for it will look back to the testing out of everything in Christ! God says, as it were, It is established in Zadok, but not Abiathar, nor Aaron, but it is Zadok, a man who stood well in the test. That is the idea of all this, for it looks back to the moral features of priesthood as seen in Christ here.
A.B.P. Zadok shone particularly at the *end* of David's reign. Would it refer also to the recovery of the priesthood in this day after the Reformation; the development of priesthood under Christ?
J.T. I think these scriptures bear remarkably on that. This is a time of recovery, and Zadok is outstanding in this. Jehovah says of him: "But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel *went astray* from me" (@Ezekiel 44: 15). We are in the midst of that now. There are those who have gone astray, and what a great thing it is to keep the charge of the Lord in the presence of all that!
C.A.M. When this is actually brought about in the millennium and Israel will be in the blessedness of it,
{226}
it will be with the consciousness that the assembly has previously entered into all this in a greater way.
J.T. Quite so; as a matter of fact, we shall have a part in it then in *some* sense. We are not totally separated from it, because the heavenly city includes the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel; they are in the gates.
A.R. In chapter 44 God is considering for the priesthood in view of the service? The chapter, in the main, has service in view?
J.T. Yes; the first part of the chapter makes provision for the superiority of Christ over all of us -- the Prince; He alone can go in by the gate that looked toward the east; His Deity is really implied in what is stated, and then the sons of Zadok are the saints who take up the worship, but they are saints who have been tried, that have not gone astray when others went astray.
W.B-w. Is it significant that these sons of Zadok present the fat and the blood?
J.T. "And they shall stand before me to present unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 44:15). That would mean that prosperity is connected with overcoming, for this is what marked Zadok. Fat is spiritual prosperity, but instead of clothing myself with it, I offer it up to God.
J.T.Jr. The reference to the garments here is instructive, and does it not show a spirit of reverence with us in regard to the service as we come in -- that we are suitably clothed? And reference is also made to the holy cells where these garments are kept.
J.T. Yes; it says, in verse 17: "And it shall come to pass when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the inner court, and towards the house. They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird on
{227}
anything that causeth sweat. And when they go forth into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy cells; and they shall put on other garments, that they may not hallow the people with their garments. Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long: they shall duly poll their heads" (@Ezekiel 44: 17 - 20). What is said about the garments is remarkable. The common people are not to be hallowed by them. They are altogether for the inner position. The reference to the "people" being hallowed by the priests¬ garments would show the danger of priestly sanctity being taken on externally, not as a result of God's work. The linen being so predominant would mean that we are balanced, sober in serving, and thus we do not offer "strange fire" as Nadab and Abihu did.
Ques. Is it that God intends to guard the priesthood, that the common people can never have to say, as such, to things pertaining to the assembly?
J.T. Yes; that priestly status should not be taken on *superficially*. If we are priests we are sanctified in the true sense as in @1 Peter 2: 5. Christendom is marked by men assuming priesthood who have not the Spirit. We must be on our guard not to impart to the younger ones anything that might make them *unreal*.
Rem. The teaching of Romans would correct this. You were drawing attention to the mind in @Romans 7, that I am delivered and thus can serve God with my mind.
J.T. Quite so; and "in newness of spirit". I not only have control of my mind, but it is renewed (@Romans 12: 2).
{228}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (11)
@Ezekiel 45: 1 - 12; @Ezekiel 46: 1 - 15
J.T. The instructions for the service of God which are found in Ezekiel are unique, as we have already observed. No explanation is given as to why they are so different from other references. There is no formal reference to the instructions in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, or other books which treat of the sanctuary; so that the inquiry of the spiritual mind is, Why should we have such a section of Scripture as chapters 40 to 48 inclusive? One lesson to be learned is that the earlier instructions are direct types generally, and to be viewed more abstractly, as the mind of God in regard to something still to be constructed; even the tabernacle was presented as a concept; a thing as yet future, for it was to be built of certain materials, whereas here, the sanctuary is already existent, so that it can be measured in every part of it; and then the instructions as to the services follow. There is no comparison made with the tabernacle or temple, or reason given why there should be such variations from them. It would therefore seem that the Spirit of God would impress us with spirituality -- the subjective work of God -- that what proceeds is of itself, without any necessity for explanations. If we are spiritual and intelligent, we understand.
Ques. Would you say that the nearer we come to what is real, the less need there is for actual law to govern us?
J.T. It is the uniqueness of the spiritual realm, whether it be the Mosaic system or the order of things in the assembly as we have it today, or what shalt be in Israel in the future, each has a distinctiveness. The present and future are based on the work of God in us, so that we are not hampered by legal requirements; we are in liberty. Those who have part in this great service in the future will be in liberty and shall understand. It is
{229}
said, "And they shall be all taught of God", @John 6: 45. And in dealing with these matters, unless we are taught of God -- not that we know everything, but we are in principle taught of God -- we shall fail to grasp the mind of God.
J.H.E. Would we get some help on this in the beginning of the Acts? Nobody told the disciples that they had to select one to take the place of Judas, but they did it.
J.T. Just so; it was spirituality; they were taught of God. They knew what to do. There was the idea of a standard in what they did, because they said it must be one who had assembled with them all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, from the baptism of John until the day in which He was taken up. It was a wonderful standard, but there was no word earlier that they should conform to that; that the Lord's moving in and out amongst them should be the standard for them.
J.T.Jr. Would they have had the thought of spiritual substance in their mind in their requirements?
J.T. They *had* spiritual substance really, for the company in the upper room denotes that very thing. They are there expressly as the subjects of Christ's work. The apostles¬ names are first given in order, and then reference is made to certain women, and Mary the mother of Jesus and His brethren. They were possessed, not only of the instruction the Lord had given them, but impressions had been received of the light and grace and example that had come before their notice in all that wonderful time. They were *men* awaiting the Spirit. They knew that He would come, and instead of going home and waiting for some indication of His coming, they were *together*. They abode there in the upper room, having come in from the mount of Olives.
J.H.E. The gift of the Spirit would be as if heaven sanctioned what was taking place.
{230}
J.T. That is right; the "parted tongues, as of fire", denoting how the Spirit came, "and it sat upon each one of them" @Acts 2: 3; indicating that He was pleased with them. There was no discrepancy, in principle, in what the Spirit found in them. He did not come to them in the form of a dove, because they were creatures, and having sin in them, but the sin was held under; it was not active.
A.R. Save what we have as to the bread and cup, we have no direct instructions in actual detail as to assembly order when we are together; as to how the service is to be conducted. I wondered whether that would be in line with what you say, that it is left to spirituality, so that we would move entirely on spiritual lines without having any detailed outline as to how the meeting would proceed.
J.T. That is a good suggestion at this point. What is done is the outcome of spiritual intelligence; as in the first chapter of Acts, such procedure is approved. They acted without formal instructions, but what they did was approved. The coming of the Spirit accredited what was there; and so in @John 20; the Lord came in. There was nothing of which to complain; nothing to adjust. But the account in @Luke 24 shows there *was* something to adjust, for the conditions were not right. The Lord, as it were, takes account of the wonderful period in which we are -- a period of spiritual wealth marked by the movements of the Spirit Himself -- and as we proceed in our service according to spiritual intelligence, He gives us to understand that we are approved. But we must bear in mind that He must have to say to us, and if He come, will He have to rebuke, or will He approve? While, as we have said, there is no ritual, except what is furnished as to the bread and cup, there are scriptural principles governing the service of God in the assembly which those taught of God understand.
{231}
C.A.M. You connect divine teaching with the covenant, do you not? Would it be right to say that the teaching side of the truth goes on to that point in the meeting where we break bread, and after that it is a family setting, as in @John 20?
J.T. That is good so far, but the word "teaching", I think, should be confined more to the covenant as applied *primarily*; that is, to the house of Judah and the house of Israel. Their sins are to be remitted and the law is to be in their heart; but as applied to us, what answers to the new covenant takes the form of *ministry by divine Persons*. Paul's treatment of it in 2 Corinthians lifts it on to a higher level than that in which it is found in Hebrews where we have its application to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, and no doubt it will enter into this service in Ezekiel which is now before us.
In 2 Corinthians the Lord and the Spirit are spoken of in relation to His glory, and as beholding it, we are changed into His image. Then, as to teaching, the gospel of John introduces it almost immediately, and it is teaching by Christ -- where He abode. Then later, He says, "And they shall be all taught of God", @John 6: 45. The allusion there, I think, is to *more* than what is found in the new covenant, because teaching strikingly comes into @John 20, in that Mary Magdalene calls the Lord "Rabboni", that is, *my teacher*. It is not simply what she might get from Him, known as *Prophet*, as in chapter 4, but He was *her* Teacher in a general way. His teaching fitted her to carry the message which He sent to the disciples. The message, we may say, was the consummation of His teaching.
A.F.M. Would you link on the thought of the ascension of Elijah in the Old Testament? The conditions were that he was to be seen going up, and Elisha saw him. Would there be an illustration in the attitude of Elisha when Elijah went up?
{232}
J.T. That was in advance of what Elijah had taught him. He had visited certain places in company with Elijah and would get the mind of God from him in those places, but he desired more; he sought a double portion of that man's spirit. And to get that, Elijah says, "if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so", @2 Kings 2:10. And that is what is seen in @Acts 1; they saw Him as He went up; and the two men in white stress the point that they should see Him come back as they had seen Him go up.
C.A.M. What you have been saying is illuminating to me. It impresses me that the divine thought is really arrived at, and then taken account of; also, as to the covenant, that divine Persons take charge of it as to us, and make it effective, Of course, that is greater than its dispensational application.
J.T. That is what we have now, I think, and it is set forth in the types we get in these chapters. The thing exists, especially as to the house itself and the approaches to it; but then God is measuring them, and He is seeing that they conform to His measure. We all want to be like that. A spiritual man would say, I would like to be up to the measure. The ministry to the Ephesians is to bring the saints up to the divine measure. The measuring in Ezekiel is to show that God is accepting what is there, approving of it. And He looks for the same now; He found it in the beginning of our dispensation, as we see in Acts.
C.A.M. Education leads up to and fits us for the blessedness of sonship; it is really that side of the truth that you have before you, is it not?
J.T. Quite so. We are not even told in general what materials were used here, yet immense stress is laid on what materials were to be used in the tabernacle and the temple. Here it is just *what there is*. I am not speaking now as to chapter 45, because that is instruction
{233}
as to what was to be done, I am referring to the measurements of the sanctuary and its approaches.
J.H.E. In @Acts 3: 4, Peter and John could say, "Look on us".
J.T. The work of God was there. Properly, christianity is not a development; it is presented in Christ first; it is "That which was from the beginning", @1 John 1: 1. And according to @Acts 1, it was there in the saints. What was in the mind of God, to be effected, was there. So that what marked those who believed Peter's testimony is stated thus: "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship *of the apostles*" (@Acts 2: 42); that is, the thing was there. The Lord had put what was witnessed in Christ there; it was in the apostles and their teaching. Those who believed came into it; they "were added".
E.E. How do you regard Paul's discourse in @Acts 20 in relation to what you have been saying?
J.T. The whole truth was there. "For I have not shrunk from announcing to you *all* the counsel of God", @Acts 20: 27. The whole matter was there; the assembly develops through that; the saints are brought to it and sustained in it. What is presented to us in testimony is perfection.
Ques. Is the object of teaching to bring us on to worship?
J.T. Quite so. It is to give us to understand what *is*. I think the quotation in @John 6: 45, "And they shall be all taught of God", includes more than the new covenant. The new covenant is brought to christians in one who was made of God competent as a minister of it. And then the Lord Himself is the Spirit of the covenant. The thing is brought to us and made effective in us by a divine Person who is the Spirit of it, which lifts it up to a level beyond Israel.
C.A.M. I am glad you stressed that. If we do not get hold of the bearing of the service of the Lord and
{234}
the Spirit in the new covenant, we shall lose the blessedness of the present moment.
J.T. It has often been said, christianity is Christ; that is, Christ expressed; worked out subjectively in the saints. As to the covenant, it is said, "Now the Lord is the Spirit", @2 Corinthians 3: 17. He is in it authoritatively. And it goes on to say, "but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"; because the thought is to let what is of God develop and show itself. There is liberty under the Spirit of the Lord; He affords liberty for all that is of God. He would restrain all that is not. It is pleasing to the Lord to see even any little thing that is of Himself expressed livingly amongst us. God approves and measures that. So that we can say, That is right so far. It is a great thing to have a sense of that in assembly, that God approves of what is there.
G.MacP. Would the words "transformed according to the same image" (@2 Corinthians 3: 18), suggest the saints as coming up to the measure seen here?
J.T. Certainly; the *same image* -- that is Christ in us. God approves that.
A.R. What is the thought in chapter 45 of dividing all this territory in the land -- the sanctuary and the other portions referred to?
J.T. "And when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance" (@Ezekiel 45: 1). It is a *mutual* dividing. The priest does not do it. Much is made in this section of the prince, and the priests; that is, the great spiritual measures amongst the saints, but the mutual feature is also in evidence. The word "ye" would include the prince, the priests, and the Levites, as well as the whole house of Israel, but it is, "when *ye* shall divide". That is a beautiful mutual thought. It appeared when the foundation of the earth was laid: "When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy", @Job 38: 7. There is no leader mentioned. It is a mutual thought, and God is pleased with it in
{235}
His people and gets His portion from it. In the heave-offering unto Jehovah here, there is spontaneity in a mutual state of things. We are to love one another, but that love moves Godward; that is the principle.
J.T.Jr. Is that seen in @2 Corinthians 3? Is the Spirit of the Lord seen in a mutual state of things first?
J.T. Well, there is restraint, for it is, "the Lord the Spirit"; and then the judgment reached in chapter 5: "having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised", @2 Corinthians 5: 14, 15. That brings us on to mutual ground as living; and in Colossians, the apostle says, "the love which ye have towards all the saints" (@Colossians 1: 4). And it was "love in the Spirit", @Colossians 1: 8. I think that is a remarkable tribute to a mutual state of things in a local gathering.
F.S.C. The cities of the land which, according to Joshua, were for the Levites are all gathered in one thought here. The heave-offering would appear to include all.
J.T. That is right; it is all concentrated. The inheritances, involving personal distinction, are concentrated. The heave-offering includes the portion for the priests, the Levites, and for the prince. All the greater distinctions are provided for together; all related to the sanctuary and the city. That is an important matter as to the work of God. If it is greater in Paul than in any other, then Paul must be recognised. The work of God must be recognised in the heave-offering. Whilst we are mutual in offering, we make full recognition of special distinctions.
Ques. Does @Exodus 25 suggest that the whole tabernacle system is a heave-offering?
J.T. Yes; it is the same idea. The saints are taken account of in that way, that their hearts are to move Godward. The word "heave" means that.
{236}
A.R. Would the same thought be suggested in @Luke 24: 41,42? The Lord asked, "Have ye anything here to eat? And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb". Would the fish represent the sovereign provision in the assembly, the greater thought, and the honeycomb, mutuality?
J.T. That is good. There was something there to offer. "Have ye anything *here*?" He asked.
C.A.M. The way they come into the inheritance here is really the opposite way to that in Joshua, since all that relates to the sanctuary is first given.
J.T. Well, exactly; you might enquire, Where is Jerusalem? Where is the city of David? Where is the city of the ancient temple? The answer is, *This* is the thing now! There is a region which does not admit of such questions. God makes all things new. You are sensible in the midst of all this that everything is right. You do not want to be diverted from it. It is a spiritual state of things; the work of God.
Rem. There is no speaking from the throne here.
J.T. No; it is rather the prince, but then he *is* a prince; he is a great personality. It is not his official title so much as his personality that is in view. The measurements in chapter 45 need close attention; and what we have in verses 1 to 8 is taken up again in chapter 48. What is called the "holy heave-offering" here in the subdivisions is measured together there, and viewed there in relation to the division of the land to the tribes, and is a part of the "heave-offering", which was a portion of the land between Judah and Benjamin (@Ezekiel 48: 8, 23).
F.H.L.C. Does the fact that the prophet Ezekiel is spoken of as being at the river Chebar with the captives, show that he had learned this great principle of merging with the brethren; the principle of mutuality?
J.T. Yes. God usually takes up a man He can use for a particular purpose. He puts him through the necessary discipline and education to bring him to this.
{237}
It is important to get the thought of the heave-offering; that we are on mutual lines, and our *hearts* are affected. We love one another like the Colossians but when we come to Ephesians, we are on *elevated* ground, "raised up together"; provision is made for the work of God. The mutual line is not enough. In the mutual state of things there is also distinction; that marks the testimony of God from the beginning. The work of God is graded; it must be seen in all its beautiful varieties, and it blends. And so in this heave-offering there is recognition of it and provision for it. The sanctuary is already specified in previous chapters; but it is included here in the more extended thought, namely, the provision for the priests, for the Levites, and for the prince. We are now on the line of graded distinction. On the mutual side we are not claiming to be all alike, all having the same measure; because Romans would teach that every one is to know his measure: "as God has dealt to each a measure of faith", @Romans 12: 3. And if he does, he will be humble and recognise greater measures. After the Supper, the Lord Himself evidently participated in the mutual side; *they* sang a hymn and went to the mount of Olives. But now the time comes to mention distinctions; and in mutuality you *must* mention distinctions, or God will not like it; and the distinctions here are, the priests, the Levites, and the prince.
J.T.Jr. Would the allusion in @Ephesians 3 to the apostle's own intelligence bring out his distinction? It says, "according as I have written before briefly, by which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence", @Ephesians 3: 3, 4.
J.T. Just so; that is a good illustration. It is in parenthesis, as you know. Evidently the apostle, when he began to write that section of the epistle, did not calculate to introduce the contents of that parenthesis He had, no doubt, the plan of the letter in his mind; but when he came to the question of his prisonership, his heart became enlarged; and the Spirit of God
{238}
operated in it to call attention to himself You may say, Paul is occupied with himself; but the Spirit of God is occupying him with himself, and Paul must be subject. He would not have done it of himself. He says, elsewhere, that he was ashamed to speak so much about himself. But as he proceeded to write the letter, the Spirit of God caused him to speak of himself. The Ephesians were well taught, and might say, in effect, that they were learned men. They might think too highly of themselves. The apostle had declared to them the whole counsel of God. But still he knew much more than they, and it is well that they should be aware of this. "By which ... ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ" (@Ephesians 3: 4). It is wholesome to know and recognise that somebody possesses from God more than oneself. Paul knew more of the mystery than the Ephesians; he had indeed the whole truth of it.
G.MacP, Would he be like the prince here?
J.T. Quite so; Paul is like a prince. The idea of the prince in our scripture would reach out to the Messiah; the Lord Himself. Earlier, we get David mentioned as king, prince, and shepherd; that is, he was typical of Christ in those characters. But one is only called the prince here; and the designation may be typical of others than Christ -- subjects of the great work of God in those days, for "princes shall rule in judgment", @Isaiah 32: 1. Some will be greatly enlarged in the knowledge of God, as in the present day. And it is important that the saints generally should understand that there is such a thing as others having more knowledge than they have, even today.
G.MacP. David recognised that he was set among princes.
Ques. Would you help us as to the distinction between gifts and services?
J.T. They are spoken of in @1 Corinthians 12. "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit",
{239}
@1 Corinthians 12: 4. The gifts are exercised in the power of the same Spirit, though distinct one from another. In the assembly there are apostles, prophets, etc.; not all on the same level. "And there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord". The Lord is over the services. "And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all" (@1 Corinthians 12: 6). That is, we are told that the Spirit, the Lord, and God -- three divine Persons -- are occupied in this matter.
Ques. What would a "service" be?
J.T. Any service of God; all come under the Lord; the preaching of the gospel comes under the Lord. As to the gifts, there is variation: the Spirit gives them according to @1 Corinthians 12: 4, Christ gives them according to @Ephesians 4, and God sets them in the assembly, according to @1 Corinthians 12. All services are under the Lord.
A.R. Would that be suggested in the priests that are mentioned, "who draw near to serve Jehovah" (@Ezekiel 45: 4), and the Levites "who do the service of the house" (verse 5)?
J.T. Yes. Even the prince has to provide certain of the offerings. Every person in the land is to provide the heave-offering for the prince, and then it says, "This is the heave-offering which ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley; and the set portion of oil, by the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of a cor, which is a homer of ten baths, for ten baths are a homer; and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -- for an oblation, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah. All the people of the land shall be held to this heave-offering for the prince in Israel. And it shall be the prince's part to supply the burnt-offerings, and the oblation, and the drink-offering, at the feasts, and at the new moons,
{240}
and on the sabbaths, in all the solemnities of the house of Israel: it is he that shall prepare the sin-offering" (@Ezekiel 45: 13 - 17). Important personally, as he is, he does something. But he gets the means of his service from the people. This particular service is to be marked by princely dignity; all tends to general unity and enjoyment. The provision of all this includes the contribution of all the saints. Mutual feeling and bounty underlie the service, because what the prince is working with is what the saints provide. It includes today in principle, all that we contribute in assembly; and even the money we contribute. All that comes into what is public greatness and dignity; it challenges us as to what we are able to do in the service of God. What we give for the Lord's servants, or for the poor or needy should be given in a princely way, not in a niggardly way. "Enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God", @2 Corinthians 9:11.
W.R. @Jeremiah 30: 21 says, "And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them", [there is a footnote on the word "prince" saying it means "excellent"] "and I will cause him to approach, and he shall draw near unto me. For who is this that engageth his heart to draw near unto me? saith Jehovah".
J.T. That is another view and aids in what is before us.
A.B.P. Would the doxologies in Scripture suggest the character of the princes¬ offerings?
J.T. Well, spiritually they would. As to material things, Barnabas and Saul in @Acts 11 denote the princely side. What they carried to Jerusalem was the offering of those that were "well off".
Ques. When you speak of giving to the levites, are you going hack to verse 5 of our chapter?
J.T. Yes. It describes the allotment to the Levites.
{241}
C.A.M. So that all these services, gifts, etc., are taking us further and further away from mere ritual of religious systems around us today.
J.T. Quite so. The book of Acts shows the same thing. The book is entitled "The Acts of the Apostles". That title is not inspired, but it is a good one; not that *their* acts are exclusively there, the acts of others are there, too. Precedent is in mind for those who were to come into the truth later; and God would exalt the fruit of His own work in calling attention to it. The book is not marked by arbitrary injunctions; it sets out how things were done. As the Lord says, "learn from me", @Matthew 11: 29. We are to learn from the apostles, too, both in their instruction and examples.
G.MacP. Does the quality of the princes come out in @Numbers 7, as seen in what they offered?
J.T. Yes; unity in princeliness is seen there. Each one offered the same things as the others, and then God accepted *all*. The beautiful thing is that God accepted their voluntary offerings in the aggregate. And that is the idea in the book of Acts, the Spirit of God writing down what was done, as generally approved. Of course, there were discrepancies, but the spiritual mind understands.
R.W.S. Why does God call attention in the chapter before us to the unprincely conduct of earlier princes of Israel -- their oppression of the people (@Ezekiel 45)?
J.T. That was to make a then present application. And it is for us here tonight; it is for this meeting. God in unfolding His mind for any period would make it a present application.
Ques. Is it a reference to @Nehemiah 5 -- they were to oppress no longer?
J.T. Yes; Nehemiah saw what the nobles were doing; oppressing the people; lending money to them for usury. It says, "And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother!
{242}
And I set a great assembly against them" (@Nehemiah 5: 7). He brought the brethren around to oppose them in this nefarious conduct. It is humbling as we get power, we are apt to misuse it.
F.S.C. Will you say a word about verse 6 of our chapter?
J.T. "And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and five and twenty thousand in length, alongside of the holy heave-offering: it shall be for the whole house of Israel" @Ezekiel 45: 6. That is the provision made for the city. It is the administrative side, but it is for the whole house of Israel; they have access there. This is one apportionment. It is only five thousand in breadth as compared with ten thousand in each of the measurements for the priests and Levites.
Rem. The feast of weeks is omitted here.
J.T. Yes; what is contemplated is not the gift of the Spirit as we have it; although the Spirit will be present in the millennium, it is not in mind here; it is on lower ground. The feast of weeks refers to the gift of the Spirit as in @Acts 2 -- as in the present period.
F.H.L.C. Did the daughters of Zelophehad show princely qualities in asking for their inheritance? Jehovah honoured it, and it becomes the occasion of a statute.
J.T. Just so; it shows how heaven approves what is done, being the fruit of God's work, it is a most precious thing. So that, as something is done, someone may say, You do not have a word for that. But, if it is the fruit of God's work, God approves it. He *shows* that He approves it. That is the idea. God approves the fruit of His own work, and this will never be out of accord with His word. There is much more, of course, that we could say as regards these feasts. We have reference to the first of the month in verse 18. "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, on the first of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock, without blemish, and thou shalt purge the sanctuary" @Ezekiel 45: 18.
{243}
That is a variation from anything we get before. The year starts with this; it gets an excellent start; the sanctuary is purged. And then we have the passover, and the feast of tabernacles. But the feasts are wonderfully augmented by the offering of bullocks every day, and other offerings as specified; wonderfully augmenting these feasts as compared with those that Moses inaugurated. The prince offers for himself and for the people during the passover and the feast of tabernacles.
And then in chapter 46 we have instruction as to the worship by the prince. The prince is again brought into view; how he enters by the east gate, and how he worships, and then how the people enter; coming in by the north gate, they go out by the south; coming in by the south gate they go out by the north. That is an instruction God has been using in our own times. We have often referred to this passage in correction of the custom of closing the meeting for the breaking of bread by prayer and an announcement of the gospel, or in some other formal way. That is, we then went out by the same gate by which we went in; whereas the instruction here is distinct light on the position; when you come in by the south gate you go out by the north. You go out a *different* way; you go out on a higher note really.
J.S. We are to go straight ahead, and not turn back to where we began.
J.T. Quite so. Why should we drop from the high level we have reached? Going out by the north gate we strike cold or adverse circumstances and need to be fortified by the warmth of the assembly. As going out we need the heavenly touch. And even if we go out by the south, perhaps to favourable, or perhaps affluent circumstances, we need to be fortified; not to live in such circumstances, while giving thanks to God for His mercies. We are to set our minds on things above.
W.R. John says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", @Revelation 1: 10. Are there not special privileges
{244}
granted to us on the Lord's day as suggested in the four references to the sabbath here (@Ezekiel 46: 1, 3, 4, 12)?
J.T. Quite so. There is distinction made here between the sabbath and the working days. I do not think we get that expression under Moses. It contemplates that people work. The millennium will be the rest of God, but still there will be wholesome employment. But there is the sabbath, and the idea is, I think, absorption; lying fallow so as to absorb all the wonderful things that are presented to us. We are to take them in; and take them on, too. We should take colour from them. I believe that is the idea.
Ques. Would coming in by the north gate be like announcing a meeting for discipline at the beginning of the morning meeting? God would be favourable to us as we state such matters at the beginning.
J.T. The announcements have to do with public testimony, and they really belong to the gates. So that it is right to make the announcements at the outset. And when the things announced are attended to, spiritual power is needed; they require to be done according to the sanctuary, according to the anointing; and therefore the necessity to go out in heavenly power so as to be able to do things in a heavenly way.
A.R. Evidently the prince acts in a different way from the people.
J.T. He does. He comes in by the east gate, and worships in the east gate. To make it simple, he came in by the outer east gate. Then it was closed, for he only could come in that way. It was wonderfully honoured in that the glory came that way. Then he walked across the court and worshipped in the inner east gate. He did not go beyond that. That is to say, special spiritual power is not exactly priestly power; the priestly side must be added to draw near to God. Princely power, in itself, does not go so far; it is for publicity, for distinction in testimony, so that the prince here does not go beyond the gate, he worships
{245}
there, and the priest does the service for him, Then on other days at special convocations he goes in and out among the people. He is one of the brethren after all, however great he is. So that when they sat down at the breaking of bread at Troas, Luke says, "and we came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days. And the first day of the week, *we* being assembled to break bread", @Acts 20: 6, 7. Paul, as amongst them, would be there with the others. That keeps us balanced. Applied to the Lord, this instruction would be that on certain occasions He comes in with us, or is there from the outset until the end.
A.R. Is verse 10 suggestive of mutuality? The prince comes in amongst them and they go out together.
J.T. Yes, as was noted, Luke says, "we being assembled". Paul did a great deal, showing how princely he was in that meeting, but he came together *with them*.
Ques. Does this chapter suggest, in the main, the public side of things rather than the inside? They did not worship inside the sanctuary.
J.T. You get very little of the inner features of the house here; going into the holiest is not even spoken of. It is rather the public side; for it typifies the carrying on of the great service of God in the millennium and it is a question of what His work is, in a graded way. If it be represented in a prince, he is what he is. He is mentioned as there.
Ques. Is the actual breaking of the bread by an individual a public service?
J.T. I think so. He is doing what has to be done. It brings Christ in. It is to be done as He did it. It is part of the service. In the "systems" they bring in fragments of bread; but that is not the idea at all. The idea is *breaking* bread; there is nothing said of eating for the *memorial*; of course, eating is mentioned, for this is necessary for the Supper. @Acts 20: 11 says, "Having broken the bread, and eaten"; the Lord's supper requires giving of thanks for the loaf and breaking it as part of
{246}
the service. This brings Christ in. It is what He did. "This *do*", He says.
A.F.M. What is the actual significance of breaking the bread?
J.T. It is to bring Christ in. It is what He did. How lovely to think of that as exactly what He did! It is in the *breaking* of bread that the memorial lies.
C.A.M. This prince is really representative of Christ, is he not?
J.T. Quite so; in the sense of personality. As the apostles represented Christ, they represented personality in the public service.
A.R. Would you say a word as to the cup? It says of the bread, "This do in remembrance of me". But, in referring to the cup, "this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me", @1 Corinthians 11: 25. What did the Lord refer to in relation to the cup?
J.T. I think the blessing of the cup; the giving of thanks. It says, "In like manner also the cup". The word "manner" is the link with what He had already done. "After having supped", would mean that He had finished with the Jewish passover before He said this -- "after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" @1 Corinthians 11: 25. The drinking is added there; whereas, eating is not added in regard to the loaf.
A.R. Would "this do" be the thanksgiving?
J.T. Quite so; this is His part in it, but I think, "as often as ye shall drink it" brings in the happy, blessed side of the position; the drinking is satisfaction, alluding to the Spirit's part in the service. So the remembrance involves our happy condition and state in calling Him to mind; that we are satisfied in the position.
J.T.Jr. Would the north gate and the south gate be illustrated in @Acts 16, in the jail? Paul and Silas came in through the north gate, as under pressure,
{247}
and I suppose they went out by the south gate into the jailor's house.
J.T. Quite so, and when they were let go, they went to Lydia. That was the highest point in the place; "whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul", @Acts 16: 14. That was spiritually the highest point in the position. "And having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and went away" (@Acts 16: 40). They went off full. They were not disconsolate.
C.A.M. When you refer to the fact that one goes through to the opposite gate, going out that way, you imply that he has taken on colour.
J.T. Yes. There is a hymn in our book that I think the brethren are misusing. It is hymn 300 (Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock, 1932 edition). Some are making that a *closing* doxology, and that is not right. Nobody should assume to finish the meeting. Let the Lord do that. The most spiritual man in these latter times said his difficulty was to know when the Lord went out.
J.T.Jr. You mean that going out by the opposite gate is not some act of the brethren, to indicate that the meeting is over, but it is when the Lord goes out.
J.T. Quite so; it is a spiritual touch.
Ques. What do you understand by, "That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please", @Song of Songs 2: 7?
J.T. The reference is to *love*. Let it act from its own side. Love will do the best for us. Let it act when it pleases; for instance, the Lord remained away from the scene at Bethany. Love acted as it pleased. The sisters would have hurried the Lord, but the point was, He would come as He pleased, and the result showed that love in Him did its best for all.
Rem. You need no laws governing a situation like that.
J.T. No; "he whom thou lovest is sick", @John 11: 3. He knew all about it. He remained there
{248}
until Lazarus died, and then He came and did far beyond their expectations.
N.P. We read in our scripture that the prince is to worship at the threshold of the gate, and the people at the door of the gate before Jehovah. What is the meaning of that difference?
J.T. The prince went further in, although not exactly into the inner court. It is to mark off the distinction of spirituality in the service of God. We are to keep that in view, and yet to remember that after all the most spiritual man is a brother and comes in and goes out with the rest (@Ezekiel 46:10).
A.R. Does the portion in chapter 46 suggest that wealth spiritually comes specially through daily offerings?
J.T. "And thou shalt daily offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, of a yearling-lamb without blemish: thou shalt prepare it morning by morning. And thou shalt prepare an oblation with it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and of oil the third part of a hin, to moisten the fine flour: an oblation unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance. They shall offer the lamb, and the oblation, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt-offering" (@Ezekiel 46: 13 - 15). There is no evening lamb, you will notice, as in @Numbers 28. There are morning and evening lambs in Numbers. The millennium does not stress the evening.
{249}
READINGS ON EZEKIEL (12)
@Ezekiel 47: 1 - 12; @Ezekiel 48: 1 - 7, 20 -35
J.T. These chapters are a fitting close to the book; chapter 47 calling our attention to the river of life; a necessary adjunct to the millennial day of blessing. Following on that the borders or border of the land; no effort to make it appear large, but rather to suggest the exclusiveness in the land; and then the tribes. The Spirit of God reverts to the book of Genesis, the divine thought being carried through; and instead of a formal list of names, it is each in his inheritance. "And these are the names of the tribes: From the north end along the way of Hethlon ... shall Dan have one portion" (@Ezekiel 48: 1). So that instead of names formally given, we have the extent of each tribe's inheritance; as if the name of each would enter into his inheritance. The inheritance would be an integral part of what was involved in the tribal name. Much stress is laid on the extent of the heave-offering also, in keeping with what is in these two chapters; for grace underlies the results in us, in the people of God, in the river -- the river of life. So that we have the whole extent of the heave-offering. It is a square, as we note in @Ezekiel 48: 20: "The whole heave-offering shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; ye shall offer the holy heave-offering foursquare with the possession of the city". Much is made of it -- what is for God; and finally the city in which God is, Jehovah Shammah. It is four-sided, with the prince's part on each side, so it seems that the Spirit of God would give us enlargement in looking into these two chapters because they furnish the conclusion in a spiritual sense. The fulness of the truth in the people both Godward and manward.
Ques. Would the greatness of God's thoughts as seen here in Ezekiel correspond with the Revelation?
{250}
J.T. Yes. There is a link between the two books, particularly in the two closing chapters of the book of Revelation: the city and the river. The river in Revelation comes after the city, but flows out from the throne in keeping with the teaching of the book of Revelation, the throne of God and of the Lamb, the city having prominence: here the river comes in before the city is described. I think the Lord might, by the Spirit, bathe our souls in the thought of this river as that which meets conditions; that which in grace meets conditions that would preclude our having part in the heave-offering and in the city and in the house.
W.F.K. The source of the river is from the house in Ezekiel, but in Revelation it is from the throne. Is there anything in that?
J.T. Yes, there is. It is more love proceeding from the house of God in Ezekiel; the threshold is the first feature, and would allude to walking. There is the suggestion of walking either in or out. The activity of love, I suppose, when the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst His own; and then "south of the altar". In order to make the love, that shone in Him here, effective in us in grace there must be the altar.
Special attention should be paid to the reference to "waters" (@Ezekiel 47: 1). It is not called a river as thus coming out; it comes out in a small way. Attention is called to the place from whence it comes and how it passes south of the altar -- the *favourable* side; but the threshold I suppose would allude to love's walk; love's activities, which have striking exemplification in the ministry of Christ. The conscience is met in the altar, but love is behind it; the residence of love, too.
Ques. Would John have this in mind in his gospel: "for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace" (@John 1: 16), as if the ministry was in mind?
J.T. Quite so. The disciples were immediately the recipients. The fulness was there infinitely. The
{251}
first disciples followed Him as walking; attention is called to Him as walking. And He calls attention to the river of grace Himself in @John 7.
As the water begins to flow, the prophet is taken around by the north to see it. That is where you feel the cold -- the opposition. Instead of diminishing outside, in the scene of adversity, you might say, it *increases*; external conditions bring out its character. It increases, whatever the conditions, and goes on to infinitude -- "a river that could not be passed through". We all know how we tend to shrink up when we get away from the source, whereas this increases and increases; it becomes large as *outside*.
Rem. The source of it is in the sanctuary (verse 12).
J.T. Yes. It flowed out from under the threshold of the house eastward. The mention of the sanctuary is to bring out the holiness of the river, but the house is the love side; and the threshold indicates, I think, the movements of love. It is a river that cannot be passed over; but nevertheless one that can be *appropriated*. It is a regulated thought. The first river "went out of Eden", we are told, "to water the garden" @Genesis 2: 10. That is, instead of issuing from an ordered state of things, it is out of Eden, and enters into an ordered state of things, and thence becomes parted into four heads. The ordered state of things in the garden amplified and diversified it; made it more available universally.
A.P.M. What is the idea of waters to swim in -- a river that could not be passed through?
J.T. Well, I think the infiniteness of it increases in the mind as it meets with what you might regard as the sphere of need. It is small in its own home sphere; it increases in the sphere of need. That is the idea of it, I think. It is therefore a remarkable suggestion of the gospel; it issues out in an apparently small way, but its *innate* power is seen in that it increases as it meets need; instead of diminishing, it increases.
{252}
J.T.Jr. Verse 1 says, "And the waters came down". Would that fit in with what you have in mind in the gospel?
J.T. Yes; on the south side of the altar: "And the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, south of the altar" (@Ezekiel 47: 1). The coming down would mean sacrificial descent, the source of everything being in the abode of love, but the altar must be in view. It is the *right* side of the house; that side would be toward the south, and the prophet is taken toward the north; the prospect of the house was toward the east.
A.B.P. Would @1 Corinthians 13, which says that love never fails, suggest that the river seen in the Lord's ministry in the gospels was still available in the day of the Spirit?
J.T. That is right; there are other rivers in the prophets. The Lord alludes to them in @John 7: 38, "as the scripture has said". What He quotes cannot be found *literally*, but it is there, and probably includes this; it is rivers of living water in @John 7, and the prophets contemplate that, too. Zechariah contemplates one toward the west and one toward the east (@Zechariah 14: 8). It is the fulness of grace in the one towards the west and the one towards the east, but in fact, the river of grace in christianity is toward the west. The eastern side of the field is very little in view in the account of what the Spirit did, for the Acts is the account of what *happened*. It is not that God formally directed it; although Paul says in coming into Europe that the Spirit did not suffer him to go elsewhere. He would have him go that way, but Zechariah contemplates the full thought of God. Here, we have the *east* in keeping with the millennial thought. I suppose the direction for blessing then will be the east. The general directions given by the Lord Himself, it should be noted, contemplate all nations, the fulfilment of which requires a later testimony than what Acts records.
{253}
C.A.M. Regarding the river, do I understand that the result of it really enriches God?
J.T. Yes; it brings out what love is; that love increases, as it were, in its own use, its own service. God has pleasure in the gospel. There is nothing in which He has more pleasure, in that sense, than the gospel. It is love, so that in the power of the Spirit it becomes greater and greater.
J.H.E. Do we not get that in @Luke 7? The woman loved much for she was forgiven much. There is a greater return.
J.T. Quite so; that thought is here, as remarked -- the feet, the movements of the feet. She anointed His feet, and kissed His feet -- evidently because they were the means of bringing grace to her. They came from the realm of love, carrying love. "The Father has sent the Son" (@1 John 4: 14), sent Him out as Man here on earth. It was love and the realm of love, the Father and the Son; the woman in @Luke 7 evidently discerned that: she stood at His feet, washed His feet, wiped His feet with her hair, kissed His feet, and anointed His feet.
Ques. Should the local assembly be the residence of love?
J.T. Quite so; Paul said to the Philippians, "Because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now" (@Philippians 1: 5); not that they were preachers, but the whole assembly had fellowship in the gospel. Love should be amongst us in this way.
Ques Are the first five verses of @Ezekiel 47 to impress the servant with what is available?
J.T. Yes; as experiencing it himself. He is coming into it gradually, from the ankles, then the knees, and then the loins, and then swimming. The whole person is immersed in it.
Rem. There is a contrast to this in the so-called evangelisation that is going on in the world today, which is on a much lower level than what is exemplified here.
{254}
J.T. Yes; this is normal. No doubt the evangelists of the coming day will experience something like this; that is, they get what they present from its source. Modern so-called evangelists can hardly be said to touch the source of power in the true sense. They do not practically acknowledge a divinely ordered state of things, but move in relation to human organisations. Failing to recognise the order God has established, we do not go *inside*, and have to depend on what those who do go in bring to us -- even if we wish to preach the gospel. This marks generally what is called "missionary enterprise". But Ezekiel was inside the house of God, and saw the waters issuing forth; and then was taken round by the north gate, then to the east gate, and saw the waters running out on the right side. Thus he could render a true testimony: "And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world", @1 John 4: 14. That is the full thought; divine love is behind and in the gospel; it is announced in love in the power of the Spirit, the Spirit being here in the assembly.
W.B-w. Is passing through the river the test of the depth each one has -- what he has reached in grace in his soul?
J.T. That is the thought. "And he measured a thousand cubits, and caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the knees" @Ezekiel 47: 4. If it is only to the ankles, you may be able to preach the gospel, but it would be more in terms than in feeling, less affecting than an Ephesian gospel -- the latter would bring those who received it back to the Source, as the prodigal came back to his Father.
N.McC. Your soul experience enters into all this?
J.T. That is the point; it is soul experience, and the man that experiences each thousand cubits, the depth reached in each, is he who goes around by the north gate; he has seen the waters issuing out of the house, before they touch the scene of need at all -- seen the
{255}
thing in its own sphere -- and then how it enlarges as it gets into the sphere of need. You can understand how full Ezekiel would be of where he had been; the house and the threshold of the house would be in his mind. Some feet would go in and out over the threshold. Whose are they? What are the impressions? All is entering into this figure of waters, emblematic of grace coming out and meeting need. It is whence it came; and this man sees it and he is brought round to the north gate, where you get the blast of the north wind, as you might say, and then he goes round to the east side. Will he find this again? That is the point; he did find it. Then the measuring begins.
J.H.E. You referred to the prodigal. No doubt he crossed the threshold many times and never appreciated the grace. But in the far country it was magnified, and when he came back he would make a very good preacher.
J.T. Exactly. And when he came back he got into the house. We ought to consider this measurement. The Spirit of God is measuring what is; and He is showing us that the thing is increasing and increasing in the sphere of need; instead of being driven back and diminishing, it is increasing and increasing.
W.R. Would you say this entered into the preaching of Philip to the eunuch? He preaches unto him Jesus and the eunuch says, "Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?" @Acts 8: 36.
J.T. Yes. You see how it worked out there. The water was a divine provision, only it was for baptism; but this is also grace. In Samaria grace works in a man who had no commission save that of a deacon. But the Spirit of God takes him on definitely. He reaches deeper depths as he goes on.
R.W.S. The length of the river given here is only about a mile and one-half. Would the prophet be impressed with the rapidity with which depth is reached? I wondered if there would be an application as to the
{256}
rapidity with which the work of God is reached at Philippi; beginning with the women in connection with prayer and business and attending to the things spoken by Paul, and then terminating with Paul visiting the brethren. Would that be something like it?
J.T. That is good. It is a suggestion that when things are normal as at Philippi or Ephesus, depth is reached quickly. Whereas at Corinth apparently it was not reached. That is, Paul could not go far because of the conditions. But *he* had reached the depths reached by Ezekiel; he says, "for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God", @1 Corinthians 2: 10. But the Corinthians did not follow him: they were content to stay on shallow lines, as many are. They do not follow on; but the depths were there. The Spirit was ready to conduct them into the depths of God, but they were holding back. And so the apostle had to hold himself back. He had to confine himself to the depths of the ankles. "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified", @1 Corinthians 2: 2. "And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ" (@1 Corinthians 3: 1).
Ques. The knees were understood a little at Philippi. I was wondering whether it would fit in with prayer before the gospel on Lord's day evening?
J.T. Very good; the knees reached in this river would lead us to pray in our houses before the gospel. It is a practice that is much used throughout the world, and it seems to me that God is honouring it; especially in the families of brethren; prayers in the households before the gospel.
A.R. The apostle in writing to the saints at Philippi says, "because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now" (@Philippians 1: 5). Would that be like the depths -- starting at the ankles and going right on?
{257}
J.T. They were fully with the apostle. It was a remarkable time there; a unique time. The testimony was sown in tears; and in truth it began by the river-side. That is a beautiful link. That is where the prayer was going on. The roots of the testimony at Philippi were laid in the river, as it were. I believe Lydia represents the depths there, because it was a question of what Paul had to say, and the depths of God were there.
G.V.D. Does @Romans 5 fit in here? "By whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand" (verse 2), and then going on to "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (verse 5).
J.T. Yes. That shows how progress is made, according to Romans. It runs on in an objective sense until we reach chapter 6, where we reach everlasting life. That is the order of the truth from chapter 5 to the end of chapter 6. And then the conditions of soul afterwards. Chapter 7 is to bring out the depths of our sods, and chapter 8 develops the truth of the Spirit; not only shedding the love of God abroad in our hearts, but the Spirit of adoption; also that "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (@Romans 8: 16), establishing inward relations with God, so that it is understood that "all things work together for good to those who love God" (@Romans 8: 28). That is definite progress.
A.F.M. What about the "double river" (verse 9)? "And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live" @Ezekiel 47: 9. Does it refer to abundance besides what we have had?
J.T. I think so. The word "double" is difficult perhaps to follow literally there, but I suppose it alludes to the fulness or greatness of what is presented. The plural often contemplates intensity and completeness of what is mentioned, and if it be Romans, it would be the objective on one side, what we have just been
{258}
speaking of, what the Spirit is to us, what He is to us from God, and then what we are to God by the Spirit. Both these things are in Romans; there is the double action of the Spirit; first, the Spirit serving us in shedding divine love abroad in our beans, and then the reaction of the Spirit in us, so that we love God. In chapter 5 God is seen as loving us, and would have His love in our hearts, but chapter 8 is that we love God.
J.T.Jr. Would the suggestion in *causing* be like the Spirit having His way with us as in subjection to the truth? "And he caused me" (verse 3).
J.T. Quite so; whatever the power used, causation is intelligently exemplified. In @2 Corinthians 3:18 we get "the Lord the Spirit" by whom all is effected; so that there is authority with it, and there is a result -- a spiritual change. There is a cause, compelling the movement; not that there is any resistance. It is normal, but it is causation. The prophet is not doing it voluntarily.
J.T.Jr. Bringing us back, as he says in verse 1. "And he brought me back to the door of the house". It would indicate that the prophet is subject to this person, typically, the Lord Jesus.
J.T. Exactly; you feel you have to be brought back, as we do not learn all that attaches to a matter at once. Here the prophet comes back to learn a collateral truth, to what he has been having. Of all that Ezekiel saw in the measurements, there is a result outside, the waters issuing towards the east. It is a wonderful thing, going out and increasing in power as it runs through the sphere of need.
Ques. Do you think that Peter, on the day of Pentecost, is standing on the banks, as it were?
J.T. Quite so; he gives an account of the great stream that was flowing. He says, "but this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel", @Acts 2: 16. He was calling attention to something more tangible,
{259}
present there before his hearers. I think that is a good reference.
F.S.C. Is the river of life, as referred to, a more original thought than the tree of life?
J.T. Well, yes; it comes directly from the divine source. The tree of life, as a figure, is a growth. The idea of a river generally is influence; here it is issuing forth from God. In the antitype it comes through appointed channels, the twelve apostles, Paul and others. Basically it is the Holy Spirit, but taking character from the divinely appointed vessels through which it comes. The first preaching of Peter at Jerusalem, and how it appeared at Pentecost, furnishes the needed instruction. It was a public matter, and Peter, having already quoted the prophet Joel, gives a further account of it. "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (@Acts 2: 33) -- a tangible thing, but coming in mediatorially; that is, through appointed means; whereas John in @Revelation 22 characteristically deals with the feature of life, to stress the tangibleness of what came in through the Spirit; referring to millennial conditions.
A.R. Do you think that the idea of trees on either side of the river would suggest what you are saying: that there is growth, development and formation there?
J.T. Yes; it is the fruitfulness of the area. This is more John's side of the truth, as already said. It is tangible evidence. If you have not life today, what have you? Of course, the profession abroad has more or less the doctrine of the gospel. You may have that without having the Spirit. What Scripture presents is the truth, including the doctrine of the gospel, presented in divinely qualified vessels in the power of "the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven", @1 Peter 1: 12.
J.S. The Spirit would maintain the power.
{260}
J.T. That is the point to recognise, especially in our time. Of course, it was the same always, but it is stressed in John's ministry as bearing on times subsequent to the failure of the public body.
W.B-w. The second section of our chapter, verses 6 - 12, refers to the river of life, but the first section refers to the river of grace more. Is that the idea? This second section brings in life and healing with it.
J.T. Just so; so that you have what is more tangible there. There are the fruits. "And by the river, upon its bank, on the one side and on the other, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, nor their fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, for its waters issue out of the sanctuary" (@Ezekiel 47: 12). That would mean that the river is kept at the source in holiness. "And the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine" (verse 12). We can see a link with @Revelation 22. The allusion there is undoubtedly to this passage.
Ques. Would you say that in the gospels, the life is seen in Christ; and in the Acts and epistles, the life is seen more in the saints?
J.T. That is the thought, so the word "Acts" is rightly used; there is practical evidence of the activity, in the apostles and others, of the Holy Spirit. It was to show what there was in a living way in their service and testimony. Generally all was right. God approved it by taking up Luke, who gives a measured account, not overlooking certain discrepancies. The testimony of God, in the power of the Holy Spirit, is clearly set out in the service of the apostles and others. Today the doctrine of the gospel is professedly held in the denominations; Rome, for instance, holds everything nominally, even the Bible is professedly held intact, but with doctrines and practices that are utterly at variance with it; and all the so-called "orthodox" people have the doctrine of the gospel, but practically disassociated
{261}
from the Spirit, and largely, alas, connected with bad doctrines and worldliness. John's ministry shows that the Spirit must be associated with the gospel. Indeed, this is generally the thought in Scripture. Peter says, "which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven", @1 Peter 1: 12.
A.F.M. Why is there necessity for medicine as well as for food?
J.T. "The leaf thereof for medicine", showing that every fruit of the Spirit in believers has virtue in it. This marks the very profession of true christians, for the leaves refer to that. The Lord cursed the fig tree; the leaves were there, but the time of figs was not there; the fruit was not there, although it should be. But these trees refer to those who have the Spirit characteristically.
C.A.M. The leaves are the clothing of a tree. Perhaps it would be exemplified in Paul's garments, which had a healing effect.
J.T. Quite so. I think leaves are profession; but it may not go on to fruit. The fig tree had the leaves, but the Lord cursed it. The trees in our chapter have fruit for food, and hence they are truly living and their leaves are for medicine.
J.S. Is that not what we have in christendom today -- plenty of profession but very little virtue?
J.T. That is right. There is no virtue in that because of the relation of it; whereas with a person who is characteristically indwelt by the Spirit there is virtue in everything; his profession is virtuous.
Ques. Jude says, "praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God" (@Jude 20, 21). Would that be the way the leaves are seen, and help all by influence?
J.T. Quite so. "Keep yourselves in the love of God". Those kept in the love of God bear fruit for food and leaves for medicine.
{262}
W.B-w. Peter says, "in your faith have also virtue" (@2 Peter 1: 5); it was to the end, that they should be "neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ" (verse 8). Would that bring out fruitfulness?
J.T. Quite so. "He led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river" @Ezekiel 47: 6. Notice that: he "brought me back". It is always well to be brought back to a thing; because there are usually collateral lines of truth to the main one in any subject. "When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other" (@Ezekiel 47: 7). That would mean that there is life-giving power in the river. The soil is enriched by the river. The trees are one thing. They in themselves testify to the power of life, because they grow out of the ground. There would not be any tree without life in the ground, or without water and moisture, but then the *fruit* is touched on in verse 12.
F.H.S. With reference to pools, would Bethesda be a contrast to the river? You were referring to John's line.
J.T. Yes. It was stagnant. There was not much there. There was a little, but very little. Whereas in @John 9 it is Siloam. The comment in connection with Siloam in the prophets was that it flowed "softly". So that in chapter 9 you have positive testimony in the man as to its virtue; he says, "and having gone and washed, *I saw*" (@John 9: 11). That is the beautiful testimony. It is Siloam, a pool, of course, but it means ''Sent''.
Ques. The Spirit of Jesus did not suffer Paul to go to the east. I was thinking of these trees by the banks of the river; as if that would suggest that the river is moving towards the west, to territory that is fertile. Do you not think that was borne out in the way the apostle went, toward Philippi?
J.T. I think that indicates the dispensation in which we are. The river has flowed toward the west; flowing,
{263}
as we might say, in the language of Peter, "and it came even to me", @Acts 11: 5.
But now we must go on to @Ezekiel 48, to see a little of what follows on what we have had spiritually. It is the border of the land Israel is coming into. The extent of it. We might say, how exclusive it is! for that is the idea. It is not the greatness of the extent of it, but rather the exclusiveness of it. And what a large portion of it is appropriated for a heave-offering! It is the extent of the heave-offering that is stressed; a square of twenty-five thousand cubits; the figures given impress the mind with the idea of largeness. It is large proportionately, and of course this must add to the richness *spiritually* of the whole land. I think it is to call our attention to the reciprocal workings of the whole position. The land itself is exclusive. We are not told the exact acreage or extent of each inheritance, it is just the whole width of the land. There is nothing about the width of the particular allotments, until we come to the heave-offering. Then everything is measured most carefully in regard to the heave-offering. The portion for the sanctuary, the portion for the priests, the portion for the Levites, the portion for the prince, and the portion for the city. I think the Lord would give us instructions on that line, that we are brought into a place of exclusiveness -- richness; a large portion devoted to God.
C.A.M. Is that emphasised in the way the Lord has for some years been stressing the boundary question? Satan has made a special effort to nullify the principles involved.
J.T. You may be sure of it: where this question of boundary is ignored there is rebellion at the bottom of it. It is emphasised strongly here: the boundaries of the land. We do not come into the good of the things of God except as we abide by divine boundaries. The reciprocal working out of things is contingent on that.
{264}
Ques. Would the acceptance of the diminutive size as in contrast to the size of the whole world be important?
J.T. It is a very small bit, so I think the point is exclusiveness, and then a large portion of this small bit of land is for divine use, what God appropriates is called the heave-offering; so that the people are viewed as thinking of God: they are thinking of Him, and of His servants, the priests, the Levites, and the prince, and they are thinking of His city. All that God has specially before Him, they are providing for.
Ques. And the tribes are mentioned first; what is the force of that? Seven are mentioned first, and then the heave-offering, and then the remaining five are brought in.
J.T. I think it is a reference to the working out of love. "These are the names of the tribes" (@Ezekiel 48: 1). That is first in your mind; a class of people that are in tribal relations; they love one another. And then each man's name is identified with his allotment, that the name enters into the allotment, and the allotment supports the name; that God has apportioned everything so that each of us is fully satisfied. All is divinely fixed, and there are no irregular boundaries; we have no needs. There is no cause of friction, and then there is plenty for God in the heave-offering, for one verse, you will notice, is devoted to size. From verse 20 we see that it is a square. There is a finished thought in a *square*.
J.T.Jr. Does it bring out that we are not thinking of ourselves, but of God?
J.T. That is confirmed by the greatness of the place given to the habitation of God in the epistle to the Ephesians. You get it nowhere enlarged on as you do in Ephesians.
F.S.C. The word "shall" is used from verse 8 on in the chapter constantly. Why is that?
J.T. It is future, but that it must be so.
{265}
W.B-w. Have you any thought as to the end of chapter 47? The tribe of Joseph's portion is mentioned before you get the names. Chapter 48 opens with the names, but chapter 47, verse 13 says, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border whereby ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions" @Ezekiel 47: 13. It starts with Joseph.
J.T. That is the boundaries, the border; "ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions" @Ezekiel 47: 13. It evidently alludes typically to Christ, who is always distinguished as among the brethren. In every connection we must give Christ His true place. Joseph's two sons are found in the actual allotments, but *his* name is not mentioned in these; but his name is in the gates; he and Levi are both in the gates, so there is a wonderful reciprocation in the whole matter. It is all a love matter; God has things in His own hands, and man's will is not there.
Ques. Why does it start from the north in verse 1 of chapter 48?
J.T. It is to show how that love is at work, for Dan did not deserve this. He is not mentioned in @Revelation 7; he did not deserve it, but he is getting it in Ezekiel.
Ques. How do you contrast the use of straight lines here in the inheritance with the inheritance given in the days of Joshua, which were bounded by rivers and mountains?
J.T. There is no need of testing; the allotments in Joshua admit of possible causes of testing or annoyance between us. We are tested by each other as near to each other. The peculiar boundaries of Joshua, I think, are to bring that out, so that love might be tested and worked out in us, that we might judge ourselves; that if a brother is not pleasing to me, I might judge myself, the cause may be in myself. I think that is what
{266}
is meant. It is love in a state of things that admits of what is contrary, in Joshua; whereas here, it is love in a pleasing state of things, you might say. There is nothing to ruffle your spirit. You are not even told how much you are getting, because the point is, what you are getting you will find is right and you are not questioning it.
Ques. Do you think that Mary, Martha, and Lazarus in @John 11 would be like the Joshua setting; and @John 12 would be like the Ezekiel setting?
J.T. Very likely. Each is in his place and there is no complaint at all; whereas in the early part of chapter 11, the sisters are wondering and almost complaining. "Lord, if thou hadst been here" (@John 11: 21). There is an implied criticism in that, that the Lord should have been with them.
F.H.L. Why is the numeral five emphasised so much -- two thousand five hundred, two hundred and fifty, etc.?
J.T. There are seven tribes on the north above the sanctuary, and there are five on the south, but the numeral five has a great place throughout all the measurements, as you say. Five refers really to what lies at bottom of man morally, the exercise of his senses. There are five senses that go to make up a man, and it is the exercising of that that makes him, in a moral sense. "Have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil", @Hebrews 5: 14. Then his fingers and toes point to his ability for action as in dependence upon God.
J.H.E. Six -- six -- six would be a man rising above what he should be -- independence of God.
J.T. Yes. That is not a normal condition; the idea of a super-man, such as is now coming into evidence. No doubt the Philistine men with six fingers and six toes suggest this idea as over against David, who was marked by the idea of five -- dependence on God.
{267}
Ques. Do you think that Levi being mentioned as having part in the gates (verse 31), is to show the part the levites have in any administrative matters universally?
J.T. God is reverting to His primary thought in the twelve tribes. You did not get Ephraim and Manasseh when the twelve tribes came out of Egypt. This is sovereignty; taking up two tribes and putting them on a level with the others, and then the manipulation of two others. Joseph disappears and Ephraim and Manasseh are included in @Ezekiel 48: 1 - 7. Levi is taken out for another purpose.
F.N.W. Is there a point in the fact that Judah is next to the heave-offering?
J.T. It is between him and Benjamin, as it was at the beginning. It is to call attention to the peculiar working out of love between Benjamin and Judah. You go back to the history of Benjamin and Judah. They are strikingly linked together. Judah had a beautiful touch in regard of Benjamin in speaking to Joseph. So that as they were situated in the land in Joshua's day, evidently Jerusalem was actually in Benjamin's territory (@Joshua 18: 28). How did it come to Judah? Benjamin gave way. It is the principle of giving way. Love will give way. It will not contend for its rights. There was an excellent relation between those two tribes. It was said of Benjamin, "The beloved of Jehovah", @Deuteronomy 33:12. The beloved of Jehovah will give way. But then it says, the Lord will "dwell between his shoulders". That is, He honoured him, but in result the sanctuary was in the territory of Judah. Jerusalem was the city of the great King and the great King belonged to Judah. I think it is to bring out what these two men were: Judah and Benjamin; the beautiful relation between one and another; and now here they are, Judah is on the north. As soon as he is mentioned you must have the sanctuary because he is that kind of man. Benjamin is the other kind of man
{268}
that will give way, and make room for a greater than himself.
A.R. Does the reference in verse 8 here go back to @Psalm 114: 2, "Judah was his sanctuary"?
J.T. I think it does. "Judah was his sanctuary, Israel his dominion". We have to find out how that was, because the facts in Exodus do not show it. No doubt the allusion is anticipative of the place that Judah would have in David and Solomon and the final position of the sanctuary.
Rem. When Paul went up to see Peter the lines were straight; but when Peter came down to Antioch the lines were ragged, and they had to be straightened.
A.B.P. Would you say that @Luke 10: 25 suggests the matter of the neighbour must be settled before the matter of eternal life can be enjoyed?
J.T. Quite so. Brethren dwelling together in unity, as the basis for eternal life, confirms this (@Psalm 133).
A.R. What have you to say about verse 30?
J.T. "These are the goings out of the city. On the north side, four thousand and five hundred cubits by measure. And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one. And at the east side four thousand and five hundred, and three gates: the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one. And at the south side four thousand and five hundred cubits by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one" (@Ezekiel 48: 30 - 33). The twelve tribes are now in another setting. It seems to me that our minds ought to be on the tribes in this chapter; because it is the finish. "These are the names of the tribes". And then their allotments and then their positions in the gates, as if they are the ones. They are the climax of all this instruction, and you want to be amongst them, each having his place in the city.
{269}
W.F.K. Would you say a word on the heave-offering?
J.T. The heave-offering is, as we said, presented on a large scale. We have a large square, showing the fulness of it, and variety of it, too. Every interest is taken care of; every distinctive interest such as the priest, the Levite and the prince. They are all taken care of in the heave-offering; meaning that the saints are thoroughly in the mind of God. The saints are co-operative with the brethren who are serving; ready to support them freely, and in doing so they are ministering to God. So this is the finish, and it seems to me, a wonderful finish. The tribes are in their place and it is in the city; corresponding with Revelation, and then "Round about it was eighteen thousand cubits; and the name of the city from that day, Jehovah is there" -- Jehovah Shammah (@Ezekiel 48: 35). He can be there under those conditions. It is the saints viewed in this dignified way under divine manipulation. You are just where God would have you, and I am just where God would have me. And God says, I am satisfied with that; I am there.
C.A.M. Is that not what all the current ministry is tending to? The culminating thing is the presence of God.
J.T. Quite so. What is it if there is not a place for God? Ephesians gives us the full thought in regard to the habitation of God in the Spirit. He is really there according to all His blessed feelings and interest in us in detail.

MARRIAGE IN THE LORD
@1 Corinthians 9: 5; @Revelation 19: 7,8
What is in mind in reading these verses is to call attention to the relation of sister and brother, which according to Scripture is to precede the marital relation, not now in the natural sense, but in the spiritual; what we need to be concerned about is the spiritual aspect of what is before us, how a marriage among the people of God is to contribute to the testimony of God. It is often otherwise, for the reason that the brotherly and sisterly relation according to God is not in mind before the contract is entered into.
Much sorrow is occasioned by unholy marriages. Alas! a brother or sister entering into this relation with one who is not a believer can only end in sorrow and disaster. Indeed spiritually, it cannot be otherwise, and so the brotherly and sisterly relation is of great importance, and young people are to have this in mind.
These happy occasions are used of the Lord to instruct us, not only those who are the principals for the time, but all of us, parents, children, sisters and brothers, that our selections may be in the Lord, and it says, "only in the Lord". There is a certain latitude allowed in Scripture in the selection of husband or wife, as it says, "She is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord", @1 Corinthians 7: 39. Hence a very wholesome, indeed a holy restriction is imposed on young people, inside of which they are safe, but outside of which they are exposed to the enemy, and the testimony, with which they are identified nominally, is damaged.
So that we find with the early men of faith, the sisterly relation was insisted upon. Abraham stands out as a great parent, a great father. "High father" his first name "Abram" meant, involving moral elevation. He could take on elevated relationships. His
{271}
whole course was one of separation. He represents the heavenly man, one of whom it is said that "God is not ashamed ... to be called their God", @Hebrews 11:16.
Sarah was his sister -- his wife was his sister -- and, as Isaac is seen offered up in type in @Genesis 22, immediately we have Rebecca introduced as related to Isaac. Her genealogy is given as related to Isaac, and then we have Abraham's considered determination that the wife of Isaac must be related to him on sisterly lines, and not a foreigner. Foreign wives were prohibited in Israel later, Nehemiah calling our special attention to Solomon, the like of whom there was not in his day, yet he became damaged by foreign alliances.
So Abraham was careful -- exceedingly careful, to the extent of causing an oath to be taken -- that the wife of his son must be related to him. In other words, that marriage must be "in the Lord". It is imperative. And so Isaac in his time took it upon him, and Rebecca, a holy woman, we might say, like Sarah, directed that Jacob must also select a wife from her relatives.
The wives of Esau were a cause of grief, they were Canaanitish -- unbelieving foreigners. I stress all this, that we might be helped of the Lord. He must be considered first in these selections -- only in the Lord. That is, the wife must be a sister, the husband a brother, and not simply christians, as we say -- great as the word christian is, but in our minds apt to be reduced to a common level and lose its spiritual significance. The disciples were first called christians at Antioch, but not in the sense in which persons may be called christians now. It was a divine thought. The word had great significance, but now it has lost it very largely. It is not simply that a person is a nominal believer, known to be a christian in the ordinary, common sense of the word, but he or she is to be known to be "in the Lord", that is, the Lord has His rights, and has been consulted in the matter. Anything contrary to Him has to be refused by the brethren, and adherence
{272}
to it becomes the occasion of discipline, for the term "in the Lord" among the saints is not an empty term, but involves power. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" @1 Corinthians 10: 22. The Lord has to say to us in these matters, and where His will is disregarded we may look for discipline, if not among the saints, certainly from Him. As we read, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep", @1 Corinthians 11: 30. So that it is imperative that these relationships be "in the Lord", and we shalt find that it is *wisdom* that they should be so. How different to have the Lord with us than to have Him against us. If He is against us are we stronger than He? But how happy to have the Lord with us!
Then, further, He has said, "I will be to you for a Father", @2 Corinthians 6:18. How precious a thought that is. First you come out from among them, you are separate, and in these relations God says, "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters". How happy that is! How it foretells blessing in such a relation as our dear brother and sister have entered into.
So the apostle here says, "Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife?" @1 Corinthians 9: 5. A sister! I have pointed out how that in patriarchal times this was insisted upon, and in the Song of Solomon the same relation exists between the bride and bridegroom. He calls her his sister, his spouse. So that before the natural there are the spiritual communications and relations, happy spiritual relations and communion as brother and sister. The natural will find its place, that is the husbandly and wifely relations, as the brotherly and sisterly have their place; and these never should lose their place, because in the assembly the wifely relation ceases, but not the brotherly and sisterly relations, merging into the precious thought of brethren, which really is the higher thought of the two, and goes beyond death, whereas the marital relations do not go
{273}
beyond death. The thought of brother and sister does, for the idea of brethren enters into eternity.
Well, that is all I had to say for the benefit of our dear brother and sister, as well as all of us, particularly the young ones here, because these matters are of much more importance to the testimony than we are apt to think. We are apt to confine them too much to the natural side, whereas the testimony must be always in mind.
In Revelation it is Christ and the assembly. It will be observed that in @Revelation 19 it is the marriage of the Lamb and His wife, not His bride. We are not living in the bridal period, that is future properly, although Scripture speaks considerably about the bride and bridegroom, but the bridal period is future. It is in chapter 21 of the book. Here it is His wife, because what is in mind is the suffering time, the Lamb. It is a time of suffering, and what is needed is the wife. A bride is more ceremonial, more for show. As attached to the assembly presently it will be shown in the proper sense -- she comes down from heaven adorned as a bride for her husband.
In this chapter 19 it is not the bride but the wife, for the reason evidently that it is the suffering time. What is needed in suffering is not show and ceremony, but simple and mutual confidence. It is what is needed now and the Lord looks for and finds that in the assembly now. It is vital to His interests in the assembly now. The remarkable thing is that the bride is called the wife before the marriage. "And his wife" -- not His bride, she is alluded to as His wife -- "has made herself ready". She is ready, and the readiness involves practical righteousness -- indeed the word is plural, the righteousnesses of the saints.
That is the general spiritual position, dear brethren. I am at liberty to speak of it at a time like this as our thoughts rise to Christ and the assembly. What a thought that is for us: the thought of the wife being
{274}
true and loyal to Christ in this suffering time, in this time of His rejection, those who are loyal in a wifely way sharing in His suffering.
So the marriage is coming -- the great display proper to the union of Christ and the assembly. Chapter 21 depicts it for us, but here it is to remind us that He is looking for wifely devotedness and loyalty, that His interests may be looked after now in the time of His absence.

SOLOMON'S WORKMEN
@2 Chronicles 2: 17,18; @1 Kings 5: 13 - 18; @1 Corinthians 3: 5 - 15
J.T. Workers are in mind to be considered. There is this great army of workers and no age limit is prescribed. In the earlier typical references we have age limits. The increasing ages of the youth made them liable for service in the army, and also as in levitical service according to Numbers.
So that, whilst inquiry will be confined largely to these three scriptures, the question of age must not be overlooked. The first typical references that are in Numbers bear on all Israel. The military requirement was very large; the Levites are given from a month old and upward. We find some twenty-two thousand taken instead of the firstborn of all Israel, but only about eight thousand of them in actual service. According to the age limits, some would be passing out of service and others coming in all the time.
These descriptions in Numbers, applying also to the army, bear on us now. The older ones are more or less incapacitated by age and other infirmities, so that the bearing of the application is on youth. The Lord seems to be pointing to the youth now; many are coming into the light and into the fellowship. So that what is before us today is to see their place in the service, the need being great, inclusive of all young brothers and sisters. The sisterhood spiritually seems to be coming up for review.
Our scriptures speak directly of the building of the house, and it is worthy of thought for the moment why there should be such a number employed; a hundred
{276}
and fifty-three thousand "strangers"; seventy thousand being bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand to be stone-masons; and three thousand and six hundred being overseers, besides the thirty thousand of Israel under the heading of a levy, these receiving more consideration than the strangers. All these typical references bear clearly on the passage read in 1 Corinthians, where the building is directly in view, and everyone who builds is in mind. There is no doubt the vast number would have in view the continuance of the building; for it is going on now as it was in the apostle's day.
J.C.T. What had you in mind in the Israelite receiving more consideration than the stranger in this work?
J.T. It would allude to spiritual development in the workers, I think. With the hundred and fifty-three thousand there is no special consideration; I suppose they allude to the younger, and to the comparative arduousness of their position; they are just numbered and put to work. They come down from David's regime, so that we have to consider them in relation to Him, who Himself was a Sufferer and Worker beyond measure, that is, the Lord Jesus viewed as the antitype of David. In that respect He is the great example of toiling; the work is always there, abundance of it: "Lift up your eyes", He said to His disciples, "and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest", @John 4: 35. "Other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours" (verse 38). It was just a question at that particular juncture whether they were labouring very much. They were just engaged in something that one or two of them could have done alone, buying provisions.
F.C.H. Do you mean that David had felt what it was to be a stranger himself?
J.T. David being mentioned in Chronicles in connection with this subject, the mind is directed to him, as to what his experiences were; applied to the Lord, who wrought like Him? He tells us in spirit in Zechariah,
{277}
"I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for man acquired me as bondman from my youth" @Zechariah 13: 5. That is a remarkable statement: it points to the readiness with which He served, taking on anything that was needed to be done without any thought of honour or dignity, which is important especially for young ones entering the service. It is not to make much of us; we are to do what is to be done; as the apostle says, "these hands have ministered to my wants, and to those who were with me", @Acts 20: 34. He was ready to do anything that was needed; as the Lord says, "*I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves", @Luke 22: 27. That is, He did anything that was needed: very touching!
Ques. Is it your thought that every one of us should be engaged in profitable labour for the house?
J.T. In the light of the Lord's remarks and Paul's remarks, how can any of us excuse ourselves at all -- how can any believer excuse himself from doing necessary work? There were those at Thessalonica who worked not at all; well, the apostle says, You must shrink from them, they are to be put under discipline.
F.C.H. The Lord speaks of the one of the ten lepers who returned as a stranger (@Luke 17: 18).
J.T. Strangership did not prevent him, on the contrary, the spirit of service was there with him.
F.C.H. He entered into the spirit of service from the beginning.
Ques. Was that dependent on his appreciation of Christ?
J.T. Quite so. Strangership is often brought in in Scripture, to show that God is working in others besides those who are in the place of outward relationship with Him, as in the case of the ten lepers, and the Samaritan of @Luke 10.
Ques. What do you think would help us to enter into this labour?
J.T. Well, one thing that ought to appeal to us is the example of the Lord, seen in the gospels, also of
{278}
the apostles and others seen in the Acts; and the epistles. And then, what example there is in the older brethren now. The last is to be taken to heart, for, after all, the coming generation must learn from the one passing away. The young ought to be brought up with the understanding that the work has to go on.
We have another set of labourers in the Scriptures -- the Gibeonites, "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation", @Joshua 9: 21. Christ is said to have supplied the water for Israel, the Rock that followed them: "that Rock was Christ", @1 Corinthians 10: 4. He was a Water Carrier. It is a most touching thought. It is not simply that He was smitten, He was smitten as the Rock, but He *followed* them: the Ark went before, facing the exigencies of the wilderness, the opposition, to find out a resting place for the saints, and the Rock followed with the water. So that we have examples in abundance, both in the Lord Himself and in His earlier servants. But what is evidenced now in those of us who are older?
E.S.B. Why did the Gibeonites come into this service as a result of the curse of Joshua?
J.T. They came in that way, but they came under covenant. Joshua made a covenant with them, that they should live, thus putting them under protection; and Saul's descendants accordingly suffered because of interfering with them. So, as coming under covenant, taken on by God, whatever the preceding history, we are under His protection: that is a great matter.
Take the maid Rhoda, in the house of Mary the mother of Mark; she served and was persecuted because she served, but she stood by her service; showing how young people ought to serve today.
C.O.B. These workers were not volunteers, they were numbered by Solomon.
J.T. Conscription governs service or work in the divine system, it is not optional. I may say, "Here am I", @Isaiah 6: 8; God loves that, but it is obligatory on us,
{279}
it is not optional; any refusal of it would come under discipline.
C.O.B. Our wills do not come into the service.
J.T. That is the point, I think, in the hundred and fifty-three thousand and the levy too; a number of persons put under obligation to serve. It is a question of Solomon's ordering. The Lord says to His disciples, "When ye shall have done all things that have been ordered you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen; we have done what it was our duty to do", @Luke 17: 10. Well, what is it our duty to do? It is what these hundred and fifty-three thousand had to do. It is arbitrary, but in time we shall find we have a wonderful Master. Boaz may be viewed thus as a type: a most gracious master; but there must be the acceptance of the obligation to begin with, the acceptance of the authority of Solomon. We shall never be effective servants until we bow to the obligation resting upon us. An optional attitude amongst the brethren is most damaging. The youth are especially damaged in that way.
Rem. The question is asked, "Why stand ye here all the day idle?" @Matthew 20: 6.
J.T. Quite so: they were ready, but no man had hired them. That brings up another matter; any of us who may be working for the Lord in our simple, humble way, the leading religious organisations would not hire us at all. That is a humbling thing, but it exposes *them* rather than us.
Ques. You have referred to the workers in John and Luke and Matthew; do we see the completion of it in Mark: "the Lord working with them", @Mark 16: 20?
J.T. Quite so; that would be the true Boaz, He is sitting "at the right hand of God" (verse 19), but working. Paul sets out in a most striking way the labours and sufferings that go with service.
G.C.S. Paul says to Timothy, "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word
{280}
of truth", @2 Timothy 2: 15. Does that suggest accuracy as in service and building?
J.T. That is good; you are coming to *skilled* labour, we have to come to that. But we must consider the rough, heavy burden bearers first.
Rem. Even when they were on constructive lines.
J.T. Yes; you have to get the rough material, but those engaged in it are hardly skilled labourers.
Ques. Does @1 John 3: 16 apply? "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives". That is an obligation, is it not?
J.T. "Ought" implies obligation. These strangers have no option at all, and I believe they refer to the generality of workers. In order to enter on the work of God we have to see that the Lord has absolute ownership of us, we belong to Him. Their strangership placed them in the position of slaves, a most salutary attitude to take up; for we shall never enter on the more skilled and honoured services that 1 Kings has in mind save as we acknowledge the Lord's rights over us.
A.D.T. Does the reference to John Mark help? "Paul thought it not well to take with them him who had abandoned them, going back from Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work", @Acts 15: 38. Then in @2 Timothy 4: 11: "Take Mark, and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry". Would that not be a warning to us and also an encouragement?
J.T. Yes; he lost ground, although he seemed to start well. He came from a good household, for I understand that the prayer meeting was held in his mother's house (@Acts 12). John Mark's mother was evidently a godly woman; but the failure to recognise the good service of Rhoda would indicate declension, and this may be the explanation of his breakdown. There was another thing, too: they were praying and yet did not believe they would get the answer. That
{281}
condition in christian households is apt to damage the young in relation to their service. Drilling for service is in early youth. That is the idea of the strangers here, they belong to the king; there is no question about it. Their strangership obliges them to be absolutely subservient.
J.L.A. With regard to the thought of obligation, would what Paul speaks of in @Acts 20: 35 bear on that? "I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive".
J.T. Well, exactly, wherever you have obligation laid upon you, that is the principle.
R.D. "A master roughly worketh every one", @Proverbs 26: 10.
J.T. "Roughly worketh every one", that would mean, I suppose, that they are taken on raw, but absolute subjection must be there.
Rem. As to what you were saying as to youth being conscripted into service, in Mark's gospel the Lord saw the two sons of Zebedee, and "he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him", @Mark 1: 20. He would make them something.
J.T. They left a good going business; that is another matter. Another thing that might help, is to call attention to the three thousand six hundred overseers in the passage in Chronicles and those mentioned in Kings, too; that is, the potential ability in the very youngest workers of developing into overseers. That is, purchasing to ourselves "a good degree", @1 Timothy 3: 13. Why these three thousand six hundred were selected is not stated; the secret of their qualifications is not given, but they are made overseers, which, of course, would be a higher level than that occupied by the hundred and fifty thousand. It is a very important thing to have the element of overseeing taken on in this way at
{282}
the beginning; that is, you will not let things go by the board, as we say, discrepancies will be noted. Take Abigail's young man, he scented the danger of disaster, and acquainted Abigail with the fact; he might have let it go had he been careless, but he did not. He represents a person who loves the Lord and the interests of the saints, and anything going amiss is his matter.
F.C.H. Is it something like the young man in @Acts 23: 16, "Paul's sister's son"?
J.T. Yes, the brethren seem to have been very remiss; not one of their names is mentioned after Paul was arrested in Jerusalem. That young man did a very remarkable service.
J.C.T. Had Timothy purchased to himself "a good degree"? He was known to the brethren in two districts and well reported of, and Paul would have him "go forth with him", @Acts 16: 3. Had he qualified?
J.T. Quite so; and continued to qualify, for in the Corinthian crisis the enemy was trying to damage the whole assembly, and Paul could send him there; a young man to go into the midst of it and represent Paul, that they might learn in Timotheus what spirit marked the apostle.
J.C.T. Brothers are encouraged in @1 Timothy 3: 1 to aspire to oversight.
J.T. That is another thing: eldership is within our range and we have to be qualified on moral lines. Overseers must have suitable qualifications; no one can rule others if he does not rule himself Evidently these men qualified. Solomon was very methodical, and we may be sure he had the matter investigated as to the persons he appointed to rule. Even in regard to the brethren of Joseph, Pharaoh inquired as to whether there were any capable of overseeing. What scope there is for such service, and hence the importance of purchasing to ourselves "a good degree".
F.W.K. "Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the
{283}
end that thou fulfil it", @Colossians 4: 17, That was to stir him up.
J.T. Exactly, to stir him up; and Timotheus, too, "stir up the gift of God, which is in thee" (@2 Timothy 1: 6) -- really, rekindle it.
P.H.H. In @Mark 13: 34, He gave "to his bondmen the authority, and to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch". Would these features go together? Would the watching be in line with the authority, in oversight of what is being done?
J.T. Quite so: I suppose you may see it throughout, in the epistles and in the Lord's own service. Here, the principle of authority is always present.
A.W.P. Would the spirit of desire enter into what you are saying?
J.T. In the antitype, the principle is that the work is carried on by old and young, by experienced and inexperienced, by gift and by those who have no special gift. So that alertness in the young will lead them to see what is within their range, as we have been saying, purchasing "to themselves a good degree". That is illustrated in the seven deacons appointed according to @Acts 6: 3, men "full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom"; they were to be that. The apostles said, "It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables", @Acts 6: 2. Their work was regarded as beyond that, whereas these seven required no gift; deaconal work is not gift, but a question of moral qualification. Evidently they all qualify for deacon's service, but two of them purchased "to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith"; that is, Stephen and Philip. As a result the other five might say, That is within our range also, within the range of all, why should not *we* go in for the service wholeheartedly? So that the scattered ones preached and Antioch is the outcome. Paul and Barnabas come in
{284}
later, and give character to the work. It developed into an assembly. But the scattered ones were workers; they did the rough work, so to speak. Philip "preached the Christ", @Acts 8: 5. "The Christ" conveys the thought of operation: He is the model for every worker -- "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts", @Ephesians 3:17. We are to develop in skill. Philip started and attained great heights in evangelical work, so much so that he was raptured, taken away by the Spirit, so much was the Spirit pleased with him.
But then this thirty thousand in @1 Kings 5 have to be considered: "And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel" (verse 13); these are Israelites having a greater status. "And the levy was thirty thousand men. And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy" (verses 13, 14). Adoniram must have been a man of great distinction. Now we have skilled labour: "And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountains; besides the overseers whom Solomon had set over the work, three thousand three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work" (verses 15, 16). So that the work is now proceeding with skilled labour and burden bearers.
Ques. Why is it, "a month ... in Lebanon, two months at home" (verse 14)?
J.T. That refers to the consideration our Master has for us. The Lord would become known as our Master. It is a remarkable thing that the prayer in @Acts 4 is addressed as by slaves to a master; so that the Lord is apprehended in that way in the beginning, and here we have great consideration suggested. "A month they were in Lebanon, two months at home"; that is to say, continuous labour will not do. We need *home* experience or there will not be development of the family. God not only wants workers, but He wants sons, and sonship must keep pace with workmanship.
{285}
E.S.B. Do we see the Lord's consideration for the seventy in saying, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while", @Mark 6: 31?
J.T. Yes. Suppose you met them on the way, they would not be holiday-makers, with sports coats, tennis rackets, and all that; it was *needed* rest; and this would bring about better service. I think the two months at home would suggest God's concern about His sons. We must retain in our toil the spirit of sonship, the spirit of the family.
H.W.S. Is it like the Lord saying, "rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens", @Luke 10: 20?
J.T. Yes.
F.C.H. What had you in mind in the levy? -- were you connecting it with @Acts 13?
J.T. I would say that Saul and Barnabas belong to the thirty thousand (@1 Kings 5: 13,14). They, too, had to be developed. Saul appears at once as a preacher of the Son of God, but the principle of the heavy burden bearers was there, and is seen in @Acts 9. The Lord on His own initiative directed Saul to go into the city; I think that is the principle of the hundred and fifty-three thousand (@2 Chronicles 2: 17, 18). It is first, "rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do", @Acts 9: 6. It was imperative. The Lord could have told him all, but he must go to the brethren, bringing in the principle of overseership. He very quickly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God, which I think would enter into these two months at home. I think that would be the basis, that sonship must be understood and maintained in our souls. Then there is another thing, skilled labour of the highest type is seen at Antioch. Barnabas, being a man of great vigilance, knew a good workman, the kind of man needed at Antioch, and brought him there; and we are told that for a whole year they taught in the assembly. It was a "large crowd" (@Acts 11: 26) that was taught,
{286}
rough material, you might say, but the idea of the assembly being present, it is the gradual merging of the crowd into what is structural. The assembly that was formed was marked by spiritual men.
Rem. That links on with Corinthians -- the structural idea -- "ye are ... God's building" (verse 9).
J.T. That is what we are coming to.
Ques. Would the "great stones, costly stones, hewn stones" be in keeping with the ministry of Paul and John and Peter? Would these features have a bearing on those who went home? So that there would be the matter of exercise and pressure in the mountains, but rest and recuperation in the home.
J.T. I suppose their work would be more efficient as having the home experience; for us it would be assembly experience, so that we apprehend what is needed. We get measures in the assembly, quality in the assembly, and our work is therefore intelligent, we know what is needed. I believe sonship underlies all skilled work in the service of God.
A.E.L. How do you bring in the thought of sonship? Is it in connection with Solomon as son?
J.T. Well, Solomon, of course, shows typically the primary thought of sonship as seen in Nathan's message to David (@2 Samuel 7: 14). It was a question of the house; much was made of the thought of the house, even David's house was provided for for "a great while to come", @2 Samuel 7: 19. Solomon represents all that; he is the son. Thus the home here ("two months at home"), is the place of sonship. The idea is not workmanship in the home; Lebanon is the place for the workers, but the home is the place for the development of intelligent affection. That must enter into our service. Who can preach the gospel rightly except a son? Paul says, "God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", @Galatians 1: 15, 16.
{287}
J.S. Would the toil and labour of David and what he secured in his affliction bring in the thought of the levy? As you have said, it is not optional; and would Solomon bring in refinement?
J.T. @1 Chronicles 22 contains the record of the result of David's affliction, the material, not the finished material, but the rough material. That is why one thought it should have a place in this inquiry. He is mentioned in our chapter as taking account of the strangers, but now we are dwelling on the thought of sonship in service in the home.
N.K.M. Would you say a further word as to the features of the work of "stone-masons in the mountains"?
J.T. It says, "Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountains" (verse 15). They are not building, they are preparing the stones. The word 'mason' is usually connected with builders, but evidently they would be preparing the stones; there are eighty thousand of them, ten thousand more than the burden bearers. They would refer, I suppose, to work such as gospel service in which the Son of God is preached. I do not think you can grasp the idea entering into these men's work in the antitype save as we have sonship, because the "living stones" are those who believe in the Son of God. Paul says, in the great work in Corinth, "the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)", @2 Corinthians 1: 19. The three of them preached the Son of God. I suppose the idea would be that it was set out in the three of them, in their minds, Christ in that light. How could they become stones otherwise?
E.S.B. "All the building fitly framed together" (@Ephesians 2: 21); the stones are made ready so that there is no further preparatory workmanship required.
J.T. There was no noise there: so Peter, who understands material says: "To whom coming, a
{288}
living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house", @1 Peter 2: 4, 5. Not prepared, but each put into his place; that is, I hope, going on in this room. That is how it goes on, it is a silent work. There is noise in the service in the mountain, but there is the silent work. It happens in these services that souls get light and take their place secretly.
F.W.K. Does the apostle refer to this when he says, "So have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation", @Romans 15: 20? He was moving in the glad tidings in an extensive way.
J.T. Well, that brings us to what is before us in 1 Corinthians.
P.H.H. Before you go on to that, with regard to the ten thousand extra stone-masons over the burden bearers, would that suggest that in assembly matters there is always to be a forward movement in what is positive? No matter how many exercises there are to be borne, would the ten thousand extra stone-masons suggest something being constructed all the time?
J.T. Well, it would seem that more of them were needed, and no doubt their work would mean a reduction of labour for the burden bearers. They prepared the rough material, and would remove what was extraneous. The ten thousand extra, I suppose, would be for this work. We hear of persons being converted, but have any masons had to do with them? So it seems that more masons are needed than burden bearers. A man may get so many converts, but how many of them come into fellowship and fit into the assembly? All that, I suppose, enters into this extra ten thousand.
Rem. The stone-mason's work is particularly to fit the individuals to have their part in the assembly.
J.T. Quite so.
P.H.H. Do you connect it with finishing work?
{289}
J.T. Yes, the stones are to be made to fit into the building. There is more said in verse 17, "And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the house. And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Giblites hewed them, and prepared timber and stones to build the house". The Giblites are skilled in stone work. We are not told how many there were, but I think they point to greater skill in the work; skill, I think, is the leading thought now. We hear every week now, thank God, of young people coming in and confessing the Lord; but skilled labour is needed that they might be put into the building; so that takes us to @1 Corinthians 3, where the apostle says he is "a wise architect" (verse 10). "I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it". Then further he says: "Now if any one build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is. If the work of any one which he has built upon the foundation shall abide, he shall receive a reward. If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through the fire" (verses 12 - 15). This brings out the building from the standpoint of responsibility In @Matthew 16 Christ is the Builder, there is no discrepancy there; but it is a question now of our responsibility, any one of us might build, but the question is, What do I put into the building?
A.D.T. Would you say a word on the thought of "God's fellow-workmen"?
J.T. That is important as coming into the subject, referring to Paul and those labouring with him, linking on with chapter 6 of the second epistle, where we have a similar reference: "as fellow-workmen" (verse 1), or, as it is literally, 'jointly labouring'. So that we have
{290}
the workmen linked on with God, which is a most precious thought. What can be more exalted than to be workers with God? And, of course, it peculiarly fits in with these epistles, because there were those ostensibly working who were not real, they might be cast away at the end.
Ques. Is what is built to be consistent with the foundation?
J.T. That is the point here; Paul's work, I suppose, was almost all there was so far. We must remember the Corinthians were spiritually only about two years old, and the apostle's leaving exposed them to the wicked one, who was trying to destroy the work; but the foundation, the apostle's work, stood.
C.O.B. "Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets", @Ephesians 2: 20.
J.T. It is remarkable that the apostles are brought into it; the apostles, I suppose, represent the insistence on Christ's authority, and the prophet brings God into the work: the apostle says in the first letter that one affected by prophetic ministry would report that God was among them (@1 Corinthians 14: 25).
J.C.T. He passes from the thought of husbandry to building, what is the connection?
J.T. Husbandry is not our subject, it is building; but still the agricultural thought is connected with the structural thought here and elsewhere: "Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house", @Proverbs 24: 27. We must have the field, we must have the support its produce affords; but this building is the point the apostle is stressing, because there were those who were putting in bad stuff, and that is seen everywhere now, so the chapter is most important for us: "let every man take heed how he buildeth".
P.H.H. It says in @2 Corinthians 11:13 that some were "false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ". Paul goes on to
{291}
say here, "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (verse 11). Would that give the suggestion as to the kind of work?
J.T. Yes, it is the moral side, I think. There is another thought of foundation in @Matthew 16: 16, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". It is sonship entered into, but Messiahship too, "the Christ"; but here it is Jesus Christ, not even Christ Jesus, it is the *moral* side. Jesus Christ is more what He was down here. That is where the character of Christ is seen, and that must enter into the building -- the moral features of Christ.
Rem. That *kind* of man.
J.T. Exactly.
F.C.H. And would the gold carry on with your thought of sonship?
J.T. What subsists through the fire is contemplated here.
Ques. With regard to the thought of fellow-workmen, do you think that there is a preservative element in working together?
J.T. I suppose Jonathan would help us. One has thought of him as in @1 Samuel 14, where it is a question of Saul, who could never build a house for God; he himself was foreign material such as we have all around us now, today; without accusing anyone, the leaders are not to be trusted. Jonathan "did not tell his father" (@1 Samuel 14: 1). I believe the work today requires that we proceed, making no inquiry at all of the religious leaders of the day. It is not only withdrawing from iniquity, but also from vessels to dishonour. Jonathan took counsel with his armour-bearer; they were two men on their hands and knees, but they are working with God. I believe that enters into our work at the present time.
J.C.T. The condition of things publicly makes the work more arduous. Twice Jonathan says, "Come and let us go"; and then there is the response of the young
{292}
man, "behold, I am with thee according to thy heart" (verse 7); and then both show themselves.
J.T. Workers with God, showing themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. That is what Christ was here, coming out, according to the circumstances, to the enemy. It is as we show ourselves in that character there will be victory.
Ques. Should all workmen have the completed structure in mind?
J.T. Yes; I suppose Paul would have that as "a wise architect".
{293}
DIVINE RESOURCE
@Ezekiel 47: 1 - 14, 22, 23
What is in mind, dear brethren, this evening is divine resource, flowing out and becoming available to us. The section of this book, in which I have read, beginning with chapter 40 to the end of the book, is unique in Scripture. It is marked by measurement, not generally of what should exist and does not, but of what actually exists -- specially the house of God. Most of the section is taken up with this structure and its approaches, and accompanying and accessory buildings, but all viewed as existent. This chapter contemplates the sanctuary as existing, divinely measured, that we might have the concrete thing before us. It is to exist in actuality in the future and in every way according to God.
This chapter represents the resources flowing out thence, so that God's people should be provisioned, furnished with what is requisite, that our outward circumstances might be in keeping with what is within, that there should be no discrepancy, and hence this figurative river, one of many spoken of in Scripture. The subject indeed is one of the most interesting and ancient, beginning in Eden and extending on to the millennium, which, indeed, this chapter has in mind, linked on not only verbally but spiritually with the last chapter of the Bible. The apostle John, undoubtedly conversant with the prophet Ezekiel, is led in his ministry to present to us the thought of river, not in that case flowing out of the house so called, but out of the *city* (@Revelation 22). John has in mind the Holy Spirit as moving administratively; Ezekiel sees a dwelling -- a house. The city indeed is in view in Ezekiel, for we are told in chapter 40 that he is brought in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and he sees "the building of a city, on the south"; on arriving there, however, he
{294}
finds a man with a measuring reed and flax cord, but there is no reference to the city. What is presented to him immediately is the house or its approaches, and what I have to say now refers to the building of God in which we have part in our own times -- in fact we are it. In christianity the divine dwelling is a heavenly construction, effected in the power of the Spirit, as is indicated in the book of Acts. We are told that Peter saw a sheet knit at the four corners and containing all kinds of creatures, let down from heaven. Peter says, "it came even to me" @Acts 11: 5. A privileged man indeed, and yet not specially so, in a way, for the Spirit of God would bring it even to each one of us; in fact, that is what He is doing, bringing the idea of the divine dwelling near to us. I am not saying the sheet is exactly that, but it is the suggestion of what is heavenly, come down to earth in testimony and then returning. It is essentially heavenly. This chapter in Ezekiel has in mind that we should be furnished in regard of it, that the outgoings of the house, involving the saints, might be according to what is inside.
As I have been saying, the subject that is before us is extensive, beginning in Eden and extending to the end of the millennium. We have in @Psalm 65, alongside the reference to the river of God, a beautiful expression; it is said there, that it is *full* of water. Over against the river of God there is man's river. The Nile is a type of this, seen in this book of Ezekiel. A river is symbolical of resource, and the Nile is this in a worldly sense. Heaven affords but little rain to Egypt. It is dependent upon its river, and Pharaoh, leaving God out of the matter, says, "My river is mine own, and I made it for myself", @Ezekiel 29: 3. He represents the world leaving God out, and using what God supplies, without God -- a most sorrowful situation -- strikingly illustrated every day in every restaurant in London and elsewhere. How few bow their heads to thank God for their food, for His bounty in His creation! That is Pharaoh. His
{295}
river is his own, he says. God is left out and Pharaoh exploits it for his own glory and satisfaction, but God has His river, the river of God. That is what is in mind, and it is seen here in @Ezekiel 47.
Having in our own minds the picture of these wonderful suggestions, these things measured, we shall understand more clearly how the river flows, by placing ourselves where the prophet was, at the door of the house in the inner court. It is the inner court, the altar is there, and the waters flowed out of the house on the right side, on the south side of the altar; for the house, as always, looks toward the east. That is, the prospect of the house of God is glorious, the rising sun is typical of the rising glory of the coming Saviour. We are looking for Him. This river issues forth, the prophet tells us, on the south side of the altar in the inner court, for that is where the altar is. There was an outer court. The prophet is led by his guide and his instructor our of the north gate -- the gate of discipline, as I may say. That is one of the accompanying features of the house of God -- discipline. Peter says, "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God", and then he adds, "if it first begin at us" -- for it begins at *us* -- "what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?" @1 Peter 4: 17. The prophet is led through the north gate, and finds the waters still flowing; they come out at the right side of the east gate.
Then we come to the man with the measuring line. He is there so as to bring the believer experimentally into what this means. There are four measurings, all alike, one thousand cubits each time; each leading to deeper waters, all referring to our experience. The depth of the river is not given by the man with the measuring line: it is given by the person who enters in; its depth is according to experience; how far can we enter into these things? We can test ourselves by the Scripture and determine how far we have gone in this wonderful experience of grace. Am I an 'ankle'
{296}
man, a man who has never ventured into deep waters, content just to be in things, in the waters from the ankle down? It is clear that such experience is small, but nevertheless it is important, for it is a beginning. God has gone to great pains to provide what is needed for us in His dwelling, but why do I not avail myself of the provision? Then you get the waters up to the knees; then the loins, and then finally you have the term "river". It is an experimental matter. Ezekiel says, I could not pass over it; but then you might say, His energy was perhaps defective; but he goes on to say, It could not be passed over, meaning that these experimental features have to be pursued, and the further we pursue them the more we realise that we have part in what is infinite -- it cannot be passed over. Let no one think he can compass it, for it involves the power and grace of the Spirit of God. Many assume that they can. The more we trust to our own minds, the more likely we are to think that we can compass everything, but we cannot, for we are creatures. In having to do with the activity of the Spirit of God we are dealing with what is infinite. But the wonderful favour vouchsafed is that believers have part in it. Here Ezekiel participates to the ankles, to the knees, to the loins, and then after that, swimming, but no assumption to passing over. It is divine. It has come down to us in Jesus, a Man indeed, but not compassable. "No one knows the Son but the Father" @Matthew 11: 27. And so in regard of all the divine Persons; They are inscrutable, but yet come within our reach.
What is in mind now is the teaching relative to what God is graciously vouchsafing by the Spirit. The word in @John 6: 45 is, "they shall be all taught of God". Let each of us inquire as to whether the teaching we are imbibing is of God. Even if it be orthodox and intelligible to us, is the teaching really divine? There is no effective teaching if not divine. The more we proceed in what is presented, the more we shall discover
{297}
that it is infinite. It cannot be passed over. The word 'river' is used twice in the verse; the name 'river' is not given to it as first seen, nor in all the measurements until we come to the fourth; then it is a river, the river of God supremely so, more so than that in Eden.
Now this is a wholesome matter to face, as to what kind of teaching we are receiving. Is it divine or is it just like the schools? Persons attempting to teach, undertaking to be ministers of God, generally think it necessary to undergo a university course, or such like, but that is all according to man. I am not here to speak against ordinary education; far otherwise, I am only emphasising divine teaching as over against what man provides. They shall be all taught of God. Where is my claim to christianity, where is my claim to serve God, unless I am divinely taught -- taught of God Himself, by the Spirit? No one can serve effectively save as he pursues the course indicated here, and acquires experience with what God provides, with what issues out of His house. The seats of learning in the world, I do not hesitate to say, are poisoning humanity at the present time; modernism, and all that it means, has its home in them. A river represents the idea, the influence of learning; a river generally is influence. The influence of those seats of learning is poisoning christianity. Alas! the public body has been poisoned, and it is becoming more and more apostate. Over against that, we have the teaching that is from God; it comes out of the house: the river flows thence. It is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of truth, but it is the Spirit of God; it is the same at the beginning as at the end. The measurements to the ankles, to the knees, and the loins, all refer to my experience, and finally I get room for swimming; waters to swim in, a river that cannot be passed over.
That is what I call deliverance from the educational point of view. I am come into infinitude. What is man in the presence of what is of God in the way of teaching?
{298}
The apostle John says, "*ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things". He teaches you all things. I come to see that from a spiritual point of view, man, as such, is shut out; as John says again, "ye have not need that any one should teach you", @1 John 2: 27. It is not only wrong, but it is unnecessary to have human teaching in divine things. The Unction teaches. I am not speaking of ordinary education, you will understand; it is the moral side of the matter, the spiritual side. Man is shut out and I have come to infinitude. It is a river that cannot be passed over, there is inward power in the believer to swim in it; he is delivered. The allusion in @2 Kings 6 to swimming, helps here. The iron swam. It is in the power of God that I am at liberty to swim in the divine provision. This is deliverance. John's gospel is intended specially to effect deliverance in our souls from this point of view.
The next thing is movement in this river. It goes eastward, indicating clearly that it is a millennial picture; other parts of Scripture speak of the waters going eastward and westward. I suppose the latter refers to ourselves. In this river moving eastward the Dead Sea is in mind. The Dead Sea in which nothing could live -- this terrible influence found in the east. I have no doubt as I said, it refers typically to the influences in the east, the terrible deadening influences brought in by apostate teaching that exists there. This river is intended to overcome that. The river of God is potential, and powerful enough to overcome the very worst evils and the consequences of the most deadly teaching. So we are told that waters issue out towards the east country, "and go down into the plain, and go into the sea; when they are brought forth into the sea, the waters thereof shall be healed" @Ezekiel 47: 8.
We are then told of the fishermen and the fish. Let us dwell on it and cause the truth to reflect backwards upon us, even as the truth of the heavenly city reflects backwards affording administrative light. Let us ponder
{299}
the power of God in the provision of His grace. Even the Dead Sea becomes living. What is in mind here is spiritual. The Dead Sea would suggest the effect of the devil's working, his influence in the east since the time of Babel, carrying down the evil to our day. God will deal with it and finally remove it, not judge it only; that will come to pass indeed in another day, but here the point is He will bring in *life*.
In relation to this, I want to note, for our practical help, what is said in verse 6: "And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? And he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river. When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other" @Ezekiel 47: 6. The prophet says that the man brought him back to the bank of the river, and when he *returned* he saw trees. Why did he not see these before? Does it not suggest to us the necessity for patience in regard of the things of God? Why did he not see these trees before? They were there, undoubtedly, and is it not so, that we find it thus in dealing with divine things? I have to ask, Why did I not see that before? It has been there for centuries, but I did not see it. The guide of Ezekiel brought him back. Let us go back after we have considered a scriptural subject. Do not allow yourself to think you have finished, when you have gone over it once or even twice, however carefully. The Spirit of God would bring us back constantly to the same thing. You may say, You said differently before. Well, suppose I did, this proves that I did not see the thing clearly then. The Spirit of God brings us back. Ezekiel is brought back to the river and now he sees these trees. He says, "When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other".
I am speaking now of the great importance of patience, and at the same time of attention, vigilance as to what the Spirit of God is presenting to us. The Lord says,
{300}
"Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, Lord. And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder", @Matthew 13: 51,52. Why does he use the word scribe? Well, one of the features of a scribe is accuracy: there is need for accuracy in dealing with divine things. The scribe, He says, "brings out of his treasure things new and old". He is a careful man, valuing what he has.
These trees are to be considered; there are many of them, they do not fade, and they are serviceable. The Spirit of God in speaking of these, shows us that the trees are not merely ornamental; they *are* ornamental, but as you will observe they are for support -- for food. "And by the river, upon its bank, on the one side and on the other, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall nor fade, nor their fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, for its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine" @Ezekiel 47: 12. We come thus to a further view. It is further instruction to show us that this provision is not only for shelter or ornament, but for food; and do we not need food? We do. The Lord's supper is the great centre of the idea in christianity. The passover used to be, now it is the Lord's supper, and the Lord is seeking to bring us to it and to cause us to look round and see everything attaching to it. It is not only a memorial. It is also food -- meat and drink. We may have the light of the memorial, intelligence as to the Lord's supper in this aspect, but then what about the food? What about the leaf that never fades? How *fresh* the Lord's supper is as rightly apprehended! it never fades. When the Lord instituted it, those who partook of it sang: "And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives" @Matthew 26: 30. We are not told that they sang at the passover. They sang as the full thought of the Lord's supper, especially the cup, was brought home to them by the teaching of
{301}
the Lord. It is fresh; its leaf never fades; its fruit comes every month -- for us every week.
Then as to the fishing (verse 9). "And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live" @Ezekiel 47: 9. The double river -- the plural idea, meaning, I believe, that the thing is accentuated. The river is becoming greater and greater; is it not so, that this marks divine things? They never diminish. To the exercised believer they become greater and greater. It is the "double river" now. "And there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters shall come thither, and the waters of the sea shall be healed" @Ezekiel 47: 9. The meaning is that the river has come to the Dead Sea and those waters are healed. We are to be impressed here, in this instruction, with the increase in the idea of divine resource -- it is a double river, not only a river that cannot be passed over, but there is a plural thought attached to it. It is a testimony to us, to this idea of increase; and added to it there are the fishermen, the names of the places, and the kind of fish. There is a link again with John's gospel; the fish are not ordinary or inland lake fish. They are "as the fish of the great sea" @Ezekiel 47: 10. What God is doing transcends all that is ever conceived, and we are brought into it, through this experience of the divine resources. We are to be enlarged inwardly by the provision made, by the resources supplied.
Finally, there is the inheritance, for as we appropriate the provision God makes for our deliverance severally, the thought of the inheritance comes before us. It is introduced here in a very touching way, and it seems to me in accord with the instruction of the chapter. Verse 13 says, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border whereby ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions. And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers; and this land
{302}
shall fall to you for inheritance" @Ezekiel 47: 13,14. It is God coming in, not simply in grace and government, for our deliverance and education -- precious as that is -- but coming in in relation to promise, not promise in the sense of support here, but as to what His counsels involve. He has lifted up His hand about this matter. We read of the promise, and of the oath, in Hebrews. He is telling us that He has never forgotten us in regard of His counsels. He has been on the look-out for us. He had the land in mind; it was a question of promise and He says, 'I lifted up my hand, and it is to be yours according to My purpose'; and then, so as to balance us in all this, He intimates that Christ must be pre-eminent among us. Joseph is to have *two* portions. That taxes us, taxes love among us, but every true heart will gladly yield the supreme place to Christ.
Jacob says to Joseph, "I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren" @Genesis 48: 22. The Lord Jesus is anointed above His brethren, above His companions. There is always something in our greatest privilege, our most intimate relationship, to balance us as regards the dignity and the rights of the Person of Christ. He must ever be supreme, and that is the beautiful setting of the truth here. The tribes¬ names are not mentioned in this chapter, for the point is to show that we are brethren, that we belong to Christ, and that provision is made for us according to divine counsel, and we are to enjoy the land of promise; but Joseph is to have two portions.
In the end of the chapter we are taught that the greatest magnanimity is to mark us in the enjoyment of divine things. We are not to be selfish or hard or unnecessarily exclusive, as set together. The introduction of "the stranger" here gives it an evangelical touch, and so we read in verse 22, "And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of
{303}
Israel: with you shall they draw by lot inheritance among the tribes of Israel" @Ezekiel 47: 22. It is the Spirit of Christ developed in such circumstances. Why can I not be liberal? Why can I not be spiritually magnanimous? Why can I not love others? Why should I look down upon anybody? Why should I not esteem others better than myself even though they are strangers? Let us learn, dear brethren, to make room for those who have external disadvantages amongst us. The Spirit of Christ is to be developed in such circumstances as are seen here. If it be a slave who believes in the Lord Jesus, as Onesimus, he is to be regarded as "a brother beloved" @Philemon 16. He had fled from his master, but he was converted in Rome, and not only was he converted, but he became a brother beloved. Philemon was to look upon him as one born in the family, as a "home-born among the children of Israel" -- a brother beloved in the house. The whole letter of the apostle Paul was written to correct any tendency to allow social feeling in a human way to deprive a brother of his dignity among the people of God, that we might regard each other according to the dignity conferred upon us, though humanly under disabilities. We are to recognise each other according to the manner of the love the Father has given to us that we should be called the children of God (@1 John 3: 1). As of the same calling and birth, we belong to the family of God.
There is another thought in the last verse: "And it shall come to pass that in the tribe in which the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah" @Ezekiel 47: 23. That is the local setting; again exemplified in Onesimus. He was now to be viewed as home-born in the house of Philemon, and hence to be a brother beloved *there*. He had to go to Rome to be converted, but he has come back as one of the heavenly family. If Philemon believed what Paul wrote and acted upon it, his regard for Onesimus would be equal to his estimate of the saints generally in the
{304}
town, even of his own sons, if he had any. In these matters we are to be governed by divine magnanimity -- to receive one another according as the Christ also has received us to the glory of God (@Romans 15: 7). It is done in the intelligence of love, and *adds* to our own tribe, so to speak; a local company is enhanced by a brother beloved; whatever his outward circumstances, he is a brother. You can talk to him, keep company with him, have communion with him in holy liberty as sharing together the heavenly calling. May God help us in these things.

By the Lord's help I would use these scriptures to develop a little the thought of *faith*, but faith linked with the Holy Spirit. We are told by the apostle Paul, in his first letter to Timotheus, that the dispensation of God is in faith. But the very thought of dispensation involves more than faith, the word "dispensation" there alludes to what is dispensed, quoting from the New Translation; it involves the house of God, the centre down here of His operations. Heaven indeed is our centre, our metropolis, but the assembly is God's centre here on earth, and those who undertake to operate on God's behalf must show that they have part in the house and are subject to its order, recognising that God is indeed there. This challenges all operations professedly in the gospel, missionary enterprise, so-called: all evangelical work is unauthorised, except as it issues from the house. What I am saying I know affects much activity which professedly is in the Lord's name, but God has not changed His mind at all since Pentecost, since the apostolic days, and all gifts were set in the assembly (@1 Corinthians 12: 28), and all services were under the Lord.
In the prophet Ezekiel we have a river which typically represents the power in which operations professedly on God's behalf are to be carried on. He who describes the river was in the inner court of the house, and he saw it there first, coming down out of the house on the right side under the threshold, on the south side of the altar. Then, brought round by the north gate, he sees it issuing forth at the gate looking eastward, and it becomes a great river. These are facts known to most of us, but they deal with what I am saying,
{306}
that divine operations centre in the house of God, and all otherwise centred have no divine mandate at all, and that is what the apostle has in mind in saying that the dispensation of God is in faith, but faith working out in the power of the Holy Spirit.
In selecting these scriptures I wish to show how the Spirit is linked with faith, and faith with the Spirit, first in the epistle to the Ephesians, which, we may say, corresponds with the river, not only as ankle deep, but as waters to swim in. The fulness of the gospel is in mind in that epistle, not only the terms, as in Romans, but "the unsearchable riches of the Christ" @Ephesians 3: 8. Ezekiel speaks of the river that cannot be passed over; nor is the gospel ever compassed, even by the preachers, it is the glad tidings of the *unsearchable* riches of the Christ. It is the gospel of God concerning His Son. The more we proceed in it, the greater, fuller, and, we may say, the more infinite, it becomes. So the apostle alludes to the reception of the Holy Spirit, and, in speaking of this matter, I may say that one has for many years been convinced that there are many who have faith and have not the Spirit; and there are those, too, who assume that the Spirit is given automatically as faith exists, which is not true. The Spirit is a gift, it is the gift of God to us -- Christ *for us*, the Spirit *to us* -- and He reserves His right to give in His own way. We can never assume that He acts automatically; He is God, He acts from Himself, acts sovereignly, and as He pleases, always consistently with Himself.
Now, in reverting to the early history of the assembly at Ephesus, tracing the river to its source, @Acts 19 brings out the inquiry made of the twelve men that were there as to whether they had received the Holy Spirit since they had believed. The Holy Spirit had been on earth, He had been in the assembly, for a good while, but they had to say, "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come" @Acts 19: 2. You can see, therefore, that a certain state in persons is essential to the gift
{307}
being received; they were believers, but, sad to say, they were not aware of the presence of the Holy Spirit. So it is with many; so much darkness has come into the profession of christianity that some today are even as ignorant as that as to the Holy Spirit, and yet you cannot deny that there is faith in them. So the apostle, in these few verses, alludes, as you will observe, to what happened. He says, "in whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise" @Ephesians 1: 13. Take note, dear brethren, of "the word of the truth", it is a condition, not only the word of *God*, but the word of the *truth*. Truth is a great regulating principle; here "the gospel of your salvation", of which he speaks, he connects with the word of truth.
There is much that is called gospel that cannot be said to be the word of truth, and I believe that is the secret of so much weakness among christians; the gospel, involving the word of truth, has not been received. The word of truth makes way for the Spirit of truth, and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth. As the condition effected in our souls by the word of truth exists, there can be no doubt that there will not be much delay in the gift of the Spirit, but, as I said, it is not given automatically. The gift of the Spirit is for believers, but these things that I am saying are to be observed, they are most important. Another thing is that God gives the Holy Spirit to those that obey Him. Lawless persons and the reception of the Spirit are quite incompatible, and yet we find persons alluding to themselves as having the Spirit and yet moving in lawlessness; not even in the fellowship of God's Son, or of His death, but standing aside from it, and even having part in other fellowships which are worldly, and not according to God. These facts are not compatible at all with the reception of the Holy Spirit; morally God cannot give His Spirit to lawless persons.
{308}
I stress this a little at the beginning, because one has felt for years that the weakness among those who are nominally brethren is largely due to the fact that many have not the Spirit, for the reason that they have not received the word of the truth, the gospel of their salvation, nor have they practised obedience, submitting themselves unqualifiedly to the authority of God in Christ. The Ephesians had, and it is a very beautiful account in @Acts 19, they received Paul's word immediately -- "when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus" @Acts 19: 5; that would mean that they were detached from whatever else they had been in. The truth detaches us from what is not of God, and it also attaches us to what is of Him -- a dual operation. So that these twelve men accepted baptism to the name of the Lord Jesus, and then Paul laid his hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came upon them. Let us not weaken the words of Scripture in these matters. These men were not sealed as they were baptised, but as Paul laid his hands on them. How careful Scripture is as regards this matter!
Well, having said all that, I want to show from the scripture in Genesis how this period is marked by light -- by information or instruction received from the Holy Spirit. This present dispensation is one of faith, and all is to be worked out by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit; the coming dispensation will be one of sight, the Holy Spirit will be there too according to the prophecy of Joel which Peter quotes in the Acts. A consideration of the truth governing the reception of the Spirit will show that we have the Holy Spirit in a peculiarly exclusive way, and we are entirely dependent on Him for what we know; if we are to know divine things we must get our knowledge from Him. That, I believe, enters into this passage in Genesis, the Scriptures being minutely accurate, even in the types -- indeed, one wonders at their accuracy. There are two transactions noted here. You will observe that Noah
{309}
is said to have *looked* in verse 13. It is a question of *sight*; he removed the covering of the ark, pointing typically to the coming day when it will be a time of sight, and looked and saw for himself. In the first instance, he did not take off the covering, he was dependent on the dove for the truth he needed. That is a point.
I think we may profitably notice, and accept it as applying at the present time, that if we are to be rightly informed as to anything, it must be through the Holy Spirit. I am not ignoring the ways and means He has of communicating things to us. He uses this and that one whom He has fitted in some way to serve us, but it all comes through the Spirit. Of course it is under the Lord; the economy requires the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Father, in whom the supreme thought of the Deity is presented to us, to be worshipped and revered; the Son in the office of Lord over all the operations; and the Spirit here permanently knowing everything accurately. Of course all the divine Persons know things accurately, but the presence of the Holy Spirit carries the thought of first-hand knowledge of everything, whether in God or here below; He searches the depths of God, and is also conversant with all conditions here, specially among the brethren; so that the instruction comes through Him, and it is well for us if we accept it. There may be signs of the times, these refer to sight, people speak of them and bring in prophetic subjects; but any information or instruction that can be relied upon must come through the Holy Spirit.
We should notice that Noah sends out the dove three times; first she comes back and he takes her to him into the ark; the second time she comes back at eventide with an olive leaf plucked off, meaning that there has been a day's work, as it were, at eventide, and a result involving instruction; that is, fruit was there, for the leaf was plucked off -- it was attached to the
{310}
tree. Then we find she goes out again and does not return; that refers to the change of dispensation, confirmed by the removal of the covering of the ark, so that Noah is no longer dependent on the dove. We have to understand it in a contextual way. It is not that the Holy Spirit is not needed in the future; He is, but what is meant in the dove not returning is to point out the change; it is then a period of sight, so that Noah removes the covering of the ark. We have not come to that yet. The Lord Jesus will come and translate us to heaven, and it will be no longer faith for us, but sight, as it will also be for God's earthly people. There will be power in the everlasting gospel, and wonderful results; a great number of believers -- real ones evidently -- brought in in a short time, too. There will not be a long period such as this is, for the gospel service will be as by an angel flying in mid-heaven. God can bring about things rapidly, and, on the other hand, He may delay and delay and delay, not willing to bring to an end a period in which He has much interest, and not willing that any should perish.
That is, I believe, a helpful link in our subject and will keep our minds steady in our walk here, that we should not be deceived by what the eye sees. We shall be more dependent on God and on the Holy Spirit, so that we may get the true thoughts of God about everything, as the apostle says further about the Spirit to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3: 16. The keenest prognosticators of things that are occurring, if they have not the Holy Spirit, are very untrustworthy; whereas those who have the Spirit of God get, not only direct teaching in words, but feelings and sensibilities, and acquire a certain way of assurance as to everything. "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" -- one of the greatest facts is thus presented to us; not only that the Spirit is here, but He dwells in the
{311}
saints in a certain connection, that is, in relation to the assembly.
Another scripture that helps us in this way is @Leviticus 16. Many of us will have noticed that on the great day of atonement there is no scape-bullock; there is a scapegoat; and the epistle to the Hebrews enlightens us as to the bullock: "The Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it", @Hebrews 10: 15. The Holy Spirit is a witness to us as to the sacrifice of Christ. It is to *faith*; the scape-goat is for sight. The new covenant is quoted immediately to bring out that forgiveness of sins is involved in it. So it is not what we see, for Christ has been taken out of view; "a cloud received him out of their sight" @Acts 1: 9; hence the period of faith, and the Holy Spirit makes good what the absence of a scape-bullock means. The Holy Spirit witnesses to us, so that the believer today has more sense of real forgiveness than men will have in the future; it is through the Holy Spirit in us. The witness to us is by the presentation of what is in the Scriptures, but nevertheless there is the Holy Spirit; it is not what we see, but the Spirit confirming our faith.
I want to go on to speak of the other scriptures a little, so as to point out how faith works with the Spirit, and, before proceeding to Stephen and Barnabas, I would call attention to Thomas. The Lord singles him out to bring out the truth that I am stressing now. He says to him, "blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" @John 20: 29; there is a peculiar blessing attached to faith. The Lord had in His mind this present wonderful period, and every one of us surely would seek to understand the blessing to which the Lord refers. In connection with that, I want to point out how absenting ourselves from the gatherings of the brethren tends to weaken our faith, to make us sceptical. There is much more scepticism than many of us will admit. The questions that are being asked constantly indicate a certain amount of scepticism in the saints, and I
{312}
believe what would remedy that, to a large extent, is adherence to the meetings -- "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" @Hebrews 10: 25. Thomas absented himself; I do not say that he did it deliberately, but he was not at the first meeting mentioned; that is the point. It is very easy to find excuses if I am absent from the meetings; very little, too, alas, often holds us back, but the scepticism that is often apparent is undoubtedly largely due to holding ourselves apart from the gatherings of the saints where the Spirit operates.
According to what has been said, normally the gatherings of the saints involve the temple, the presence of the Spirit of God. Even the meetings for prayer bring in the sense of the presence of God by the Spirit. "But *ye*, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", @Jude 20, 21. Praying in the Holy Spirit -- I cannot afford to be absent from such a meeting for prayer. Of course private prayer is most important, but where the Holy Spirit is present, as in the meetings for prayer, the advantage is special. So in all the other gatherings of the saints. How often people slip away for a holiday from a meeting like this, for instance, turning their backs on it for a little bit of relaxation. What do they see on the beach? I am not saying that the ocean is not a testimony to the power of God, not that physical gain does not accrue from contact with it, but people see things there that damage their souls.
I am speaking now of how easily we slip away from our greatest advantages by which our faith is confirmed, and where the Holy Spirit can affect us in a living way, causing our hearts to rejoice. The believers at Antioch, after Paul and Barnabas had been there, are said to have been filled with joy and the Holy Spirit; that is the true effect of the gospel. Not only joy, as with Philip's converts in Samaria; without the Spirit that would not
{313}
last, and hence the Spirit soon came. But at Antioch, where Paul and Barnabas preached, the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit. I am bringing these things in so that we may see the greatness of all we are brought into, and how easily we may miss it and the blessed features of it, and become sceptical. Thomas was sceptical, avowedly so -- he said, "Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe" @John 20: 25. He was avowedly sceptical, and how often one notices people indicating unbelief as to the things of God, and they exhibit no sense of shame in it. Faithful attendance at the meetings, dear brethren, will greatly help to promote faith, and also joy in the Holy Spirit.
Well, I want to show how Stephen and Barnabas exemplify this matter of faith and of the Spirit. They refer to what I may call crises in the history of the saints; these are coming up constantly and they call for faith and the Spirit. The first crisis was the murmuring of the Hellenists against the Jews; the Hellenists, having come from a distance, assumed they were not as favourably treated as those near by -- a very common thing -- but they were murmuring. Even if there is some cause for it, murmuring is a naughty element among the brethren; it is foreign to the assembly, viewed normally, and what is needed to meet it is faith and the Holy Spirit, and that was what marked Stephen. The direction of the apostles was that the people should choose out men full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and Stephen is mentioned first; he is said to have been "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit" @Acts 6: 5. A crisis usually brings out a man like that. In a small measure today, of course, it is to be looked for, for God is never taken by surprise; He is always ready, and Stephen was the man; there were six others. Stephen and Philip stand out, although Philip is not said to have been full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; there is a certain shortage
{314}
in him as compared with Stephen, even as to the results of his preaching; the Holy Spirit does not come in immediately, but still, he was a wonderful man, and wrought miracles and caused great joy in Samaria.
Now it is said of Stephen that he was "full of grace and power", as he "wrought wonders and great signs among the people" @Acts 6: 8. See what a man he was. He is one of the most remarkable servants of God, and he began as a deacon. We are not given any account of his work as a deacon, but the *man* is placed before us in the Scripture, and he is a model for us in crises: one ready under God's hand for an occasion, and the Spirit of God directs the minds of the saints to him. Full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and full of grace and power; and then his countenance was as the face of an angel. That is the man; the Spirit of God causes him to stand out before us. Let us not lose the sense the Spirit would give us in directing our view to Stephen. He is a man of glory, a man who goes "from glory to glory" in his service.
Now Barnabas also comes in with peculiar distinction; he is introduced before Stephen, as a son of consolation; that is another thing, a man that can comfort the brethren, a son of consolation. We much need that, too; brethren who are going on -- even the brightest of us -- need consolation. The apostles evidently had consolation in Barnabas. You can picture him coming up with his money, laying it at the apostles¬ feet. As a Levite he should not have had land; but the thing is done publicly, he is not hiding anything. He is now ministering consolation to the brethren, and proving what he is, a work of God; and opportunity for service suited to him is near. It is no longer a question of crises, such as we have in chapter 6, but a great work of God among the nations; the assembly characteristically has ears for that. It has not ears for all the things that occupy those of this world, but it has ears for all that God is doing. The Spirit of God sees to it that all
{315}
who would have information as to His work will get it. So the assembly sent out Barnabas to Antioch; he was a suitable man, evidently with God, and ready for a particular service. God is with him. If God is not with us we do not succeed; however much ability or prestige we may have, we do not succeed if God is not with us. The Lord says, "without me ye can do nothing" @John 15: 5.
So it is said of Barnabas, as he shows his genuine interest in the work of God and its results, "for he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" @Acts 11: 24 -- the Holy Spirit is placed before faith here. So that we have Barnabas where he should be; he shines perhaps more at this point than elsewhere. Observing the work of God, in many being added to the Lord, he rejoiced in it, and the Holy Spirit tells us "he was a good man". Very few of us can be so designated, I am afraid, but Barnabas was "a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" @Acts 11: 24. He was the man for the moment; he was like the golden taches of the tabernacle, a man who can link things on unjealously. He would not say at Antioch, The work here is nothing compared with that at Jerusalem! No, he would make the most of the work at Antioch, it was a wonderful work in his eyes, and he said in effect, *I* am not equal to it, another is needed. He knew where that other was, and he went and brought him: "he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul. And having found him, he brought him to Antioch" @Acts 11: 25,26. That is the idea, dear brethren, unjealous conditions, marked by the Holy Spirit and faith, so that the work of God is linked together and prospers. Barnabas and Saul taught a large crowd, we are told, in the assembly. They had a right thought of the assembly, and that is what is so needed. In preaching and teaching we are to have the assembly in mind. The assembly that was in Antioch was the fruit of this work; and then the service of God in that town: that is, the great levitical position is among the gentiles; there were those who ministered to the Lord and fasted, and under those conditions
{316}
the Holy Spirit is seen as at liberty. He had been at liberty, of course, in Barnabas and Saul, but I want to point out, as to what is called missionary work, that it is a question of the Holy Spirit being at liberty to move in sending out servants. It is a remarkable thing that it was the Holy Spirit who selected those who were to undertake the first missionary enterprise in the service of the gospel, and in doing so He recognised the assembly. It is a question of the conditions and firsthand knowledge of the conditions, and how the Holy Spirit acts in those conditions. As I said at the beginning -- and it is urgent that it be accepted -- no one has any mandate for preaching or teaching aside from the recognition of the assembly of God. This is the period of the dispensation of God which is in faith. The Scriptures teach that the assembly is essential to it, and those taking part in it nominally who disregard the assembly are disqualified.
{317}
REST
@Genesis 2: 1 - 3; @Genesis 8: 4,5; @2 Chronicles 5: 7 - 14; @1 Corinthians 15: 24 - 28
J.T. What is in mind is the thought of rest; first in the bearing of it in regard to the dispensations of God which in Scripture are said to have come upon us. It is particularly in mind to dwell on 2 Chronicles, the account given of the ark as in rest in the temple, which is followed by service of a peculiarly rich kind that is not found recorded in the corresponding passage in 1 Kings. As it is obvious that the books of Chronicles were written in remnant times, the bearing of this passage on ourselves is specially to be noticed. It has come down to us; the dispensations having come upon us. The first book gives us a beautiful phrase: "after that the ark was in rest" (@1 Chronicles 6: 31); but chapter 5 of the second book, from which we have read, records historically how it entered into rest; and in view of the glory coming in at that time we should inquire as to whether the period in which we are corresponds in any way.
The passage in 1 Corinthians is read just because it speaks of the end in a formal way. All these periods of divine operations and their results in men have this end in mind; the state of things in which God is "all in all". The state of the saints is in mind; He is all as *in* us. It is clearly not what He is in abstract Deity, but what He is in revelation, dwelling in the results He has reached: "all", but all in us, "all in all". This gives a rather wide range, but the thought to be before us is the practical side of this matter, especially in 2 Chronicles.
C.A.C. Were you thinking that is something to be reached spiritually now?
J.T. Yes, I was thinking that; whether the assembly does not afford a means of this being reached, at least
{318}
in principle. God is all in the assembly objectively, but also in the sense of filling us.
F.S.M. Had David this in view in @Psalm 132: 8, "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength"? And do we see it fulfilled in the next psalm in brethren dwelling "together in unity"?
J.T. That is very confirmatory of what is in mind. "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy" (@Psalm 132: 9), may be added; it is as if he not only thought of God's rest, but response to Him as in it.
So according to our first scripture God rested. We are told that the creation was finished: God had finished on the seventh day His work; "And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished. And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had Created in making it" (@Genesis 2: 1 - 3).
That is a remarkable paragraph of Scripture; and then the fulness of that, the fulness that God would have and look for, is opened up to us in chapter 2. It is the thought of response to any position of that kind; here God in rest. He rests, of course, in Himself abstractly, In His Deity, but then He is resting now in relation to what He has made; not indeed leaving it to operate by itself, but the great operation was finished, and now there would be *fulness*. In chapter 2 God continues to open up His thoughts as to His creation, especially in Adam and Eve: "Ish" and "Ishshah".
Eu.R. Would you say a word as to God's rest as connected with the seventh day and our realisation of eternal privilege which seems to be connected more with the eighth day?
J.T. The seventh day is the end of any testimony, viewed thus as completed. In an extended way it is
{319}
the millennium; what God has in that order of things which is still testimony. The idea of eight is what God has beyond that; but not as detached from it. From the assembly's point of view, that is, the instruction purely in relation to the assembly which is found in Scripture, the first day of the week is introductory to what is eternal; not the seventh, but the first. The first and the eighth synchronise, but the first is the eternal thought; it relates to what God had in mind in His eternal counsels before the world, and runs on into what shall be eternally.
C.A.C. Would the seventh day have reference to the time when the work of God is going on and is brought to completion, therefore referring to time conditions?
J.T. Quite so; and material things, too, not yet all things made new. The first day of the week in the gospels stands related to persons, especially in John's gospel, where it is mentioned twice, the Lord's activities characterising it from very early morning to late evening. The whole day is in mind, and we have the highest relationship into which we are brought, mentioned. We are on lower ground in the sabbath, so we are prepared for what is purely spiritual on the first day of the week; not the eighth, but the first; what is purely spiritual in relation to persons.
Ques. Would the close of @Numbers 10 connect with this? When the ark rested, Moses said, "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel" (@Numbers 10: 36).
J.T. It does; it is a remarkable setting of truth referring to the movement of the tribes in their four sub-divisions Judah and Reuben are mentioned first, and then the sanctuary, that is, a place for God is reached immediately Love is portrayed in the movement in the way it deviates slightly from the instructions: it is indeed the filling out in love of the instructions. The tent is set up, so that there should be no
{320}
delay in the ark being brought in: that there should be an immediate accommodation for God, the divine dwelling being ready. That is, love for God is acting in the tribes; and then the ark on its part moves also outside the instructions. It is love in Christ acting too; it is the suggestion, I think, of the reliability of love; the ark moves and goes before the people to find a resting-place for *them*. It is not yet a place for itself; love in the tribes made provision for it in the first two movements, that is of Judah and Reuben, and then the ark moved later to make provision for the people. It is the activity of love, and then the end is, "Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel" (@Numbers 10: 36), the foreshadowing of God coming back where love could rest; no doubt pointing on to the end when God will "rest in his love", @Zephaniah 3: 17. He returns to "rest in his love".
Ques. What is the thought of the rest in @Hebrews 4: 9 -- "There remaineth ... a rest to the people of God"?
J.T. Well, that is for us. We have just been remarking how love would prepare a rest for us; we are told Joshua did not bring them into it, but we who believe do enter into it; we come into these things now in a provisional way in the power of the Spirit. The feast of Pentecost made provision for all these things, what the Spirit can be to us; but we are now speaking of the divine rest, and it is thought the verses in Genesis would make a good beginning.
The ark of Noah is the second point; for what is in mind is to show the dispensations and the divine movements in them, and how our dispensation involves a point reached by God in which He can rest provisionally, not finally, but still rest. Then, from that point He opens up what is for the accomplishment of His thoughts. Every dispensation has something of this kind; God has reached a point in which He can rest provisionally, pending something else, but in that position He accomplishes certain features of His testimony,
{321}
all of which are accumulative, and we are to gather them up in our souls so as to see how He reaches the thought of finality.
H.P.W. Would you just outline what the thought of rest is connected with in chapter 2 and chapter 8 and then in Chronicles?
J.T. @Genesis 2, as we have been remarking, is a question of creation and what God would develop out of it for Himself. The rest is not the final thought, but God being in that attitude of rest, the final thought develops out of that. The rest is broken in upon by sin, but primarily God had in mind what would develop out of the rest. Creation is in mind, man being the supreme thought in it, the man and woman, the pleasure that God would have in man viewed thus.
Then in Noah we have a form of headship, that is, he is the beginning of a new order, so the reckoning is from the year of his life -- it is a question of *his* years. So the ark rested. He does things, and the ark rested; and then what follows on that has to be taken account of in the ninth chapter. The ark is a figure of Christ, as Noah is, too. They have to be taken together, as the ark and Joshua have to be taken together, concurrent ideas. "The ark rested ... on the mountains of Ararat" (@Genesis 8: 4); that is not the finish, but is a point reached from which further operations can be carried on with a view to the prime results coming out of the movement.
So that the *window* is in mind: "And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. And he sent out the raven, which went forth going to and fro, until the waters were dried from the earth. And he sent out the dove from him" (@Genesis 8: 6 - 8). This would be, I suppose, a prime thought in the movement, the *faith* period, typically; and then the *covering* is lifted, which would be the *sight* period. So it covers our own dispensation and the millennial state of things, but the dove is the type to notice particularly; the link between Noah and
{322}
the dove, how she was sent out "from him" and came back "to him". The covering is not lifted, nor is there any thought of sight, simply a period of faith in which the Spirit is depended upon. Antitypically the dove would be the Spirit here having first-hand knowledge of everything, whether it be a state of death or whether life is extant at all. She ultimately reaches life and brings up the evidence of it to Noah.
Then the ark at rest is very beautifully stated in Chronicles; and inasmuch as a remnant state of things is in mind, one thought it would touch us a little as to whether we are in this period intelligently -- as it is said, the ark is "in rest". It is mentioned in connection with levitical activity in @1 Chronicles 6: 31: "And these are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of Jehovah after that the ark was in rest". The fact is stated anticipatively in the history, for the ark was not yet in rest; in our chapter it is, it has reached its rest. The staves are drawn out, they are seen, not outside, but in the holy place, and then we have all this added to what we have elsewhere.
C.A.C. We have been apt to look at the thought of rest as finality. What you are suggesting is most helpful, to see that it becomes the starting point of a wondrous development of the thoughts of God.
H.P.W. Do I understand that God, as it were, reached a sort of halting-place of rest, if we might put it so, so as to move on further; and then move on again, and so on until you reach the end which is final?
J.T. All sections of one great thought.
H.P.W. Is there such a thought connected with the assembly now? Would every Lord's day morning be a sort of halting-place of rest?
J.T. That is what I understand. How restful it is spiritually, as by the Spirit in assembly we gradually release ourselves from all that would intrude! We are sitting there apart from and not occupied with our
{323}
domestic affairs, or anything else; if it were only for a minute or two, how restful to reach the point that God has reached in Christ -- the ark in rest, and the Spirit here is the power by which we reach it.
H.P.W. Do you think we ought to go out as moved on a step further each week?
J.T. Yes, surely progress is in mind; we do not go out as we came in; if we do, we have not gained anything, and it is doubtful if God has got anything from us. You go out with Him, and the next time you are more fit for the service, you are richer: so Asaph is a typical man, a remarkable man; he says: "When ... I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I", @Psalm 73: 16, 17. He is the author of most of the psalms in that book and begins with this one, showing what is made clear as we enter the sanctuaries. Instead of coming out as we went in, we come out different; we may lose during the next week, but the point is to retain everything so that the next time you are more equal to the position.
Eu.R. Do you suggest we should seek to fill out the privileged occasion on the first day of the week in the power of the Spirit, and thus hold the ground as God's rest, and definitely judge wandering thoughts as to domestic or business matters?
J.T. Yes, that we are in accord with the position that God reaches ultimately. He is to be "all in all", meaning that He is all to us, but as filling us there is no room for anything else. It would be an eternal condition as in the verse read, but it is to be reached now. There is a point reached where all else is shut out, however legitimate it may be elsewhere. I am filled with God; God is all to me as filling me. I may look at the heavens and admire the handiwork of God, but that is an objective matter; it is not all to me as *in* me. God is "all in all" -- not all and in all, but "all in all" -- one great fact.
{324}
Ques. Is that how glory to God in the assembly would be known?
J.T. What a glory it would be if you are filled, and I am filled! He has accomplished much if He has filled me, He is thus all to me as filling me. I am not casting about and thinking of other things; God is all to me as filling me.
F.S.M. Is there a parallel thought in @Ephesians 3: 17 - 19: "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, ... that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God"? Does that lead up to the final rest, glory to God "in the assembly" and with Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith, have we reached rest?
J.T. I think that is right. Ephesians supports all we have been saying; that epistle stresses the assembly; glory to God "in the assembly". When God is "all in all", of course, there is glory to Him, too, that is, in the eternal state of things, but Ephesians has in mind the great thought of the assembly now. 1 Corinthians hardly goes as far as that, it is more the persons: "the first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming. Then the end" (@1 Corinthians 15: 23, 24). It is a question of persons raised and glorified, so that God fills us all, and He is all in that sense.
Eu.R. What have we to learn in the dove finding "no resting-place for the sole of her foot" @Genesis 8: 9?
J.T. I think the allusion is to the Spirit, the Spirit coming out of heaven. The window, I suppose, suggests the faith period apprehended, but when the cover is removed from the ark and Noah looks out, then he can *see* things. He is dependent entirely on the dove in the first instance, and that is how the matter stands today. It is what the Holy Spirit is here; He knows everything, as coming out from heaven He knows the whole position. Presently the dove finds evidence of life and brings back a token of it in the evening, meaning that there was a day's work. The Holy Spirit works incessantly and when He touches life an end is reached.
{325}
His activities are going on every day of the dispensation. Whilst there is no change in man naturally, "only evil continually" @Genesis 6: 5, life appears; the leaf was not floating, it was ''plucked off'', showing that it was the fruit of life. That seems to be a sort of basic thought for us; and then the principle of coming back, as it were, to Christ. Then Noah acts of himself, but he does not move out of the ark without orders. In moving under divine direction we have a state of obedience and all the living creatures under that. Noah is acting of himself now in offering up the sacrifice, so that we have permanency for the moment, not eternal permanency, but "While the earth remaineth"; that is the principle with God. He is moving on in sections, and *we* are in the section into which all the others come (@1 Corinthians 10: 11). We are thus to understand them all.
I believe 2 Chronicles is to be viewed in that light. The writer is evidently a very spiritual person, but in remnant times. Our attention is called, I suppose, to the writer being in a time of recovery; so that as a spiritual man he adds what was left out in the earlier account.
He records two fillings of the house, that is another thing: he omits nothing in that way. The house is filled after Solomon's prayer, and it is filled here, the thought of singing being added. There is the wonderful unison of the priests in song, and then the house is filled with the glory of Jehovah. It is also filled, as I said, after Solomon's prayer. All this shows that in remnant times the full recognition of the ark and response to it may develop. It is not here the bare fact, as in 1 Chronicles, that the ark was in rest, but there is this wonderful display of spiritual power; and then subsequently, the prayer of Solomon occasioning a further coming in of the glory.
C.A.C. Do you gather from that, that God has in mind to bring about what is most excellent at the end of the dispensations?
{326}
J.T. That is exactly what I was thinking. We have spoken of it a little elsewhere, the filling of the houses; how the dispensation began at Pentecost with filling the house with sound, and how, as seen in @Luke 14: 23, God's thought was that His house should be filled with people, such as suited Him. So the gospel testimony in these last days should be of spiritual quality. Then there was Mary of Bethany possessing what was needed on a great occasion: "the house was filled with the odour of the ointment", @John 12: 3. Then, finally, the house here in Chronicles filled with the glory, twice, indeed, both in relation to the service of the priests and then in relation to prayer -- the meeting for prayer. That is not to be neglected, it has its place, the glory fills it too.
All this in this book is contingent on the ark in rest. Christ is still sitting in His Father's throne, as He says to Laodicea. That is the position and the operations are in relation to that.
F.W. Would you say a word as to the staves? In the authorised translation they are drawn out, whereas in the New Translation, which seems to be helpful, "the staves were long" (verse 9).
J.T. Well, it is in accord with what we are saying; there are to be no more wilderness conditions. They are seen in the holy place, that is what is meant. The ark had been carried, but it is in rest now. Other operations develop out from this, but the ark is in rest.
Rem. In Chronicles the singing refers to what we do, but in @Zephaniah 3, it is God who sings and rests in His love.
J.T. That is a good link to bring in here: it is what He has in us, the inheritance of God.
Ques. Does not what you are saying, and particularly the thought of God "all in all", raise the question as to how far holiness has been maintained with us?
J.T. It does indeed; Leviticus stresses that -- that God is holy; and Peter brings it forward. If we are to have to do with these matters inside, we must have
{327}
holiness. The Lord stresses it from time to time. Romans takes it up initially: "ye have your fruit unto holiness" (@Romans 6: 22). "Ye have" it, as if you acquire the thing as wealth, or substance, so to say. It is "righteousness unto holiness" (verse 19). "And the end everlasting life" (verse 22).
C.A.C. We could not have to do with God at all without holiness: "holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord", @Hebrews 12: 14.
Ques. I was thinking particularly of being able to move intelligently from the point God has reached: "the knowledge of the Holy is intelligence", @Proverbs 9: 10. Would He carry us with Him in what He is about to do, as developing from that point?
J.T. The Psalms have that in mind. We all ought to know something about the sub-divisions of the Psalms; and the end of the second book is Christ on the throne, and the prayers of David are ended. That is all he had in mind in his prayers, so to speak, for if Solomon is on the throne everything will be looked after; 1 Chronicles shows us that Solomon *is* on the throne; and as he is on the throne of Jehovah, David's prayers are ended.
Asaph comes in as a counterpart, and he is concerned about evil, notwithstanding that Christ is on the throne. He was pained that ungodly men were flourishing in this world; but he says, "I went into the sanctuaries of God". Many hold to what is reached through David's prayers, Christ in heaven, and preach the gospel too; but have not a true judgment as to the state of things down here; the dove sent out by Noah, as we have seen, denotes infinite knowledge of the state of things down here. The Holy Spirit corresponds in Romans; and there Christ is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness" (@Romans 1: 4).
So it is as entering the sanctuaries that holiness is specially required; who could be there without holiness? -- and then you see the need of suffering. So Asaph's
{328}
ministry in the third book of Psalms should be looked into; the book finishes with @Psalm 89, where David is seen in a wonderful way -- greater, I believe, than he has been seen before. He is seen as God's firstborn, as if the book would teach us what Christ is in suffering, and how the conditions here occasioned Christ's sufferings: not simply that I am suffering, but I judge of them because they occasioned suffering to Christ. I have acquired the habit of going into the holiest.
Rem. At the end of @Psalm 89 he is great enough to take in and bear all the reproach: "Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants -- that I bear in my bosom that of all the mighty peoples -- wherewith thine enemies, O Jehovah, have reproached, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed" (@Psalm 89: 50, 51).
J.T. Yes. I think it would be well worth our looking into these psalms, one of the sub-divisions at a time, of course bearing in mind the others. When you get a man like Asaph, who had such a great place in the service of God, and see the exercises he had, it is worth while following him. The book touches on what the Spirit of God is doing; besides Asaph, there are other distinguished names in that book.
Ques. Is the millennium a moral necessity for God's rest in creation?
J.T. That is what has been remarked; the millennium is the seventh day, but those of us who enter the sanctuary not only see the end of everything here, but we see what Christ is before God, and how things are to be effected in a positive way and eternity reached; so that God is "all in all".
H.B. At the end of the next book there is an addition to the doxology.
J.T. The psalmist is evidently in it himself. The "Amen, and Amen" (@Psalm 89), would be his; Jehovah is specially in mind, He says, "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore!" The close of each book has its own distinction. At the end of the second book it is: "Blessed
{329}
be Jehovah Elohim, the God of Israel, who alone doeth wondrous things! And blessed be his glorious name for ever! and let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen, and Amen", @Psalm 72: 18,19. You can see we are on lower ground in the second book; it is a question of Israel. In the first book it is: "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity!" @Psalm 41:13. It is "the God of Israel" still, but @Psalm 89 is "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore!" It is *Himself*. The end of the fourth book (@Psalm 106), is: "Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!" So this third book is significant, I think, in that sense, it is God and what He is inside; one going into the sanctuary sees everything before God in Christ.
C.A.C. That is very good. How do you connect these psalms with what we have in Chronicles?
J.T. Well, the truth is that David is "the sweet psalmist" and it would, I take it, be his chief service. It is not that he was *appointed* to be chief psalmist, but it is what he *was*. Eternity is not reached officially; we have official thoughts in every section, but eternity is reached on the line of personality, through personal formation, the working out of intelligence and affection in us, so that we know what to do. It is not a question of what we are told to do, as in Exodus, where we get constantly, "as the Lord commanded Moses"; but you hardly ever get that in David. He, we are told, built *inward*. Speaking of David in this way, there is, of course, evidence of the recognition of the word of God with him; he said, "The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue" @2 Samuel 23: 2; but it is especially what *he* did; even the thought of the house was his own. So that in David it is God taking us up in accord with what we are as the fruit of His own work, so that in eternity everyone is entirely according to divine counsel. In @1 Corinthians 15 the Son is Himself subject; He is not, as it were, acting in subjecting others, that is all
{330}
finished: the Son is Himself subject, "that God may be all in all". How can He be "all in all" save as He has wrought in us to remove what is contrary? and that is what the psalms mean, I think: what men learnt in experience with God. Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun *prophesy*, according to @1 Chronicles 25. There were twenty-four sons to these men, as far as I can reckon, fitting in with the great thought of twenty-four. David separated, we are told, "for the service those of the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun who were to prophesy with harps and lutes and cymbals; and the number of the men employed according to their service was: of the sons of Asaph ..." Then we have the names of four sons. Following that, "Of Jeduthun", and we have six names. Then "Of Heman", and we are given fourteen names. We have thus twenty-four in all. They are all said to prophesy on harps: "All these were under the direction of their fathers Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, lutes and harps, for the service of the house of God, under the direction of the king. And the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of Jehovah, all of them skilful, was two hundred and eighty-eight" (@1 Chronicles 25: 6, 7). All these men are with their sons who are said to have prophesied, thus bringing out Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, the special leaders under David in the service of God. They not only provided the song and sang, but prophesied; and how is God to be "all in all", save on that principle? He is brought in powerfully in this kind of ministry; all else is excluded.
G.W. Does not the meaning of the name of Asaph suggest a gatherer, or collector; and Jeduthun, praising; and Heman, faithfulness?
J.T. All is very suggestive; they stand for the very acme of quality under David, all "under the direction of the king". The prophesying is that God is brought in in this remarkable way, a way in which He is most
{331}
easily allowed to come in, that is, in song. All Mr. Darby's hymns, I believe, have that character, the words bringing God into our souls.
Eu.R. Does that link on with @1 Corinthians 14: 26? "What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation".
J.T. Quite so; and there is the thought of "the spirits of the prophets", what comes out is the principle of subjection: "under the direction of the king". These men are really David's seers, bringing God into the matter. God is ever in such services and He becomes "all in all". What comes out in that chapter -- @1 Corinthians 14 -- is subjection: "spirits of prophets are subject to prophets". That is, our spirits are subject to us as in the prophetic ministry. I believe generally the ministry is *brought into* prophetic meetings; it is thought over beforehand; one speaks after another and he has brought in what he says. Whereas if he comes in with his own spirit in subjection to himself, all the prophets present being in the same attitude, if there is one sitting by who has got something at the time, it will be discerned at once, and room will be made for him. Thus the Spirit of God can use what He has at the time. It would greatly help if the brethren came together so that "the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets". I believe Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman would all be together in this way.
Ques. Would the accepting of "the direction of the king" (@1 Chronicles 25: 2), stand behind the spiritual wealth in Chronicles?
J.T. We must give attention to apostolic authority: "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14: 37. We must give direct attention to the authority of Scripture, or we shall be led astray. But then there is the spiritual side, the "spirits of the prophets", but also the spirits
{332}
of the saints: "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding" (@1 Corinthians 14: 15). How much scope there is for enlargement in spiritual understanding and power in these last days! It is the wealth of it, I believe, that is seen in @2 Chronicles 5.
H.B. The spirit of a saint would be very sensitive; is that the idea?
J.T. Normally the spirits of the saints are sensitive; you do not find anything like them in the systems of men: a number of men together waiting on the Lord, their spirits subject to one another. It is a wonderful triumph, but it can be made more than it is; I am certain of that. Heman, Asaph, and Jeduthun not only sang in the service, but *prophesied* in it; that is, that God is brought before our souls.
R.T.H. Would the different kinds of instruments used suggest variety?
J.T. That is right, the different features there are amongst those taking part in the service of God.
F.S.M. Would the thought of oneness that marked the singing (@2 Chronicles 5), also mark the prophecy?
J.T. You feel that whilst you do not look for "suggestive" meetings, that is, that if you say something, I will say something like it, there should be *spiritual* unity in what is said?
F.S.M. Spiritual unity and not merely verbal unity?
J.T. Quite so.
Eu.R. David had the thought of this rest before the house was actually built: "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell", @Psalm 132: 14.
J.T. This is answering David's exercises: "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy", @Psalm 132: 9. God would clothe the priests, too. And he said, "here will I dwell, for I have desired it" (verse 14). All this shows how David's exercises corresponded with God's purpose.
Eu.R. He located the foundation and called it the house before it was built (@1 Chronicles 22:1).
{333}
VESSELS
@Romans 9: 23,24; @2 Timothy 2: 20,21; @Ezra 1: 7 - 11; @Revelation 21: 10,11
J.T. What is in mind is to show how the assembly, or heavenly city, becomes invested with the glory of God. It is not mere external glory, it is substantial; and this depends on the persons who form it being themselves severally vessels of mercy prepared for glory. It is thought that the passage in Romans is primary, God sovereignly preparing certain vessels, "vessels of mercy", as they are called, "which he had afore prepared unto glory"; and that these, according to the verses in Timothy, are seen over against other vessels to dishonour, these the outcome of the unfaithfulness that has come into the profession; so the principle of separation is the way to the primary thought. Hence in remnant times the idea is seen and maintained, and Ezra shows typically how under God the vessels carried into captivity were handed back in view of Jerusalem and the service of God, Cyrus being ordained of God, long before he was born, for this service. "King Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put in the house of his god. And Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine-and-twenty knives, thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred. The whole did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem" @Ezra 1: 7 - 11.
We have a group of spiritual circumstances in these passages that the Spirit may help us to put together for our good, especially that we may see how at the
{334}
present time we are being invested with glory in assembly service. The Lord is said to be the Spirit of the new covenant; and "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" @2 Corinthians 3: 17; so that we can behold His glory, being changed into the same image from glory to glory -- "transformed". We are made glorious in a substantial way; and this appears in the heavenly city in the future. She *has* the glory of God, Scripture says. We might bear in mind this prince called Sheshbazzar; it appears that it is Zerubbabel, which means "born in Babylon". Sheshbazzar is possibly his Chaldean name, showing how the princes of God were captivated, and took on names of the countries where they were; but deliverance would mean that we come back to primary thoughts. The prince of Judah ought to have a name distinguishing him as such. These thoughts are very rich, especially in remnant times, and the scriptures read would show how we reach the purpose of God in the heavenly city, even in such times. God is stressing at the present time how we are brought into glory.
J.B. In what way are the vessels prepared for glory?
J.T. It is a primary thought of God. The word "vessels" would mean what is *usable*, in whatever setting that may be. As coming out of Egypt the Israelites obtained "utensils", which would imply that whilst they were used by the Egyptians, the people would be used by God. God has in mind to use us as delivering us, indeed primarily man was to be used of God. The idea of a vessel runs through Scripture, but appears more in relation to His service in the tabernacle, and particularly in the temple. It is very much stressed in the remnant books as calling attention to our deliverance from Babylon, and that the service of God is to go on. It is not a figure of something merely recovered, but is an indication of primary thoughts of God coming into being and activity.
F.W.W. Would a vessel of mercy be for the showing forth of mercy?
{335}
J.T. He would, surely. Mercy would imply sovereignty; "prepared for glory" is a primary thought.
H.E.F. Do I understand that your thought is that in this first scripture the thought is rather viewed as God's sovereign work and choice, but in the other scripture we see how the saints are really brought to that thought by the work of God?
J.T. Yes. The other scriptures show us how as captivated we are brought to it. We see in Egypt that Pharaoh set himself in opposition to this; in the passage in Romans, under consideration, Pharaoh is referred to as a vessel "of wrath fitted for destruction" @Romans 9: 22. That is God's sovereign judgment in government. Of course, Pharaoh hardened his heart; but this comes out, that "whom he will he hardens" @Romans 9: 18. We cannot question that; it is a fact before our eyes. What lies behind it we cannot compass. But the Spirit is stressing vessels of mercy prepared for glory; so that no one should quarrel with God if He is preparing vessels of mercy for glory. "Even us" -- we can say that now in the light of the post-captivity prophetical books: the return of the captivity brought to light this thought. Now it is as if God would say that, in recovering His people in the last days, He is recovering them to His primary thought; it is the real thing. The primary thought is being reached.
W.S. Does the word "prepared" include the subjective work in the believer?
J.T. I think so. John's gospel shows how this is worked out. John's writings culminate in the book of Revelation, and show how the holy city shines with the glory of God; it is put there. You can understand that, because the persons who form the city are severally vessels of mercy prepared for glory.
F.I. Does that stand in contrast with what is presented in @2 Chronicles 5, where the house was filled with glory, and the priests could not serve?
{336}
J.T. The official side is left out. What is inside points to sovereign mercy -- for that is what they were saying, "for his mercy endureth for ever"; what is inside alludes to the saints personally, not officially. It is what God has made them for *Himself* God will have the persons themselves, fully suitable, "before him in love". So the official or priestly side in them is not needed: God would say, They are delightful to Me, and I will have them without official service!
W.E.B. Would Paul be seen in the end of chapter 11 as a vessel of mercy fitted for glory? He speaks of God concluding all in unbelief that He might have mercy upon all.
J.T. Yes; he says, "mercy was shown me". The Lord speaks of him as an elect vessel in @Acts 9, where he is a sort of prototype of those forming the assembly, but the idea of *vessel* attaches to him specially in view of the ministry.
W.E.B. I was thinking of the doxology at the end of chapter 11: "God hath shut up together all in unbelief, in order that he might show mercy to all", and then, "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" @Romans 11: 32,33.
J.T. It would help us to take that ground together in assembly. We are taken up sovereignly as vessels of mercy prepared for glory; and we are not to suppose that this glory is to be altogether relegated to the future, but we come into it now in assembly. The assembly is being invested with glory, but it can only be as the persons themselves are capable of taking on glory.
S.B.F. So it is mentioned in @Romans 8: 30: "these also he has glorified".
J.T. That has a present bearing, clearly. It alludes, as often remarked, to the Spirit. The possession of the Spirit by us severally is glory. Everyone is thus glorified. It is quite obvious that everyone who has the Spirit of God is glorified. Still, the thought would run on to the future, where its fulness is seen, our
{337}
bodies being glorified, made like unto Christ's body of glory (@Philippians 3: 21).
H.E.F. In speaking of glory in connection with the service of God, I judge you have in mind that there should be something answering to this thought of being prepared, as we are together, so that there might be an opportunity for the glory to come in, and for us to get fresh glimpses of it.
J.T. That is the thought in the assembly, from one glory to another. It is not from degradation to glory, but "from glory to glory". So as leaving his house, the believer is glorious. The whole way to the assembly ought to be a way of glory: "I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord", @Psalm 122:1. He went on in a joyful company in a holy sense. So it is "from glory to glory"; hence the need of keeping our houses clear, so that they are not places of degradation, with radios, novels, and such things lying about in them, but houses marked by suited glory.
B.F. Have you any special features in your mind when you speak of glory in our households?
J.T. I was thinking of the action of the Spirit in the head of the house. You can see the change in a man. Take the case of the Lord's dealings with the man who was paralytic in Mark; he presents the same sort of thing. A spiritually paralysed man is not glorious, but a testimony to the power of sin. The man is carried by four, and let down before the Lord, who forgives his sins, and sends him back to his house. He arose, and carried his bed back to his house. He was glorious in principle; he would be a different man at home, a different man as a husband, and different as head of the house; being relieved of the thing that would irritate him and make him inglorious. Now he is glorious there; he is in power. He goes back in power, which alludes to the Spirit; for a man having the Holy Spirit in his house, and being head of it, is glorious; he is representative of God there. That is why I think
{338}
the graded authority the apostle speaks of is so important: "the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God", @1 Corinthians 11: 3. The glory is descending from God to Christ, from Christ to the man, and from the man to the woman. "For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head" (@1 Corinthians 11: 10), alludes to authority; it is glorious. And the children, of course, are "like olive-plants", @Psalm 128: 3. That is glorious too. All is stamped with glory, for the house is a divine institution; you cannot think of God ordering it without having the thought of glory in it.
E.J.F. Would it be right to suggest that in remnant times the vessels take on added value? I am thinking of the later reference to vessels of shining copper, precious as gold (@Ezra 8: 27).
J.T. Well, the copper takes on added glory, the thought of gold attaching to it. We can see in the epistles to Timothy how the vessels of mercy became associated with vessels to dishonour where there is no glory. That is what marks the profession all around -- the "great house", which is not really God's house, but what it has publicly become; and there are vessels to dishonour there. So the vessels of glory come to light in separation. It is the path of separation which brings us back to glory.
H.E.F. Would the thought of "from glory to glory" be expressed by "That way is upward still"?
J.T. That is the thought. So as issuing from our houses we do not come empty-handed. It was said of old that Israel was to bring out of their houses two wave-loaves baked with leaven: the leaven is not operative. How can that be? It is because I have power in my house to disallow sin in myself by self-judgment. I bring to God an offering. It is not yet, "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one" (@Hebrews 2: 11); but we sit down as those who are men and women here in a mixed condition, those in whom
{339}
sin has ceased to operate. That is glory; it is a great victory that, by the Spirit, I am able to disallow sin in myself.
C.W. Would you say a word as to star differing from star in glory?
J.T. That is a very exalted thought, a heavenly thought; what is before us implies it in the saints. What we are dealing with immediately is the way God glorifies those whom He justifies; that is, the reception of the gospel brings in glory in the believer. That involves @Romans 8, and the disallowance of sin. The Spirit is prominent throughout, especially in the first pan of that chapter.
R.T.W. So it is the God of glory who appeared to Abraham, he being a vessel of mercy.
J.T. Yes. It is important to bring that in here; and God had glory in mind. Abraham was to be a reflection of His glory, which he was.
A.L.V. Would the woman in @John 4 illustrate what you are saying?
J.T. Well, she is a vessel; that is what you have in your mind. She is glorious, too. She has her place in relation to a Man: "Come, see a man" @John 4: 29, she says. It was a question of *men* before as regards herself; she had had five husbands. There was no glory in that, but degradation, and dislocation of the divine thought; but now she gets from Christ the idea of a vessel. She had brought a vessel to carry back full of water from the well; but she leaves it, meaning that she saw what the Lord meant. She laid aside that which was natural for the spiritual. So she herself was a vessel, and proved that it was a vessel according to God, for she carried light now to the *men*. She was superior now to the *men*; she preached the gospel to the *men*; she had gained the victory clearly; and she was not an empty vessel, but full. They accepted her testimony, and went to see the Man; for her point was, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did" @John 4: 29. She has
{340}
one Man before her soul now; she is brought back to the divine thought in relation to where the woman belongs; she is subject to the one Man. She would be in the assembly rightly, having had Christ before her as the one Man.
C.O.B. Do you connect the thought of sonship with the glory of which you are speaking, the present glory?
J.T. Quite so. We shall come to that; it is an exalted thought, far on in our subject. The Lord said to His Father in @John 17: 22, "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them"; I believe that is *the glory of sonship*, one of the most important things, but "these also he has glorified", in @Romans 8: 30, refers to the Spirit given to those who are justified. So every christian in principle is glorified.
E.J.F. Is the way Peter speaks of glory in line with what you are saying? He speaks of the "Spirit of glory", and "the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus" @1 Peter 5: 10.
J.T. Yes. Peter's epistles are very important in relation to this subject. He speaks of our being "called by glory and virtue", @2 Peter 1: 3. This is a question of the Spirit; a person who has the Holy Spirit is in principle glorified, for everything subjectively lies in the Holy Spirit: joy and peace lie there; it is because of the Spirit that dwells in us: "if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among the dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you" (@Romans 8: 11); that is, the whole thought is in mind; it all lies in the Spirit. In my house I am able to carry on gloriously for God by the Spirit; and as to the future I am quickened because of the Spirit who dwells in me -- made like Christ.
F.G.B. Would the Philippian jailor be an illustration of a vessel of mercy fitted for glory instantly, in the
{341}
way he moved in regard to the apostles whom he had ill-treated, washing their wounds, and setting meat before them? Would that be a practical illustration of one becoming glorious?
J.T. Yes; he became glorious at once in his service to the apostles. How inglorious he was in thrusting them into the inner prison! That was man's brutality, but now it is all the other way. It is very beautiful. The household, too, comes in there; and "thou" occurs twice in the apostle's answer to his inquiry: "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved" @Acts 16: 31 -- by himself, he became glorious as saved; but the second "thou" is in "thou and thy house"; there was glory in his rejoicing with all his house, having believed in God. The whole scene is glorious. That glory began, of course, in Paul and Silas, whose praises were heard, and he took it on.
F.W.W. Would the baptising of all his lend itself to that?
J.T. I am sure it would; it would be the negation of this world's glory.
Rem. I suppose it is of importance that we should see that separating from what is unsuitable brings us into a realm of glory. The scriptures you have read in Ezra and Revelation treat very definitely of that. It is one of the seven angels which had *had* the seven bowls who shows John the heavenly city; the angel no longer has the bowl, showing that as the matter of evil is dealt with, we can see God's great thought in relation to the holy city.
J.T. Quite so; he is occupied now with another theme, that which is positive. It is very beautiful. This matter of separation is put so pointedly in 2 Timothy, for those vessels of mercy prepared for glory are mixed up with other vessels. Of course, Pharaoh was a vessel, a vessel of wrath, and some of these vessels in the great house are dishonourable: "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels,
{342}
but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour"; and then, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" @2 Timothy 2: 20,21. It is not now the sovereign mercy of God that is in mind. One comes back to a Despot -- for the word "Master" is "Despot", as the note shows, implying that there has been waywardness and wilfulness; for that is the secret of the mixture there is abroad. Real brethren are mixed up with these vessels to dishonour; it is disobedience, the working of will. So that we come back to the Master, the One who is absolutely dominant; and our salvation lies in our taking that well to heart. There is no possibility of staying in the place of recovery aside from the refusal of our wills. It is the Master now; it is the word used in @Acts 4, when Peter and John come back to their own company, having been let go. They pray to God as a Master, as a Despot, because the conditions in which service is carried on are so against us, that there must be the strictest adherence to obedience. Referring again to Exodus, there must be obedience if the vessels are to be of any use; there must be that.
Ques. What is involved in the word "iniquity" -- "withdraw from iniquity" @2 Timothy 2: 19 -- is it that the will is operative?
J.T. That is lust what it is; and those who name the name of the Lord are to withdraw from that. We are to own His authority over us; it is not optional at all. Young people need to recognise that; for a young person may calculate that he can stay here in some human religious denomination, or take his place with those walking in the fellowship of God's Son -- that he can leave the latter at his will: that is obnoxious to God. God is a Despot, and He will not brook our wills. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" @1 Corinthians 10:22.
{343}
Ques. Would "separating himself from them" be the good separating from the bad?
J.T. "These" (verse 21) would be the vessels. Withdrawing from iniquity is more in relation to the general system, where man's will is dominant systematically.
Rem. People are held because certain elements are there that can be looked upon as good, as vessels; and they are detained on that account; but the way of blessing is complete separation from what is unsuitable to God.
J.T. So there are the two thoughts. A person might say, Look at So-and-so, whom God has used. Why should I not be where he is? Such noted men as are in mind in that remark may be vessels of mercy and possess gifts, but they are in wrong associations, and really doing harm not only to themselves, but also to others by staying in them. They should withdraw from iniquity, as others have done, and then they would begin to have a definite judgment about others that they laboured with; those whom they call their colleagues in service -- some of them unconverted -- for I know that to be so in the systems in which they serve. If they saw the iniquity, and that the name of the Lord was involved in it, and they withdrew from *it*, they would also see that these colleagues of theirs were not vessels of mercy at all; they would have to separate from *them* too, and not be held by their service.
Rem. And instead of being restricted in their service, they would be "prepared for every good work"; you could not have anything better than that as seeking to serve.
J.T. Quite so.
R.T.W. So that principles and persons are always identified, really.
J.T. Then as regards the persons I may have been working with, in looking at their histories, I may have to judge that they are not christians at all. Well, I have to name them -- not only the system, but the
{344}
persons in it. So we have persons mentioned in this epistle that were spoken of hundreds of years before, but not named until we come to this epistle; Jannes and Jambres are not named anywhere else in Scripture, but it fits in here to mention them. These persons were corrupters of the truth; they withstood Moses. It was by imitation, and the apostle names them here. We ought to name such as we find them.
J.V.P. Does that show us how careful we should be about our associations?
J.T. Quite so. The naming of persons who are vessels to dishonour is a remarkable thing in this book; and another thing is that there are certain ones who turn away from Paul; in fact, he says, "all who are in Asia ... have turned away from me" @2 Timothy 1: 15 -- a most sorrowful thing, showing that in these circumstances there are those who have personal antipathy to those whom God is using. That is another thing in this epistle -- persons who are opposed, not perhaps to what Paul taught, but to *him*: they turned away from him. He speaks of others who forsook him: Demas forsook Paul.
F.F. "Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil" (@2 Timothy 4: 14).
J.T. That is another man to be noted.
F.W.B. Was the apostle desirous of the preservation of all these vessels? He says previously in the chapter: "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory" (@2 Timothy 2: 10).
J.T. That is "the elect"; he had that thought in his mind. In fact, this epistle is based on that; it is a question of sovereignty and promise, for Paul is an "apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, according to promise of life, the life which is in Christ Jesus" @2 Timothy 1: 1. The position "in Christ Jesus" and "the promise of life" are outside the reach of sin and Satan. So the apostle has great concern that in these days of the enemy's activities, this should be before us. Look again at
{345}
chapter 2:10: "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory" @2 Timothy 2: 10: what a great thought that is! The first epistle relates to *all men*: "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all" (@1 Timothy 2: 5, 6). Now in @2 Timothy 2: 10 it is "the elect", showing that we are coming back to divine purpose, not simply the recovery of a remnant, but we are on the solid basis of divine purpose. This enters into our service as vessels sanctified and meet for the Master's use, prepared unto every good work.
H.E.F. So you mean that in our day God is returning to His best thoughts.
J.T. Yes. That is the very word I should use: His best thoughts.
F.F. Is that why the apostle brings in that verse in chapter 1: "who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling ..."? @2 Timothy 1: 9.
J.T. Quite so. It seems to me that this second letter to Timothy is very much like what we were saying yesterday about the books of Chronicles. There is no doubt at all of the fact that the last paragraph of 2 Chronicles links on with the book of Ezra; it is almost identical with the opening verses of Ezra. This with other evidence shows that the books of Chronicles were written in remnant times, and this shows, further, that in remnant times, such as ours, God returns to His best thoughts; and not only so, but there is enlargement on what they had at the beginning. 1 Kings leaves out one of the choicest portions recorded in @2 Chronicles 5, that which refers to the unity and the number of the priests in the service, and also the Levites. The very best thoughts of God under David in regard of the service of God are recorded there in that book (2 Chronicles); and it was written undoubtedly, as I said, in remnant times. It would look as if God in
{346}
recovery in the last days will bring out the brightest side, even if in a small way.
Rem. It says, "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former", @Haggai 2: 9. It might be difficult to find this in Ezra and Nehemiah, but the last chapter of Ezra gives us persons clearing themselves from evil -- that is glorious, as has been remarked.
J.T. In our case it must link on with the heavenly city; that surely is the terminus; the latter glory is there. I believe a principle with God is to show that there is that which is so glorious that He must prepare something for it. There is the woman in @Luke 21 who cast in all that she had into the treasury; immediately following that we have the throwing down of the temple then existing, as if it must be replaced by something suitable to that which was seen in the widow. I believe that what God is aiming at at the present time amongst us requires the heavenly city to enshrine it, for it involves the very best thoughts of God. How this should appeal to us! In Ezekiel we have the earthly side of the city, in John's writings the heavenly side, what God is developing in these last days, His very best thoughts. The same thing happened in regard of Israel, for with the remnant there was that developed, in relation to the Davidic character of Christ, which went beyond anything there was in Moses¬ time; and in the assembly in remnant days there is that here which goes beyond anything there was before; the very best is enshrined in the heavenly city for us, and it will be in the earthly city for them.
Ques. Would the excessive turmoil of the world today be intended to turn our thoughts to the assembly, and what God has in it?
J.T. That is what it is for. God is bringing on the world, and on ourselves as in it, this terrible pressure; aiming in it all to bring out in us the very best there is.
F.G.B. In Daniel we read that "Belshazzar ... commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels
{347}
that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem" @Daniel 5: 2 -- they had not lost their features of gold and silver, although in conditions that were not suitable. Would it apply to believers at the present time in the system of things connected with Babylon?
J.T. They were in a false position, held for man's use. God resents it very much that His people are held thus. "Woe to the world because of offences!" @Matthew 18: 7; that means that the world has decoyed the saints -- offended them in the sense of turning them away from the truth. "Woe to the world!" That is just what happened to Belshazzar; it was woe to *his* world! He brought out the golden and silver vessels; he desecrated them. The people of God in the systems of men are desecrated; they are the people of God as much as any, but in a false position.
F.G.B. It is a very solemn position for the world to be in, holding these vessels.
J.T. Hence there is to be the terrible destruction of it. Woe to it! the Lord says.
There were a large number of vessels in Ezra's day; five thousand four hundred. The name of the prince Sheshbazzar I think has to be considered. He is a trustworthy person, to whom these vessels are given over. Whether it be Christ in type, or whether it be the principle of rule, or responsibility, among His people, in either case it is a question of trustworthiness. There are those who can be trusted with such persons or things. Elders amongst the saints are held responsible. Leaders are held responsible, as the apostle said to the elders of Ephesus: "shepherd the assembly of God" @Acts 20: 28. The name Sheshbazzar, in @Ezra 1, would point to the power of the world as able to give names to what belongs to God, each country putting its own name on us. The book of Daniel enlarges on this. It has to be accepted as a governmental fact, but is God not going to take it up with those countries? Certainly He
{348}
is. Sometimes one hears among the saints the expression *our country*. We may make much of it, but let it not be forgotten that every country has to answer for all the names given by each to what belongs to God. Such terms are never used rightly. Take the word 'church'; it is not used in its right sense at all in the world. The religious world does not use the divine vocabulary as it was intended. We have come back to that divine vocabulary.
But Cyrus is special; God raised him up to do this service, and he is doing it well, including the giving back of the vessels of the house of Jehovah. That is of God. Sheshbazzar must allude to those of us specially in responsibility, and we ought to clothe our brethren (even although still in Babylon) with these thoughts: that they belong to the assembly for its service.
Rem. He does not get the Babylonish name when he comes up in the return to Jerusalem mentioned in @Ezra 3: 2.
J.T. No; he gets the name which comes down to us in @Matthew 1; Zerubbabel is really his name, meaning, "born in Babylon".
Ques. What would correspond with the handing over of the vessels today?
J.T. If we look at @Ezra 8: 24 - 34, we shall see the bearing of it: "I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, and I weighed to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the heave-offering for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors and his princes, and all Israel present, had offered. And I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver; and silver vessels a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents; and twenty basons of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of shining copper, precious as gold. And I said to them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah; the vessels also are holy; and the silver and the gold is a voluntary offering to Jehovah the
{349}
God of your fathers. Watch and keep them until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah. And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.<p>And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. And we came to Jerusalem and abode there three days. And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Urijah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites: the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written down at that time".
Now that seems just a fit finish to what we are saying. Of course, this is a secondary movement under Ezra; it is not the first chapter; but the principle is brought out fully as to priestly care; because the man in charge is a thorough priest; his genealogy is traced back to Aaron (@Ezra 7: 5); he is an orderly man, too, for not only were the vessels counted, but recorded by weight. That would apply to letters of commendation; not only should it be mentioned that a brother is in fellowship, which would be on the principle of count, but there should be that which answers to the idea of weight.
Rem. It is very important that we do not say things that we do not mean.
J.T. A letter of commendation ought to convey just what a man is. A brother 'in fellowship' is one among others; that is on the principle of count; but
{350}
weight is another thing; it would constitute a check on him.
F.G.B. What do you mean by a check?
J.T. There might be sixty in fellowship in the meeting from which he comes, and he might be commended as one of those; but then they are to be weighed; they are not all of the same value. One brother might be much more valuable than another; his *weight* suggests the idea of his intrinsic worth, what he is.
F.W.W. The brethren would be acquainted with his weight.
J.T. Yes.
G.S. Would that have to do with the glory?
J.T. It would indeed. There is glory attaching to that weight. Take a letter like that which the apostle Paul gave to Phoebe: what glory as to her there is at the beginning of it! "I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea ..."; then he runs on, taking up other brothers and sisters; the whole is a chapter of glory, filled with salutations of love; the apostle salutes one after another. I suppose the assembly at Rome would be more glorious after that letter was read. What the saints were would be better understood -- hence how they were to be regarded.
{351}
HOUSES FILLED
@Acts 2: 1,2; @Luke 14: 23; @John 12: 3; @2 Chronicles 5: 11 - 14
You will observe that the idea of a *full house* appears in each of these scriptures. The first is filled with a *sound*, a sound from heaven; the second is to be filled with *people*; the third is filled with *odour*; and the fourth is filled with *the glory of God*. I wish to speak under those four heads, and it will be observed that these four features do not exclude each other: sound makes room for people as well; people make room for an odour such as that of which we read in @John 12 -- there was one complainant, but obviously the odour was appreciated by those present, nor did it exclude anyone; then, fourthly, although the priests were not able to do their service, that does not mean that the *persons* were excluded; it refers to an official feature as non-essential to what was in mind; the glory resting in what was there, which in the antitype does not exclude but includes people. The idea is ever in the mind of God, heaven is to be peopled; so that, although glory fills heaven, and love too, people are essential there. Authority in the sense of Moses, and what is official as in the priests, may be non-essential, but not the people; for our names are written in heaven, we are told, and our names there establish our right there; so that we are not to be there as strangers, but as known persons, and known in our dignity, for dignity is what is stressed in the firstborn.
@Acts 2 is the first passage to be considered, and this states that the saints were all together in one place. That is a preliminary and essential condition to what follows, for God is not filling an empty house with His sound from heaven; hence we are directed to those persons. Persons are in view throughout. It is a question of the public testimony, and for the public testimony we have to consider those employed, whether
{352}
they are suitable. How are they to be furnished? Not, certainly, according to this record, by human cultivation; they are furnished by Christ; they are His handiwork. Coming into this world He came in in a public way, for although He moved here in a retiring way, yet He took His place in the likeness of men, that is, He was One who could move about amongst men, and could accept their conditions and circumstances, sin apart. There is no evidence that He was clothed differently from others; John the baptist was, because his testimony required it, but Christ came in in a suitable way, eating and drinking, but with no special habiliments to mark Him off as a Minister of God. He moved about among men, "taking his place", not only in the likeness of man, but "in the likeness of men" @Philippians 2: 7 -- men in their ordinary circumstances of life.
So His distinction would develop from Himself, not from any human honours or distinctions conferred. His distinction was in Himself, hidden, indeed, in a sense, for the ordinary eye saw nothing at all; as the prophet said, "there is no beauty that we should desire", @Isaiah 53: 2. Still the power of distinction was there; and so in time He became public. He is not said to have been "in the deserts", like John the baptist was till the time of his showing to Israel. Jesus was there among men -- it is most touching -- following His father's trade. "Is not this the carpenter?" they said (@Mark 6: 3). It was not long before He became distinguished, and what distinguished Him was intended to give character also to the workers that He would send out into the world in testimony. They were to be seen. The testimony was not to be "done in a corner" (@Acts 26: 26), nor were they to enter by the back door anywhere, but at the front. It was a public matter, and the Lord fitted them for it.
What is said in @Acts 1 shows that they were all in a certain place, not in anything palatial, but in an upper room. They were there according to their names;
{353}
their names intimated what the Lord intended each one of them to be. Besides, there were women there, particularly the Lord's mother -- the most distinguished woman of all time; also other women; and His brethren were there, too. The testimony clearly is to include not only men but women -- a very important matter to remember. So they were all there, as we read: "they were all together in one place" @Acts 2: 1. You can understand how comelily they would sit together, for they were sitting. You might say, Why should they be sitting, for the Lord was standing as He left? Well, if we do not learn to sit, we shall certainly not learn to stand in testimony, nor to act in testimony. Their posture was that of sitting. They were evidently freed from all else, prepared under God for the great event. That is another important matter, dear brethren, to be ready for great events; for great events belong to us, as those who belong to God's assembly, and every assembly meeting is a great event. We are to understand how to be there and to take advantage of an opportunity. Every occasion is not intended to give the same person an opportunity; we get opportunities in our turn, and we see in the case of Mary that she was ready for a great occasion. This occasion was not to distinguish one of them only; it was to distinguish them all -- an important matter, too, that God would affect us *together*; that is, the similarising influence which God has provided is to make us like one another -- in one way each is distinguished, but we are like each other; the likeness is taken on from the glory. The varied glories that shine, in which we have part, are intended to make us like one another. If there be difference, it "differs ... in glory", @1 Corinthians 15: 41. Those whom God uses are to be glorious. We are perhaps slow to name things, but there are many things which come under our notice that are really glorious, and we are not aware of it; the reason is that we have not eyes to see true glory. Glory attaches to the believer, and especially to those
{354}
who are the result of the handiwork of Christ. So the one event in @Acts 2 affected them all, and they were all affected at the same time.
So we are told that when the day of Pentecost "was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place" @Acts 2: 1; that is, they are ready for the great event. It was not an accident; it was thought of long before; the divine eye looked on to this at the inauguration of the day of Pentecost. It was a great feast, a feast not limited by time, like the others. It is running its course, but it is really an inlet to heaven. It is the feast that has the promise of the Holy Spirit in mind. Here it is not the inlet to heaven, but an outlet from heaven, an outlet for a sound, and this sound filled the house, but it was "the house where they were sitting" @Acts 2: 2. *They* gave character to the house. If it be the upper room, it is all the more suggestive. They gave character to it, and the sound filled it.
Now you can understand, dear brethren, that this would accustom them to heavenly sound. There are many sounds, of course; the world is full of them, but *the sound from heaven* is something to be noted. They are to become accustomed to it; they are to reproduce this sound; they are to be preachers. I mean to say, they are to be vessels in testimony. Some of them -- twelve any way -- would be preachers, and they would have to understand that sound, so as to conclude what kind of sound should emanate from them. This must be the pattern of sound. It is from heaven. What issues from heaven is *par excellence* as to anything; and if it be sound, it must be that, and as such must enter into the testimony. It is the sound Paul speaks about, the sound issuing from Thessalonica, for instance: "the word of the Lord sounded out from you", @1 Thessalonians 1: 8. The apostle Paul, in treating of this subject, speaks of lifeless things that give sounds -- pipes and harps, organs and pianos; I do not say that he mentions all these, but they are all lifeless. He calls them lifeless;
{355}
they cannot be used in the service of God; they are not equal to it. They are lifeless. Hezekiah says, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee", @Isaiah 38: 19. The service of God is to be carried on in life, the musical instruments are to be living. That is what the apostle is stressing in @1 Corinthians 14; so he says, even lifeless things give a sound (verse 7); and he uses them illustratively to show that if there is not definiteness of sound, who shall know what is piped or harped? So with the trumpet, there must be definiteness; and so with those who catch the heavenly sound, the sound that issues from heaven. Witness must be definite, so that what is said, or testified to, should be understood.
So this sound filled the house; that is, it excluded all other sounds, for any other sound would interfere with this one. People do not interfere, odours do not interfere, but *other* sounds interfere. Hence the travesty of the use so profusely in christendom, in the testimony (so called) of God, in the streets, and in the great cathedrals and the like, of lifeless things. They are incongruous. This heavenly sound is not to be discerned in them, but in living instruments -- persons who wait on God. Here the saints are sitting; they are ready to absorb what is of God. The sitting posture would suggest that all the senses are free -- we absorb things through them. So there would be the absorption of this wonderful sound in the men and women who sat there. It is not a musical sound for the moment -- it will develop into that in the house of God, for we read of music and dancing in the house (@Luke 15); but this is not musical: it is "a violent impetuous blowing", or "a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind" @Acts 2: 2, as it is rendered in the Authorised Version. But it is not simply "wind", it is more the idea of breathing -- see note in the New Translation. The word "breathing" is more suggestive, not of the wind as a created thing, an element in the creation (these elements have their place, of course, in the testimony
{356}
of God), but if there is breathing, there is a Person behind it, there is feeling behind it. God does use the elements, for, as we read in Job, He uses thunder, lightning, rain, snow, frost, and so forth. God uses these things in His testimony; but this sound is directly God-given, this sound of powerful breathing. We have breathing in @John 20, but it is not mentioned in this way. That is the breathing of Jesus -- it is most touching -- the breathing of the ascending Son of God. He breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (@John 20: 22). This, in @Acts 2, is an enlargement of that, having in mind what had to be contended with in the testimony; and we are told that it filled all the house where they were sitting; and then we are told in verse 4: "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak", but they began to speak "as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth".
Now that is the great principle in this section, that the idea of the filling of the house is carried into the persons. All the house was filled where they were sitting, and in turn it is said that the Spirit filled every one of them; "it sat upon each one of them" @Acts 2: 3 -- beautiful thought! Can I eliminate myself from anything like this? Maybe there is someone here who does. It is the mind of God for believers, and I cannot afford to eliminate myself from that; it is an insult to God, and it is to my unutterable loss, if I eliminate myself in any way from these great things which God furnishes. So it says, "they ... began to speak" @Acts 2: 4. I am speaking now in a practical way to the dear brethren. Let us not in any way eliminate ourselves from any of these things that are brought so near to us, and in such a palpable way. It says, "it filled all the house" -- why should I be out of it all? Let no one here eliminate himself or herself from this: the Spirit sat on each in the character of cloven tongues, as of fire; then we are told that they were all filled with the Holy Spirit; that is to say, they were available. Think of the opportunity given
{357}
to us! Are we available for what God offers? Think of what there is for us at the present time, dear brethren! Am I available? If I only listen to the truth, even admiring it, and do not take it in, I am not filled.
God is looking for filled vessels. God does not want empty vessels. If there are any ready, He would fill them, as the six waterpots of @John 2 were filled. So here, each one was filled. With what? -- with the Holy Spirit! Surely no one here would for a moment think of eliminating himself from such a great blessing, brought so palpably to him, as this is! Each one of them in this wonderful company which Christ had prepared was sitting there; they were all ready to be filled. Were they unjudged people? Were they selfish people? Were they people of pride and ambition? No, they were not. The Lord Jesus had taught them to eliminate through self-judgment all these things; and now they are ready for the Spirit. One challenges oneself: Am I available to God for this -- to be filled? It is not simply coming to the meetings in a perfunctory way, and intimating that it is nothing to me whether I am there or not. What good is such a person to God? He is better away, really; he does not add to the interest; he does not add to the absorbing power of those present. And yet God is here in infinite fulness to fill each one with the very best, with the greatest possible things. They were all filled. They took part in testimony, too. They spoke, we are told: "they ... began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth" @Acts 2: 4. That is to say, they were vessels ready; and the Spirit came in and they heard the sound, and now the Spirit is on each, and they are speaking, but how? "As the Spirit gave to them to speak forth"; and they spoke "the great things of God".
Well now, I go on to Luke to pursue the subject. In this gospel we have the house -- "my house" is the word which the Lord's parable uses -- it is God's house, of course; and the word is, "that my house may
{358}
be filled". The house in @Acts 2, of course, was a literal house or room, and we cannot say that it was filled with people. I suppose it was commodious; I suppose it afforded suitable accommodation. We are told by Luke in his gospel that it was large -- "a large upper room furnished", @Luke 22: 12. If it be the same one as in Acts -- no doubt it is -- I suppose they were all comfortably seated. It is important that the testimony should not be hindered by unsuitable accommodation in rooms or halls in which meetings are held. I believe God would help us on these points -- not to discredit the testimony by any avoidable limitations. In some instances they are simply the result of carelessness. God does not like that. If we are careful about our own houses, why not about the places where the saints meet? So Luke speaks of "a large upper room furnished"; there is no thought of its being filled with people in this connection: the point is that they were comfortable there, sitting; not, indeed, for their mere ease, but as ready for the great occasion, with nothing to distract them.
Now we come to the house in @Luke 14; and there can be no doubt that it is the house of God, and it is to be filled, to be filled with *people*. That is the point; there were not enough. And, dear brethren, inasmuch as the final thought of filling is in view -- though a good many were there already, according to the parable, it was not quite filled -- does it not enter into our own position now? The churches are becoming empty: I am alluding to what is common and current around us; that is to say, apostasy is at work, most deplorably so. One has no pleasure at all in the churches, so called, becoming empty, because one knows such emptying is simply apostasy, the devil's work. But what about the house of God? Is it not being added to? It is, indeed; and that is the positive thing to which one turns with the deepest satisfaction, that the matter is proceeding, the house is being filled with people,
{359}
but not with such as are unsuitable. Let us never be deceived by the thought of mere numbers. Not that we should not be ashamed of very small numbers where there might be larger ones: for the truth is that small numbers are often due to want of evangelical activity.
Whilst we say rightly that it is "the day of small things" @Zechariah 4: 10, let us remember and own that our laziness, our indolence, our want of evangelical activity, is the cause of the smallness of numbers in many cases. Let us take this to heart; for this is a great evangelical chapter, and also the next one (@Luke 15).
I am now speaking of *fitting*, for God has no thought of anything else than that all His blessed thoughts should be answered to in the fullest measure. There are to be no voids, no empty seats: no, dear brethren! The counsels of God will surely be corresponded to by the work of God. The gracious, patient work of God in all these centuries will result in His house being filled: filled with people; but what kind of people? "That my house may be filled", the parable says. @Luke 15 shows you the kind of people. There is *quality*, not only are there numbers; and in securing the quality, we are to be concerned not only about evangelical energy, but about formation and building. So we find in Ephesians, where we should expect it, that the gifts are received, according to the psalm quoted, by Christ as Man. Every gift was received by Him as Man, and every gift was, I believe, expressed in Him, the suitable, blessed Vessel available to God here below for the expression of all His thoughts. I am now speaking of ability, of workmanship. Christ is now ascended, having passed beyond all the heavens. Think of the altitude that enters into our service! We have been speaking of the upper room, but think of going beyond all the heavens! He has gone beyond all the heavens, and being up there ascended, He has received of the Father the gifts. We read of His "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit",
{360}
@Acts 2: 33. The Spirit involves all the gifts, but the Lord received Him first. Of course God gave the Spirit, but the Lord Jesus as Man exalted in heaven received Him first. The Spirit has come down through the hands of Jesus -- wonderful thought! -- that as Man above He has Himself received the Spirit and shed Him forth; and so the gifts are here. We read, "thou hast received gifts in Man" (@Psalm 68: 18); He received them for men; they have come through Him; not, as it were, directly from God the Father to us, but through Christ, handled there and then given. "*He* has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers". What for? "For the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ", @Ephesians 4: 11,12. That is what we have to keep in mind, dear brethren, not only that the house is to be filled, but *how* filled? With *what* filled? What is in view is "the edifying of the body of Christ: until we all [the same word as in @Acts 2] arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", @Ephesians 4: 12, 13.
Well now, that is @Luke 15. This prodigal, as we call him -- see the hands he has passed through! "The father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best robe and clothe him in it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet ..." @Luke 15: 22. The bondmen are all available; they bring out things; it is a question of refinement, of clothing the saints; first of all, with the thoughts of heaven. If I am to be in the house, I am to be there as fully acceptable to heaven. In truth, we belong to heaven: "such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" (@1 Corinthians 15: 48); and if the house is to be filled, dear brethren, there must be the reflection of heaven; the persons must be according to that. So in chapter 15 there is no formal introduction of the
{361}
prodigal into the house: he is the house -- you understand what I am saying -- he represents the idea of the house; he is clothed and fed and furnished and arrayed in every way according to heaven, it is the father's doing. The bondmen are all there to do it; there is no discrepancy whatever; he is according to the place. Then there is the house: as if to say, That is the divine result of what these two chapters in Luke present.
So, dear brethren, the filling coming in there, at once calls for quality. The Lord has been helping us as to quality. What am I doing? What kind of workmanship is mine? Am I skilled? There are rough workers, as we see among Solomon's workmen, those who were burden bearers, but there were skilled workmen, too, not only skilled in relation to ordinary stones, but also precious stones -- in all that is highly refined. Am I available for anything of this? Well, the filling needs it -- "that my house may be filled".
I pass on to @John 12, so as to show how sisters come into this matter. I have been speaking of sisters: they were all there as the Spirit came, according to @Acts 1 and 2. Now here is a great occasion, a supper made for Christ, and the place of it is suitably filled. We can understand there would be no vacant seats at this table. Martha served; that is, the idea of *sitting* is there, and the idea of *serving* is there. "Martha served" -- that is her part; and I suppose, service is never to cease; shall we not serve above? Jesus will; I mean, love would be active in that way, and nothing would be remiss, nothing wanting. No, dear brethren, love will never have anything that is not suitable, and everything needed is furnished.
So now it is a question of what this sister Mary can do. What has she got? One often feels, and surmises, without being severe on the sisters, that they do not think it necessary to have anything. As if they were saying, If the brothers have the things, let them give
{362}
them out: we will receive them -- or maybe not receive them! Now the only one who, in the sense implied, had anything in this wonderful scene was Mary; and she had what was supremely suitable. She had it too, in the sense of preparation; it was something she had kept for some time; for what is any one of us if he has not spiritual history? Spiritual history is one of the greatest thoughts. Mary had spiritual history; she was not a believer of yesterday, she was a woman of spiritual history; Luke gives us the beginnings of it, John the finish. It is a fine piece of work, dear brethren! Would you not say, Well, I want to be a fine piece of work for heaven? Each one of us, I am sure, in our quiet, meditative moments wants to be a fine piece of work. Such divine workmanship is wonderful: "Let thy work appear unto thy servants", @Psalm 90: 16. Is there anyone here who would eliminate himself from that? Is the work of God not to appear in us? It is, even as it appeared in Mary. Luke gives us the beginnings, John the finish, as I said. This is the last mention of Mary in the Scriptures, though, of course, she has been mentioned millions of times since; there is no end to it at all. She has an eternal fame -- all in heaven will talk about Mary in the way I am speaking of her. She is a fine example of divine workmanship. She knows how to choose the good part -- to sit at the feet of Jesus and hear His word -- and now she has this ointment. It is very precious; she has kept it -- it does not say in an alabaster box, as elsewhere. The Spirit of God would eliminate that thought here. *She* kept it; she herself was the box. She was one of those who "love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption", @Ephesians 6: 24. You cannot corrupt her, in that sense; she is incorruptible. In principle and in result all true believers are; the first epistle of John views us in this abstract way; it is only a matter of the setting aside in time of all that is contrary. God looks at us abstractly, and there is the thought of it in a concrete
{363}
way, seen in those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption, that is, to be entirely unselfish in it. So she kept the thing without an alabaster box; she was that herself. That is the way John presents Mary.
So the great occasion arrives, and there she is thoroughly in it and equal to it. She anoints the feet of Jesus. It is not an assembly occasion properly; for after the Lord discloses Himself to the assembly as such, to the persons who compose it, it is His hands and side of which He speaks; that is how John records the fact; but here it is the feet of Jesus. I suppose she represents the Jewish side; but still, we can include it amongst ourselves. It is a question of a journey, of six days yet to be traversed. She was waiting for His death, for the time of His burial, and it was a question of His feet. She is saying in effect, Those precious feet have travelled to me; they have to travel six days more; they have to travel to Golgotha, and I will express my love to Him whose feet they are! And she had the ointment; there was no need for self-complaint, saying, I wish I had brought that! What a fine opportunity it would be if I had it with me! Mary *had* it with her; it was herself in effect, dear brethren. There are things I may forget, but the point is what I am myself, that is the thing. She was there; the real Mary, the real workmanship of God was there; there was nothing wanting, no! She fitted there, as she will fit eternally. That is the idea in the assembly: I want to fit in there as a subject of the work of God, and to be ready for my opportunity. So the house is filled with the odour of the ointment.
Now I go on to @2 Chronicles 5. I have now come to the supreme thought in my subject, namely, the unity of the Spirit in the formal service of God. This is one of the four records of the kind: the tabernacle is filled with the glory; then 1 Kings tells us that the temple was filled with the cloud; and this book tells us it was filled with the glory twice, the second time
{364}
being when Solomon had finished praying. Indeed, we get again in Ezekiel twice over that the house was filled with the glory of the Lord. It is a thought God loves; it marks His ways where things are suitable. This account in 2 Chronicles is fuller, I think, than any of the other instances that I have mentioned; and I may remark, so as to make it clear, that in 1 Kings the filling does not require the service of the priests and the Levites; it is in relation entirely to the ark, as if God would signalise the presence of Christ in the temple, how God comes in where Christ is everything, Christ personally or in testimony. "And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah" (@1 Kings 8: 10), as much as to say, when they are out, the glory goes in. What for? It is in relation to the ark which they had just been placing there under the wings of the cherubim, and we are told that the staves were drawn out: there is to be no journeying; it is never to be carried again. The staves appeared in the holy place, suggestive, too, to those of us who are serving; as the word says, "he shall go no more at all out" (@Revelation 3:12) -- precious thought! This is the time of working, journeying. The ark had to journey for centuries, but now the staves are to be drawn out, they are to be seen from within; the time of journeying is over. We too are about to enter into our rest very soon: in this sense the staves are to be drawn out soon. "He shall go no more at all out", is the word of Christ in consideration for His workers. It is said, indeed, in the gospel, that He said to them, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little", @Mark 6: 31. It is His consideration for His workers; He never fails in this, and we must not forget that we are to do this, answering to His request, because our workmanship will be all the better for it. We are not to be holiday-makers or tourists, but to come aside into a *desert* place, where there is to be nothing for the flesh, to rest awhile;
{365}
but it is *with Christ*, not in His absence: He says, "Come".
The passage in Kings to which I am alluding refers to the completion of the work side, the journeying side. The staves are drawn out, the priests come out of the temple, and the glory fills it, as if God is saying, That is enough for Me! Christ's presence there is enough in one respect, for Him. There is no longer any priestly or official service: the glory fills the house; but there is nothing there about this wonderful service of the priests and Levites that we have in this chapter of 2 Chronicles. So we read in @2 Chronicles 5: 10: "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place" -- that links on with what is recorded in @1 Kings 8. The Spirit of God however is not content with that in this book; we have enlargement here on what we get in 1 Kings, and it really suggests, dear brethren, that the continuance of spiritual ministry must mean enlargement. Undoubtedly Chronicles came in later than Kings; it was, no doubt, written in remnant times; and we have thus the suggestion that in remnant times we may have spiritual enlargement on official times, for it must be the same occurrence that is referred to in @1 Kings 8 and @2 Chronicles 5, but in the latter record there is enlargement as compared with what was seen in official times. Is it not an incentive to us, dear brethren, to follow up this great thought of the service of God, to be ready for it at all times, so as to get this enlargement, this preparation for eternal service, for it is to be, "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", @Ephesians 3: 21. It is "in the assembly in Christ Jesus": that would imply that He is still operating; the preposition indicating that it is in His power that the service goes on and shall go on eternally. So there
{366}
will be a great enlargement in what we shall have part in then. God is preparing us for it now.
So the addition to @1 Kings 8 is in verses 11 - 13 of our chapter: "... (for all the priests that were present were hallowed without observing the courses; and the Levites the singers, all they of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, clad in byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets) -- it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud", @2 Chronicles 5: 11 - 13.
This brings out the great enlargement in the mind of the writer of the books of Chronicles; and surely it should appeal to us now as to whether we are ready for enlargement, or whether we are simply living in the past. Is the Spirit inactive? Not at all! The Spirit is here. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts", @Zechariah 4: 6. Zechariah enlarges on that in remnant times; and it is for us, that we might make room for the Spirit to enlarge us.
I confess that I am very little able to speak much about glory, though I find myself speaking a good deal of it; but that one should speak of it with understanding is what one is concerned about. The glory of Jehovah (for that is the word here) filled the house of *God*: God is the great Ultimate, dear brethren in all this -- not the Father, exactly, nor Jehovah, but *God*; God as presented to us in the Scriptures. The first verse of Scripture uses a word to express Him which implies that we are to worship Him, that He is to be served, that He is to be revered, that He is supreme. Here
{367}
"the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God". It seems to me that it is a beautiful touch, a touch that such a man as wrote this book was able to give by the Spirit, in order to direct our minds to God as the great Ultimate of all things: "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things", @Romans 11: 36. The glory of Jehovah fills *the house of God*.
What is to be noticed in verse 13 is "to make one sound to be heard". It is not simply that the sound is there, but it is to be heard. I was speaking earlier of sound from @Acts 2; but now it is one sound from human musicians, but worshippers, qualified worshippers, and they are able to make *one* sound. Is God not leading us to that? Is He not seeking to help us to repudiate all selfishness, and pride, and rivalry, and ambition, in His service; that there might be unison -- not only the unity of the Spirit and the unity of the faith, but the unity of *sound*? We do not get this in @Acts 2: it is the supreme thought in relation to what I am saying, and it is to be *heard*. There is no use in talking about these things unless they are to be realised. Here we have one voice heard "in praising and thanking Jehovah". It is very touching to connect this with the prison in Philippi: the sound was heard coming from those two sufferers, who in prayer praised God with singing. The prisoners listened to them. The sound was heard. The children in the temple were praising the Lord, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David" @Matthew 21: 15. Who heard it? -- the Lord heard it. His enemies said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? He says in effect, I hear! What they were singing was to be heard. So, as I said, in the prison at Philippi, the singers were heard: "the prisoners listened to them", @Acts 16: 25.
May God bless those thoughts to us, so that we may have before us this supreme thought of unison in service, that the sound may be heard, so that we may realise something of God's glory filling His temple.
{368}
STANDING BEFORE GOD
@Zechariah 6: 4,5; @Zechariah 4: 13,14; @Jeremiah 15: 19; @Jeremiah 35: 18,19; @Deuteronomy 10: 8
What is in mind is to enlarge on these scriptures as presenting the important thought of *standing before God*. It is seen in Zechariah, where God is said to be the "Lord of all the earth". It is hoped, by the Lord's help, first to call attention to these "four spirits of the heavens", as they are called in @Zechariah 6, and these "two anointed ones", also standing before the Lord of all the earth, in chapter 4. Then in @Jeremiah 15, to remind us of the danger, as in this attitude of standing before God, of becoming discouraged, being complainants (whether verbally or in our hearts) as if God were unfair to us. Fourthly, how young people come into this favour through obedience, especially to parents; and finally we may see the great privilege afforded to us as priests, that we may stand before God and minister to Him.
The first is of peculiar importance at the present time, as embodying the idea of government, the four monarchies seen in this chapter under the heading of horses being spoken of as "the four spirits of the heavens" @Zechariah 6: 5. This is a unique explanation, but one which is to be noted, in view of the apparent danger in some quarters of disregarding governors: those whom God has appointed to maintain things, in His government, pending the return of Him to whom the government belongs -- the King of kings and Lord of lords -- that is to say, our great and glorious Emperor, still rejected, is about to take unto Himself His great power and reign. These four powers designated here as the four spirits of the heavens are, from the very designation itself, evidently appointed of God. Be they Babylonians or Medes or Persians or Greeks or Romans; be they what they may personally, they are designated in this way by God, and all who love God and who
{369}
know Him should know His mind respecting them; give thanks to God for them; pray for them; for our very existence here in testimony, as we shall see in the later scriptures, depends upon them. So the prophet rightly asks about them, and young people would do well to follow the example of Zechariah, and inquire about these horses viewed in this remarkable way as the four spirits of the heavens. Four is always, I may say, universal, and not only at a given moment, but also in the sense of an extended period. They have come down the centuries to us, and we are under their protection in this very hall today. It is the authority of God in fact, not only the permanent thought of the heavens ruling, which is the primary thought of God, but the spirits of the heavens. How God can make men -- themselves unbelievers it may be -- represent the *spirit* of the heavens is a matter of great interest, but He does it. He makes them serve Him indeed, beyond what they themselves might be able to describe or admit. God has them in hand. The figure here is the horse, a very serviceable creature, but one that may easily get out of hand, as some of these monarchies have, but God has the power to control. We are exhorted as christians not to be like the horse or the mule, who have to be kept in with bit and bridle. Young people are like that sometimes; indeed, older ones too, but God has the means of control: we pray for that control, and we prove that He has that control, so that the very spirit of the heavens is around us in the sense of government, which is an assuring fact.
Then correlative with that, there is the question of "all the earth", not merely a particular country, specially favoured. There are those of us who consider our own particular country or countries, and pray for them and rejoice in their prosperity, but the spirit of the heavens would enable us to think of *all* the earth. The Lord Jesus, we are told, is seen coming down from heaven with the rainbow on His head, and He puts His right
{370}
foot on the sea, and His left on the land, and cries as a lion roars, meaning that He has power to take these things up, and is about to do it. He is already putting in His claim, by the testimony. It is our business to make it clear that the right is His; but still He died under these powers -- under one of these monarchies -- the apostles were martyred under its power also. It is all a question of the government and the wisdom of God in it, so that He might complete His testimony. His testimony involves His patience -- how long He could wait -- His patience in the gospel, and it is a very great matter that the gospel should go on to the end.
So we have these two "sons of oil". We may have no part in the government -- save through our prayers -- but we certainly, as I assume, take on this second designation, namely, the "anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth" @Zechariah 4: 14. The four spirits of the heavens make the testimony of these two a possibility and, dear brethren, it is our privilege to occupy this place of testimony. Thank God, we do take it up a little, but one would urge the great importance of taking our places under this heading -- two anointed ones, or, as the margin reads, *sons of oil*; typically, persons who are developed in the thought of the Spirit. How important at this juncture that we should read Scripture, read it in the spirit of it, as the Holy Spirit gives us understanding, that we should understand what this oil means! It is the Holy Spirit, as I said, not as the earnest of our inheritance, but as seen publicly in us, the correlative witness to the rule of the four monarchies. The service of these two sons of oil is to continue. How this thought enlarges us as to the little we may be doing!
These two sons of oil, as you will remember, are seen in later years -- in the book of Revelation -- and indeed they run through the testimony from that time to this. It is a question of *adequate* testimony in the
{371}
power of the Spirit, namely, that the preaching, the teaching, or the service, whatever it may be, is done in dignity; not as imitating current religious ways, but in the originality of the mind of God, as carrying conviction with it as of God. The apostles insist in their testimony: "*We* are of God". Is it too much to suggest that there should be some representation of God at the present time? Surely not. I should be ashamed to be on earth save as in some way representing God. Man is made in His image, after His likeness. What is it for? To be representative. Man is God's image and glory even as a creature, but what I am speaking of now is the dignity put upon us by the oil, by the Holy Spirit "sent down from heaven". It is not only that one has the Spirit, but that one is characterised by Him.
In Jeremiah we have one of the most honoured of the prophets. He says to God: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy words were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor exulted: I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation. Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable? It refuseth to be healed. Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a treacherous spring, as waters that fail?" @Jeremiah 15: 16 - 18. No one of us would speak to God in that manner, I am sure. We might tell Him of our appropriation of the Scriptures, as Jeremiah does; he says: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them", referring, I suppose, to the book of the law found in the temple, in the days of Josiah. Jeremiah would assiduously read the holy roll, read it with deep interest; but then he had evidently been losing in his soul in spite of this; he actually says to God: "Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a treacherous spring, as waters that fail?" It carries with it, of course, the marks of the dispensation in which these words were uttered, but still, God is God, and could not but feel such words, for God is true. And it is a
{372}
great testimony (among many other things in the epistles to the Corinthians) that God is faithful. Whatever appearances may be, let us never falter, especially those engaged in the divine service; let us never falter, for God is faithful, and not only so, every promise of His is yea and amen in the Son of God. We can rest in that.
It is clear that Jeremiah failed, and if any of us fail in the same way, conversion is necessary. It is well to be reminded that "our God is a consuming fire" @Hebrews 12: 29, and any failure marked by bitter complaint, spoken or unspoken, whether against God or against the brethren, will not pass unnoticed. So the word "return" (verse 19), is addressed to Jeremiah by Jehovah at this juncture. If you are to stand before God again, there must be a turning round, and so God goes on to say to His servant: "Thus saith the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me" @Jeremiah 15: 19. That is a word that ought to appeal to every heart that has known, if not now, but *has* known, what God is to the witness. Jeremiah was a witness, a most remarkable witness, and God says: "If thou return". The need is great, dear brethren. If there is one here who has turned away, who once proved the faithful support of God in service, God is saying to you, "Return"; and this word, "If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me", shows that you will not have to go all the way alone, God will meet you. God will meet the returning servant. I am not now speaking of a prodigal, for Jeremiah was not that. He was a failing servant for the moment, but God would have that settled with him, and it would be on the principle of returning. And then God says: You will not have to come all the way, I will meet you and *bring* you. He says: "then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me" @Jeremiah 15: 19.
Jeremiah, then, would be engaged perhaps in a more difficult service. It will be a question of persons,
{373}
of being faithful to persons. Servants who turn aside, but become restored, sometimes make the best ones. It was said to Peter: "when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren" @Luke 22: 32. The need is great, as I said, and so the further word is, "if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. Let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them" @Jeremiah 15: 19. Maybe someone here has been with them. It may be you have found your place among the opposers of the truth. You must never be with them again. "Return not thou unto them"; the word is, "Let them return unto thee", Thus you give them a lead in returning, and you will have power to help them. You will have your place restored. One thus restored will be a greater servant than he had been. You will never again turn aside complaint, or join the opposers of the truth. You will save them, you will separate the precious from the vile, and what could be more honourable than to be as God's mouth? It bears on a title accorded to Christ, who is the Word, One who not only speaks the word of God, but He is God's mouth. Can anything be more desirable in service than that? And what a need there is for it!
Well now, I go on to chapter 35, to speak to young men and young women here. The passage refers to the Rechabites, a remarkable family. They are brought in here by God as representative of His mind. Their way would ensure that their father, Jonadab, should never be without a man to stand before God. Where is the father who does not desire such a result from his careful discipline and training of his children? It is a question of coming generations, dear brethren. God works on that principle, the generations of the godly, how they are to be *continued*, how men of God are not to fail of a man to stand before God. Who is there here who is old, who would not cherish the thought that as the Lord takes him, as he goes to be with the Lord, he has left behind a man that can stand before
{374}
God, that God accords that privilege to? I hardly know anything that pleases one more in moving about amongst the brethren than the presence of young men, sons of godly men, holding the ground that their fathers held. The work of God has taken this form peculiarly. It always marked the work of God, and the need for it now is great: the continuance of generations carrying on the work of God, which their forefathers had been used of Him to further. The primary parent in this sense never fails of a man to stand before God. It is a matter for serious attention. What is said is: "Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you: Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever" @Jeremiah 35: 18,19. How stimulating these thoughts are as to the young! Do they not imply that parents should become more energetic as to their children? The world is bidding for them, and the governments need them too; but there are God's rights, which must always come first, and these have to be inculcated in the house, in the household of faith, and the children are thus honoured. "Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever", @Jeremiah 35: 19.
Well, finally we have the priesthood. As one proceeds in this service one is increasingly impressed with the thought of the extent of the area of our service. It is universal. Our outlook is to be universal in whatever little service we may be occupied: preaching in the streets, or in the meeting-rooms, or ministering the word to the saints, the outlook is the whole field. "The field is the world" @Matthew 13: 38. It is a question of God's rights on the earth and it has to go on, however few and feeble, this is the outlook -- to stand before the Lord of all the earth.
Now priesthood is more inward. One can understand that these four spirits of the heavens standing
{375}
before the God of the earth, are at His bidding. Indeed, the thought is that they are going forth from before Him. They are ever active as under His control. If it be the two sons of oil standing before the God of all the earth, we are also at His bidding. It is a question of what has to be done. A right of way is secured through redemption for His service. What has to be done is to be done in the dignity of the oil. However little there may be it has to be on that line.
Now, as to priesthood, I read from Deuteronomy. It says, "At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day" @Deuteronomy 10: 8. Levi in Deuteronomy includes Aaron, of course. The whole of the Levites are called priests in this book, and also in the book of Joshua. That is to say, the priesthood has a wider bearing than in Leviticus and Numbers, but then it is Levi, and Levi means *united*. It would point to what God is helping us in -- the idea of unity, that we are linked together in a vital way in the service of God and His testimony. What underlies it is the idea of union with Christ. How attractive all this is! May God grant that it may be so to us! He is calling us into it, this inner thought. "At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi" @Deuteronomy 10: 8, so that he might stand before Him. It bears on what is so much before us now, namely, the service of God. It is a question of standing before God. The Lord Himself as risen is seen *standing* in the midst of the brethren. Stephen sees Him in heaven standing. It implies that we are not waiting to be served. We are ready to serve. We are on the alert to serve, and to serve after the divine manner, not as is customary in the general profession, dear brethren. Let us reject at once and for ever all thought of copying what is around us. It is a turning away from the truth. It is the assumption on the part of unconverted men to be priests to God. I do not say that it is wholly so,
{376}
but that is the general fact; whereas all believers, having the Spirit, are priests, and God is calling upon us to be priests in a true practical way. He separated the sons of Levi, and there is the thought of unity in the name; and according to this book, and especially Joshua, we have no earthly inheritance. I have been speaking of the Lord of all the earth. It is now a heavenly matter. Think of having access to the heavenly regions! It is not simply because I am a priest, but because I am a son, that I have access to the heavenly regions.
The apostle Paul says: "I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) how that he was caught up into paradise" @2 Corinthians 12: 1 - 4. He was not called up there to serve -- he was caught up "to the third heaven"; then he says, "caught up into paradise". The one is *elevation*, the other is privilege and blessing; unspeakable blessing, unspeakable ecstasy belongs to that place. Paul understood that, but he says: I did not know whether in the body, or out of it. It was special; we cannot build much upon it beyond that it was special. It was not the position of those who fall asleep through Jesus, it was a special circumstance.
The matter of priesthood is to be faced by us all; we belong to those whom God has separated; as He says, "the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day" @Deuteronomy 10: 8. That is, the thing went on, and we may thank God that in our time it goes on; and God is stressing it; He is stressing His service in the assembly; and that in it we are to know what to do at a particular time. Normally the priest knows; it is the function of priesthood to lead in this matter. The priest knows
{377}
what to do. The privilege of this belongs to every christian, young and old, and God would press it upon us that the whole range of divine service is open to us. He has separated us to stand before Him, to be ready as the opportunity comes, and to know what to do. As we get in Mary of Bethany, she had what was needed at a given moment. She had kept it for the day of the Lord's burial. What spiritual understanding she had! It was a pound of ointment, pure, the best that could be found. It was not in an alabaster box according to John's account. *She* was the box; she loved our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. How important that is for young people! As we see with Joseph, a young man, he was preserved incorruptible. The enemy sought to corrupt him, but failed. And so we are to flee youthful lusts, and "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" @2 Timothy 2: 22, to have part in this service for God, to stand before God -- ready to function suitably as opportunity offers; having what is needed and, like Mary of Bethany, knowing how to use it; hence the house is filled with the odour of the ointment.
{378}
SONSHIP
@Genesis 4: 17; @Exodus 4: 22,23; @2 Corinthians 1: 19,20
J.T. The sonship of Christ in its public bearing is in mind. The first scripture read sets out the place sonship had with the man of the world in those early days. The word "son" is found here for the first time. In Cain's mind the idea was to mark the city which he had built; "he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch" @Genesis 4: 17. Over against that, we have, in Exodus, God asserting sonship as it is in His mind. He sent a message to Pharaoh: "Israel is my son, my firstborn" @Exodus 4: 22, conveying that He, too, had the thought of sonship, and that it should appear in service. He appeals to Pharaoh as to *his* thought of sonship, Jehovah conveying that His was no less, and that the service of God should be in His son's hand. The thought appears in Malachi, the last book in the Old Testament: God says that He would spare those who feared Him "as a man spareth his own son that serveth him", @Malachi 3: 17. Then, finally, at Corinth, the apostle and those who served with him in the gospel carried forward this thought: the Son of God was preached among the Corinthians by himself and two others. The truth had good witnesses, so that there should be a public result for God in that city.
It seems as if it would help us to have this before us now because it is what is in God's mind, both in regard of this world and His public rights here, and eternally, too, but particularly now. The husbandmen said of the Son, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours" (@Mark 12: 7); but that inheritance will come back to the Son publicly. He will ask for it, for God says, "Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession", @Psalm 2: 8. So that the stress laid on this side of the truth at the
{379}
present time is significant, as, indeed, always; for it is a question of one who reflects the mind and affections of God -- God, as it were, expressing His best in testimony; and no one really is in the testimony according to God save as in the light of that.
H.E.F. If this public testimony is to be effective according to God, does it depend on those who render the testimony being in the enjoyment of sonship?
J.T. Yes; sonship underlies testimony -- in Christ and in us. The prominence given to it at Corinth would show that it was to be enjoyed, at least in those who preached it. The light of it was evidently attested fully by Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; it was in mind that it should be in every heart who received the gospel in that town, and necessarily would affect the testimony of the assembly in that town; for it is addressed as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth" @2 Corinthians 1: 1; God's best, as you might say, involving Christ known as Son in all those who form the assembly.
We might consider Cain's city just for a moment, because it is well to have the negative side; for the antediluvian world furnished developments that God would meet; and the world of @Genesis 4 is Cain's world presented in its varied features, but the idea of the son is stamped upon it -- *his* son. Evidently he had in mind that he should be a cultured person, a disciplined person (Enoch meaning disciplined), and this, of course, as in the world today, underlies all education and polish. God meets it all in *His* Son; that is what we may come to; but it is well to look at the world in this way, so that we might see what God would overthrow in our minds, and replace with the light of His Son and His world.
H.E.F. Your thought is that Cain was expressed in his son, in the system that existed before the flood?
J.T. That is what the name *Enoch* would represent. We find it, too, in God's world. Enoch in God's world is a very pleasing man to God; "he had this testimony,
{380}
that he pleased God" (@Hebrews 11: 5); Cain's son did not. No doubt he pleased Cain: Cain saw to it that he did, and the name he gave him would imply that he would be properly cultured and sophisticated in this world. We could not have such a development as this chapter presents aside from education -- the arts, the sciences, and the fine arts too, music, and the like: these are the outcome of research and education, and, of course, enter into the world system, making it what it is, men priding themselves in having made it. "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built?" is the principle, @Daniel 4: 30.
J.A.P. Do you think we have to be careful as to the amount of admiration we bestow on it?
J.T. That is a good way to put it. The arts and sciences, of course, go largely to make it up, to give it the dignity that it has in its makers¬ minds. We pride ourselves, naturally, on what we are and do; and the city which represents the very centre of that system is called by the name of Cain's son Enoch. Every capital in the world is developed in that way as the centre of the very best which the country can afford. It is well to have before us what the thing is that we are to be delivered from, to see it negatively, and to see how God meets it.
Ques. Would naming it after his own son have in mind also the continuance of it?
J.T. I suppose it would; that son would carry on the idea in *his* son.
R.T.W. Why is the relationship of son first found on the line of what is evil? It says of Cain that Eve bore him and then that she "further bore his brother Abel" @Genesis 4: 2 -- not another son.
J.T. I thought that we might see why it should be so. The first mention of the word 'son' is in connection with Cain. It seems a relationship through which a man is expressed, or shines; whether it be the father shining through the son, or the son shining in
{381}
the presence of the father, the position or relation affords opportunity for the very best to shine out. As to our Lord it is said that "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)" @John 1: 14: that is where we see the thing shine according to God -- a Son with a Father, an only-begotten One. That is what is in God's mind in this relation, that He shines out in it. It is His best, as it were; God seen (using the word advisedly) according to how He would have Himself known -- in His Son. God had spoken in the prophets; but "at the end of these days has spoken to us in ... Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds", @Hebrews 1: 1,2.
Ques. Is the culmination on the line of evil seen in Barabbas?
J.T. "Son of the father". Quite so.
F.W.W. The statement in @Hebrews 1: 2,3, "whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance", is attributed to Christ as Son.
J.T. Yes, That shows what is in mind in sonship according to what we are speaking of now; "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance". It is not simply that He is great enough for these things, but He is in that relation.
F.W.W. "In Son".
J.T. Exactly: "In Son"; it is God Himself, but a divine Person *in that relation*.
B.F. Is sonship according to God brought in in answer to what came out in Cain?
J.T. That is how God meets it; not that it is an afterthought with God; but God's purpose is worked out as the world develops. The idea of kingdom, for instance, is brought in to meet the kingdom of man after the flood. We do not get that before the flood, but we get this thought of sonship before as crowning
{382}
the world in its best features according to man. Sonship was in God's mind before of course, but this development according to man comes in first historically.
Ques. Would you say this development provided the occasion for God to bring out His thought?
J.T. Yes; it reappears in Pharaoh, who is a king, representing the power of the world in royalty. The feature of royalty is an advance in the history of the world. Nimrod was the first in that position, in kingship, and God meets that. Pharaoh is a continuation of it, and he has a son. So that God appeals to Pharaoh in that way: He says, "Israel is my son, my firstborn. And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill thy son, thy firstborn" @Exodus 4: 22,23. That is how God meets Pharaoh; God is dominant now, even in Egypt: He says, "I will kill thy son, thy firstborn". God must have His son; and, of course, that ought to appeal to any who is in any way influenced by this world, even if a christian, because you are robbing God of yourself in this relation. We belong to Him as sons: God is demanding our deliverance, our releasement.
H.E.F. Do you mean the enemy would retain God's people so that they might express features of himself, and so rob God?
J.T. Yes. Our brother just now referred to Barabbas. That is the man they selected instead of Christ. That is the kind of man the world wants. Think of a christian being a companion of Barabbas -- a world-builder: even though he was a violent man, he was a world-builder, because violence belongs to the world, it is a feature of it; the world is full of violence, violence in high places and in low places now; how sorrowful that one of God's sons should be there! That is the present bearing of "Let my son go".
G.W.B. Does the quotation in @Romans 9: 26 come in here: "there shall they be called Sons of the living
{383}
God", showing God has this in mind in the gospel?
J.T. Just so: He is going to bring out Israel in the future in the way you quote: they "shall be called Sons of the living God", which is an additional thought to that of sons of God, a very significant term too, God has in earlier days stressed the thought of life, and He is now stressing sonship. The thought will reappear in Israel, as it is here; but it is in those who form the assembly in a fuller way. God is leading many sons to *glory*; it is the heavenly side of the truth that is reflected in the assembly, and that is what God would have to shine out now; it is the heavenly side, but still having a public effect.
H.E.F. Do you think that when the gospel came out -- "The gospel of God ... concerning his Son" -- it had in view that men should be secured in that way?
J.T. Yes; and @Romans 1, which you quote, goes on to say that He is declared to be that, not simply what He is before God, in His service; but declared to be Son by resurrection of the dead -- that is, by resurrection of dead persons, however long or short a time they have been dead. It is an abstract thought, but plural -- the full thought of "dead". He is able to raise the dead: "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" @Romans 1: 4 -- declared publicly to be such. It was announced from heaven when He was baptised; but now He is known to be Son, declared to be Son of God by resurrection of the dead -- the greatest testimony to power.
C.O.B. The book of Exodus opens with "the sons of Israel": is this fourth chapter an advance upon that?
J.T. It is; still the reference there is remarkable. They are characteristically sons, because "with Jacob had they come" @Exodus 1: 1; that is, they are *with their father*. Joseph had brought them to that point. Joseph was characteristically a son; and Jacob loved him, we are
{384}
told. Joseph brought the family to that point, so that they are with their father; and that is the idea, that God has us with Him. He has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love -- the most attractive presentation of it, perhaps: He is the Son of the Father's love.
Rem. Moses seems to be introduced, too, in this way in Exodus. We read: "a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived, and bore a son" @Exodus 2: 1,2. Though Aaron was first, Moses is called attention to as a son.
J.T. Yes; he was 'fair to God', @Acts 7: 20 (note). This idea of being 'fair' comes out in Exodus, the ministerial section of Scripture, and correspondingly in 2 Corinthians. The Corinthian epistle has to do with the ministerial side of the position, and it behoves all those who serve in any public way to keep this before them prominently: "The Son of God ... preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)" @2 Corinthians 1: 19, says the apostle. So Moses enters into this, and the New Testament enlarges on the fact that he was "a proper child", one with whom God would be pleased.
J.A.P. Referring again to @Romans 1: 4, what place has the Lord's own resurrection in relation to the expression, "by resurrection of the dead"?
J.T. It has part in it. He raised Himself, as we know from John's gospel; but the bearing of the statement is to what He did for others. It is not a declaration from heaven, but "in power", meaning that He exercised it; and, of course, that is the power by which the world is brought down.
Rem. Paul's first preaching was that Jesus is the Son of God.
J.T. It would involve this; he would have before him the world that God had in mind, however little he understood then. That is the point with him. He says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me", @Galatians 1: 15, 16. The Son was apprehended inwardly by
{385}
Paul through revelation; and he goes on to say, "that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" -- it is deliverance in power, but deliverance in sonship, by such an One as that. This makes deliverance peculiarly attractive, God is shining in it.
Ques. Do you mean that in the preaching, sonship is always in view?
J.T. If you take the Roman epistle, that is how it begins: "God's glad tidings ... concerning his Son ( ... marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead) Jesus Christ our Lord" @Romans 1: 1 - 4. He is declared to be that; that is the public testimony to Christ. He raised Himself, of course, but He was not seen publicly thus; it refers to persons that are raised and seen publicly; the testimony is there unquestionably.
Ques. Would the resurrection of Lazarus be an example?
J.T. That is one of the best witnesses to it, because he had been *four* days in the tomb. The Lord sent a message to John the baptist: "Go, bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard; that ... dead are raised" @Matthew 11: 4,5, without specifying who they were. Lazarus is an outstanding case, because it is definitely stated that he had been four days in the tomb; that is, as Martha said, corruption had set in. The young man at Nain apparently had not been dead so long, but Lazarus had been four days dead.
C.O.B. Is "my firstborn" a further thought?
J.T. It is very beautiful that God should deign to communicate to Pharaoh what He had in His mind as to Israel. Pharaoh would understand; he would be educating his son, I suppose, for the throne, so that he might represent him; and God says, I have feelings like that -- of course, infinitely more pleasing and holy -- but, still, Pharaoh would understand. It brings out the place sonship has in *testimony*, because it is in man's mind. Hence the way God moved was
{386}
intelligible to Pharaoh. God's messages to men are intelligible to them.
A.W.G.T. Is that why God allows His thoughts to be anticipated, so that when He brings in the real thing it will be intelligible?
J.T. That is just what I have often thought. "As of an only-begotten with a father" @John 1: 14 is characteristic of any such son with a father; it is descriptive, and, of course, Pharaoh would appreciate it in God's message to him.
Ques. Had you in mind, with regard to Exodus, that this challenge is maintained today publicly? God is moving on this line publicly today, is He not?
J.T. That is what I was thinking; He has been moving on it from the time of the incarnation: "the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" is Luke's presentation of the truth (@Luke 1: 35). It is a question of how He should be known. What He is *called* is a public matter.
Ques. Would @Luke 15: 24 give us a parallel thought in relation to what we have in Exodus: "this my son was dead and has come to life"?
J.T. That is so; in truth, the idea of death and resurrection came out in Israel, and will do so again, for Israel is dead; God will say presently, He is alive! The principle is worked out in any prodigal. God has nothing less in His mind for anyone than to say of him, He is a son. It is what the prodigal was, you might say, potentially, but he was never characteristically a son until he was back with the father in the house.
E.J.F. Referring again to Genesis, is there any significance in the fact that the matter is mentioned again in @Genesis 5: 3 -- "Adam ... begot a son in his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth"? Is that bringing forward what is in God's mind, that image and likeness should be worked out in sons?
J.T. Quite so; Seth would be Christ in type. Seth was to take the place of Abel whom Cain slew; and he
{387}
is characteristically equal to the position, appointed, as his name signifies. He calls his son's name Enosh: that is, he brings in the idea of man naturally as weak and perishing, as over against Cain's thought. Cain would not think of *his* son as a poor, weak, perishing creature; he would make him an outstanding man, with polish and education. So in relation to Enosh you have the testimony: "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah" (@Genesis 4: 26); that is, in the light of Christ as bringing in the truth as to man's state; for Seth is Christ in type.
E.J.F. Would the complete thought on God's side be seen in @Romans 8, where it is said that we are to be conformed to the image of God's Son? Would that be the complete idea you have in mind?
J.T. Quite so. What we are engaged with especially, however, is to stress the idea of sonship in power. It enters into the gospel, the public testimony of God. It is no less than this; God has nothing less in His mind.
A.W.G.T. Is that why in Mark's gospel the Lord is brought in at the outset as the Son of God?
J.T. That is in line with what we are saying; it is the public presentation of the gospel: "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God" @Mark 1: 1.
G.W.B. Would the seven sons of Sceva, Jewish high priest at Ephesus, illustrate what has to be met in the way of imitation on the part of the enemy?
J.T. Quite so; it is the full expression of the idea in evil -- "seven sons" -- characteristically; and at Ephesus, too, where the greatest power was demonstrated in the gospel.
G.C.G. Would the reference to the prodigal in @Luke 15 mean that the gentile is secured in sonship, the elder brother apparently being in the place of Israel?
J.T. I think so; that gives force to what we are saying, how God has wrought especially in our own times in relation to the thoughts of life and sonship.

Sonship particularly applies to those who form the assembly, and it is only as we are in it really that the gospel can be rightly presented. How can I present the gospel of the Son of God rightly save as I understand it? Many, of course, present Christ as a divine Person, but then the thought of sonship characteristically must be carried into it: sonship itself enters into it.
C.O.B. Sonship as to the assembly carries the thought also of firstborn ones.
J.T. Just so; that is what we are every one: "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven", @Hebrews 12: 23. The idea of firstborn attaches to every christian. There is no inferiority in any from the point of view of sonship: they are all alike in that sense, all of the same dignity.
W.L.C. You mean we should preach the gospel from the standpoint of being sons ourselves?
J.T. I think one should exhibit the thought -- one is free in one's soul, exhibiting what is presented, an exponent of what one preaches; one is to preach as in sonship.
M.H.E. Does the fact that Joseph is sovereignly chosen for the firstborn's place suggest that in the last days this thought should very much come into evidence? He was almost the last of Jacob's sons.
J.T. Well, it does look so: "the last shall be first", @Matthew 20:16. In the parables of the kingdom of heaven in Matthew, there is what appears before the assembly is introduced, and there is what appears after it is introduced. There are two phases of the kingdom in Matthew; and in the second phase sonship in regard of ourselves, of believers, is seen: "Then are the sons free", (@Matthew 17: 26). In the further parables of the kingdom there are the workmen whom nobody would hire. The leaders of the religious world will not hire people who are characteristically sons; they want labourers developed according to human requirements.
{389}
That is what the clerisy is based on -- and then the vicar is a one-man thought, the service must centre in him, which never can be sonship; it must lead to bondage; it must gender to bondage. Well, there are workmen not after this principle in the market-place, who will not be hired; but the householder goes forth and brings them in at the eleventh hour, and they are given their wages first, receiving the same as the others. God says, as it were, It is My pleasure! -- the householder says, It is my pleasure; I can do what I please with my own. That is liberty; it is a question of divine pleasure. These are the kind of men I want in my vineyard, he would say; they made no bargain with him. Sonship in us will never make a bargain with God; we serve in love. We never expect wages in the ordinary sense, making a trade of the word of God. We get the idea of wages in @2 John 8, but that clearly refers to what the servant receives at the end in a spiritual sense. It is a question of serving in love, and thus in liberty; the divine thought underlying service in sonship.
F.G.B. Would you say that the enemy's great effort is to eliminate this feature of sonship from the people of God?
J.T. God has been helping us on this point. I believe it is entering into the public service of the brethren. As to sonship in Christ Himself, it is not that He was begotten of the Father before all worlds: it is derogatory to Christ to make Him 'begotten before all worlds'. The truth is that a divine Person became a Man: that is incarnation -- coming in through birth, but still a divine Person entering into this relation. "The Word became flesh" @John 1: 14 -- a divine Person taking on manhood, but in the relationship of Son, taking it on designedly in this relationship. So as He is seen, Luke records He "shall be called Son of God" @Luke 1: 35. How could anyone who saw Him with divine perception fail to call Him Son of God? So John the baptist says, "I have seen
{390}
and borne witness that this is the Son of God" @John 1: 34. He saw the Spirit coming down upon Him and abiding upon Him -- there was One on whom the Spirit could abide. Now God is going to operate, He has this Person in this relation. John the evangelist says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" @John 1: 14. That is the kind of thing they saw; how could they but speak of Him in that way? John the baptist leads in it, being directly ordered to do it; so he testifies, "this is the Son of God". So it is that God is operating through the Son, and I believe the Lord is helping us in our ministry publicly, but He is aiming at helping us more to see what is in His mind. "When he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him" (@Hebrews 1: 6); that is preceded by, "*Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten thee" @Hebrews 1: 5, quoted from the second Psalm, which says later, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way" (@Psalm 2: 12). That is God acting in One who is reflecting Him as in this relationship; and so it is, that all of us are to reflect God in our measure in this relation -- "Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4: 23.
A.G. Is that why in @John 9 the works of God reach that climax, the knowledge and worship of the Son of God?
J.T. Exactly; "To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil", @1 John 3: 8. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son" @John 3: 16; that is the line of testimony.
Ques. Does the expression, 'son with a father' mean that the son enters fully into the father's mind, and fully responds to the father's affections?
J.T. Quite so. We have been speaking of being translated into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love; that is the thought -- we are in that kingdom; the Father has put us there. He translated us into it,
{391}
having delivered us from the authority of darkness. What do we see now? that is the point; we contemplate His glory. Proverbs opens up this position, the Son of the Father's love; the writer of the book of Proverbs was in that position. So he says, "I was my father's son" -- or, "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother" @Proverbs 4: 3. There is affection in it, affection radiates in it, and is to be expressed in the brethren. We lay hold of the thought by the Spirit of adoption in our own souls, hence we testify effectively. Anyone can see the difference between the man who is trained to be a teacher by human methods, and the man whom God has made a preacher; the latter is in liberty; he reflects Christ in sonship.
Rem. So that although it is service, it is to be carried out in liberty.
J.T. That is the idea: "Let my son go"; it is one let go.
Ques. Does the thought of firstborn mean rank or beginning?
J.T. It is the beginning of the thought, I should say; there is a family following; and it is in the mind of God that this idea should be universal; nothing less than the whole universe is to be in this liberty. There will be grades, no doubt -- Israel and the angels; though their sonship is somewhat inferior to ours; but it is all expressed in Christ.
J.A.P. Why does Paul link the thought of the promises with what you refer to in 2 Corinthians?: "whatever promises of God ..."
J.T. It is to bring out that God is faithful; that is mentioned three times in these epistles. In this last case Paul goes on to say, "whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen" @2 Corinthians 1: 20; he buttresses what he is going to say by the fact that he and Silvanus and Timotheus *preached* the Son of God, not simply that Jesus *is* the Son of God. What He was
{392}
in testimony is in mind. Paul says, We preached Him, among you, and He is not yea and nay. In Him is the verification of everything in the mind of God, but particularly of what has been promised; for the faithfulness of God refers to His promises; they are all carried out in Christ -- "in him is the yea, and in him the amen", and then this is to be reflected "by us".
J.H. Is there a link with Isaac in that way in relation to the promises?
J.T. Yes; that is how the truth comes out in the history -- in the types. When Jacob was going to Egypt, God appeared to him at Beer-sheba, the place of the promises. It is spoken of just as a place in @Genesis 21, but it is called a city in chapter 26, but it is a city in relation to Isaac, meaning that things are administered now; not only are there promises, but administered things. So Jacob is found at Beer-sheba on the way to Egypt going *out* of Canaan -- which might imply that the promises are failing, as is often the case with believers; he comes away under the stress and feels God is not what he thought He was. That is the state of soul in Jacob while at Beer-sheba; but the passage says that Jehovah appeared to him, and said, "I am God, the God of thy father" -- that is, Isaac, not Abraham (@Genesis 46: 1 - 3), Isaac typifying Christ as Son, in whom everything is verified; every promise of God is yea and amen in Him. Hence God says to Jacob, 'Fear not to go down to Egypt; the promises will not fail you'. So it is in sonship that all these things are verified. Those of us who are in the light of sonship are sure about things; we have no question about God or His promises; we know everything will go through. How needful that is in these last days, when the enemy is doing his utmost to baffle us, whether socially, or commercially, or politically; but he will not be able to baffle us if we are in the light of sonship.
{393}
W.E.B. Does the idea of mutuality come in in relation to Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus preaching the Son of God at Corinth?
J.T. It is suggestive of humility that Paul should place himself in this way with those two men, because they were not apostles properly. I suppose Paul would sit down and hear Silvanus preach; no doubt he would be the best listener to the gospel at Corinth! They may have had three or four places in which to preach at Corinth, as we have in our little way in our cities; but no doubt Paul would be very happy to hear Silvanus or Timothy preach the Son of God.
G.C.G. Does what you are saying indicate that with any of us who serve in the glad tidings, seeking to preach the Son of God, it is vitally necessary to be in the liberty of sonship ourselves?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. With these three there would be no feeling of rivalry, I am sure; or, leaving Paul out, there would be none between Silvanus and Timotheus. I am sure they were in happy liberty with each other, and would listen to each other with pleasure. They preached the same truth; there would be nothing but the unity of the faith in their preaching. There would be one mind with them. I can understand Silvanus asking Timothy, How did you get on? Well, I preached the Son of God! Timothy would reply; and Silvanus would say, I did that, too! They might not confine themselves to their mere words; they might have preached many things about Christ, but all bearing on the fact that He is the Son of God.
Rem. That preaching is beyond the range of the enemy's power.
J.B. Is the development of sonship in Paul's ministry among the things Peter says are hard to understand?
J.T. I do not think that would be one of the things, because Peter understood sonship before Paul. You will remember that Peter confessed Christ as the Son
{394}
of the living God, according to @Matthew 16; so that Peter knew sonship; but he was not appointed to preach it. Paul was; he was the one whom God selected to preach the Son of God. We do not need always to preach all we know, because preaching is not a matter of what we know, but of what God gives us to preach: "the preaching that I shall bid thee", says God to Jonah (@Jonah 3: 2). What you are to preach is the message you get. So, according to the scriptural record, Peter did not preach sonship, but Paul did; the first thing he preached was the Son of God; there were other things he spoke of. I suppose the things that were difficult to understand by the Jewish believers were things entering into the mystery, the assembly. Paul had that ministry. Peter did not have the ministry of the assembly as his service; Paul did. I do not suppose Peter meant that *he* did not understand; but there were things difficult *to* understand. Many did not understand. Peter's first epistle supports Paul's doctrine as to the local assembly; but he is concerned about many who did not understand. I believe what was difficult was the truth of the mystery. Sonship must enter into all preaching.
Ques. Is the preaching of the Son of God more what he is to God than to the individual?
J.T. It is what He is in *power* -- of course, what He is to God, but what He is as in that relationship, able to reflect what God is. God is known in Him. Hence the need of power, and He is declared to be the Son of God "with power" by the resurrection of the dead.
Rem. Is that also for all men? It says in @Galatians 1: 4: "according to the will of our God and Father": that is, in relation to deliverance from the world; that has sonship in mind.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. And it is for glory to God also. "For glory to God by us".
{395}
J.T. That is what comes out in our passage in @2 Corinthians 1: 20. "For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us"; so it is carried on in us. Then it goes on: "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God" @2 Corinthians 1: 21.
{396}
CONFIRMATION
@John 1: 47 - 51; @John 9: 35 - 38; @John 20: 19 - 23
It is in mind to speak of confirmation; confirmation in what is right, of course, what is of God; that, as we have been led by light into the things of God, and taken up a public attitude in relation to them, we might be confirmed. Many have not been confirmed and have receded from ground taken up: so in regard to many now -- it may be in this hall -- although from one cause or another they have taken up a public position in relation to Christ, they are not confirmed in it and are thus in danger of recession, affording the enemy in each instance an opportunity of attack on the position of the testimony -- the position proper to it. These three scriptures will serve to show, as I hope, how confirmation comes about; for it were better we never took up a position in relation to Christ than that we should subsequently recede from it, because in doing that we discredit it. I may say here, that taking up a position in the testimony, in the fellowship, as we speak, and receding from it is not optional: it cannot be done with impunity. Some assume that they can withdraw from it as they might resign an ordinary occupation or appointment, but this cannot be, for heaven's records have to be borne in mind; and if one is on the rolls, he has to give account; after taking his place with the people of God, he can never be afterwards what he was before. These records have to be looked into, and the conscience of the assembly here normally is the transcript of what is up there, hence there must be a balancing of the matter in each case.
Nathanael serves to show how the Lord is ever ready to confirm us as we move towards Him and make a confession; for a confession implies the stand I have taken. In connection with Nathanael, I may remark that he may be used to illustrate a person drawing near
{397}
professedly under the light of God, drawing near to Christ, having on his mind, it may be, to examine for himself what is there, and perhaps considering that it is optional whether he remains or not. He is coming with the thought of examination, and those who know what is in Christ and what lies here in the Spirit, having appropriated both, are quite confident in inviting anyone to "Come and see" @John 1: 46. That is a special word in John's gospel. One responds, and comes with a light heart, it may be, with very little concern; he has in mind to examine things and thinks it can be left at that, that it is optional with him whether he remains or leaves; but what comes to light is that on his way *he* is under observation. Though he does not find out at once, he will surely find out that things are not optional in the divine realm. He comes under observation; the Lord is looking at his movements and reserves His right as to His estimate of the person. He sees whether there is anything there of value, or whether he is really moving under the influence of others -- following the example of others -- or whether there is any conscience work, whether the movement is the fruit of the work of God. The Lord is looking out for such persons, and I need not say, He never errs; His eye is never dim. He gives us to understand that He knows all about us. Even before there was any movement of heart with us at all, or any professed movement, He has seen us.
So, as I said, it is a matter of coming and making an examination in response to the word "Come and see" @John 1: 46. Those who participate in what is to be seen, what is spiritual, have no hesitation in asking anyone to come; for if we have eyes to see according to God, we shall see what others are seeing. So the Lord in seeing Nathanael come, pronounces His judgment about him. It is as he moves to Him that the Lord speaks of his qualities. Before that, no doubt, were we to have joined him under the fig-tree, he would
{398}
talk glibly about the matters of the day; he was certainly very free to talk about Jesus when he heard of Him first. The change with him must have come about rapidly: "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" (@John 1: 46), he said. Young people talk about things as if they knew -- for at a certain stage they think they know everything; later, perhaps, they are not so sure. Nathanael seemed to know what Nazareth was, whether it was by hearsay or visitation. He says, Can anything good come out of it? He had no hesitation in his reply to Philip. Philip had said to him, "Come and see" @John 1: 46. Being evangelical, he had found him. The Lord found Philip, and Philip found Nathanael, and said, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph" (@John 1: 45). Nathanael fastened upon the word Nazareth, showing that the operations of the Spirit of God had not yet become effective in him. Had he been with God, he would have thought of Moses; he would have thought of the prophets, Philip having spoken of these; but he speaks of Nazareth. As soon as light is active in his soul he refers to the Scriptures; he can then allude to the Psalms very intelligently, but not at first. Moses and the prophets are of little importance to him; but Nazareth is under reproach; he names that. So we can see how he needed to be carefully observed; and this should always apply as younger ones seek to be in the fellowship of God's people. The Lord sees Nathanael coming to Him, and says: "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" (@John 1: 47). The allusion would be to Jacob; and this man was truly an Israelite, a guileless one, as the Lord says -- a rare kind of person today.
So that you will understand, dear brethren, I am not occupying you unduly with this first scripture, but to show how the Lord's eye is vigilant and makes no mistake. He calls attention to this moving person. He is moving in one definite direction; he is moving
{399}
to Jesus, and he inquires of the Lord, "Whence knowest thou me?" (@John 1: 48). That was a good question; every *true* Israelite will be open to investigation, leading to the inquiry how it is that he is known. "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee" (@John 1: 48). That is, the Lord would say, In your ordinary state, before the light came to your soul, I saw you. With regard to an applicant for fellowship, as we say: the Lord says, I saw you before you were moved at all. That is a very solemn matter; you were being scrutinised, and you did not know it. Thus it is in the case of many -- their histories are better known amongst the brethren than they are aware of. At any rate, all will be gone into, and it is most important that the histories of applicants should be fully inquired into. Well, Nathanael says to the Lord: "Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel" (@John 1: 49). That is remarkable! How quickly he came into the truth! How did he get these great thoughts? Evidently he knew the Scriptures. He alludes, I suppose, to @Psalm 2, which speaks of these two things as to the Messiah. He had not been always careless; he had evidently read the Scriptures; and that is most important. *What* do young people read? If the Scriptures, *how* do they read? Evidently this man had paid attention as he read, and now the Person is before him. It was a wonderful moment for him when the Person thus spoken of in @Psalm 2 was known as before him. His soul is evidently affected, and the Lord says: "thou shalt see greater things" (@John 1: 50). "Because I said ... I saw thee under the fig tree", you believed -- is that why? Well, evidently. What I mean, dear brethren, is that the work of God may proceed slowly in us on account of our condition, but it may be rapid on account of a better condition; but whether slow or rapid, its results are sure, and they all bear on Christ. Christ is supreme wherever the work of God is effective, and the Lord took account of this. "Believest thou?" (@John 1: 50);
{400}
that is a good word in the examination of a young christian. Why do you believe? How did it come about?
What I want to come to is this: the Lord would confirm this man in the position he had taken up. He would *hold* him. It is the holding power; not by Sunday school treats or prizes, surely, those will not hold young people spiritually; it is the holding power of Christ Himself, the confirming power in the soul. He says, "thou shalt see greater things than these" (verse 50). The Lord would keep us on the *qui vive* as to the "greater things". What a range John has for us in this wonderful gospel! Greater things, and greater things, and greater things; corresponding with "glory to glory". There is no limit. There cannot be a limit; for after you have read these writings of John, you have what is *not* written to think of. There is no thought that anything spoken or done by the Lord Jesus is to be regarded as lost. "The world itself could not contain the books that should be written" (@John 21: 25); but he says, as it were, I have written enough to establish you in faith: "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (@John 20: 31). That is *life*; if you come into eternal life, that will hold you, but there is more beyond. Things are to be held in His name. It is a question of faith: "that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God". If profession is not of faith, it is nothing.
So the greater things are to be seen by Nathanael. The Lord, it seems to me, honours his understanding of Scripture. He goes on to say: "Henceforth" -- from now on, without being specific -- "ye shall see" -- not *thou*, for as soon as I arrive at the stage that I am truly a believer in Christ, I value the plural; it is "ye", and I would have it so. That is often found in the Scriptures; the work of God is sure to be marked by
{401}
love of the brethren. It is one of the holding elements in the economy. Young believers are held out of the world by love among the brethren, including their own love. It is not simply what you find, but what you bring; so that it is "ye"; you are linked up vitally with the brethren. So here the Lord says "ye", meaning all believers; I am applying it simply to all of us. I want to be with the brethren; and whatever I see, they see, and if they do not see it, I want them to see it; and if I do not see it, they want to enlighten me. That is what these meetings are for, we share the great things of God together; for christians are a community. "Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (@John 1: 51). The Lord is obviously alluding to @Genesis 28, and also, I suppose, honouring the intelligence of this young convert; showing that he had read the Scriptures. Parents should see that their children read the Scriptures, are filled with them, shutting out things that in later years will be reminiscent in their minds and defiling to them. The Scriptures in the mind are power.
In telling Nathanael that he should see "the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man", the Lord would fill his mind with the greater things. In @Genesis 28 we read of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder, but here it is on a Person, on the Son of man. What does it mean? The bearing of it on the believer is that, if I am confirmed in my intelligent faith in the Son of God, King of Israel, surely I am to understand that everything begins with Him -- "the first and the last" (@Revelation 1:17); "the beginning of the creation of God", @Revelation 3: 14. The angels begin with Him; whatever their work, they have reference to Christ. That is confirmatory, and it reminds me that I must begin with Christ in everything, not be self-centred but Christ-centred. All my activities are to be in relation to Christ: that is another
{402}
element to confirm me in the position to which I have come as in the fellowship of God's Son.
Now I go on to chapter 9, as linking together the chapters read. It is a well-known chapter, we often allude to it; and I may say here, the more we know a chapter the more we get out of it. Referring to something said, you may say, We have had that scripture before; but then, did you see *everything* in the passage commented upon? I have been impressed with Ezekiel's river -- he finds it deeper and deeper according to measurement, and finally, he says, "a river that could not be passed over", @Ezekiel 47: 5. As progressing, he found he had reached spiritual infinitude; it is not only that *he* could not pass over it, but he says, it "could not be passed over". We might say, We have had that subject before; yes, but there is something more in it than you saw then. Ezekiel's leader brought him back to the bank of the river, and when he returned he saw trees on either side of it. He had not seen them before. So the Holy Spirit, from time to time, brings us back to the same scripture, and we see new things in it.
@John 9 yields wonderfully; one has felt it in a little way. The yielding power of confirmation of the truth in that chapter is striking. There is nothing said as to opposition to Nathanael; but here it is a different man altogether. He has to go through the mill of conflict, real conflict for the truth; and it is as sure as possible that, if I am faithful in such circumstances, the religious people with whom I have to do will indicate their judgment of me, and have recourse to legal or authoritative means to dispose of me. I do not fit in with them. No man who is in the full light of Christ, as this man was, fits in with the religious organisations of the day. You do not fit and they do not like you, and they will soon show it. They would like to have you, of course, but on *their* terms. I have no doubt the Pharisees would have used this man were he amenable to their
{403}
terms; because earlier they had sent to John the baptist, offering him distinctive honours in Jerusalem, the centre of religion at that time, but on their own terms. We must be on our guard as to any such overtures or suggestions from religious systems around. They can use you, but not as rigidly maintaining the truth. They say, "thou teachest us?" -- that will not do at all; the teaching must be by them: "they cast him out" (@John 9: 34). One has often gone over this chapter: it is most stimulating to any lover of Christ. It shows how a young believer, a convert, is led on instinctively, one might say: no external person is helping him. We have it from the Lord's remark to him that he had seen the Lord, but from the earlier facts given, the man works out the truth -- through conflict -- by himself. The Lord intended this, for "the works of God" were to be manifest in him. The man was obedient; he was sent to the pool of Siloam -- the meaning of which is Sent -- and he went. He went to the pool of Siloam and washed, and came seeing. The instinctive thought with him would be to return. He is true to the word 'sent', he is an obedient convert. It is an important point reached in obedience, to come back to the point where you got the light; and then the conflict comes in. He stands his ground at every point; he is steadily victorious. His casting out was victory, negative, of course, but truly victory; but how is he to be *kept out*? That is the next thing: that is the thing that is burdening the brethren all over the world. There are the young believers, they are cast out, as in this instance, or leave, as we may say, as in Nathanael's case; how are they to be confirmed in the position taken up?
"Jesus heard that they had cast him out" (@John 9: 35). That is a beautiful touch: the Lord *hearing* of such a matter. His true manhood is implied. That is the point in the chapter; the clay alludes to the blessed Lord's humanity. He is true to it. It is a question, not of instinctive knowledge of the fact, but that the
{404}
Lord *heard*. He took that place; although divine, He listens to information. Who brought this information is not stated, but Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and the Lord, I am sure, would say, That is good news. He would rejoice in spirit, perhaps, as in other cases, and impart stimulus to everybody that was with Him. The nearer we are to the Lord the more we experience this. Hearing of young people coming into the truth stimulates us. Think of the Lord in His gracious service looking out for this man -- and finding him! When he is found, the Lord does not go over the ground of the man's experience: what his neighbours had said, what the Pharisees said, and what his father and mother had said; that is not the point now. That *has been* gone through by himself: he has the gain of it in his soul; he has advanced wonderfully, and now he is to know the Son of God. Nathanael evidently knew the Scriptures, as we have seen, and confessed Christ as the Son of God as spoken of in them; but the immediate effect of the work of God is stressed in this man -- the wonderful results of it. He is in the benefit of what has been gone over in the chapter. The Lord does not go over it again. If you are to be kept outside the religious system, something *more* is needed. The leaders may come after you, they may offer you terms and say they are sorry for casting you out so ruthlessly; the enemy is not behind in all these matters. What will keep you out? The Lord says to the man: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" (@John 9: 35). He had not heard of Him, he wants to know: how interesting he was to Jesus! One would like to have been there to see how the Lord would treat a young man like this. "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" is a word for the moment, dear brethren; the Son of God as presented in Scripture, not as in the creeds. Here it is the very appellation from the Lord's own lips. The man gave a wonderful account of Jesus and what he thought of Him; he did believe in Him so far; but it is the Son of God now.
{405}
Do I take in what God is saying to us about His Son? Do I believe *on* Him? as it is here; for, mark you, dear brethren, it is not what Scripture had said -- that is what Nathanael had in his mind, right enough, of course, in its place -- but now it is what has come directly, the truth for the very moment; truth for him, just what he needs.
The Lord has selected the moment to bring this to him: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" What will the man say? What would you say, young person, if you had never heard of it before? The man says, "who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" That is the suitable answer to the Lord's inquiry. Who is He? The Lord is pressing it here as truth for this man just now. Is he ready for it? He *is* ready for it. The Lord says, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he" (@John 9: 37). He does not say any more, he has said enough. Faith in this man's soul has become active; not faith in a creed, but in the very Person Himself. "And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" (@John 9: 36). He is ready for it; the Lord tells him he is in His presence. Think of being in the presence of the Son of God! The man said, "I believe, Lord: and he did him homage" (@John 9: 38). Nathanael was in His presence, too, but he did not worship; this man worships. It was the result of direct ministry to this man. God would have us to worship the Son of God. Let us not overlook that; it is the same word as in chapter 4. We are to worship the Son of God. We hear no more of this man, but heaven knows him, and we shall see him. He fits in at this juncture in John's gospel: one brought to know and worship the Son of God. The next chapter shows what the Son of God is doing to keep young people out of the world. Even if they were cast out they might go back. The enemy is so ready to use anything, that we may go back: "they might have ... returned", we are told in @Hebrews 11: 15, but we are told also that God
{406}
has "prepared for them a city" (@Hebrews 11: 16); having a city prepared for us by God we shall not go back. So the Son of God will hold us *Himself in another world*; He has inaugurated it Himself. Shall I go back? No; I have got into another world. It is what chapter 10 opens up; it is *confirmation*. We need it if we are to stand our ground in the terrible times of darkness we are in.
Now in chapter 20 is the final thought of what is in my mind as to confirmation; that is, what you find *among the brethren*, viewed, not simply as so many nominal christians, but persons who have received a message direct from Christ as to their dignity, the brethren from the standpoint of the heavenly calling, what they are according to God's mind. Jesus came to where they were. That would be to confirm them. They are not going back. We know from the epistle to the Hebrews that many did go back; that epistle was written to keep Jewish believers from going back. "Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come", @Hebrews 13: 13, 14. That is Hebrews; it is the book of the opened heavens. Faith says, No, I cannot go back, I am held; I "have come to mount Zion; and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, the universal gathering; and to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven; and to God, judge of all; and to the spirits of just men made perfect; and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel", @Hebrews 12: 22 - 24. I am not going back. Think of spirits of just men made perfect! I have come to them. But think of coming to "God, judge of all" -- the Supreme! And to Jesus, Mediator of a new covenant. That is Hebrews. We can appreciate the writer's statement: "*we* are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving the soul".
{407}
Now the Lord came in here in @John 20 to these that are not only saints, but persons dignified by the message of Jesus. They are unique: they are in a certain place, and the Lord had sent a message to them, in effect to confirm them, and then He came where they were, and said, "Peace be to you". "He shewed to them his hands and his side", (@John 20: 20), and they were glad to see Him. Showing them His hands and His side was to open up His love to them. They were glad, and He says again to them, "Peace be to you" (@John 20: 21), as if to confirm them in the position. Each of them would say, I am not going back, there is no position like it; as Peter said earlier, "to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal", @John 6: 68. He is now in their midst, and they do not say anything; the passage stresses what Jesus said, but they are acquiescing in it. Their very looks, I am sure, would indicate how they were confirmed. They will not go back. There was a diversion with some of them, as seen in chapter 21, but the general position is that the disciples were confirmed and held.
The next thing is they were to be here as confirmed in this way in *representation*; that is the next thing in this passage. He says to them, "as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you" (@John 20: 21). Let us look at this! He has dignified them, He has ennobled them. Then "when he had said this, he breathed on them" (@John 20: 22). He mentions the word "sent". "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you". Think of the level on which this mission is placed! We are not only elevated in dignity personally, but representatively. As He was great enough to represent His Father, so we are to represent Him here. How are we to represent Him? Not by words only, but by His own Spirit. "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" (@John 20: 22). That applies to all of us. It has, of course, special reference to the twelve, but it includes us all in some measure, that is, we receive His
{408}
Spirit the Spirit of Christ, the ascended Man, the Son of God, not only in relation to our privileges, but also our *testimony* here, the representation of Him where He is not. So he says, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained" (@John 20: 23). It is representation, but representation in the possession of His Spirit; then, following on that, *confidence* in us. There can be no christianity in the true sense of the word in assembly service without confidence; that God has confidence in us, and we have confidence in one another. Thus the Lord says to His disciples here, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". This is confidence. It is not retaining first, it is forgiving sins. That is, the Lord is setting up His own in the midst of christendom -- well-nigh apostate as it is -- with this mandate from Himself, the mandate of confidence. He would say, as it were, If there is anyone to be forgiven and you forgive him, I will be with that. There is need for extreme care in these cases, and if forgiveness is needed, it must be seen that there is a basis for it. We cannot afford to betray His confidence; hence the need for the utmost investigation so that the truth should be known, and there should be the true administration as representing His forgiveness. He says, If you forgive, I am with you, and if you retain I am with you too, It throws us on Himself, and on ourselves too, so that we should be true in thus acting for Him. Priesthood, as in the types, enters into all this, especially as seen in @Leviticus 13 and 14. The spirit of investigation is a most essential thing in these matters, more particularly now as there is so much imitation. But the confidence placed in the disciples, and the service based on it, enter into the present moment, and the Lord would have us accordingly more in representation of Himself.
{409}
THE ASSEMBLY AS THE HOME OF WHAT IS OF GOD
@Acts 1: 10 - 14; @Acts 2: 42 - 47; @Acts 4: 23 - 31; @Acts 13: 1 - 3
J.T. It is in mind to consider these four scriptures as to the assembly, to see how it is intended to conserve all that is of God in the present dispensation. First, divine impressions received by the saints; these are to be housed in the assembly. Secondly, persons such as "were to be saved". Thirdly, the servants of the Lord: the assembly being viewed as the sphere where divine sympathy and divine protection for the servants is found. Fourthly, evangelical feelings and sentiments; the assembly is to be the home of these also, as seen in Antioch. Much is made of the assembly there, including what is said in these verses, which tell us of the kind of people who were leading: prophets and teachers who were ministering to the Lord; and the Holy Spirit recognises a condition suitable for sending forth Barnabas and Saul, as is said in @Isaiah 32: 20: "Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass". No doubt the brethren will consider that there is a wide scope for our meeting in these scriptures.
The first thought, as remarked, refers to divine impressions received. The Lord has gone up, a matter made much of in this book. "Having said these things", it is said (@Acts 1: 9), "he was taken up, they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight"; and then verse 10 says, "As they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing, who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem,
{410}
a sabbath day's journey off". Then they went to the upper room where all the apostles were, and Mary, with other sisters, and the Lord's brethren. The instruction is that, as compared with Luke's first account, instead of going to the temple, they went to the upper room. It is their own doing, and they had great impressions in their souls, augmented by what the two men in white said, so that they go to the upper room where these persons were; they could there open up any impressions they had without fear of damage.
Ques. When you speak of impressions, are we to understand you refer to the communications they received from the Lord during the forty days, or to the ascension?
J.T. Well, particularly to the ascension here -- spiritual impressions, not only instructions. One may receive an instruction, as a servant, to be carried out on his own account, perhaps kept secret for a while, but an impression is for the enrichment of the assembly, the Spirit taking it on and causing it to pervade all. If you get anything in that sense, the quicker it is made known to the assembly, the quicker the Spirit will make it effective and give it a place in the treasury of God. That was what I was thinking -- the idea of a treasury or conservatory, where things are preserved from evil, for sometimes contamination readily enters into an impression. You may go and speak of it lightly or to fleshly-minded people. If we cast our pearls before swine they may turn round and rend us. The impressions are to be placed where they are valued and guarded.
Ques. Is there a link on with the upper room of @Luke 22, the last impressions they would have in regard to the Supper?
J.T. This is, no doubt, the same upper room. What the Lord said at the institution of the Supper would enter into the enrichment here. This occasion would be in addition to that. How many such additions there were, who can say? All these are, so to say, in the
{411}
conservatory, and the Spirit causes them to pervade our intelligences and our affections, so that when all together, we are not just a number of individuals, we are built up as a community, for the assembly was to be a heavenly institution here. The apostles went on with the ministry to the Jews for a while in relation to the temple, but in chapter 10 the sheet coming down, and going up again into heaven suggests what is *heavenly*. The Lord was up there, and the saints on earth as His body -- Himself -- as He said to Saul. Therefore it is a unique dispensation, the assembly being a heavenly institution on earth.
Ques. Why are they addressed as men of Galilee?
J.T. I suppose to preserve the reproach. The assembly is under reproach. It is not characteristically in the religious centre, that is, Jerusalem; it is not another religion introduced into the world; it is a thing by itself, claiming no religious distinction at all; in the upper room it is out of sight, as it were.
Ques. Would the other side of the picture be the names that are given, distinguished persons being there, not distinguished in the world, but in their own sphere?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. These men are reliable. You can open up your mind to them. They are very interested in what you have to say, and would make good use of it. I mean the idea of a treasury enters into this position. David made much of dedicated things, placing them under protection. Certain Levites were appointed to look after them, and in the pattern of the temple which he gave to Solomon there are treasuries: the plural suggesting enlargement of the thought.
Ques. Does the fact that they gave themselves to prayer link on with that?
J.T. It would show that they were dependent. They needed God to help them in this new position.
{412}
Rem. It says, "where were staying both Peter, and John" @Acts 1: 13. The word "both" would help, two of them together.
J.T. It is a word introducing not only two persons, but all that follow; that is, it is not a one-man affair. Peter had the first place according to Matthew, and he always had, as we see in this book. The Lord saw to that, that he had the first place, but "both" would link on with all the others, John particularly. I mean, that it is not one man, a clerical matter. Others have part in it. So after the first address by the Spirit, the converts recognised not only Peter, but all the others. The work of God would recognise all those whom God has qualified to look after His interests -- to lead.
Rem. So Mary, the mother of Jesus, qualified earlier, keeping these things and pondering them in her heart.
J.T. Exactly. That is a good point. Going back to Luke's first narrative, he introduces the idea of a treasury early. She pondered them in her heart, keeping them in her mind. The mind and heart are brought in to it.
Ques. Did you mean that in the mind and the heart, is where spiritual impressions are considered?
J.T. Quite so. We may make notes, but they will not hold, they will decay. They are useful for a moment, but our minds and hearts are where God looks. Those two faculties, members, come specially under the work of God; the mind is renewed and the heart is purified.
Ques. What is the effect of the cloud in regard to the impressions you have been speaking of? The passage says, "they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight" @Acts 1: 9.
J.T. To remind them that the dispensation of faith had begun. They were gazing up into heaven. I think the cloud concealing the Lord marks the change to the period of faith. Faith was there all the time, of course, for while the Lord was here faith was required,
{413}
but now it is to be *wholly* a faith matter -- the dispensation of God which is in faith. That is, they could not see with the natural eye after that. It remains for a coming day when "every eye shall see him" @Revelation 1: 7.
Ques. Is there any special thought in the *white* clothing?
J.T. Purity, I suppose. We have a corresponding thought in the resurrection at the grave of Jesus, and also at the mount of transfiguration -- a testimony to purity; and in our chapter, as marking the dispensation of faith also.
Ques. Do the words of the men in white clothing imply that there is something now on the earth to be considered? There is an interval between the Lord's going up and His return.
J.T. That is the thought. "As they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing, who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" @Acts 1: 10,11. The word 'manner' I think is a good word for our dispensation, as involving order, entering into the Lord's supper, for instance, and the ordering generally of our meetings. It is to be a dignified dispensation -- between the going away and coming of Jesus. So the apostle stresses that in 1 Corinthians. It is very important for the brethren to note that. The men in white give the clue, I believe, and that clue would be in the minds of the disciples when they went into the upper room -- not to a religious building in Jerusalem.
Ques. Why are the men named first as a complete section ending with verse 13, and then it says, "These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren"? @Acts 1: 14.
{414}
J.T. Well, I suppose to establish the apostolic position. John refers to it -- "that which we have seen and heard we report to you, that *ye* also may have fellowship with us" -- that would be the apostles only -- "and our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ" @1 John 1: 1: 3. They had a unique place while they were here, and I suppose these verses (10 to 13) would mean that these men are to be honoured in our minds, they are to be in the foundations of the heavenly city. It is important to give them their place. They have their place strikingly throughout this book.
Ques. What is the distinction between what we have here, the return from the mount of Olives, and the return in the last chapter of Luke where it says, "he led them out as far as Bethany"? @Luke 24: 50.
J.T. Bethany is the place of the remnant of Israel, that is what Luke finishes with. It is a question of God's patience, which is lengthened out now for the gentiles¬ sake. So that it was the salvation of the Jews, if possible, that was in mind at the end of Luke. Patience stopped there. Here that is omitted, the disciples are seen by themselves in the upper room -- not in the temple -- and that involves the assembly. From the facts given, we get divine impressions; we understand the position here is morally outside of this world, we link on with what is heavenly.
Ques. Does the cloud help in that relation? It is not mentioned at the end of Luke, but it is here.
J.T. It does help. As already said, it is to mark off the dispensation of sight from the dispensation of faith. "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?" @Acts 1: 11. That attitude was not suitable here, but these men would not say that to Stephen. He gazed up into heaven, but the heavens were opened. It is a spiritual touch there, and so the writer of the Hebrews says, "we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour" @Hebrews 2: 9. Here the cloud is to shut off their view, meaning that the dispensation of faith has
{415}
begun. Hence the Lord said, "blessed they who have not seen and have believed" @John 20: 29.
Ques. In what sense do these impressions remain in the assembly today?
J.T. Well, by the Spirit; without the Spirit there could be no conserving of the things of God. They are carried down. So the Lord said significantly in @John 14 that the Father would send the Spirit in His name, and He would bring to their remembrance all that Christ had said. I think the Lord meant, if we view John as prophetic in that chapter, that the time would come when it would be necessary for that to be repeated; the Spirit having been displaced by man, the clerical system, things were lost, but the Spirit has not gone back. The Spirit would bring back to the saints what Christ said. As those in whom God wrought turned away from tradition, what existed in the Spirit was revived, and that is what is going on, I think, today. Meetings like this are greatly blessed, brethren coming together with their Bibles in their hands, dependent on the Spirit; things are brought back to us. They were there all the time, but beclouded, submerged, as it were. New touches come in, but it is the Spirit's doing. He brings things to our remembrance. It is revival, not the introduction of a new system of truth.
Ques. What place had the several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, in relation to divine impressions?
J.T. Women are essential to the assembly as a public body. We learn from @Luke 8 that the assembly in its composition has, first, a man who had been a demoniac, now sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. That would ensure what we are speaking of, the right mind. "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" @2 Timothy 1: 7. Then secondly, the woman whom the Lord recognised as "daughter", the woman who touched the hem of the Lord's garment and was healed, and who fell down before Him and told Him all the
{416}
truth, meaning she is now a *transparent* woman -- the subjective side in the assembly. Thirdly, the girl of twelve, Jairus's daughter. What she represents is coming into striking prominence just now, many children, about that age, coming into the truth. The most spiritual feature of that chapter stands in relation to that girl, showing that we ought to bring the children into the most spiritual atmosphere available. The Lord took with Him Peter and James and John, with the parents of the child, to raise her up. They were the only ones there -- a very spiritual position.
Ques. Do you think Saul had spiritual impressions from Stephen?
J.T. I do. His conscience was affected. The facts are mentioned in that way. He held the clothes. He refers to that himself afterwards. He tells the Lord that Stephen was His martyr. The Lord refers to that, I am sure, when He says, "it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks" @Acts 26: 14.
Ques. What is the thought in the inclusion of the Lord's natural brethren? In one scripture we read, "neither did his brethren believe on him" @John 7: 5.
J.T. They did afterwards. They all believed, apparently. We read of James, the Lord's brother. I believe the thought here is that they knew more about Jesus in a certain respect than others. They were His companions in His infancy, His boyhood, and His youth. Mary His mother had a knowledge of Christ no one else could have. All that belongs to the treasury. These men could tell you many things about Jesus that even Peter could not tell. As for His mother, how much she could tell! She lived in John's house. The Lord made John her son, and made her John's mother -- a remarkable relationship, and I have no doubt that relationship enhanced what Mary could contribute to the treasury -- a link with John.
Ques. Would you think that as a result of that, John's ministry was enriched?
{417}
J.T. I should say so. He had a more intimate knowledge of the Lord through her, not only as a person in his house, but as *his mother* -- a very intimate relationship.
Ques. Would the working out of the treasury be seen the Lord Jesus saying, "It is more blessed to give than to receive"? @Acts 20: 35. It is not mentioned in the gospels.
J.T. Yes; that saying certainly belongs to the treasury, a very important one, too.
Rem. It says of Enoch that he prophesied saying, "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints" @Jude 14. That is not found in the Old Testament.
J.T. No, it is carried down by the Spirit -- another such statement, belonging to the treasury.
Ques. In connection with the contribution of impressions to the assembly, why did the apostle retain the impression of a man in Christ for fourteen years?
J.T. He did in time impart it to the brethren; but there was a low state at Corinth. He said, "I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" @1 Corinthians 2: 2. He could not go beyond that. Of course the same thing is sometimes seen today. We take in very little because of our state. The Spirit of God measures what He gives us.
Rem. He actually says to them, "*I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ" @1 Corinthians 3: 1.
J.T. Just so. He says that expressly; and the same applies today. People say, Why do not we get ministry on this and that? The Lord ministers according to our capacity. Light communicated beyond our state is apt to inflate us. This is well known to oneself. The pretensions of some at Corinth forced the apostle to tell it to them. He said a great deal he did not wish to say, but he said, "I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord" @2 Corinthians 12: 1.
Ques. Do you link the thought of impressions with divine appearings?
{418}
J.T. An appearing ought to make an impression. It is intended to impress us. Paul had many. We ought to seek them -- that is in the modified way in which they may be known today. The Lord is pleased to reveal Himself to us as we are ready for it.
Rem. In *@Acts 22 Paul said that the light shone round about him, but in* @Acts 26 about him and those who accompanied him.
J.T. He extends the thought there, but the impression received he never lost. He tells of it twice himself, according to Scripture. I suppose he told it several times elsewhere.
Ques. Is what you were saying as to state in this matter set out in Abraham? He had many divine impressions.
J.T. Just so; whereas Lot did not.
That is the first section of our inquiry; the second is in chapter 2. The verses read give us what was there. It is no longer the apostles only, but their converts and how they became capable of conservation, not now of things or impressions, but *persons*. Salvation lay amongst them. We are told, verses 42 - 47, that the converts "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers ... And all that believed were together, and had all things common, and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need. And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people; and the Lord added [to the assembly] daily those that were to be saved" @Acts 2: 42 - 47. The people are thus described; the words "to the assembly" are not in the original; the people described in the passage quoted are in mind. The Holy Spirit gives us a description of their qualities to show that they are trustworthy. Thus if the Lord is working, He would provide those
{419}
capable of taking care of the converts, that the atmosphere may be suitable for them.
Ques. Would they eventually prove additions to the treasury?
J.T. That is the principle. They were so already. There had been three thousand added, according to verse 41, without it being said who did the adding. It means that they qualified themselves to be an addition, and verse 42 begins the description of them, of the whole company -- "all that believed". It is a question of *all* that believed now, not only the apostles.
Ques. Is it the same principle as Solomon adding to what David collected?
J.T. Just so. The thought began with Rachel. In naming she gave Joseph a name which implies addition. There was an addition in Benjamin, that is, the completion of the twelve tribes. Benjamin was needed as a completion. That is the idea of addition, we must go on until things are finished.
Ques. Are verses 41 - 47 more selective?
J.T. Yes; you get a description of the whole believing company. What a company it was!
Ques. Would these persons staying in the upper room represent the fellowship of the apostles?
J.T. Yes. The apostles being fully recognised, then the women and the brethren of Christ mentioned afterwards. The apostles gave themselves to prayer, they are seen by themselves. The others would be in the fellowship of the apostles, as verse 42 says, "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles".
Ques. Why are they seen constantly in the temple?
J.T. That brings in the other side. It is the full position of testimony now. The upper room accords with the true character of the assembly, but the patience of God waited on the Jews, and hence we link on again with Luke, the testimony of the patience of God carried on to His ancient people, which finished, we may say, at the murder of Stephen.
{420}
Ques. What is the thought in the Lord adding?
J.T. They belonged to the Lord -- "those that were to be saved" @Acts 2: 47. It brings us over to the counsels of God, those in divine sovereignty designated for salvation, corresponding with our own day, that the elect may "obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus" @2 Timothy 2: 10. The Lord has the assembly now into which to bring them.
Rem. This thought of the apostles¬ doctrine, breaking of bread, and so on, would be a very blessed one for the treasury.
J.T. It enters into the foundation of the assembly. The converts were thoroughly in it, there was no independency at all. They were following on the lines of the apostles, the new thing that was inaugurated.
Ques. Is there any connection with @Luke 10: 34 -- He "brought him to an inn"?
J.T. Yes; but there is more comfort and provision generally in the assembly than is indicated there, I suppose. The Samaritan gave the host "two pence" to look after the rescued man.
Ques. Do you think the closing word in @Luke 8, where the child is restored and the Lord charged them to give her something to eat, would enter into this?
J.T. I think so. The assembly has fatherly and motherly qualities, as we learn later in Scripture. Paul said he was a father to the Corinthians, and he cared for the Thessalonians "as a nurse would cherish her own children" @1 Thessalonians 2: 7. He looked after them in that tender way. The assembly is thus a place of salvation. God said He would give salvation in Zion (@Isaiah 46: 13). That is the idea here.
Ques. That is what the enemy is against, is it not?
J.T. Yes, he wants to break that down. God attaches great importance to the thought of preservation, that there should be local conditions suitable to look after persons God would bring in amongst us.
{421}
Ques, What would be the distinction for us between the breaking of bread, in verse 42, and the breaking of bread "in the house", in verse 46?
J .T. The latter is the way the thing was carried on under these circumstances. Until Paul arrived you do not get the breaking of bread properly set in order. He formally separates it from the house. He says, "If any one be hungry, let him eat at home" @1 Corinthians 11: 34. They were despising the assembly in the way they were carrying on. Here the matter had not yet been clarified. The description here shows a very happy state of things The order proper to the Lord's supper was yet in abeyance, so they partook of it in their homes. It was a feature of christianity never connected with the temple. So that the Spirit of God formally states that it was *after* supper that the Lord took the cup, He formally detached it from the passover supper. It is detached here in that sense, not connected with the temple.
Rem. Paul says, "*I* received from the Lord" @1 Corinthians 11: 23. He would be putting it into the treasury.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. If the temple is the position of testimony, why did the Lord add to those outside of it?
J.T. He led them as far as to Bethany; that was the link of grace with the Jews. They are serving in that connection in a very happy way here -- "And every day, being constantly in the temple" @Acts 2: 46. It was the most wonderful contribution ever made to the temple. Even David is not on a level with this, but it was only provisional, and soon to be withdrawn. They were carrying it on well according to these facts, so that the Lord could add to them.
Ques. Would you say a word as to Peter's wisdom in his selection from the Scriptures in his testimony to the Jews, thereby securing these great results?
J.T. He brought in what was suitable at the moment. Paul brought in what was suitable at Corinth and at
{422}
Ephesus. These servants understood, they were truly levites, they knew what to do. That is why the twelve are stressed in the account of the first preaching.
Rem. In this matter of conserving persons here it is said, "the Lord added daily"; in chapter 5 believers are "added to the Lord".
J.T. The latter appears again in chapter 11. 1 suppose chapter 5 is to show that the apostles¬ service went on and was blessed of God after the discipline executed on Ananias and Sapphira. That discipline did not interfere with the progress of the testimony, so that the additions went on, not now so much to the saints as to the Lord, It is a question of the Lord's authority in the discipline. It says, "great fear came upon all the assembly ... and believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women" @Acts 5: 11,14. It is to honour the apostles. The apostles were honoured; "they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch" @Acts 5: 12; they were magnified, and the Lord used them more and more because of their faithfulness in the discipline. This should encourage us not to be afraid to execute discipline if discipline is needed. It is pleasing to the Lord and brings down His blessing.
Ques. The acceptance of the obligation would make us more discriminating, do you not think?
J.T. Yes. There must be adding to the Lord before adding to the saints *now*. Adding to the Lord would mean that there is, first, subjection.
Ques. Would the thought of having all things common, suggest that all would be held for the good and care of others?
J.T. Yes; a community involving many persons moving in mutual feeling and happy brotherly love. What is stated shows what the testimony was at the beginning.
Now chapter 4 would show how the ministers, Peter and John, are to have place amongst the brethren in assembly. They have to contend with much with
{423}
which the ordinary saint has not to contend, which is perhaps apt to be forgotten. This section, I think, is to show that there was the utmost sympathy with the ministers, Peter and John, the suffering servants. "And having been let go, they came to their own company". @Acts 4: 23 The word *own* is the point; the saints belong to us, they are our own.
Ques. How would that work out today?
J.T. Well, in moving about, one finds increasingly a sense that the saints are one's own, even if one has not known them before; you feel you are in the company of your own. You are safe there. You tell them something about your experiences and call forth their sympathies. According to this chapter they pray, and God owns the prayer and shakes the house. Then we are told (verse 33), "with great power did the apostles give witness". That is the point to bring out, how the apostles are enhanced by the interest and sympathy of the saints.
Ques. Would you say the Lord is sensitive to the touch of His people, as suggested by the touch of the woman in @Luke 8?
J.T. That is a good suggestion. The woman knew that touching the hem of His garment saved her life. The precious oil comes from the head of Aaron down to the hem of his garments. In the hem there is the thought of *finish*.
Ques. Is not this incident a remarkable illustration of what Peter speaks of in connection with the reproach of Christ, of the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon us?
J.T. Yes. As arrived among their own they "reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them" @Acts 4: 23; involving, as you say, great reproach. "And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord" @Acts 4: 24, and so on. Then God comes in and shakes the building, so that the Spirit of glory was there.
{424}
Rem. Peter himself says, "be all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted" @1 Peter 3: 8. Do you think he experienced that personally?
J.T. He did. This must have been a particular occasion in that sense, because they suffered very severely, and now they are let go and they come to their own company, not to their homes. That is where they find the most sympathy. Normally you find more sympathy with the saints than even with your family. It is a heavenly state of things. The truth of the mystery, coming out later, unfolds what was there.
Ques. Would this support the idea of mentioning matters of interest at the prayer meeting?
J.T. It would. If any of us are accustomed to receive letters from different parts of the world, it helps greatly to read to the saints what concerns the work of God. It draws out their sympathy in prayer.
Rem. The use of the word *despot* here is remarkable. It would speak of the absolute rights of God over every one of us, this should be maintained.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord said, "When ye pray, say, Father" @Luke 11: 2. Here we have an instance of how the work of God shows itself. They were dealing with Satan's emissaries, and God was *their* Despot. The word alluded to is in verse 24, "And said, Lord, *thou* art the God"; and there is a note as to it in the New Translation -- "Lord" means despot, the master of slaves; one having sovereign power. It was fitting at this time to bring that in. We should not say it in the assembly today, but it indicates how we are to speak to God in a given circumstance.
Ques. Do they not take the title of bondmen?
J.T. Yes: "Give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word" @Acts 4: 29.
Ques. Is it a case of definite prayer and a definite answer? They say, "give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word", and the next verse says, they "spoke the word of God with boldness" @Acts 4: 31.
{425}
J.T. Quite so. It brings up what has been before some of us lately, the importance of addressing *God* in relation to His work. It has been observed in some localities that God is hardly addressed at all in prayer meetings. Priestly understanding would know how to address God, would know what is suitable in given circumstances. It is right to address the Lord in prayer, but then *God* should be addressed in prayer. Here it is remarkable, as has been pointed out, God is a Despot under these circumstances; love for Him recognises that. Now verse 31 says, "when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness. And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them; and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. For neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need" @Acts 4: 31 - 35. Certainly that was the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon them. They are ennobled and distinguished by the Spirit of God.
Ques. Does it emphasise how the assembly is to be independent of every worldly system?
J.T. That is what comes out. The shaking of the building is not like the earthquake that shook the prison. It is to show the power that was available to them -- acting in their favour, especially now in regard to the servants. Looking after the Lord's servants sympathetically brings out divine approval, so that the servants are more powerful than ever. It behoves the saints therefore to regard them sympathetically.
{426}
Ques. Would the shaking give the sense of the support of heaven in connection with their service and suffering?
J.T. I think it is very tangible evidence that God is on their behalf.
Ques. Would the reference to the resurrection emphasise the great thought of God's power? Earlier Peter had referred to Christ's exaltation, but here the apostles give witness to the resurrection. Would you link that with @Ephesians 1: 19 -- "the exceeding greatness of his power"?
J.T. It is what marked their testimony in these early chapters. They are appointed witnesses of His resurrection, the power of God in testimony.
Ques. Would you say this passage brings up the question of supplying money for the testimony?
J.T. That is what comes out: the sale of land and so forth, and then one comes forward to exemplify it supremely. "And Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation), a Levite, Cyprian by birth, being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles" @Acts 4: 36,37. The apostles are honoured in this also.
Ques. The thought of stretching out Thy hand to heal, not to destroy -- do you think that would be delightful to heaven, and accounts for what follows?
J.T. That is very beautiful. The stress on *this* city too, where they were, and where the emissaries of the devil had been assembled against Christ.
Rem. This man, being a Levite, and having land, is immediately adjusted.
J.T. Yes, he is ennobled by the apostles, too.
Rem. It seems as though they gave him his name before this occurred. It says, "Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas" @Acts 4: 36.
{427}
J.T. Quite so, the outcome of the kind of man he was. Chapter 11 brings it out more fully, what an unjealous man he was. The apostles named him rightly.
In our last scripture the facts show a remarkable assembly at Antioch. Earlier, the work there is noted, and the assembly at Jerusalem takes notice of it. The ears of the assembly are active, ready to listen to any news of the work of God. They sent out Barnabas, who, seeing the grace of God, rejoiced. He is governed by a right spirit and seeks out Saul. They two were with the saints there for a year teaching them "in the assembly". This brings the thought of the assembly into prominence, that it was there characteristically -- in every session, as it were, the idea of the assembly permeated the teaching. The product is seen in these verses: "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there, prophets and teachers" @Acts 13: 1. They were carrying on, making everything of Christ, ministering to the Lord. And "as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said ..." @Acts 13: 2. It is to honour *what was there*. They were thoroughly in keeping with the missionary service that was now needed.
Ques. What form of service would this take in our day?
J.T. It is a question of what is needed now. In view of the breakdown of the assembly we would hardly undertake foreign mission work as some do, but the Spirit is here, the truth as to Him has been recovered. This passage is to bring out His sovereign action. It is the Holy Spirit's action. The state of the assembly is quite in consonance with it. He would appeal as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting. He says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" @Acts 13: 2.
Ques. What is fasting?
J.T. It is the denial for spiritual reasons of what is legitimate. Eating is quite legitimate. According to what God said to Noah, he could use the living creatures
{428}
as well as the vegetables, but fasting is the denial of it for spiritual reasons, the spirit of self-sacrifice. God is owning it now. Full assembly conditions are here, resulting in Paul's activities with Barnabas. The Spirit has brought about certain conditions, and He will honour them.
Ques. Is fasting brought out in two relations? It first says, "as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting" @Acts 13: 2, and, after the Holy Spirit has spoken, "having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go" @Acts 13: 3, as though the need of fasting arose again in sending forth these men.
J.T. The first fasting is what you might call normal to christianity. Now this is a *special* matter, so that before they act they fast and pray. The passage does not mean that *they* sent the missionaries; it is that having laid their hands on them, they let them go -- as much as to say, We wish to keep you, but for the Lord's sake and the testimony and service we release you. This would be the denial of all natural sentiment. You might like to keep a certain brother in the locality. That might be pure selfishness. If the testimony requires that he should go away, well, release him. Do not put anything in his way.
Ques. Would you say there is what a servant is as selected sovereignly, but there is also what is recognised by the brethren? They lay their hands on them.
J.T. Yes. The saints at Antioch are with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit had made the selection; they are showing their fellowship with what He is doing. They are not taking the lead in the thing, but the Holy Spirit is. Am I ready to fit in with what the Spirit is doing?
Ques. It has been said that the assembly does not preach. Is that right?
J.T. That is quite right. It neither preaches nor teaches. The assembly takes up a matter of discipline, but not teaching and preaching. It is sympathetic with
{429}
all that God is doing. It is the home of ministry, evangelical or otherwise, but the preaching and teaching are by those specially fitted for such services -- gifted by God.
Ques. And the servant is responsible to the assembly?
J.T. Well, not quite that. He is not responsible to it for his ministry. He is responsible if he teaches what is wrong. Wrong teaching is to be condemned by the assembly (@Revelation 2: 2); but the assembly has no authority over the minister as such, nothing to do with the servant in his service, which he receives directly from the Lord. In it he serves the assembly -- teaches it, exhorts it, and so on, as the Lord may direct. Nevertheless, he is amenable to the assembly as a brother, as seen in @Matthew 18.
Ques. So if any query were to be raised in regard of teaching, it would be done by an exercised person, not done merely formally by the assembly as such.
J.T. The matter would have to be looked at as if he were an ordinary brother.
Ques. How would these indications work out at the present time? You referred to the sovereign action of the Holy Spirit. He sent them out. How would that work out at the present time?
J.T. It is a question of a brother speaking as under the Spirit's influence. We cannot look for any great distinction now in such matters, or that things should be brought out as they were then. We can see the principle. If the Lord is indicating that a brother has a gift to serve, the saints in a general way let him go. Laying our hands on him is just committal to him in fellowship.
Ques. Ought not the preacher to have the fellowship of his brethren in going out from their midst?
J.T. He ought, I suppose, but that would have to be watched. An individual in the assembly might be jealous of him and hinder him in his service. A matter like that would have to be watched carefully. No
{430}
true servant would wish to go out without the fellowship of his brethren, but the brethren have to watch that they have good reason for hindering in any way.
Ques. Would the end of chapter 15 help in that way, Barnabas and Mark going to Cyprus, and Paul and Silas going forth: the latter being committed by the brethren to the grace of God?
J.T. Paul was commended. Some might not have commended him, though. Some might have sympathised with Barnabas in this matter, but that would not set aside the general attitude of the brethren, because the principle of assembly action is not unanimity, but doing what is right.
Ques. Is this the recognition of the gift, the sending forth by the Holy Spirit?
J.T. Yes. The Holy Spirit is doing it. He gave them their gifts.
Ques. How would the hands of the presbytery fit in with what has been said?
J.T. That would be the elderhood. The laying on of the hands of the presbytery is just committal as here. Timothy's gift was "through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood", @1 Timothy 4: 14. His gift was also by the laying on of Paul's hands (@2 Timothy 1: 6), but all that is special; it contemplates the early state of things.
Rem. In the third verse referred to, fasting comes first. "Having fasted and prayed ... they let them go" @Acts 13: 3.
J.T. That would preclude the admission of any personal antipathy to the servants.
{431}
BELIEVING ABRAHAM
@Galatians 3: 9; @John 8: 39,40,56; @Hebrews 11: 9
My remarks, dear brethren, will centre in Abraham -- in Christ, of course -- but Abraham will be regarded as the subject. He has a great place in Scripture, not only in the Old Testament, but also in the New. With Moses and David he has the most outstanding place in the New Testament, that is, of those honoured men, servants of God, mentioned in the Old Testament. Generally the mention of a man in the New Testament indicates his place in the service and testimony of God.
Abraham is employed, not only as an example for us of faith and works, but he is used by the Lord in the well-known parable in @Luke 16. He is selected to fill a remarkable place, in a figurative way, no doubt, but still Abraham is mentioned as representing peculiar privilege in the unseen world. And the Lord elsewhere refers to him as living, saying that God is "the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (@Luke 20: 37); adding "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living". Although he is used in a symbolical way in the parable (@Luke 16), yet he is brought into it, and that is not accidental. The Lord had pleasure in bringing Abraham into such distinction, mentioning even his bosom, showing that he must have been a man of great affection. Lazarus, when he died, "was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom", @Luke 16: 22. The Lord referred to Abraham in this parable as a man worthy of such mention.
It is not that the departed saints are literally employed as in their disembodied condition; it would be very fallacious to assume that they are used in a general sense. But there is nothing impossible with God, and, as it is said, He brought Moses and Elijah on to the mount of transfiguration; it was so; and that *He* brought up Samuel is a fact. God was acting in a *special* way.
{432}
He has a right to do this, honouring certain of His saints at the same time. It was not merely to accomplish a certain purpose in the testimony, but also included the place that they had in the divine mind; and nothing is more precious than to be held in the divine mind in this practical way. Abraham is outstanding in this respect.
So one may freely bring him forward in a service of this kind, in order that lessons may be learned from him. The first scripture read introduces him to us as "*believing* Abraham". Paul by the Spirit refers to him in this way. In @Romans 4: 16 he refers to him as "the father of us all", a statement that has to be understood by the context; for God is our Father, but the Spirit of God comes down to us and speaks so as to make the truth intelligible, not, of course, to the natural mind, but to the spiritual; although it may be only of small development, as in the Corinthians. Paul said he could only speak to them as babes; but he did speak to them as christians -- they were "babes in Christ", @1 Corinthians 3: 1. Their status therefore was equal to others in Christ. One is honoured, however small his measure, as in that position.
So we have this way of divine teaching, God taking up a man like Abraham and stating that he is the father of believers; that is to be understood in the same sense in which he is said to have a bosom into which Lazarus was carried. Thus in Galatians he is "believing Abraham!" The word *faithful*, as in the Authorised Version, is hardly correct; it is a question of faith rather than being faithful. Faith is a word scarcely used in the Old Testament, although it is used, and Abraham is the father of all who had faith, and who *have* faith. Here he is "believing Abraham", a word we should all take to heart, as other similar points, in an educational sense; such as "repenting", that one is a "repenting sinner", @Luke 15: 7. It is not that he repented historically, at a given time, or that he believed, but that
{433}
he is a repenting sinner and believing, as Abraham was believing.
So "believing Abraham" entering into the present dispensation, is of first-rate importance; for whilst history enters into our training and growth, it is always what we *are* that counts. One challenges oneself as to whether one *is* believing, for believers "are blessed with believing Abraham". No believer wishes to isolate himself; of course he values individual blessings, but love is always correlative, in the growth of the christian, with other features, and would always include the brethren. Love for all saints would say that one is blessed with them, but then, blessed with all *believing* ones, we are "blessed with believing Abraham".
Faith is that without which we cannot please God, but that does not simply mean that I believed in the Lord Jesus at a certain time, but that I am a believer *characteristically*. So in regard of assembly material, in the first great missionary journey of Paul he observed a man that had faith, before it is said that the man believed. The apostle discerned that he had faith, that is, the lame man at Lystra (@Acts 14). He represents a feature of assembly material. It is useless to talk of assembly service and assembly material aside from faith; the present time is the period of faith; "God's dispensation, ... is in faith" (@1 Timothy 1: 4) -- that is the principle governing it, involving faith in us. Believers are essential to the dispensation -- an important thing to bear in mind, for it is the dispensation of faith.
Then the next thing is works, the accompaniment of faith. James refers to Abraham, distinguishing him, and says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works?" @James 2: 21. He alludes to @Genesis 22, where it is said that he offered up Isaac, and then says: "Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?" (@James 2: 22). So that we are in an imperfect state, a one-sided growth, where faith is assumed to exist, and perhaps does in a measure, but
{434}
without works. The dispensation is not to be discredited by malformation. James and Paul taken together present perfection from the standpoint of which I am speaking, faith is perfected by works.
James goes on to say: "And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God" @James 2: 23; he has this very great distinction, which is mentioned three times. James quotes from the Old Testament when he refers to him as "the Friend of God". It is mentioned in @2 Chronicles 20: 7 and @Isaiah 41: 8. Being mentioned three times thus, it is significant: there is one man a friend of God. Is there anyone here who would elect himself out of that category? Friends of God are greatly needed at the present time.
The Lord regarded His disciples as friends, meaning that there was confidence. This remarkable appellation of Abraham, that he was the "Friend of God", is especially to be noticed as fitting in with the remarkable testimony to the man: "believing Abraham". Abraham being our father, and believers being blessed with him, we may well aspire to be with him, the friends of God.
Abraham signalises the truth of it on a most important occasion: he filled out the occasion by this feature. Jehovah, and the two men who came with Him, moved away; for God as in testimony is always moving on. God had turned aside to visit Abraham, who was pleasurable to Him, and He waited under the tree for Abraham to prepare Him a meal. How beautiful that is! God thus comes down to us and touches our hearts. As They move on, Abraham would go with Them on Their way. Then God says in effect, Abraham is showing still that he is My friend, and I am not going to hide from him what I do. That is, he is moving on with God; the men went on to Sodom, but Abraham still stood before Jehovah, and God opened up His thoughts to him. The patriarch remained what he
{435}
was; it came into evidence on a great occasion that he was God's friend. We all want to be that, I am sure; it enters into the matter of works, Abraham's works perfecting his faith.
And in this most remarkable chapter (8) of John's gospel we have the subject of Abraham's works introduced. It is one of the most affecting chapters; satanic power in the reprobate Jews is showing itself throughout, so that the Lord goes so far as to say, "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do" (@John 8: 44). We have to do with all this; so the Lord says: "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham" (@John 8: 39). You see, dear brethren, how this fits in at the present time; I have been speaking of friendship of God, God's friends, taking sides with Him. It should appear in our prayers; speaking to Him about the powers that be, how He set them up -- Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander, the Caesars, how they behaved. Is it nothing to God? Is their behaviour nothing to God? It *is* something to God.
God took great pains with Nebuchadnezzar. He even converted him, to make him an example, no doubt, to all that were to follow in rule on the earth up to the present moment. Then there is humanity itself; although they turned from Him at Babel, God divided them up into nations for the time of the gospel; kept them within bounds, "That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith", @Galatians 3: 14. Think of the thoughts of God away back at Babel, that the nations should receive the promise of the Spirit on the principle of faith! It meant a great deal to God that they should turn from Him, and one has liberty in speaking to God about this. He likes to see us taking sides with Him in these matters.
Then think of all the divine activity to set christianity up here! The apostles, every one of them, raised up
{436}
of God to preach the gospel, to promote the truth so that we might have it; is it nothing to Him that the great mass have turned away? It is a great deal to God and He likes to hear us speak about it and to ask Him to prolong His operations notwithstanding. There is another matter: the few who have been restored to the truth in our day, how precious they are in His eye! and we are to take sides with God in prayer about these things, and so the work goes on. Whilst borne out sovereignly, the work goes on very largely through the prayers of the saints; God works through us, that we might tell Him what we want Him to do: He loves to answer us. To one king He said, Abraham will pray for you. God knows us, we may say, by our prayers, and would call the attention of others to us.
As I was remarking as to this chapter, there is in it the terribleness of what the Lord met, Satan himself, not as he tempted Him in the wilderness, but attacking Him through the reprobate Jews; that is, apostate people as all around us now. The Lord said: "Ye are of your father the devil" (@John 8: 44). The Lord did not mince matters in talking to them; "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham" (@John 8: 39). That is the point: "the works of Abraham" balanced his faith so that he was "justified by faith" and "justified by works" too.
The Lord further says: "now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham" (@John 8: 40). One might speak at length on that negative line; for there is much that comes up in our gatherings as to which some say, What harm is there in it? Well, the answer is, Scripture does not approve it at all. If I take the example of sports, often legalised amongst the Lord's people for certain ages, I might say, "this did not Abraham", and he, as our father, is a model for us. You say, how do you know he did not? I think I can show you from the passage I read.
{437}
The passage says of him that he "dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise" @Hebrews 11: 9. Where is Esau? He was of the same age as Jacob; where was he? Why did Abraham not dwell with him? Abraham would not take a tennis-racket and go off to play a game with him. I am not at all desirous of making any young people here legal; I am only stating the truth: "this did not Abraham". Where was Esau when Abraham dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob? This would be from the time Abraham was one hundred and sixty years of age until he died: it would be in that period. He lived only fifteen years as a contemporary of his grandson Jacob and the same period with Esau, but Esau is not mentioned as having the same honour. So if we go in characteristically for sports we shall have to do it without Abraham, and that is very sorrowful indeed.
We are obliged to get along without some who go on with these things, but we do get on without them, and have good times without them. Recently I saw an old sister who has not been attending the meetings of the saints for years, and I said to her, We have been having good times without you. Think of missing all these precious times! The brethren get on without you; they do not want to, but they get on well without you. I have no doubt Abraham had good times with Isaac and Jacob. An old man one hundred and seventy years of age: would he enjoy the companionship of that boy? He would, for it is spoken of as a matter of faith. God is pleased with suitable young people in His assembly. Some of you here may get along without the brethren, but do not forget we get along without you, too, and get on well; and heaven will get along without you if you continue an unbeliever.
Why should not Esau be included? Surely it is to call attention to this very thing; these things did not Abraham. The believing christian today does not go in for worldliness, inclusive of those things which
{438}
parents sometimes regard as harmless. As so regarding these things, you are legalising them, and, presently your children's conscience will become hardened, and they will not even care for your society.
Well, the Lord spoke about these things in this way: "this did not Abraham". Then lower down: "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad" (@John 8: 56). "Your father Abraham" -- how often that could be said to young people who are going in for the world -- getting into the so-called good side of it, and then moving into the bad side, becoming hardened: the devil has got you. The Lord would say: "Your father ... rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it"; he did not make little of it: "he saw it, and was glad". That is a beautiful reference to Abraham, and I mention it now because one cannot but speak to the young I see here. The best place to speak to them is when they are in the company of the elder brethren: there is a spiritual atmosphere amongst the brethren. Abraham did not dwell in tents alone, but "with Isaac and Jacob". The old and the young are to be together.
As I said, this is a beautiful reference. One might venture to link it up with @Genesis 21, with Isaac as weaned; that is, when Christ is apprehended by the believer as detached from all that is natural. In effect, it is the believer seen in that way. It is Christ apprehended by the young people in that way. Isaac there is typically Christ, and Abraham saw him: he made a feast for him.
Sarah appears in it, which brings in another thought for sisters especially to notice; Abraham would have had joy with Ishmael as well. Sarah was in advance of her husband as to Ishmael, and God supported her. We have these issues constantly amongst us, and sometimes the sister is ahead of the brother. Abraham is enjoined to hearken to the voice of his wife. Sarah said that Ishmael must not inherit with her son. Abraham submitted to the word of God. He had made the feast
{439}
for Isaac and he rejoiced in it, I am sure; the Lord says he "rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad". One could hardly present him as a better example for us as christians than as rejoicing to see Christ's day. This is not His day in that sense; His day is when He is fully known and owned. That is His day: normally christians love His appearing. You say, I love the Lord; that is very good, but after all there is not much credit in that: if you do not love the Lord you are deserving of a curse. "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maran-atha", @1 Corinthians 16: 22. When we say, or assume, we love the Lord, it is only what should mark every christian; and no doubt it does; but then, who loves His appearing? The apostle Paul spoke of a crown which the Lord would give to all those "that love his appearing", @2 Timothy 4: 8. So it seems to me Abraham comes in on these lines.
Then this matter of @Hebrews 11; this family matter: I have anticipated it and come back to it. The Lord is stressing it at the present time. Abraham was a family man; we find him concerned about a wife for his son; and that principle is handed down through Isaac to Jacob. It is not only typical, it is a principle of the most practical account, because mixed marriages, dear brethren, are among the most baneful things that come in amongst us. Parents allow their sons and daughters to form affiliations that are not "in the Lord"; whereas marriage is to be "in the Lord". Thus the husband or father, the head of the house and the mother with him, must insist on this, for they have authority; the Lord has given them authority, why not use it? Both Isaac and Rebecca enjoined Jacob as to this matter; Abraham causes the leading servant in his house to swear as to this matter. He would have a wholly right seed, and he has a wholly right seed in Isaac and Jacob, and he lives with them.
Esau's wives, the daughters of Heth, "were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebecca", @Genesis 26: 35. Every
{440}
husband and every wife of that kind brought into the family circle of faith is a grief; they cannot be anything else. Abraham is a believer, a man who looks out for the husbands and wives of those in his house; so that he has his own joys in them, not grief: he "dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him" @Hebrews 11: 9. Think of having a daughter-in-law, or son-in-law, that is not an heir with one in the spiritual things that God has vouchsafed to us! "Heirs with him of the same promise" -- that implies fellowship; we share together in the family, the sense of being blessed together in the family: the head of the house sharing with his son and his grandson in his old age the rich inheritance that had come down, and with which he was blessed, and with which they also were blessed. I trust this may be of practical service to us at the present time, that we may follow in the steps of our father Abraham.
{441}
CHRIST'S MARITAL RELATIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY
@Exodus 18: 1 - 7; @1 Samuel 25: 3, 14 - 20, 32, 33
J.T. There is considerable inquiry and exercise among the brethren as to the assembly viewed in marital relations with Christ; as to her part in the service of God, and as to how the truth of the assembly's marital relations enters into the service of God. It occurred to me that it might be profitable to look into these two types; Zipporah, significantly related to Moses as engaged in the service of God, and Abigail in relation to David, also prominently connected with God's service. The service of God is introduced very formally in Exodus. Jehovah sent a message to Pharaoh saying, "Israel is my son, my firstborn. And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4: 22, 23). And we know how David links up with the service of God, being also "the sweet psalmist of Israel", so that Abigail serves to typify the assembly in relation to Christ as seen in David. David represents the more spiritual side of our service as we come together in assembly; Moses represents more the initial, or dominical, side of our position. There are other types of the assembly, but these are representative of the assembly as relating to the service of God.
E.J.McB. It has raised a very interesting point, that is, as to the place that the marital relation has in the service of God, how far it goes.
J.T. Well, the link in our first scripture is very evident, for it is said that Jethro came as Moses was before the mountain. "And Jethro, Moses¬ father-in-law, came to Moses with his sons and his wife into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mountain of God" @Exodus 18: 5. Moses had reached that point. Israel, we are told in the next chapter, verse 2, "encamped there before the mountain", but it is Moses in this chapter, and the
{442}
link is very evident as to the service, because God had directed that they were to serve Him "upon this mountain". So that the subject of God's service is plainly in view, "And Jethro ... came to Moses with his sons and his wife into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mountain of God" @Exodus 18: 5. There is nothing said here about Zipporah being a woman of good understanding, or of a beautiful countenance, indeed there is nothing at all said of her as to her character. She represents the marital side, being as much a wife as any other: Abigail or Rebecca; indeed, as appearing *here* she represents the thought of the marriage bond and, I think, corresponds with our position as we sit down at the Lord's supper. The marriage link is there between Christ and His assembly, in the sense of the bond, that she is "to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead", @Romans 7: 4. This is seemingly the Roman side of the subject.
E.J.McB. Has the naming of the sons any place in this matter? Do the two names suggest two sides of the position?
J.T. They have their meaning expressly given. "Gershom -- ... I have been a sojourner in a foreign land, -- and the name of the other, Eliezer -- For the God of my father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh" @Exodus 18: 3,4. These meanings seem to fit in with our public position. Zipporah represents the assembly in an initial way, not too lovely, not too attractive, but still the bond is there, and the Lord is true to it.
A.F.B. Would you mind saying a word as to Jethro in this connection -- what place has he?
J.T. There is more made of him than of Zipporah in this chapter, so that it is the 'in-law' position. The position is somewhat legal, and rightly so; we all begin with that. The position is clear, the wifely relation is not only there, but the father-in-law as well; he stands
{443}
specially related to her. She is his daughter, of course, and he is her father, but the *father-in-law* is stressed. The position is without a stain on it; there is ample witness that the wifely relation is accredited. The father-in-law tells Moses that he has brought his wife to him. He says, "I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her" @Exodus 18: 6. There is no doubt about it. He has thoroughly identified himself as his father-in-law, and the wife is there; the bond is clear. Whatever people may say about His people characteristically on assembly ground, the Lord owns us. The position is clear, let people say what they will, whereas the position of the Church of England, or the Church of Rome, is not clear. Who has brought them to Christ?
W.S. Does this represent the love of Christ, and not so much response on our side?
J.T. It presents the bond, and it is owned. It cannot but be owned, for she *is* the wife, and there are the children, and the father-in-law. If we are in this position, it is impregnable. What can anybody say if this position exists?
C.L. Would the legal position be secured primarily, and is it essential to the service of God?
J.T. Yes, we must see to that. Whatever people may say, it is a question of what is legal before God. As on assembly ground, we can easily give an account of the position if anyone wishes to know. We can bring forth the evidence of the bond. What can be a better witness than the wife, the two sons, and the father-in-law? The 'in-law' is mentioned over and over again; and Jethro is on good terms with Moses. Moses kissed him and brought him into his tent.
W.McB. Is this the outward evidence of something?
J.T. It is, so that the bond between Moses and Zipporah is clear, and this comes in as God enters into covenant with Israel.
{444}
Ques. When you ask the question as to the Church of Rome and the Church of England, Where is their father-in-law? what do you mean?
J.T. Well, who can show that there is any real bond or link with Christ? Is it clear? Can any of them make it clear? I am certain they cannot. What part has God in their professed relation to Christ?
Ques. Is the commencement of this bond seen in that Moses "sat by the well"?
J.T. Just so, and we are told that Jethro had seven daughters, and here he says, "I, thy father-in-law Jethro" have come to thee, and thy wife and her two sons. There is no question about the relation of Zipporah to Moses. It is "I, ... Jethro". He had seven daughters, one of whom was Zipporah, and he was a priest of Midian, and these daughters were shepherdesses, and they came to water their flock, and their testimony is that an Egyptian helped them. That was Moses; he watered their flocks. That is our Husband. Christ has shed forth the Spirit abundantly on us. There is nothing said as to the personal attractiveness of Zipporah. It is just that her father gave her to Moses to be his wife. There does not seem to be any special drawing on her part, it was Jethro who proposed bringing Moses into the house. As to those who question the position of the saints today and despise us, well, we have to hang our heads and say there is ground for that; but nevertheless the legal papers, so to speak, exist; we have the evidence of the bond, and that is everything in this position.
A.F.B. Do I understand that Jethro suggests the element of authority among the brethren prior to the Supper?
J.T. Yes, it is authority from God; fatherly authority. Any fatherly authority is from God; it is a principle in creation. God Himself brought Eve to Adam. He was, as it were, the father-in-law; that is the principle.
{445}
Who can question our position? The Lord goes back to that in the matter of divorce. He says, "from the beginning it was not so" @Matthew 19: 8.
Ques. Are you suggesting that this is the legitimate position?
J.T. There must be the legitimate bond or we are disqualified, and we have no claim to the service of God at all. We must begin with the attested position in relation to Christ; that is what I think is meant here.
E.J.McB. Christ has a right to us, and we have a right to Him.
J.T. The relation is reciprocal; married "to another, who has been raised up from among the dead" @Romans 7: 4. Well, that is our side, we are free, and He accepts us.
Ques. When we come together at the Supper all the saints are in view, are they not? The position is somewhat beclouded as most are absent, whereas it is open for us to come in this way as recognised of God, and we come in for the gain of the assembly.
J.T. So that anyone who is not claiming the bond is questionable; "veiled", as it says in Canticles. I apprehend that allusion is to questionable persons. Anyone who is not taking up this marital position in relation to Christ is questionable as to his affection for Christ.
E.C.M. It says here, Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and kissed him, and they asked each other after their welfare. It does not say that Moses went out to meet Zipporah, but to meet his father-in-law.
J.T. All that shows that it is the 'in-law' position that is stressed here. There is no question that Zipporah is Moses¬ wife: there is not much evidence of affection; it is not mentioned at all, but the father-in-law is mentioned in this sense -- it is a most important matter.
{446}
Ques. When you say, We have the papers, what do you mean?
J.T. I am alluding to the marriage contract. You know what that means, that the principals have entered into it. Whatever the affections, the bond is there as much as if they were in abundance.
E.J.McB. Is that to stress the fact that we have a right to claim the Lord, and He a right to claim us?
J.T. Quite so. That is what I understand, and, whatever people may say, if we are in the light of this, having the Spirit and related to Christ, we know the matter exists, and we can go on with the service of God. Jethro, Moses¬ father-in-law, was not an ordinary man; he can tell Moses what to do, he can be listened to with confidence; and he is thoroughly in what Israel were going on with. Verse 8 says, "And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake; all the trouble that had befallen them on the way, and how Jehovah had delivered them. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness that Jehovah had done to Israel" @Exodus 18: 8,9 -- showing that it was not a mere perfunctory matter of bringing his wife to Moses and returning home, but that he was thoroughly in the thing; a reliable man who goes on to be a priest of God. We read in verse 12, "And Jethro, Moses¬ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses¬ father-in-law in the presence of God" @Exodus 18: 12. So the position is clear and happy.
C.L. I notice that it does not say that he is a priest of Midian, the title is dropped.
J.T. He is a real priest here. As a type he is one ready to go on with the service of God.
F.H. Would you say that we enter into this marriage bond individually on the lines of @Romans 7?
J.T. Yes. I think we may take it up as we sit down to partake of the Lord's supper; the ground taken is that we are to Another. That is, the first husband is
{447}
dead. Whatever claimant there may have been, all is now clear; legally you have title to disregard it. It is not divorce here, the first husband is dead; we have become dead to the law by the body of Christ. Whatever exists that might hinder me in the service is regarded as done with in the death of Christ, so that we should be to Another. That is the collective position. "Father-in-law" is mentioned many times, and surely it is for some purpose: and now Jethro, as offering sacrifices, is a priest, and they eat bread before God with him -- even Aaron has part in that.
Ques. With regard to the Supper as presented in Corinthians, have we the idea of the legality of the thing in Paul's word, "I have received of the Lord" @1 Corinthians 11: 23, and then some suggestion of the marital affections in the use of the title, Lord Jesus?
J.T. Yes, and it is "My body, which is for you" @1 Corinthians 11: 24; that surely is the suggestion of His love for the assembly. It is the Lord's thought from heaven. The marital relation refers to a Christ ascended. The Supper here was celebrated in the assembly, and Paul in recording @1 Corinthians 11 would have the mystery in mind. Being the minister of the assembly, he would have it in his mind, although he kept back much in speaking to the Corinthians. In the second letter he says he had espoused them as a chaste virgin to Christ; but in the first letter he keeps to the wording of the Lord's communication to him as to the Supper, and this should govern us as celebrating it.
F.W.K. That is, the apostle claimed them for the Lord.
J.T. Quite so. He says that in the second letter, showing that he has more liberty now. That is what he had in his mind -- they were only two years old; they were young, when he wrote his first letter, but he refers to his early service among them. "I have espoused you ... a chaste virgin to Christ" @2 Corinthians 11: 2 -- he had that in his mind and we must read the first epistle in that light.
{448}
Ques. Why does Moses eventually send away his father-in-law?
J.T. The matter is settled. This chapter is by itself, it is a remarkable chapter. Jethro comes in and actually officiates as priest and then tells Moses what to do, and Moses acts according to his word too. All this comes down to us for our education. Then we come to the position on the mountain (@Exodus 19), and the going up (@Exodus 24). The service of God started in this sense. There was the song earlier, but that was not the inauguration of the service of God, because the service of God was to be inaugurated on the mountain. The Red Sea does not denote the resources of God, but His mountain does. "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided" (@Genesis 22: 14); that is what @Exodus 19 presents. Everything for the service of God will come out there.
The second side of our subject is Abigail and, over against Zipporah, the first mention of her brings out that she is a woman of a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance, so that we have a different view of the assembly now, which ought to come in later in assembly service. Our spiritual intelligence ought to come in especially, and our attractiveness to Christ; also liberty for the operations of the Holy Spirit as in the assembly, producing intelligence and affections, not only for Christ, but for one another. We must be united in affection to one another; it is a collective thought and that is what is in view here; we have a different view, but it is the same subject. It should appeal to us as to how we respond in this way, whether there is a good understanding, that is, that I know what to do at a given time. "I speak as to intelligent persons" @1 Corinthians 10: 15, the apostle says. This hardly marked them at Corinth, but he would accredit them in this way. I know what to do as intelligent, and I am attractive to Christ as being of a beautiful countenance.
{449}
Ques. Would this come in more in relation to the headship of Christ? You are speaking of the dominical side in relation to Moses.
J.T. Well yes, David represents that, but we have to observe first what Abigail does. You see what she is capable of before you get the thought of union with David. She is viewed by herself, she is not yet in relation with David; it is what she is in herself. We are told what she was in the third verse, and then some disaster is pending, and the young man, verse 14, "told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master; and he has insulted them" @1 Samuel 25: 14. That is, this young man understands what she is capable of. He knew where to put the information, and she knew what to do. That is the next thing, what we can do as left to ourselves. The whole of the gospel of Matthew strengthens us in that position, though Matthew does not say that the Lord went to heaven. One principle is that He has confidence in the disciples.
E.J.McB. Do you look at this type as setting forth the spiritual beauty and understanding of the assembly as knowing how to act in difficult circumstances?
J.T. That is it. How important that is! The scripture says, "difficult times shall be there" @2 Timothy 3: 1 -- that is, *now*. How important, therefore, to have the Abigail features! -- that is, the wisdom she evidences in dealing with matters -- we are to know what to do; to have a good understanding.
E.J.McB. She thoroughly judged her previous links.
J.T. She is still the wife of Nabal, but she has a true judgment of him.
E.C.M. She seems to correspond with David himself in regard to her attractiveness.
J.T. Quite so. She is of importance already in that way, and this young man's information leads her to move. Verse 18 says, "And Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves .... But she did not tell her
{450}
husband Nabal". She was like Jonathan, who did not tell his father what he was going to do. It is an important feature that we know how to hide things, the disclosure of which would defeat the purpose in view.
E.M. How do you account for Abigail's having all this substance to hand?
J.T. It is to bring out what the assembly is. There must be resources to carry on. Abigail knows what to do, and she has the means; what a selection of food she made! And it is calculated to meet the situation with David. It is certainly good to have something in your hand if you want to appease a brother; you are not demanding of him, you are bringing something to him. David is hardly a full picture of Christ yet, he has vengeance in his heart. Our day is not a day of vengeance, it is the day of grace, and so the Lord in sending out His disciples in @John 20: 23 says, "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them", that is the first thing; they are remitted by them because the disciples were to be representative of Him.
G.C.M. Would you say a word in regard to the prominence given to the young man here? Verse 14 says, "And one of Nabal's young men told Abigail", and in verse 19 Abigail says, "Go on before me; behold, I come after you".
J.T. We are in a period of young men today. It seems to be a young men's time; and the Lord is making it a sisters¬ time also. We have passed the patriarchal stage and have come to the young men's stage. Of course the old brothers and sisters have their place, but I think the Lord is calling special attention to the young men.
C.L. Is this food for the young men? I was thinking of the converse of that. Had she told her husband Nabal it would have weakened the position.
J.T. Quite so. What a fine variety of food it is! And Abigail said to David, "now this blessing ... let it be given to the young men that follow my lord" @1 Samuel 25: 27.
{451}
If she had told her husband Nabal it would have interfered entirely, because the authority was still ostensibly his. It is what the assembly is as left to herself -- what she is as seen in Ephesians.
C.L. That is, intelligence should mark us.
J.T. "I speak as to intelligent persons" @1 Corinthians 10: 15, is addressed to the Corinthians: "the assembly of God which is at Corinth" @1 Corinthians 1: 2; think of what that implies!
*Rem* Abigail has the sympathetic support of those like-minded -- here the young man says of Nabal, "he is such a son of Belial" @1 Samuel 25: 17 -- they had a true judgment of him.
J.T. Yes. You find that the young men generally rally to the truth; they have not the prejudice of the older brethren. Prejudice is a great hindrance to us in the development of the truth in the service of God. There has been a constant battle with prejudice from the time of the revival of the truth.
Rem. The young men are quick to regard the needs of the position and they act quickly. This element should be seen in relation to any exercise that is raised amongst us.
J.T. I think we ought to act quickly if the issue is clear. It is well to take counsel, and we must not ignore that Solomon's son, Rehoboam, made a mistake in confining himself to the young men; that has to be watched, but when the thing is clear, the example shows that wisdom would proceed at once. There are so many things that are left undone, untouched, and they become weights upon us. Abigail, "made haste" (@1 Samuel 25: 18). The matter is clear; there is disaster pending. You do not delay on this account, but you proceed on positive lines, not always with a sword in your hand, but with *food* -- food is a weapon here.
Rem. What Abigail brings -- food and drink -- would be an excellent contribution to the wealth of the position.
{452}
J.T. All is David's now, she hands it over. The position is thus changed, and he says to her in the two verses we have read, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me. And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand" @1 Samuel 25: 32,33. That is a fine tribute from David to her. It is really an acknowledgment on his part of the way she had helped him -- she had saved him as well as the whole position.
Ques. You are referring to the young men; is your thought that the Lord is doing things swiftly today -- moving rapidly -- and that the younger element is more ready to apprehend what His movements are and to follow them up?
J.T. I would not put the rapid movement first. What I would put forward first is what marked Abigail -- that she is a woman of good understanding. She will not go too far ahead, but with her good understanding she has attractiveness. She is full of grace, and she moves at once because the exigency required immediate action, and that is, I think, the point. The word haste is connected with her, too, but it links on with the young man, because it was he who took the initiative in the matter. Here he is discerning and he understands his mistress, for the passage says he was her young man; he was Nabal's young man, but he was hers, too. No doubt he had observed in her the ability to manage things.
C.L. Would the care meeting come in there?
J.T. It does; and we act accordingly, and the results reached are -- when necessary -- presented to the assembly as *proposals*. The care meeting in itself is not direct authority -- Abigail is the assembly in type here, and the information is placed with *her*.
Rem. All these features -- intelligence, beauty, and trustworthiness -- underlie the service of God!
{453}
J.T. Yes. You can see what an institution God has here below. Matthew unfolds it to us and shows how heaven has confidence in it. The assembly brings out the culpability of the one who has trespassed. The primary sin may not be very serious, but refusal to listen to the assembly is serious, and thus the offender is unfit for fellowship. A criminal court would not take much account of it, but one who refuses to listen to the assembly is regarded by heaven as a capital offender, and the saints are to recognise this.
H.M.P. Are you viewing the assembly in its widest aspect?
J.T. Well, the desire of many now is, and has been for some time, as you know, to get help as to the service of God. Of course it has a wide bearing, but it is service in the assembly as convened that has been specially exercising the brethren; and it is clear that in assembly we do not bring in at once all that pertains to the service. If the body, for instance, is introduced, as in @1 Corinthians 10, we do not bring in Ephesians there, we just regard it according to the setting given to it by the Spirit of God, but when we come on to later periods in the service, then the truth of Colossians and Ephesians has place. The priest knows how to do things and what to bring in at any given time. So it is a question for us of the marital side, whether it be Zipporah or Abigail, Eve, Rebecca, or Asnath. All these thoughts may fit in, but it is a question of reciprocity between the Lord as Head, or as Bridegroom, and His assembly.
Ques. Would it be the Lord's thought that the whole range of the service of God should come into operation every Lord's day?
J.T. I think so, because Deuteronomy says the feast in Israel was to be a yearly one; ours is a weekly one. In Deuteronomy the whole series of holy convocations had to proceed every year. Even if it were a bad year and there was a bad crop, the feast of tabernacles comes after the reaping, when we have gathered
{454}
in everything. Supposing you have a bad crop, the feast is not to be cancelled; therefore, in our service we ought not to rob God. He says expressly after delineating the three feasts in @Deuteronomy 16, that all the males must come up at the times of these feasts. An Israelite would be remiss if he did not come up at the time of each feast. Therefore, if we fail to move on to the worship of God in our assembly service, we are remiss.
Rem. It seems a lot to suggest that we should be able to condense it into an hour and a quarter.
J.T. Well, that is another question, the question of agility -- to touch *briefly* the features of the truth entering into the service. God is the God of measure; that is one of the things that He is a God of, and time is one of the things He measures, and, therefore we ought to measure -- use our sound minds -- in the parts we take in the meetings. You say, we have an hour and a quarter, well, let us proceed in regulated agility, giving each feature of the service its due place. Mary Magdalene ran, John ran, and Peter ran. Did they do wrong? I do not think so, because the heading to @Psalm 22 is "Aijeleth-Shahar", and it means, 'according to the hind of the morning' -- an agile creature.
Ques. Is there an urgent call for spirituality in this type?
J.T. Yes; that is evident. David says, "And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from corning with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand" @1 Samuel 25: 33. If she had not acted quickly, what disaster there would have been!
Rem. That bears on what has been said. It is because of lack of discernment that we bring in things at the wrong time, and so waste time.
J.T. It is a question of priestly intelligence -- to know what to do, and how, and when to do it.
Rem. We want to be more alert as to what is spiritually for the occasion.
{455}
Rem. We have been giving too much time to the covenant.
J.T. I think so. One is very cautious, but I think it is clear that the covenant is augmentary; it is not the whole position; it is brought in; but the position is "in assembly". The two letters to Corinth are to the assembly; there is no covenant with the assembly, it is set up in liberty. Of course there is the marriage bond that we have been speaking of in relation to Zipporah, that is another matter; it alludes to the public position of the assembly of God.
Rem. I would like to ask a question as to the covenant. The Lord brings it in Himself, it comes in of necessity in connection with the cup. I think you have referred to the thought that after the Supper we make room for the Lord that He should have His full place in the affections of the saints going out to Him, and then He would bring us to God. Do you think of necessity that we should refer to the covenant again?
J.T. Not of necessity, because if we refer to God in His love, we include it; the love of God includes it, although the word love is not attached to the new covenant in the terms of it. The love of God is surely greater; Romans develops all that for us. Romans is basic both as regards the first and the second parts of assembly service, because chapter 8 brings us to the Father.
A.F.B. So the great thought of the covenant is that we might be in liberty before we proceed to the marital side.
J.T. Quite so, especially the young people, although we all enjoy it, however spiritual we are we enjoy it, but it is especially for the young people. It shuts out judaism.
E.J.McB. Going back to your remarks as to our being legally right, we know the ground on which we stand and we are conscious that it is of God -- then there is the thought of Abigail, which seems to be the
{456}
point here -- preservation. David would have wiped out Nabal and all he had if it had not been for the wonderful part taken by Abigail.
J.T. Quite so, and then the assembly viewed by itself is more prominent here, rather than those who are in the lead on the male side. David is remiss, and we have to take that to heart today. I mean the brothers who are in the lead in a meeting are apt to be too much in the lead and to miss it, so that it is well that special ability should not dominate; the assembly characteristically should come into evidence.
E.J.McB. You mean to have a *spiritual* lead, not a personal lead!
J.T. Exactly. We do not have to do the same thing every Lord's day. Whatever it be in the service, let it give room for the assembly as such.
Rem. So that the meeting should not go by clockwork.
J.T. There must be the idea of time and order, and then the filling in of the service with what speaks of *spiritual wealth*. Abigail knew what was needed and she brought it ready for use; you will observe that she brought stimulating things as well. She brought sheep ready dressed, she brought parched corn, and then she brought wine, raisin-cakes and fig-cakes. The whole selection is remarkable; just what was needed. A brother might get up and thank God in the assembly for temporal mercies and other such things, but the priest would say, No, you must be more limited than that. You might give thanks for a great many things in your house before you left for the assembly, but you must be more limited in the assembly. You should know what to bring, what is suitable; that is the general principle.
Ques. Are the moral qualifications seen in Abigail necessary for our moving on?
J.T. That is the point. David says, "blessed be thy discernment" @1 Samuel 25: 33. How great a tribute that is! It is the
{457}
subjective side of the assembly in these types, and there is no assembly aside from the work of God and the Spirit of God in us. So this is a suggestive view and a very attractive one too. The woman here knows what to do and she is reflecting David beforehand.
Ques. Is that why the things themselves are not in the raw state? They are at all stages of exercise -- the loaves, the raisin-cakes, and so on.
J.T. They are all ready for use, the sheep are dressed, and the corn is parched, and then there are raisin-cakes and fig-cakes. We have to go the whole length of the chapter to see the full result -- the marriage; but the point now is what she was before it. What will she be after it? I mean she should take on more of this character; but there is very little said about her afterwards.
Rem. If we were more conscious of what the assembly is to Christ as seen in these two types, it would help in the service of God.
J.T. That is what I think. We should carry this through, and if we are not so attractive as we ought to be, as might be said of Zipporah, we are assured that the position is a right one. There is not much said of her; it is as much as to say, we cannot say much about that meeting as to public testimony: still it is on right ground, and the Lord is owning it.
E.C.M. "So David received of her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person". @1 Samuel 25: 35.
J.T. Beautiful. You do not get anything like that in Zipporah.
Rem. He not only says, "blessed be thy discernment", but "blessed be thou".
Ques. Is that a mark of the Lord's approval?
J.T. That is what is meant. David is quick to see what is there and he is a type of Christ in that. Take a woman like Lydia, how quick the apostle was to discern what was there. "Lydia ... whose heart the Lord
{458}
opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul". @Acts 16: 14. She was a woman of affairs, a seller of purple -- she did things; that is the idea.
Ques. Do you think these features would be particularly appreciated by the Lord in the circumstances?
J.T. God orders the circumstances to bring out what we are.
{459}
THE BRIDE
@Revelation 1: 4 - 11; @Revelation 22: 16,17; @Revelation 21: 2,3
What is particularly in mind, is what the last two scriptures speak of -- the bride. The earlier scripture is to be considered as leading up to this day. The responsible assembly in the first chapter is in view under the numeral seven; not simply seven different cities in a designated province, for we must bear in mind that the book is symbolic in most of its language. Although these assemblies existed at the time John wrote, we look at them as representing the whole responsible body from Pentecost until the coming of the Lord Jesus from heaven. We have been reminded today that the letter kills, but the spirit gives life; so we are to consider this chapter -- and indeed the whole book -- not in the letter, but in the spirit, in its symbolical sense, as treating of responsible believers formed into assemblies.
The saints of God in this book are contemplated as capable of understanding the book and, in order to induce the reading of it, and the understanding of it, a special blessing is offered to those who read and understand. Understanding is of all importance in approaching the Revelation; it is addressed to professing bodies of christians, viewed not as so many christians, but as formed assembly-wise. The assembly is that which is possessed of the highest intelligence; hence the regrettableness of so little understanding of this book, for we are furnished with the means of understanding it, and to this end we are enjoined, as having ears, to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. It is not a question of understanding the gospel, but of what the Spirit says to the assemblies. The time had come to direct the assemblies as such -- that which was responsible here on earth -- to the mind of God as to what was coming: the things that John saw, the things that are, and the
{460}
things that should be after these. So that we are to be intelligent as to the whole history of the assembly, and what is concurrent: the history of the rulers of this world, the great emperors from Nebuchadnezzar until the end; and also the concurrent history socially, commercially and religiously. So that we should be in no doubt as to anything happening or anything that has happened. The mind of God for us is that we should be intelligent as to all these matters, even as to the beast -- "He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast", @Revelation 13: 18. We should not be called upon to count were it not that it is countable; that is to say, that the characters amounting to it are visible and to be understood.
John, as we see in the verses read, addressed himself to the assemblies apart from their failure; and it is a principle with God to view us, in so far as He may, according to conditions, abstractly. Whilst He would reprove us as to our failures and instruct us, He would have us to understand our abstract relations with Him, through the death and resurrection and ascension of Christ. The actual condition of the assemblies is depicted in the next chapter, but the Spirit of God has in mind in this first chapter to call us aside in an abstract way. I mean abstract in the sense of our minds being free from general history to pay attention to what we are as in the mind of God through redemption; and then to go on to what the Spirit has to say to us as to our responsibility. So we understand that we are in the confidence of God as He establishes a link with us on these lines, then He will speak to us as to failures. God, being God, cannot deny Himself, but He is entitled to view us abstractly, that is, according to His work in us, and according to His own thoughts in Christ; yet He cannot deny Himself, and will not fail to point out the failures, whatever they may be. He would have us to be restful in what He says to us in this remarkable address by John, as listening to it:
{461}
"Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ" @Revelation 1: 4,5. The Trinity is included in these verses: God in His infinite greatness, "who is, and who was, and who is to come" -- we are set up in His presence -- and the seven Spirits, alluding to the Holy Spirit symbolically, and then Jesus Christ, according to these well-known titles in verse 5.
So the address would set the mind of the saints moving, and draw our hearts into what is to be said, for it goes on, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood" @Revelation 1: 5. How touching that is! Is there anyone, young or old, who is not affected, as the Spirit of God brings Jesus in thus? -- "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen" @Revelation 1: 5,6. We are *made* a kingdom, that is how it should read, implying that we may regard ourselves as impregnable whatever men are doing, not only that we are brought into the kingdom, but we are *made* one; and as made priests, we have access to God in all the strength of what we are as a kingdom. We are set up according to these facts, and the Holy Spirit proceeds in this book to further fortify us, as He goes on to say, "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him. Yea. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty" @Revelation 1: 7,8. It is not only that John says something as representative of God, but God Himself speaks directly to our souls, setting us up before Him as the One *who is*. John then proceeds to speak of what he saw on the Lord's day.
All this is to keep our minds on assembly lines; we are addressed as the seven assemblies which are in Asia,
{462}
and our minds are to be kept on assembly lines, for this whole book is for us, directly given to us; and John gives us an example of a suitable state of this, in order to reach the end in mind, namely, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day" @Revelation 1: 10. John is a brother, as he says, "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" @Revelation 1: 9. Another thought, already referred to today, that belongs to us is tribulation; the great servant Paul spoke of it and wanted the saints to know of his excessive tribulation. It is the order of the day, for what is in mind is the Lamb's wife, and the Lamb's wife is a sufferer, if she corresponds with the Lamb. John gives us a lead in this, not restricting the suffering to himself only, but bringing the saints into it, even as Paul did, "your ... fellow-partaker in the tribulation" @Revelation 1: 9. This is the ministerial position, and ministers are to be examples, so that John would draw us along with him in connection with what he has to say in this book. He is in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus -- two distinct things, the word of God disclosing His mind in this dark world, and the testimony of Jesus, what He died for, what He lives for, what He is on the right hand of God for, and the power of the Spirit down here to testify: that is our position.
Now, having all this clearly in mind, we can follow the great thought in the passages read at the end, namely, the bride. The thought runs through Scripture, from the second of Genesis onwards and finds its completest concrete expression in this book as a city. This should never be out of our minds, and as it is in our minds we shall understand the epistles: they develop us in relation to light and rule and order and government; and as we keep in our minds clearly that what is dearest to the heart of Christ, and what is before God, is a city, and this city is the bride, we shall pay more attention to the development of the instruction and the discipline which makes it effective in us as to
{463}
light, government, and testimony generally in this world. God's testimony implies all these things, and so, in introducing the thought in @Genesis 2, the Spirit says that God builded a woman; that is, she is to reflect man, but man was not said to be builded, for Adam was a figure of Christ, of Him that was to come. Ishshah, that is Eve, was to reflect him in government. Rebecca, the second great type of the bride, carries the thought of a woman occupying the place of another -- Sarah. All these thoughts were vested in Israel, but when we come to more detail it is *Jerusalem*. The book of Ezekiel shows how God entered into marital relations with Jerusalem; it was the assembly typically. Paul's assembly is the idea and Rebecca represents that, but she represents it in the place of another, and what developed in the history of the testimony is that Rebecca, the assembly viewed under Paul's ministry, eclipsed Sarah. It is the idea right through of what fully answers to God in Christ; that is, all His features in the universe are to be seen in this great vessel. So we find in the Pentecostal assembly, as seen in @Revelation 21, the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, set in the most intrinsic preciousness, and answering to all measurement according to God. These names are set in every precious stone.
I mention all that, so that we may have clearly in mind what is involved in the bride, not only to know in thought, but to understand the idea and how it is to be reflected in the universe in light and order and government. In dwelling on this, I would make prominent Paul's ministry, which brings out the full thought, for he is said not only to be a new covenant minister, but also minister of the assembly; he received three ministries, including that of reconciliation, and each is distinctive. In order to understand what I am speaking about we have to understand these ministries of the apostle Paul, which he received directly from the Lord to carry out and to fulfil here in the saints. He says of
{464}
one assembly, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11: 2. It is that the thought of the bride should be in our hearts, so that Christ should be reflected, that He should be known.
Now I want to indicate the idea of the bride as we have it in this book. It is seen formally only at the end. The idea develops in remnant times, for we have to regard the second chapter as involving remnant conditions. The assembly in Ephesus is threatened with the removal of the candlestick, and there is no reference again to the candlestick, but overcomers are contemplated in each assembly, and I believe as we weigh the rewards to the overcomers we shall perceive how this thought of the bride comes into being in remnant times. We are in times of revival; things have been lost and have been recovered; and I believe an examination into the overcomers¬ rewards will enable us to perceive how, in our times, we arrive almost instinctively at the thought of the bride. There is the heavenly position in Ephesus, the promise to the overcomer is that he is given to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God; he does not get anything less than what the ministry to Ephesus implied. "To him that overcomes, I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God" @Revelation 2: 7. The overcomer is lifted out of this world, and he has part of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God. What a suggestion for us, dear brethren!
Then, as suffering, faithful unto death, the overcomer in Smyrna is told that he "shall in no wise be injured of the second death" @Revelation 2: 11. There is salvation in this in the time of suffering: suffering, as I said, marks the moment; whether we take it on or not, it is there; "take thy share", Timothy is told, and as we take our share in it we come into the sense of victory over death. The second death is in mind, for even if the body is killed, we have complete superiority over the second
{465}
death. There is not time to look into each, I only make the suggestion that by an examination of these rewards to the overcomers we come into the idea of companionship with Christ and the bride. That to the last one, in Laodicea, is to sit with Him in *His* throne. That is indeed what will mark the bride in a coming day. Then there is the beautiful reward in Philadelphia, which has a direct application at the present time; what is written upon us, not new covenant ministry, but much more. The Lord says, "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name" @Revelation 3: 12. Think of this beautiful touch for the overcomers, not simply for Philadelphia itself, but for him that *overcomes* in it; and it is in all these features, for the reward refers to what *we* value, as the Lord has made the assembly precious in our eyes, "the temple of my God", as He calls it, "the city of my God, the new Jerusalem", and then "my new name". The Lord has made these things very precious, and is making them more and more precious to us, as we are ready to take them in. Thus we are prepared for the thought of the bride; and as the book proceeds, the Lord directs us to the seven assemblies, "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies" (@Revelation 22: 16). It is to the saints in the assemblies.
Bear in mind what I have said about the first chapter, the abstract thought, the Lord is thinking of what the saints are to Him; He never loses sight of that, and He will bring us to it -- according to our verse, He has done so: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come" @Revelation 22: 17. *She* says it with the Spirit. How has she come to say it? The words are not put into her mouth. She has gathered it up; it is alertness, it is intelligence, it is what she is. So she has come to it, and one would
{466}
urge the dear brethren to thus gather up what is proceeding, not simply to take the ground of listening and enjoying things, but to gather them up as *for ourselves*; what the Spirit says to the assemblies thus culminates in our souls. We are to enjoy now our most precious relations with Christ, although they will be enjoyed more fully in the future. Here the bride, the new Jerusalem, is seen coming down out of heaven from God: her identity is clear. We have to dismiss the mere thought of a person in a literal sense, it is a symbolic thought; it is an immense number of persons put together, it is persons formed in intelligence as an organism. The Spirit enables us to grasp the greatness of what is presented and to reflect it -- in some little way, at least.
The bride says "Come", the Spirit does too. The Lord is helping us: the Spirit to some extent has had His place for many years back, one hundred years, and the result is alluded to in this verse; "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" @Revelation 22: 17. The Spirit moves along with the saints in their meetings week after week. One loves to think of it -- every week bringing its quota of these fellowship gatherings, and God in them would draw us into His thoughts, they belong to His great work in these last days, they are means in His hands of effecting His purpose, so the idea of the bride comes into view, and the Holy Spirit comes in; not only ministering the truth, but also drawing our hearts into it. The Spirit saying "Come" is not simply a note in the ministry, it is the desire of the Spirit with the assembly: "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" @Revelation 22: 17.
That is in the main what I had to present to you, and just for a moment I go on to chapter 21 to show how God comes down in the assembly. God is helping us on the line of sonship. How are we able to understand sonship save as it is seen in the Son? That is, in Christ as Man. "God sent forth his Son, come of woman, ... that we might receive sonship", @Galatians 4: 4, 5. As the
{467}
note in the New Translation shows, Christ's *sonship* began in the incarnation, and, through redemption, believers come into it; we receive it, and thus "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" @Galatians 4: 6. Thus we are in holy liberty with God. Galatians treats peculiarly of this subject, and the apostle brings in what he calls "an allegory", @Galatians 4: 24. He refers to Hagar and to Sarah, and says, "these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is" @Galatians 4: 24,25; but he does not take up the other covenant. Was it not enough to develop the liberty that he had in mind? No, he goes on to the heavenly city, saying, "Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all" @Galatians 4: 26. You see that is what he has in mind; he goes on to the higher line which is proper christianity. The new covenant has its place surely enough in liberating our souls, but it is the heavenly side, involving sonship, that implies the *full* liberty with God into which we are brought. It is a question of Jerusalem above being our mother -- *our* liberty, which enters into the heavenly position, for God is bringing many sons to glory.
That is what underlies these relations, of which I have been speaking: the new Jerusalem comes down from God out of heaven. "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". @Revelation 21: 2. John does not barely call her a bride here, he speaks of her as "prepared as a bride", which is, in a way, more; one might be a bride, but not be *prepared* as a bride. Later in the chapter, in relation to the millennial state of things, the heavenly city is shown to John by an angel, and she is called "the bride, the Lamb's wife" @Revelation 21: 9, but not here: what is in mind in the early part is what comes down finally and for eternity. She is set up in liberty above, and in intelligence; she knows what to do
{468}
and how to appear. How we are to appear should have a place with us. Bringing it down to a practical side of the position, we read of Moses and Elijah appearing. How did they appear? In glory; they came out of heaven -- that is the idea, we are not only set there, but we are in liberty, and we are in intelligence there; we know what to do. The city comes down, it is her own movement and she is prepared. God looks for an answer to this in assembly service, how we appear in the service. So it is, "coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" @Revelation 21: 2. She is now for Christ, which again, as I said, enters into our assembly service. What are we for Christ? How do we appear? In the service it is "from glory to glory", and so in the power of the Spirit we come to the thought of being "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" @Revelation 21: 2. It is not here a question of rule in the millennium, but of what the assembly will be in eternity, and hence we have the word "tabernacle", not "city" designating her as in relation with men. She affords a dwelling-place for God, so that He can be with men in the tabernacle. It is said, "he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God" @Revelation 21: 3. So that God is to be all in all. That is what is presented to us; this tabernacle seen "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" @Revelation 21: 2; so congenial to God, so suitable that He can dwell in it and, being there, He can be God to men, regarding them as His people.
I hope the brethren have followed, and will look into this great matter, and see how this thought is developed in this remarkable book: the assembly as a bride adorned for her husband.
{469}
THE MAN OF GOD
@2 Timothy 3: 17; @Deuteronomy 33: 1; @1 Kings 17: 24; @2 Kings 4: 8,9; @Nehemiah 12: 24
I have in mind to present the idea of a man of God in its application to the present time. If there are not those who may be so designated, there should be; it should be the aspiration of all, especially those who serve amongst the saints in a prominent way, and in view of our own times it is significant that Timotheus, as far as I know, is the only one so designated in the New Testament. His being a young man brings the matter within the range of all of us, even the youngest; it is something to be attained, and this is not by mere ability. Divinely given ability is necessary for the service of God, but it does not alone suffice for the filling out of the thought of the man of God, one who, as I hope to show from the examples in the scriptures read in the Old Testament, represents God and stands for all that is of God. That Timotheus is the only one mentioned in this way does not imply that he is the only one that could be so designated in the New Testament. It is needless to say that the writer of the epistle was one, and many others.
In 2 Timothy the title is not formally applied to Timotheus, as it is in the first epistle, but appears in this second epistle evidently in view of the last times when men of God are so needed; and in this respect it is remarkable that the preceding verse calls attention to the inspiration of Scripture: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works" @2 Timothy 3: 16,17. It is by no means implied that the Scriptures are not for other purposes than for use by the man of God. The Scriptures are in themselves a great testimony to God; evidently carefully
{470}
thought of beforehand, although many centuries elapsed in the history of humanity and of God's testimony before any Scriptures were written, but being written by the power of the Spirit, they embrace all that is necessary for the man of God to know, and for all saints to know. The book of Genesis is remarkably concise and yet comprehensive. Satan knows that, and that it lays the foundation for all that should follow, hence his great effort to discredit that book, as indeed all the books of the Pentateuch. One of the chief features of modern opposition to the truth is seen in the attack on the book of Genesis. There is negative guidance in that, for Satan selects what is worthy of attack, what is needful to get out of the way to defeat the purpose of God; and so the Spirit of God has graciously furnished remarkable expositions of the book of Genesis, as well as the other books of the Pentateuch, which all christians should read as entering into this verse, if they are to be "perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works" @2 Timothy 3: 17.
The Lord Himself stresses the books of Moses, placing them alongside His own words, indeed He says: "if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?" @John 5: 47 -- remarkable grace and wisdom to stress thus the value of the Pentateuch. He began there in speaking on another occasion, not to a large congregation, but to two persons, and they erring christians. Christendom is full, alas! of erring christians, persons who have turned aside. Not that I am accusing any in particular, but it is a fact, and hence the example set by the Lord is to be observed: "beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" (@Luke 24: 27), showing that erring christians need to have the Scriptures not only read, but expounded. Exegetical works of great value on these books are current, and should be attended to if we are to be throughly furnished unto every good work. Expositions are of great importance, not that christians should depend
{471}
wholly on them, they should read the Scriptures in dependence on the Holy Spirit. The Lord said, "How readest thou?" @Luke 10: 26 to one man, and that is a good question for us all. If you read them aright you will be supported in them, they even preach the gospel. An unconverted man would do well to read them, for the Scriptures preached the gospel to Abraham, we are told, and here it is said to Timotheus: "from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus". @2 Timothy 3: 15. They are able to do that.
The apostle says elsewhere, "the Lord will give thee understanding" @2 Timothy 2: 7; He is available to us. The Spirit too, guides us into all the truth. We are wonderfully furnished and no one who is ignorant is excusable. In fact, where people are ignorant and have no exercise the word might apply; "let him be ignorant", @1 Corinthians 14: 38. Very solemn! So we are to read the Scriptures. The Lord Himself says, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me", @John 5: 39. They are full of holy matter, the most engrossing matter for the renewed heart, able to make us wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. The eunuch is a good example; he says to Philip, "How can I [understand], except some man should guide me?" @Acts 8:31. It is well to have the sense that you need to be shown. The eunuch was reading, but he admitted he was not getting help, and if not getting help in reading Scripture it is wise to ask; I would advise each to do so, to ask the person most likely to answer helpfully. We read of the Lord Himself in the temple hearing and asking questions. I am not going to say He needed to ask questions, as we do, but that is what He did, and then His understanding and answers! It is wise, as I said, to ask questions, but be sure of the person of whom you ask. Philip was a good person of whom to ask questions about the Scriptures; he was a man amenable to the guidance
{472}
of the Holy Spirit, a safe man, not a man who trusted his own mind. An angel directs Philip to go down to the desert, and the Spirit says, "Go near, and join thyself to this chariot" @Acts 8: 29, and he did. He was a man under the guidance of the Spirit, and Philip preached Jesus to the eunuch; so it is not only the understanding of the Scriptures that is needed, but the knowledge of Jesus, for He is the subject and substance of all Scripture.
Moses is, I think, the first man called a man of God. I begin with him. What is in mind is to point out the features of the man of God. They are not all in one man -- they are all in Jesus, every one of them, and Nicodemus is a good example for us as to discernment of these features. He says, "we know that thou art a teacher come from God" @John 3: 2. That is the idea -- we know. There is guidance in that statement; he not only says that, but gives his reasons, "for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him" @John 3: 2. You may be sure if there are these marks in any one, you can designate him a man of God. Nicodemus would regard Jesus as pre-eminently what is indicated in the thought of a man of God, but he did not go very far, and there are many like him today. He was a questioner; he knew that Jesus was come from God, basing it on signs, but seemed to fail in not allowing light to flood his soul, although clearly he was a subject of the work of God. The true light is shining there before him, and yet he kept on questioning, and it would appear there was nothing definite reached in his soul at first. There are many like that, they come to meetings, and hear something and speak well of it, but the soul lacks light, the soul fails to take in the light that is shining, so that the person remains where he was -- a member of the Jewish council. If John did not mention him we should have known nothing of him. John, representing love, mentions the least evidence of God's work; he mentions Nicodemus three times, and finally as identified with Christ as dead, which is important. It is a
{473}
pity he remained so long unidentified with a living Christ while He was yet available to him. Still Nicodemus recognised that Jesus was from God, and the Lord unfolded to him the truth as to new birth.
Jesus, the Word become flesh, represents every trait of the man of God; He is infinitely more than any of us. Moses beforehand exhibited some of these traits; he was near enough to Jesus in character to be His companion in glory. What a great end is before us! "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory", @Colossians 3: 4. We cannot afford to be marked by discrepancies from what Jesus is if we are to appear with Him in glory. Moses, too, appeared in glory, he and Elijah; we can see how he is honoured; he speaks well of the people of God; that is a point in this chapter. It is remarkable that he is called a man of God here; he is called also a man of God as praying, the prayer of Moses, the man of God (@Psalm 90). He is also called a man of God elsewhere, but he appears here for the first time as a man of God. The idea is cumulative; he did not just become one because he wrote this book of Deuteronomy, or this one chapter, but it is stated at the outset as if the Spirit of God would say, This is one of the most beautiful traits of the man of God that he can speak so well of the Lord's people -- he blesses them. He is not a characteristic critic of the people of God, not that they did not deserve to be criticised to themselves; but he is king in Jeshurun, that is, among people who are "upright", in this chapter.
Every upright person in that day would regard Moses as a man of God. He speaks well of the people of God; he could speak ill of them, too, and we are to be warned by that, such a great man calling the people of God rebels, but it was not characteristic of him. This chapter is characteristic of him, he loved the people as Jehovah did. Of Jehovah he said, "Yea, he loved the people" @Deuteronomy 33: 3. Moses loved the people too; the people
{474}
he had known in their contrariety for forty years. Israel sinned from the time Moses knew them. The book of Ezekiel says they sinned in Egypt, sinned in the wilderness, sinned in the land, sinned in captivity; it is one history of sin. There were good features, but the general thought is continuous sin. There is not much in such conditions to draw out affection, yet it is after forty years with them that Moses speaks so well of the people (@Deuteronomy 33).
Elijah is the next example. He accepted responsibility, took to heart personally the calamity in others. The son of the mistress of the house died, and Elijah made it his matter. God has great respect for men and women who identify themselves with the calamity in others. Notice what Elijah did. "And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed", @1 Kings 17: 19. Elijah appeared in glory on the mount of transfiguration talking with Jesus, and what I am speaking of now entered into that, it is indicative of how God honours faithfulness in His servants; and He honours what is of Himself.
Elijah takes the child out of the mother's bosom; spiritually that was the real difficulty -- the natural being usually the source of all troubles amongst the saints. He laid the child on his own bed, he took on the calamity as before God, as the passage goes on to say, "And he cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again" @1 Kings 17: 20,21. What a beautiful complete identification with the child, with the calamity! And then the prayer, acknowledging he has no strength in himself to do anything. Power is in God, the God who raises the dead, as Paul said. That is a man of God; for he is acting for God, for the widow,
{475}
for the boy. Let us look at this feature in a man of God, and learn to accept as our own the calamities of the people of God, and bring God into the matter. I may share in a calamity and not help much in it, but if I bring. God into the matter it is a great deal. A man of God does that. "And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth" @1 Kings 17: 22 - 24. He is discerned to be a man of God. It is not put just that way as to Moses. The Spirit of God calls him a man of God, but here the beneficiary of the man of God calls him that; that is, the saints come to know by what a man does and is, that he is a man of God. What greater renown can one have? Not that you are aiming at that. It is what God is in His work, in His purpose, that such a man has before him. Still, the incidental result is great, and here the woman who got the benefit says, He is a man of God. The representation of God becomes fixed in people's minds in this way.
The third example is Elisha. What is to be observed here is not a widow, but a great woman, not great as in mere human parlance, but great in a true sense. Spiritually speaking she is the continuation of the widow who paid her debts from the proceeds of the oil and lived on the rest. The widow represents a believer living on the Spirit, the Spirit is life rightly understood, and makes us great in a moral sense, so that we are capable of seeing what is of God. It is a very great comfort that there are people in this world who can discern what is of God, and persons that are of God. The widow of Zarephath discerned by a signal miracle, not only that Elijah was a man of God, but that the word in his mouth was truth. Here we have a great woman,
{476}
and such a person is attested as having spiritual discernment. Many are regarded as great, but have they spiritual discernment? This woman's estimate of Elisha was not based on his miracles. Elisha had been passing by her house: "And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually" @2 Kings 4: 8,9. "An holy man of God", a new term in our subject, one that ought to affect us all, because holiness is very scarce. Righteousness is scarce, but holiness is more so. Elisha is designated by her "an holy man of God". One would covet to be known in that character. Moses is not said to be that, nor Elijah. Elisha is called it by this woman. Is her judgment right? That is to be considered. Is she affected merely by the presence of the man, such a great man, a man of great repute? That would be a poor thing. Men of repute are in demand. Is this woman just making much of a distinguished man? Evidently he is not affecting her naturally, she calls him *holy*, and "she constrained him to eat bread" @2 Kings 4: 8. That is, she is hospitable. To eat bread, not simply to spend an evening with them. The social side amongst us is to be watched; she had not that in mind. A man of reputation of this kind is sought after, and even for evening occasions. All no doubt may be well if under control, but all she constrained him to do was to eat bread. He needed support and she ministered support, a very great matter in the service of God. "And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread" @2 Kings 4: 8. He did not go beyond that.
I speak of this, because of the importance of limiting ourselves in the service of God; not allowing the social side of things to influence us; it would surely tend to damage. He turned in to eat bread; he did not go further than that, he is a man of God. And then she called her husband into the matter, very important in
{477}
these cases. She was evidently greater morally than her husband, which is humbling. She brought him into the matter and says to him, "Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God" @2 Kings 4: 9. She evidently perceived it by his deportment as passing by her house. He came in according to her constraint to eat bread, and did not go beyond that. Elisha was a *working* man, as every professed servant ought to be. Not that the Lord does not make allowance for the need of rest; He does. He said to His disciples, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while", @Mark 6: 31. He knows exactly what the strain of service is, and those served ought to take notice of this in regard of those who serve. It does not say that Elisha rested in this house, he just went in to eat bread.
Now she has a further thought -- hospitality in a fuller way. He is a safe man, one to be desired and trusted in the house, so she proposes that a little chamber should be made; it would be no social matter. You understand I am speaking in the spirit of things, not in the letter, for we have affections, and these affections in a spiritual way ought to have play, but here the thought was isolation, not exactly to bring him into the family. "Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither" @2 Kings 4: 10. Servants are very glad often to get that little chamber, and not to have any part in the social side of the household. She had right thoughts, she was a great woman, a remarkable woman. How touching it is that he passed by *continually*! Where was he going? The Lord regards His servants as those who have to go out and journey; it is a great privilege to do it; but He says of each, "he shall go no more at all out" @Revelation 3: 12. That is indeed to the overcomer in Philadelphia, in our own time; rest for ever is in view; so that, as Paul said, no servant should be lazily a charge to anybody. The time of rest is
{478}
coming, "he shall go no more at all out". This kind of hospitality brings about a living condition, results in better conditions in the locality wherever it is found. How much one sister can contribute to the living conditions in a locality! So that the outcome of this is life -- a son, a great increase in the truth. I mention that as an inducement for this kind of greatness to be developed in regard to the service of God.
Finally, coming to David in Nehemiah, the point as regards him is an entirely different phase of the matter. It is a question now of the service of God in song. This has come up lately, and the Spirit of God seems to stress it, how a man who is marked by care and consideration for God in these things is a man of God. So we have in the verse read: "And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward" @Nehemiah 12: 24. "The commandment", it is no optional matter, no question with him of learning to sing a few hymns, very often for personal enjoyment, the Lord with us doubtless, for we are to sing and make melody in our hearts to the Lord, but David commands it here, it is an imperative matter, and that is a word for the present time. The service of God is imperative. God would call us all into it, and so we have here "according to the commandment of David the man of God" @Nehemiah 12: 24. It is in connection with this that he is called a man of God, not as a military man or as a ruler; he is not called a man of God in these connections, but as promoting the service of God. How important this is, and God would lay it upon us, and so we find a further word in verse 36 in connection with the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem. It says: "with the musical instruments of David the man of God" @Nehemiah 12: 36. We are told about the musical instruments earlier, but David is not said to be a man of God there, the Spirit of God here crediting
{479}
him with this remarkable thought, he is a man of God in relation to musical instruments and in relation to the service of God generally. He commanded the service and prepared the musical instruments.
{480}
THE RELATION OF THE NEW COVENANT TO THE GOSPEL
@2 Corinthians 4: 1 - 18
J.T. What is in mind in the scripture read, is to consider in a general way the relation of the new covenant to the gospel as a whole, the gospel inclusive of the ministry of the assembly. The ground we are on as believers from among the gentiles is that of Romans, with the instruction in the epistles which speak of the assembly in its public aspect; and then Colossians and Ephesians which treat of our heavenly relation.
By the Lord's help it might be well to look into the relation of the new covenant to the general position of christianity presented in the gospel and in the ministry of the assembly. It is thought that an undue place is given to the new covenant in some of our minds. In making this suggestion, there is no thought at all of minimising the value of the new covenant, but yet it does not cover christianity in its full bearing. We have to reach christianity from the standpoint of Romans and the other scriptures as I have spoken of them. A correlative thought is that one aim in ministry, whether in the gospel or in the ministry of the assembly and the service of God, is that *all* saints should move together.
In the types, the feasts of Jehovah began with the passover. The ground was covered every year. In @Leviticus 23 there are seven feasts or convocations; in @Deuteronomy 16 there are three, the matter is compressed. The youngest and most inexperienced in Israel was to have part in the passover; and there was only one feast at a time, all Israel joining together in it, the most experienced and the most spiritual sharing with the least.
It is thought that the epistles to the Corinthians have this principle in mind, and that the Lord's supper, involving the new covenant, has to do with the initial
{481}
part of the service of God. It is hoped the brethren will be free to speak about the suggestion made, because there is a good deal of thought, and perhaps confusion, as to the new covenant *in its relation to the service of God*. This chapter is read to show that whilst the new covenant is treated of in chapter 3, the Spirit of God returns in chapter 4 to the main thought, the gospel in its full bearing.
P.H.H. Does the Lord Jesus fix the new covenant for us in the Supper by saying: "This cup is the new covenant in my blood"? @Luke 22: 20.
J.T. Yes. I think it ought to be borne in mind that its introduction was in a Jewish setting. Jewish feeling is in mind, as far as I can see, wherever the new covenant is mentioned; not that it does not bear on the gentiles, on ourselves, to fortify us against judaism, to help us to shut the door against the Jews. It is referred to more frequently in Hebrews than in all the other epistles, including even the gospels; and in the epistles to the Corinthians judaism is in mind; many of them had been Jews. The wording as to the Supper in 1 Corinthians varies from the gospels, connecting the cup formally with the memorial service in the assembly.
E.J.McB. Would you say a word as to the difference between the service of God prior to the Supper and after the Supper?
J.T. Well, taking on the types we begin with the passover, which is the most initial of the convocations. It was introduced in the first year; in the first month of the year. It contemplates Egyptian exercises, that is, exercises that come up as you are about to leave Egypt; and in view of young believers coming into fellowship now, relatively in such numbers, I believe the Lord would have us to make room for them, to give them to understand that in the beginning of our service Godward they have a real part, not only sitting there, but they have *some* experience that fits. The more spiritual we
{482}
are the more we shall get down to that; with joy too; for God intends that we should, as it were, go through the fundamentals of christianity in their bearing on the service of God, every week at least. The experience of going through with the younger brethren is intended to establish us *together*, also to freshen us. There will be room, of course, for the more spiritual measures, for God will not be robbed, nor will anyone who loves Him rob Him. Therefore there will be room for the greatest apprehension of God there may be, but the divine thought is that the very youngest should be included, and that we should go as far as we can with him. From that point of view we see that the *authority* of the Lord must have a great place; hence the Supper is called the *Lord's* supper, and however it is presented it is connected with Him; *He* is to be referred to in it.
P.H.H. So in connection with the cup, where it mentions the mew covenant, the Lord goes on to say: "This do in remembrance of me" @Luke 22: 19. Does that mean that while the new covenant is mentioned, the Person of the Lord Jesus is to be prominently before us?
J.T. Yes. That is how the facts are presented in the Scriptures; especially as it is called the Lord's supper, the Lord's table, and the cup of the Lord. We progress, as in Israel's case. The passover, the feast of unleavened bread, was followed, as seen in Deuteronomy, by the feast of Pentecost and the feast of tabernacles; each involving increased spirituality and intelligence, but whatever the degree of intelligence, an Israelite could have part, intelligent part, in the passover, for it alludes to the exodus from Egypt, and the exercises contingent thereon.
L.E.S. Would what you have in mind be seen in @1 Chronicles 25: 8, where we have the initial features of David's service? "They cast lots with one another over the charges, the small as well as the great, the teacher with the scholar", and again in @Deuteronomy 26: 13:
{483}
"the small as well as the great, according to their fathers¬ houses, for every gate".
J.T. That is a good scripture, bearing on what is before us, "the small as well as the great". So 1 Corinthians says, as regards matters of business, that the least esteemed in the assembly, not only the least, but the least *esteemed*, is capable of adjudicating on such matters.
F.S.M. In @Jeremiah 31: 34 the terms of the new covenant are given: "they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them". Is that confirmatory of what you are saying?
J.T. It is. We are thinking of the *least* of them now.
Ques. In @2 Corinthians 3:18, Paul says: "*we* all" -- the "we" is emphatic. It is that Paul would not leave any out?
J.T. Quite so. In the first letter it is expressly said that he determined to know nothing among them save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified; he indicates there how the most spiritual can take up that attitude, not overwhelming the young, but being alongside them as in the general position. "*We* all" is to encourage the young to have part in "looking on ... the glory of the Lord". The Lord is bringing in many young, and I believe we do well to think on those lines, so that they are given to understand, and to feel that they are of the whole; if it be the least, he is one nevertheless. The word in the new covenant is: "they shall all know me, from the least". That encourages the young believer, that he is one of the whole. The Lord said, as to the cup, "Drink ye all of it" @Matthew 26: 27.
A.M.P. Would the presenting of fourteen yearling lambs without blemish each day (@Numbers 29), indicate the carrying through of the passover? I was thinking of what you were saying as to the ground being covered from the passover onward.
J.T. Yes. You are stressing the *yearling* lambs, as linking with the passover lamb. There was diminution
{484}
of power, seen in the gradual reduction of the bullocks offered, but there was no reduction of the lambs -- thus the foundational condition remained.
Wm.C. Do we get the same idea in @2 Chronicles 35: 13,14: "They roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the consecrated things they boiled in pots ... and divided them speedily among all the children of the people. And afterwards they made ready for themselves and for the priests; because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were engaged in offering up the burnt-offerings and the fat until night"?
J.T. Yes. The place given to youth in the types of the Old Testament is remarkable. The result in recent times of the truth in young people is remarkable too; and they are to be *held* in the place of profession they have taken up; they are to be given to understand that they belong to the whole. As having the Spirit -- and they should not be breaking bread if they have not -- they are full grown. So that beginning thus, due allowance is made for the younger ones. In @Deuteronomy 16, after the three leading feasts are mentioned, the word is that all the males should appear before God thrice in the year, synchronising with the three feasts, but the stipulation is that none is to appear before Jehovah empty, so that God is not to be robbed. The male side would represent intelligence, richness of faith, and experience. Thus in them God has His full portion. These are the two thoughts exercising one -- provision for the young, that all should understand that they have the same status as the old in the general position, according to the passages read from 1 Chronicles, and that they have part, therefore, in the service of God.
Ques. Would Paul be making room for the young brethren when he says to Timothy: "Let no man despise thy youth"? @1 Timothy 4: 12.
J.T. That passage, of course, is for the youth themselves. They should see to it that they are not to be despised. It was for Timothy to see to that, that
{485}
his youth was not hindering his ministry. Therefore he would be grave, sober and balanced even beyond his years.
Ques. Is Joseph's cup in Benjamin's sack a kindred thought?
J.T. That is right, because Benjamin there represents youthfulness. In the history of the testimony in the last thirty or forty years, we have passed through the patriarchal period, when the elder brothers unduly controlled things. Not that I am accusing anyone, but it is a fact, and the Lord is helping us in the Corinthian epistles, where eldership is not mentioned. As a matter of fact, the Corinthians could not have been more than two years old spiritually. Joseph represents youth in patriarchal times. He was seventeen years of age when his conscience was tried by evil conversation. That is a fine example for a young christian, that you turn away from damaging conversation. He reported it to his father. There was one whose youth could not be despised. He is acting like a man. It brought him into reproach, of course, but his youthfulness did not discredit him.
F.S.M. The thought that God is not robbed is seen in the children crying in the temple: "Hosanna to the Son of David" @Matthew 21: 15. The Lord defended them and said: "Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?" @Matthew 21: 16.
J.T. I am glad you bring that in now, because in a sense Matthew is a children's gospel: it is not a Sunday-school gospel, but it is a gospel which makes much of children in relation to *the greatest things*. Christ Himself is viewed as a little Child (@Matthew 2: 13), not a babe. He was a Babe, but He is spoken of as a little Child and placed *before* His mother, showing His personal distinction; faith recognised it. Then Rachel's wail is introduced, as showing how faith apprehended the destruction of the children: "Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are
{486}
not" @Matthew 2: 18. We want them to be in their place according to the work of God in them, having full status, as equal to it. So the Lord likens christians, I mean His disciples, to babes, viewing them in that infantile way, in view of the greatest things. He says to the Father: "thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight" @Matthew 11: 25,26. These scriptures are important. They are to impress us with what childhood is according to God, and its ability to take in divine things. So in chapter 18 the Lord calls a little child to Him, and sets him in the midst of the brethren. That is, he was given a place with His disciples. And the Lord says of the little ones: "their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven" @Matthew 18: 10; and He warns anyone who despises the little ones. So in the passage alluded to they take on the highest note *of the moment*; "Hosanna to the Son of David". It is what the blind men had said earlier, and it resounded as the Lord was entering Jerusalem. It was a recognition of what was due to Christ at that particular time. Others were not ready to render it, but the children were.
J.J. Why is Rachel's wail, in @Jeremiah 31, the new covenant chapter?
J.T. Well, it is what we were saying. That it comes down to us from that chapter of Jeremiah is not without significance. It fits in with the youthful work of God along with us in the service.
G.C. When David told Ittai to pass over, all the men and all the little ones passed over with him. Would they be prepared to suffer with the older ones?
J.T. Just so. The Scriptures abound with allusions to this, and the question is whether the new covenant has not them in mind particularly, to assure their hearts, for the idea of covenant is assurance, confirmation. A spiritual man who knows God does not need God to make a covenant with him. The spiritual have
{487}
confidence in God, but young people have not, and they need confirmation. Of course the most spiritual of the saints values the new covenant. Paul says, "he that establishes us with you ... is God" @2 Corinthians 1: 21.
A.J.G. Is that why it is so closely linked with the gospel?
J.T. Yes. In speaking of his service in the gospel the apostle brings it in here parenthetically. He refers to "commendatory letters to you", as if the Corinthians were questioning him, and in speaking of them as his letter, being the fruit of his work, he says, God has made us 'new covenant ministers', as the margin reads; referring to the *character in his ministry*. He is endeavouring to bring the saints in Corinth along with him. All of them, we might say, were young christians. No doubt there were old brothers from other parts, but generally the Corinthians were young christians, and the apostle's effort is to carry them with him. So, as already said, in chapter 1 of the epistle: "he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God" @2 Corinthians 1: 21. Paul is putting himself alongside the young christians, and saying God establishes him and them together. God is doing that, and has anointed us too, and sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
Ques. Do you judge the bearing of the new covenant in that way is to put the saints on right terms with one another and with the Lord?
J.T. Yes; not only the elder brethren. They come in too. The new covenant ought to bear on them, but let us be sure that we have all the youth with us, that they are not left; although they may be "babes" they are "in Christ" -- thus possessing full christian status.
Rem. In Exodus Moses sent the youths, and they offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
J.T. A very important scripture, bearing on what we are saying. They are priests really.
{488}
Ques. Is liberty presented as the end reached through the Lord's service in that relation? Does the new covenant take us much beyond the thought of liberty?
J.T. That is what is in mind in chapter 3; in truth the apostle is speaking about his own service. The Corinthians questioning whether he should have a letter of commendation, he does not scorn their attitude, but shows what a place they have in his heart, and he says: I would like to have the same place in your heart. "*Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us" @2 Corinthians 3: 2. Everyone of them had a place in his heart, and he would get down with them, as a father with children, and speak to them according to what they could understand, in order to guide them into greater things.
Ques. Are you suggesting that we should come back to the passover so as to include the young people?
J.T. Well, the passover, as the first of the feasts, is a type of the Lord's supper in the sense of the *beginning* of the service of God. They had a yearly course of feasts; we have a weekly course. We go over the whole ground of the service of God, at least professedly, every week. The Lord's supper being the introduction of the service makes room for the youngest, the smallest growth in the meeting. He can join in that, as of old the youngest Israelite could join in the thought of the passover lamb. It would touch his heart, the passover lamb being in the house four days before it was slain. So Paul says: "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us". "The feast" (@1 Corinthians 5: 8), is that of unleavened bread, but the passover, as being the *first* feast of the year, corresponds to the Lord's supper, in that sense. The passover and unleavened bread refer to the moral condition of the saints.
Ques. Does the passover come before us at the breaking of bread?
{489}
J.T. What corresponds with it *as a memorial* does: "This is my body, which is for you", the Lord says, "this do in remembrance of me" @Luke 22: 19. That surely appeals to the smallest growth in the meeting, if he is alert at all. It is "for you".
Ques. "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us" @1 Corinthians 5: 7. Should not that have effect previous to the coming together for the Supper?
J.T. Well, chapter 5, which you are quoting, especially the feast of unleavened bread, refers to what should go on continually. "Our passover", there is a touching word, bearing on our affections. It is to affect us in our condition and walk: the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, on our side, in the keeping of the feast, is the fulness of it. "Christ our passover" is the death of Christ in a peculiarly spiritual way, in view of the assembly's public position and service. It is to be before us all the time. The other side is the unleavened bread, which is also to be continuous. So that we come together as already partaking of this feast. It is a question of our practical state. Therefore Matthew and Mark present the introduction of the Lord's supper *when the disciples were eating*. We come together in that sense as eating already, and then the Lord, as presented in His supper, touches us; and it ought to touch the youngest christian.
E.G. At the institution of the Supper the Lord said in connection with the cup: "this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" @1 Corinthians 11: 25. Has that a special bearing?
J.T. It has. "This do" alludes to what He did Himself -- the giving of thanks. Then the intervening clause, "as often as ye shall drink it", is a characterising clause. It is to bring in the thought of *drinking* before the thought of the memorial. He says nothing about *eating* the bread as broken. "This do", refers to what He did, not to the eating, but when He comes to the cup He introduces a clause governing it, as if we need
{490}
to understand the drinking to make us satisfied and restful in the position. "This do", was what He did. He did not drink it. Anybody looking at the passage will see from the punctuation, that the drinking is a subjective thought introduced; not stated elsewhere, but evidently having a refreshing effect in the saints.
Ques. Have you any thought as to why, in Matthew and Mark, it is: "This is my blood, that of the new covenant", why the blood is brought in before the new covenant?
J.T. Well, it would lay a little more stress on His blood, and that certainly ought to be in the hearts and consciences of the youth. It ought to be there, because many partake of the Lord's supper whose consciences are not satisfied. A purged conscience is always needed. We are to "approach ... sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience", @Hebrews 10: 22.
Ques. Does the word, "When ye come together, ... tarry one for another" @1 Corinthians 11: 33, bear on this?
J.T. I think it does. The idea is that we are to move together. There is no licence for characteristically late-comers to the meetings; but we should move together -- in *heart*, not merely as literally present.
Ques. Referring again to @Deuteronomy 16 and @1 Corinthians 5, did I understand you to say that the passover is a part in the service of God?
J.T. I am using the passover only as a figure of what we have in the Lord's supper. In the old economy it referred to the beginnings of the service spiritually, the exodus out of Egypt. It corresponds with the Lord's supper *in this sense*.
Rem. So that the new covenant and the ministry of it would relate to the beginnings of christianity.
J.T. Quite so, but then you will notice that even the passover involved that those partaking in it were not to be empty. Every feast required that the males should not come there empty, so everyone is obligated to have something to offer.
{491}
Ques. Each of these feasts is said to be in the place which Jehovah will choose. Would that have a bearing on the assembly as convened?
J.T. That is right -- assembly principles, all the rights of God recognised. So that the Lord's supper cannot be partaken of merely because certain brethren are together. Divine principles must govern them. Schismatic or sectarian conditions forbid it; the spirit of the Lord's supper abhors them.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that the new covenant is intended to liberate all the wealth there is in a spiritual way?
J.T. That is what I was thinking, and then, priestly intelligence also being there, we know what to do. One might think of bringing in *everything* mentioned relative to the body of Christ, in relation to the breaking of the bread -- the early part of the Lord's supper, but the true priest would say: No, we must reserve the more spiritual features -- seen in Ephesians and Colossians -- for their own place in the service; we must pursue the line prescribed. Do not bring in Pentecost wording into the feast of the passover.
P.H.H. You mean that the new covenant liberates us for the higher levels of the service of God; but do I gather that you would not dwell much on the new covenant *itself*; that is to say, the terms of it as given to us in several parts of Scripture?
J.T. I do not think we should go beyond its relative significance in the service of God. The love of God comes in later when in the service we come to *God*. @Exodus 19: 17 says: "Moses brought the people out ... to meet with God". There is only one title for God in our language -- God, the Father; there is only one in the Greek also. In the Hebrew there were several words each denoting a certain thought. We have one appellation, but we can use it in the service in relation to whatever may be suitably brought in. We can speak to God of *His Love*, which includes the new covenant.
{492}
We can speak to Him about the covenant, but then we are speaking to Him about His love; normally Romans brings in the love of God in its proper christian setting. The covenant introduced into the Lord's supper has, I believe, a Jewish bearing. It shuts out what is called *religion*, whether judaism or what answers to it in christendom today.
Ques. In what light are you thinking of our being brought out to meet God?
J.T. In the full sense of what God is to us. The gospel of God is concerning His Son -- that is not *the covenant God*. It is God as presented and known through the gospel. Romans opens it up, and without any formal reference to the new covenant.
Ques. Would the covenant involve the settlement of all moral questions, leaving us free to go on to what is positive?
J.T. Well, just so -- forgiveness of sins. According to the actual covenant, that is what is meant. The work of Christ is really wider even in its moral bearing than that.
Rem. Joseph's cup led to the adjustment of his brethren, so that they should be with him.
J.T. The cup brought out moral questions; these being settled, he reveals himself to his brethren. But then, even although the cup is said to be the new covenant in Christ's blood, you cannot say there is not more in Christ's blood than that. Look at the scope of the blood of Christ. Not that you would minimise the covenant, but it is evidently brought in for a particular purpose; it testifies to Christ's love in effecting what the new covenant presents, which, as already said, liberates and satisfies in a holy way, as over against judaism, but the blood of Christ goes beyond this.
Rem. "This is he that came by water and blood" @1 John 5: 6 would involve more than the covenant.
J.T. It does; it involves redemption in its whole bearing -- all that is secured by it and based on it.
{493}
E.J.McB. The blood of sprinkling is not just the same as the blood of the covenant?
J.T. It has a wider significance. @Hebrews 9 and 10, while including the new covenant, speak of the blood of Christ in a fuller way.
N.K.McC. We are accustomed to speak of covenant relationship with God. Is that a correct term?
J.T. In the sense in which it is generally used, I doubt it. The covenant was not made with us. These two epistles are addressed to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth" @1 Corinthians 1: 2. There is no covenant made with the assembly of God. If the new covenant is brought in, it is to help in the truth, that we might be in the assembly according to God. It augments the position, and especially in regard to persons who need confirmation. That the general idea of covenant, as between God and His people, exists, I fully believe, but it is based on the *typical* teaching of Scripture, especially Israel's position in the wilderness. God would be in relation with them, on certain terms, and they *committed* themselves to Him on this ground. In christianity God has come out in Christ, in fulness of righteousness and love, and believers commit themselves to Him in baptism and the Lord's supper.
E.J.McB. In your mind, the covenant is to get rid of all kinds of religious feelings.
J.T. It bears on that. I do not, of course, say that is all, but it is so especially in epistles that treat of Jewish christians, and they were at Corinth, we know. "Are they Israelites?" @2 Corinthians 11: 22. He is dealing with that element because it was damaging the saints.
Rem. The introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God would be, for us, God *the* Father.
J.T. Quite so; only the relationship of Father to the believer is really not seen in Hebrews, save as the Father of spirits. We are not set in relation to the Father according to Hebrews. We are on a comparatively low ground, and yet most important ground, especially
{494}
in these days when surrounded with so much judaism. Take any of the sects. They are encased by judaism, and the thought of the new covenant is to force all that out, to shut it all out from our affections in relation to the Lord's supper.
P.H.H. So John does not speak of the covenant, but of the doors being shut for fear of the Jews.
J.J. Would you distinguish between the covenant and the love of God? Many of us have regarded those two expressions as more or less synonymous.
J.T. If we look into the references to the love of God in Scripture, we shall conclude that it goes beyond the new covenant. It includes it, but goes beyond it. There is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which cannot be limited to the new covenant. "God so loved the world" @John 3: 16; there is no covenant in that. And many other such expressions: "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins", @1 John 4: 10. That is a basic statement, involving the new covenant, but going further. Then we come to the Father's love. The Lord says, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them". @John 17: 26. That is not covenant love. That is supreme love and it is to be in our hearts.
Ques. Is it right to distinguish between the covenant and the spirit of the covenant?
J.T. It is the new covenant in Christ's blood in the terms of the Lord's supper; but in the second epistle, we are "new covenant ministers", the apostle says, "not of letter, but of spirit" @2 Corinthians 3: 6. If he were a new covenant minister in "letter", he would be just speaking of the forgiveness of sins, and God putting His laws in the hearts and minds of Israel and Judah, but he is not limiting himself to that. He is treating of christianity, and bringing in the new covenant in the spirit of it, and he says, the Lord is the Spirit of it; hence the suitableness of it in the Lord's supper. "The Lord is
{495}
the Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 3: 17) is evidently because *authority* is necessary in the effectuation of the new covenant.
F.H. In @2 Kings 4 the woman stood in the *doorway*. Do you think that is a kind of picture of what you have in mind in view of going on to sonship? Would you connect that thought with the new covenant? Is it in view of shutting out judaism? It is a question of embracing a son after that; but she stood in the doorway.
J.T. That is suggestive, especially in view of the fact that the Shunammite was a "wealthy woman", meaning that she is great spiritually, because it follows the pouring out into vessels until the vessels are filled. The creditor's claim had been fully met, and legal demand should not again exist, for the Spirit is life in view of righteousness. Then she has to wait for her son, but she is a woman of progress, indeed she represents spiritual progress. She is to have a son in due course, but see what kind of person she was practically, how she took notice of Elisha, calling him a holy man of God.
Rem. So that we cannot limit love to any particular presentation of it, which is perhaps what we have been in danger of.
J.T. Well, these two epistles are addressed to the assembly of God which is in Corinth. He is speaking to His own assembly.
A.J.G. So that the apostle at the beginning of this epistle says: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Corinthians 1: 3); and later, "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not" (@1 Corinthians 11: 31).
Ques. Is it striking that in chapter 3, after speaking of being a minister, he makes no reference to God as such, but speaks of the Lord? He does not speak further of God until the next chapter.
J.T. That is right. He is really dealing with this one point. It is a sort of diversion. He is speaking of his
{496}
own ministry in a general way, and he refers to letters of commendation, and introduces the new covenant, for it was a part of his ministry, which fact should enhance him in the eyes of the Corinthians. Then he enlarges on the covenant, reaching on to the glory of the Lord, bringing the Corinthians into it; saying "we all". In chapter 4 he comes back to himself again and says: "Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them" @2 Corinthians 4: 1 - 4. The apostle is back on the gospel ground again. It is a question of *his* gospel and what it was. It is the world-wide gospel he has in mind. It might be said, that he brings in references to the covenant, because he alludes to "the face of Jesus Christ", but that is only to bring out how Scripture is available to us in our ministry. He refers to God causing the light to shine out of darkness -- the first chapter of the Bible, He draws on the Scriptures, but he is really dealing with christianity, with what belongs to the assembly. Therefore he goes on to the fulness of the gospel, "the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ"; and that has shone in our hearts "for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" @2 Corinthians 4: 4,6. Then he refers to himself as having "this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God" @2 Corinthians 4: 7. As Gideon's pitchers were broken the light shone, so it was with Paul. Later he speaks about new creation and reconciliation, which are not properly covenant subjects, but essentially belonging to christianity.
{497}
Rem. "This treasure" is not only the ministry of the covenant, but the gospel of which he had been speaking.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Is there anything greater than the gospel?
J.T. In a way, no. It is the gospel of God concerning His Son. Paul makes it clear that is what he preached, he and Timotheus and Silvanus. Connected with this is the ministry of the mystery. Besides being a new covenant minister, Paul was the minister of reconciliation and of the mystery.
C.G. When Moses came down from the mountain, it says that the skin of his face shone. The others were afraid to draw near, and Moses calls to them to secure their confidence. They came to him and then it says, Moses talked to them. Is that a suggestion that there was something more, something greater, to open up to them?
J.T. Just so. When he went in to Jehovah he took off the veil. That was pointing to the recovery of the Jews at the end. We have this alluded to in @2 Corinthians 3: 16: "when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away". But the apostle is showing clearly that he has christianity in mind, and he reverts to his own position as a minister (chapter 4) and shows how he moved; what had characterised him, and leads on to the thought of looking at what is unseen and eternal. That goes beyond looking at "the glory of the Lord". He is looking at what is unseen, the general thought of what is spiritual and eternal. He speaks of "an eternal weight of glory", which is more than the glory of the new covenant.
E.C.B. Would it be right to turn from the Lord to the Father?
J.T. I think the normal course in assembly service is that when the Lord's place is clearly recognised, and His relations with the assembly, He would bring us to God. Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God. In assembly we ought to have to do
{498}
with God. It is God who speaks to us in these epistles, speaks to His assembly though His servant. So it seems as if, as we are brought to God in His service, we can speak to Him about the covenant, but, of course, we can speak to Him about His love including the covenant. The Father's love is a greater thought, and then our relations with the Father as sons.
Rem. @Colossians 2: 12: "through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead". You have spoken of the faith position in view of entering into what is spiritual. It is God there, is it not?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Would you say a little more about Moses leading the people out to meet with God? In what relation would we stand at that point?
J.T. Well, we are led out of the camp. I suppose the allusion would be to our public position, the camp being this. The Lord's supper does not go beyond our public position. But when we are led out to meet with God what is spiritual and unseen is implied -- "God is a spirit". Of course, the Lord is also a Spirit, the Spirit of the covenant, but the Lord says, "a spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see me having" @Luke 24: 39. God is expressly spoken of as a Spirit. As brought to God we can speak to Him about the covenant, not forgetting that it is God's love that we speak of, the covenant being included, as already said.
Ques. Would you say a little about the word: "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ"? @2 Corinthians 4: 6.
J.T. That is a gospel statement. The face of Jesus Christ is that in which the glory shines, but it shines in our hearts for its shining forth. The apostle is alluding to his own service in the gospel.
J.J. Why does he change from the gospel to the suffering, the dying of Jesus? Why does he enlarge on the sufferings in connection with the ministry of the gospel in this chapter?
{499}
J.T. It is an allusion, I suppose, to Gideon's pitchers, another illustration of how the Scriptures yield to us in our service. The new covenant is one augmentary thought; Gideon's pitchers is another without being named. The torches were to be put in these pitchers, and at a given moment the pitchers were to be broken. When they were broken the light shone. If "our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed" @2 Corinthians 5: 1, that brings us to eternity, but meanwhile the breaking of the earthen vessels means the shining out of the light of the gospel.
Ques. I would like to ask a further question as to the place God has. I refer to @Exodus 19. Would that be, for us, that God is an Object, as One who has drawn near to us, and so we speak to Him in that light, while the thought of the family is further on?
J.T. Yes. We approach Him from the Lord's supper. You remember that in the type the injunction was that no one but Moses should come near, and that Moses should go down and see that no one broke through. That was the first thought. Then God says: Aaron can come with you. Then later: Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and seventy of the elders; so there is a gradual increase of those who ascend. That helps in the understanding of the service of God. So they went up and "they saw the God of Israel". How different from the thunderings and lightnings and barriers so that not even a beast could pass! They "saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone ... and upon the nobles ... he laid not his hand" @Exodus 24: 9 - 11, indicating that as they advanced upwards they are more dignified, and more in liberty. They are formed there; they ate and drank, and He did not lay His hand on them.
L.E.S. Would Peter in his first epistle have this in mind? -- "Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" @1 Peter 3: 18, and then in chapter 4: "If any man speak ... as the oracles of God; if any man minister ... as of the ability
{500}
which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen". @1 Peter 4: 11.
J.T. All that fits with what we have been saying, so that Exodus proves invaluable as typical teaching as to the service of God -- the mediator's part first, and then he and the seventy going up with Aaron and his sons; and then Moses called up higher still, Jehovah saying to him, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there" @Exodus 24: 12. It is not said that Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and the seventy go up to the *mountain*; the mountain is not mentioned. It is a *spiritual* ascent for us, but the Mediator goes higher. It is Christ's fixed position in relation to the service of God, but *Joshua* is with him.
E.J.McB. The peculiar references to the *Lord*, "the Lord's supper", "the Lord's table", "the Lord's cup", are all elements that are conducive to this spiritual rise in the soul of the saints.
J.T. You may say: I have no need to go through that again; but you have, everyone of us needs to, to keep ourselves fresh. We need to go through from the passover to the feast of tabernacles, and as we pass each point we know what to say. The priestly element in us enables us to know what to do.
Ques. After partaking of the cup and speaking of the covenant, there is a wide field opened to us, including the glories of the Mediator.
J.T. If the speakers, as priests, have wealth, they know just where to bring it in, and be brief in bringing it in. We may go from one thing to another, because there is great variety. And another thing to bear in mind is that the marital thought is there from the beginning. Zipporah is brought to Moses just as the covenant is introduced. We have other types of the assembly, beginning with Eve, which fit in later, so the marital thought runs right through to union. That involves great richness and felicity and glory, so that
{501}
we are joyful. In the last feast in Deuteronomy the people were to be "wholly joyful". The service of God requires spiritual joy.
L.D.M. In @Deuteronomy 26 the offerer brings the basket of first-fruits and the priest takes it out of his hand and sets it down before the altar of Jehovah. Is that the idea of bringing in what is right at the right time?
J.T. Yes. You will observe that the priest is in charge of it, and the offerer speaks of the basket to the priest; he says very little about it, but goes right back in the history of the people, goes over the whole ground from the beginning. The basket is not touched yet. Then he comes back to the basket, and sets it down before Jehovah, and the priest is not in evidence any more. The man himself is the priest; he is a worshipper, but quite able to go back to the very beginning of his ancestors. That is the principle; we begin with the Lord's supper, and go on to the greatest things -- that is, what belongs to the land.
Ques. Would that be the purpose of God?
J.T. Well, it is the *full* thought, the enlargement of blessing with which we are blessed. That is the character of the feast of tabernacles, what we are as the subjects of the work of God. So that although we go back to the beginning, God is not robbed; we present the best we have to Him.
W.C. Is it significant that in the feast of tabernacles as in Deuteronomy there is no remembrance, they were to be wholly joyful, there is no going back?
J.T. In the feast of tabernacles, which contemplates the harvest reaped and gathered in, we reach the full thought. In the feast of Pentecost there is no time limit, meaning that in the power of the Spirit we may enter into the heavenlies and enjoy heavenly things. The Spirit opens the heavenly door, and causes us to understand that there is no limit there; we may stay there. We are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the
{502}
heavenlies, and we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.
P.H.H. Does that mean that as brought out of the camp *to God* we have great spiritual expansion in the service of God before us?
J.T. Quite so; so it is not said that the seventy elders and Aaron and his sons came down. God would say, I am pleased with you up here; He did not lay His hands upon the nobles of the children of Israel, we are told.
E.J.McB. You remain up there in spirit, but leave as to the body.
Ques. In connection with going back to the beginning, you would not encourage us to delay the breaking of bread, but rather that we should be in a state to take it up immediately?
J.T. It is the beginning of the service. We come together having it immediately before us.
{503}
THE GLORY OF THE LORD
@2 Corinthians 3: 5 - 18; @2 Peter 1: 16 - 18
J.T. What is in mind is to look into the subject of the glory of the Lord. 1 and 2 Corinthians speak of it; they speak much of the glory of God too, but the first epistle speaks about the Lord as the Lord of glory, meaning that He has in His hand the administration of glory. The second epistle speaks of His own glory as Lord, and in connection with the new covenant. The epistle also speaks about the giving of the saints as connected with this glory, "the glory of the Lord himself". Those who carried the money of the saints to dispense it were said to be "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory" @2 Corinthians 8: 23.
So it is thought the Lord would help us in confining ourselves as much as possible to this point of the glory of the Lord, and incidentally to see that His supper enters into it; the new covenant, of course, entering into the Lord's supper also as given to us in the first epistle. That is connected with His glory. Then the passage in Peter gives us His glory as *Son of God*, which is a somewhat advanced thought on the glory of the Lord. The instruction we have as to the Lord's supper in 1 Corinthians connects it entirely with the Lord Himself; and Canticles in the Old Testament helps to fill out the service in connection with the Lord's supper, for it is a question there of reciprocated affection typically between Christ and the saints. There is hardly a reference to God or Jehovah in the book.
F.I. What connection has glory in relation to the Son of God with the glory of the Lord in Corinthians?
J.T. We are on the heavenly line when we reach the former title. The allusion is to the mount of transfiguration, and Peter gives us his view of it in his last epistle, significantly saying, "he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered
{504}
to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom *I* have found my delight; and this voice *we* heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain" @2 Peter 1: 17,18. It is a link with *heaven*, so that as entering into the service of God, it is an advance on the glory of the Lord in our passage in 2 Corinthians, which is an administrative thought here on earth.
A.M. Would the sight of the glory of the Lord lead on normally to the second part, the heavenly side, and would the thought in the mountain suggest the glory of sonship?
J.T. That is what I thought. Peter mentions the voice from heaven as the glory, he has this in mind besides that which appeared in the Lord on the mountain. The Lord was transfigured personally before them; this in itself was glory. It was not conferred; it was of Himself. We are changed as beholding His glory, but the glory on the mount of transfiguration is of Himself, and then there is the glory that is seen in Moses and Elias; they appeared "in glory" too. So the scene is glorious before the voice from heaven comes, but it is the voice from heaven that Peter alludes to especially, the heavenly side of the position; the acknowledgment of His sonship from heaven.
G.C.S. Does "glory to glory" contemplate this? Does the end reached suggest sonship, or is it just liberty?
J.T. It is a question of what "the Lord the Spirit" is doing for us. It is the glory of the Lord we are looking at, which includes His effectuation of the covenant, not only making it a fact, but applying it; making it effective. Of course He made it a fact by dying, but the Lord of glory alludes more to the effectuation of it in us.
Ques. Would that be especially at the Supper, or is it confined to the Supper?
J.T. It is seen there more especially, but I would not limit it to that, because in principle the Lord's
{505}
ministry in this respect is always current as He has opportunity, but it is dependent on our beholding the glory of the Lord, which would be especially at the Supper. The Lord is always ready as we are engaged with Himself. That is glory from this point of view. It is confined to the glory of the Lord here, and He is ready to act upon us. The change is "by the Lord the Spirit". Looking at the glory will not in itself cause the change; transformation is an act of Christ as Lord, but "the Lord the Spirit".
L.D.M. Two men appearing with Him -- would that suggest formation? Two men who were Moses and Elias.
J.T. Yes. Appearing in glory implies this. They were men like ourselves; but they were men of great experience with God, who had to do with Jehovah in the Old Testament in a striking way; men who took on glory and became formed in it. It was said of Moses, "the form of Jehovah doth he behold" @Numbers 12: 8. They "appeared in glory". Peter leaves that part out, but Luke mentions it. Peter confines himself to the glory of sonship; "he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom *I* have found my delight; and this voice *we* heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain" @2 Peter 1: 17,18. So Peter has sonship in mind, acknowledged in this remarkable way.
Ques. I suppose it is general in @2 Corinthians 3 -- "we all" beholding?
J.T. Yes, it is what we *all* do. The brethren will all be helped if we think first of the glory of the Lord -- the *Lord* first. "The Lord is that Spirit", and then "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, looking on the glory of the Lord ..." @2 Corinthians 3: 18, and then the act of transforming by the Lord the Spirit. So the title Lord as associated with the Spirit in the passage is very striking.
{506}
Ques. Is this to bring about suitability to the Son, so that we can take account of the glory of the Son of God?
J.T. I think so. In fact the whole scene is glory as we sit down in assembly. Even in leaving our houses to reach the assembly we are glorious. *It is not, from degradation to glory*, but from "glory to glory". Glory is one great idea "in assembly"; and so the anointing, which applies to us at all times, appears specially as we move towards the assembly. It is the place where God's "glory dwelleth" (@Psalm 26: 8), and you feel the necessity as drawing near to appear in glory, as Moses and Elias. But then there is more, it is "from glory to glory", because there is increasing depth and density of glory. The apostle speaks in the next chapter of "weight of glory" @2 Corinthians 4: 17, so there is progression in the thought.
Ques. Would you call it conferred glory on those who behold?
J.T. It is not put in that way; but in the sense of being taken on, being changed. It is really what transpires in our minds and affections; it is not superficial glory; it is substantial. If you could see the saints in this state of things, it is all glory, solid glory as it were; that is, all our faculties are glorious; reflected of course in our countenances and in what we say.
G.C.S. It is consummated in the holy city coming down, being four-square, solid, having the glory of God.
Ques. Does @2 Chronicles 9 suggest that thought, when the queen of Sheba came to Solomon? Scripture says that, "all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold ... silver was not of the least account" @2 Chronicles 9: 20.
J.T. She was affected by what she saw. There was substantial glory there, not mere tinsel. All the wealth of the world, viewed in that sense, contributed to it.
F.W.W. Do you connect the ministry of righteousness with the glory of the Lord? That seems to have a prominent place.
{507}
J.T. That is included. The parenthesis contrasts the ministry of Moses with the ministry of the new covenant now, widening out, in the thought of the ministry of the Spirit, to the full truth of the gospel. "But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, a glory which is annulled; how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit subsist in glory?" @2 Corinthians 3: 7,8. "Subsist in glory" is an intensified thought; it is not shallow or superficial. And so it goes on, "For if the ministry of condemnation be glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory" @2 Corinthians 3: 9. It is an intensified thought.
F.W.W. You were mentioning the coming from our houses as the initial step to the assembly, that we should come as expressing glory, the glory of righteousness.
J.T. I think it is well to notice that, it is a very practical allusion. First we have the "ministry of the Spirit" in verse 8, and then the "ministry of righteousness" in verse 9, and again "that which abides subsists in glory" in verse 11; so that the question of righteousness certainly enters into it. It is not simply that one is practically righteous. I will be so, as having righteousness ministered to me, but the ministry of righteousness means, I suppose, that one is substantially that, and not merely legally so -- the man *is* that.
F.W.W. So the thought of glory would be what is in the man shining out?
J.T. Quite so. Abraham's faith was reckoned to him as righteousness, that is the gospel through faith, but the ministry of the Spirit goes beyond that. It affects the person and changes him so that he is that, he is righteous in that sense. Well, you can see how all that implies dignity in the saints, and the thought comes specially into the mind, as you move towards the assembly, for you are going to the place of glory. "In
{508}
his temple doth every one say, Glory!" @Psalm 29:9, and you want to be in suitable dress for that occasion. It requires it more than any other meeting we attend. @Psalm 45: 7 tells us that Christ "loved righteousness" and so it enters into what we are saying. "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions" @Psalm 45: 7. So you feel in approaching the assembly that is what has to be in mind. The dress of the saints in which we appear must include all these things. It is well to be practical, and to think of how we are as we leave our houses. In 1 Corinthians the apostle says in regard of the collection, that we should put by at home on the first day of the week. That is an element that goes with us. There is glory in that. Everything that reflects Christ in the saints is glory. So that in proceeding to the assembly you have suitable dress. "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness" @Psalm 132: 9, Scripture says; and sitting down we are glorious. All these elements we have been speaking of are reflected in us, and therefore it is not from degradation to glory; there is glory in our houses really. Of old, Israel were to bring the two wave-loaves, baken with leaven, out of their houses, but to be a meat-offering. Although in a mixed condition and coming out of our houses we are to be glorious, because we have annulled by the Spirit the action of sin, involving self-judgment.
F.W.W. This feature of righteousness must be taken account of.
J.T. You feel the necessity of it -- where God dwells. The brazen altar is that principle -- a question of righteousness.
G.C.S. When Jacob was moving towards the house of God he saw the necessity for suitable conditions in removing the idols.
J.T. How could he go up glorious otherwise? But he did go up glorious and God owned him. When God had named him earlier He would not tell Jacob
{509}
His name, for Jacob was not equal to it; but the very thought of Bethel causes him to put away the idols, and Jehovah came down and stood beside him, not as he was at Bethel at the first, though the Lord was there, but now He comes down indicating that there is suitable dress in Jacob.
Rem. "All glorious is the king's daughter within; her clothing is of wrought gold". @Psalm 45: 13.
J.T. That goes further, but shows what we are moving on to.
W.E.M. Does it depend on what our minds are occupied with, and does that lead in the direction in which our faces are set?
J.T. A righteous man's face reflects righteousness, he is transformed; things are all settled. As it says, in the earlier part of this epistle, "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" @2 Corinthians 1: 21. Well, that makes a very great change in us, as compared with persons who are not righteous.
F.I. Is the glory of the Lord connected with Him as the One who came out, so that what was in the heart of God in regard of His love could be brought out on a righteous basis?
J.T. That is what I think is in mind, that He is doing it. It is presented here as His doing and as the Lord; not as Christ, nor as Jesus, but as the Lord and as the Lord the Spirit, a combination of thought that is unique.
A.M. Is your thought that our houses and we ourselves should correspond with what is now immediately before us in moving towards the assembly?
J.T. That is the thought. As I said, the type contemplates what goes on in the houses of the saints, and they bring it with them. It implies that sin is there, but rendered inactive, in keeping with the manner of the incoming of the Spirit which was with cloven tongues as of fire; to protect Himself, as it were. As
{510}
over against how He came on Christ as a dove, He comes to us in terms which indicate protection of Himself, so that we are not out of keeping with that, and we come out of our houses in that way. So it raises a practical question as to whether we are in righteousness and whether we walk to the assembly in dignity and sit down in dignity. So it is "from glory to glory", but glory with us in that sense is to be always. The position of a believer is never other than glorious in some sense.
G.C.S. Is it seen with Lydia? The Lord opened her heart and then she opened and controlled her home.
J.T. How glorious she was! The Lord had opened her heart, it was an act of administration. He was changing her, but to attend to the things spoken by Paul. You can see how that would be glorious and would involve more glory in her. Then she opened her house.
L.D.M. Should what is seen in Lydia be characteristic of us? It would preserve the atmosphere and give room for the liberty brought in by the Spirit of the Lord.
J.T. Anyone who thinks about it can see that the sitting down of the saints in the assembly is glory, but there is a greater glory ahead of us and we are ready to take it on, so that the Lord is there with us as He comes in, and it is "from glory to glory". He is preparing us for greater things all the time.
Rem. So we come up with right thoughts of God and Christ and the saints, and now the Supper itself would concentrate our hearts and minds upon the glory of the Lord, especially in the cup?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. We are ready for that, and the ministry of righteousness would imply that I am able to lay aside everything extraneous to that position, because we are engaged with the glory scene; we are now looking for the Lord to come in and His glory is shining. The bread and the cup involve that His glory is shining and we are ready to take on
{511}
the effect of that. It is a practical thing. It comes to us freshly and changes the nature of our outlook, and we are all to lay aside everything that is unsuitable for the moment. We are becoming more and more concentrated, and so the priestly element that comes up helps us in what we say and do. The idea is dress. Moses and Elias appeared in glory, that is dress. "Being by the right hand of God exalted". @Acts 2: 33. He is glorified. That was wonderful glory. Were they equal to it in Jerusalem in @Acts 1 and 2? They were. The description shows they were equal to it, and the Spirit came in as glory and sat on each of them and then they are speaking; they were so far glorious.
Rem. So the ministry of Moses as representing Christ results in a sphere of glory.
J.T. So in the Lord's supper, the emblems coming before us, already glorious, it is "from glory to glory", not degradation to glory.
Ques. "*We* all, looking on the glory of the Lord" @2 Corinthians 3: 18 -- does that mean the saints together in the light of the assembly?
J.T. That is where it comes out in the most concrete way. We should not limit it to that, for normally the believer is always glorious in some sense. Even if one is under reproach, he is glorious. "Whom he justified, them he also glorified". @Romans 8: 30. I think that alludes to the Spirit; having received the Spirit we are glorified in principle. According to @Romans 8:11, our bodies will be changed on account of the Spirit dwelling in us.
G.C.S. Would "we all" suggest that each one is distinguished -- but we are distinguished together?
J.T. We have varied glories of course, but the point here is to similarise us; so the Lord has us together in the assembly in glorious dress.
Ques. Does the beginning of @Psalm 29 bring in the thought? "Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; worship Jehovah in holy splendour". @Psalm 29: 2.
{512}
J.T. Very good. "In his temple doth every one say, Glory!" @Psalm 29: 9, and every saint ought to speak glory. That brings up another matter, as to how the cup is viewed in assembly service. It is the "cup of the Lord". There is the Lord's table, which is the bread, and the Lord's cup, so it would seem as if it is a matter between Him and us all the time during the service relating to the Supper.
Ques. Is the Lord's cup the Lord's portion in it?
J.T. No, it is what He is administering. He does not partake of the Supper. It is as often as *ye* eat it. It is a question of administration, and glory enters into it.
G.C.S. We have in the past addressed and given thanks to God for the cup; it would be right and proper to address the Lord.
J.T. I think so. The more you look into it, it seems that it ought to be a question between the Lord and ourselves. It is a little premature and tends to confusion to bring God into it as we are actually partaking of the Supper.
Rem. And it says, "this do in remembrance of me" @1 Corinthians 11: 24,25, in regard of the cup as well as the bread.
J.T. Quite so. It is the new covenant in *My* blood. God is not formally brought into it in the Lord's own words. As I was remarking, in Canticles there is properly no reference to God or Jehovah; it is Solomon and the people -- Christ and His people; and it seems as if the service in the assembly in relation to the Lord's supper ought to make ample room for that, for there is delightful expression of reciprocated affections between Christ and His own.
F.W.W. How far do you carry in your mind the thought of the Supper into the service? Would you limit the Lord's supper to the mere partaking of the bread and the cup?
J.T. Well, I think the facts stated would imply two things, namely food and remembrance. Matthew and
{513}
Mark give us the food -- the meat and drink, and Luke gives us the memorial. I do not know that it goes any further, but there is the marital suggestion entering into it.
F.W.W. I was wondering whether that is connected with the Supper.
J.T. I think it also goes beyond. "This is my body, which is for you" @1 Corinthians 11: 24, would mean that the Lord has devoted Himself in love unto death, and the bread, also suggesting the saints as His body, being brought in there, points to the assembly viewed in that light. Zipporah being brought to Moses in @Exodus 18, just as the covenant was about to be inaugurated, helps us to see from the types that the marital thought is there even before you have the covenant. But in relation to other servants of God that follow Moses you have references to the assembly from the marital side; as for instance with David, Abigail is strikingly representative, and what marks her is her beauty and understanding; which thought ought to come in subsequent to the Lord's supper. The marital thought being introduced in @Exodus 18 would be to augment the position in view of the covenant being inaugurated in the next chapter.
F.W.W. So you would link that with the wilderness side?
J.T. Yes, it is what we are here in the wilderness. The Cushite (@Numbers 12), I think would be similar. You have nothing much stated about affection in either case, but the setting reminds us of wilderness circumstances. When you come to Abigail, and even Pharaoh's daughter, you have marital thoughts that belong to the land of promise, which come in on the spiritual line, and there ought to be scope for that, for the Lord's supper is what He is to us peculiarly. @Romans 7: 3 introduces the thought of being to Another, and that surely ought to have a place with us.
{514}
F.W.W. So Zipporah and Abigail would suggest the movements "from glory to glory" upwards.
J.T. Just so, involving the assembly's glory, for we have in the first epistle to the Corinthians that the woman is the glory of the man; and, as to the giving of the saints, those who carry it are said to be "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory" @2 Corinthians 8: 23; all that ought to have its place in the service. Then we go back to Genesis where we have primary thoughts as to the marital side, which do not come out in connection with the development of the testimony in Exodus. Before we have the ministerial or mediatorial side at all, we have the marital thought, meaning that it was the divine purpose in view before sin came into the world.
Ques. So does the marital thought underlie every position in which we are found?
J.T. If Christ is Man, you must make room for His complement. The Lord is thinking of the saints and loving them, always thinking of us, and why should we exclude that thought from the service of God? It enhances the position, and so we have, "Go forth, daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart", @Song of Songs 3: 11. That is a very felicitous thought in the service. The saints are gladdened through what they see in Christ and because of their relation with Him.
L.D.M. John the baptist expressed it, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom" @John 3: 29.
J.T. He evidently discerned the affections of Christ in this respect.
Ques. The covenant being God's covenant, how does that enter into it?
J.T. Well, God has His part in it, but we have to wait for that period in the service. In Canticles we do not reach God properly at all, but there is wonderful
{515}
enlargement and great expansion of thought. In the Old Testament you may bring in a title of God that would fit into the covenant; Jehovah, indeed, is a covenant name, and there are several appellations of God in the Old Testament, but the word God, which is the word we use, is represented by one word in Greek. So that if we want to speak to God about the covenant He is quite ready to hear us. The idea is Moses leading the people outside the camp to meet God (@Exodus 19: 17). When that time comes we can surely speak to God, and amongst other things speak about His love which includes the covenant. In speaking to Him, God is the only title we can use, save the Father, which latter involves the family relation. If we speak to God about the covenant, He will readily listen to us.
Ques. Should there be opportunity for that?
J.T. I think there is. Moses led the people out to meet God. The Mediator does that, but He leads us out in suitable dress. The Lord would cause us to be full of enjoyment, the glory of the enjoyment of love and reciprocated affections between Him and ourselves.
Ques. Is there not one reference to God in the Canticles?
J.T. The "Flames of Jah" in @Song of Songs 8: 6, you mean? But you can hardly speak of that in the sense we are speaking of now. It is "flames of Jah" and is just a question of character. The name is used adjectivally, it is not a personal reference. It is really a suggestion of judgment -- showing the intensity of jealousy.
Ques. Has the apostle the glory of the Mediator before him in saying, "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God" @2 Thessalonians 3: 5?
J.T. The Lord does that, and in the types we have a very formal reference to it in that Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; but for us, that is not limited to God as known in the new covenant.
{516}
F.W.W. That is a full thought. We may speak to God in many ways; speak of His love, including the covenant, of Christ, of His rich mercy, and many other great thoughts. Whatever we speak of, we speak to God -- "to us there is one God" @1 Corinthians 8: 6. We may also speak to Him as Father and appreciate His supremacy in the Deity as revealed, but it is the one God. God may be known in many ways.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. In the Old Testament the first title we have is Elohim; which is a plural thought and alludes to a Being that is to be worshipped. That is the great general thought, but then the Old Testament is richer in divine titles in that sense, because if it is a question of power you have a name of the Deity which denotes that. But when we come to the New Testament we have only one word to designate God, and we have to use that if we want to speak about the covenant. God would listen to us about the covenant, but we should not speak of it unduly. Why not speak to Him as Creator and as Almighty and many other ways? Well, the priestly instincts with us would disallow that as in assembly. We want to keep to the matter before us. The covenant alludes to Him only in a limited way. It is God Himself we want to speak about, what He is in a more general way, not confined to the limitations of the covenant. Romans introduces love without any reference to the covenant. The love of God shed abroad in our hearts is a fuller thought than the covenant. "The witness of God ... concerning his Son" @1 John 5: 9, is more than the new covenant.
F.W.W. Your word 'plural' as to Elohim helps, instead of my word 'full'.
J.T. It is to stress the thought of the Being that should be worshipped, and it carries on to the final thought of God in the Scriptures, that He is "all in all". That is God. It is not the idea of a covenant God. God Himself in His own Being is to be worshipped.
{517}
Rem. The tendency to limit our thoughts to the confines of the covenant when speaking to God should be rectified.
J.T. It seems to me that we ought to see by Scripture, that it is the Lord who has effectuated the new covenant, but if we wish to speak to God about it afterwards, we ought to understand that it is a limited thought.
L.D.M. In Mark the Lord has something to say after they had drunk. Would that be the idea of leading them out to meet God?
J.T. Exactly. They are brought into mutual touch with each other. Why did they not sing a hymn before the Lord introduced the Supper? I think the Supper had caused a change in them, and that is the idea. The question may be asked, To whom did the Lord give thanks for the bread and the cup? The Spirit of God does not tell us, and it is very significant He does not, because the whole matter awaited Paul's doctrine. That is where the Supper has its proper setting and he brings out that it is the Lord's supper.
I should like, if any brother has a different view, that it should be stated, because it is an important matter for the brethren, and the Lord is greatly helping us on this line, and it is important to see what the glory of the Lord is and what the glory of the Son of God is and all that leads up to, and how there is conferred glory on us too. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them" @John 17: 22. That is, we are on the line of conferred glory after that. But the glory of the Lord is what He is Himself in administration in making known the facts of the position; so that we should go in in suitable dress to God and be happily and intelligently with God to worship Him.
{518}
ASSURANCE AND CONFIDENCE
@Genesis 15: 8 - 18; @2 Corinthians 1: 6 - 24; @2 Corinthians 3: 4 - 6
J.T. What is in mind is the assurance that God affords to those who have faith, and I thought that this chapter in Genesis, linked with the passages read in 2 Corinthians, would help. The epistle makes much of assurance, and confidence towards God, and confidence in one another. We have in it that God establishes us together, Paul saying, "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ ... is God" @2 Corinthians 1: 21. What enters into this on God's part is the thought of covenant; it enters into His relations with men generally, even His requirements of Adam were so designated, for it is said that "Adam ... transgressed the covenant", @Hosea 6: 7. There was a link in that sense between God as Creator and Adam as His creature. Then, after the flood, there was the covenant made with Noah, and the cattle, and the earth itself Then with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Israel, and with David, so that the idea marks God's relations with men, and of course, particularly with believers. In fact, it is always with those who are in specific relations with God.
We get it here in @Genesis 15 with Abram; and what is to be noted in his case, and in the case of Noah, is that certain experiences are gone through before the covenant is formally made and ratified. In Noah's case, it was proposed before the deluge (@Genesis 6:18), but ratified afterwards. Abram goes through much, and then we are told that "On the same day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram" @Genesis 15: 18. There is no formal covenant made with christians as such, but the principle of covenant enters into christianity, not only the new covenant, but the first covenant with Israel in the spiritual, or anti-typical teaching of it (see @Romans 8: 4). That is, God has come in in Christ in the gospel according to His love to us, and *in baptism and the Lord's*
{519}
*supper believers normally commit themselves to God*. (See also note in New Translation, @1 Peter 3: 21). So that in general there is the principle of covenant between God and us as known as a people here on earth. The new covenant by itself enters into this too, only it is *made* expressly with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
In all this we see how God would assure us, in His readiness to commit Himself in covenant, oath, promise; but, in truth, the more we know God the less we are dependent on these specially assuring provisions. But still, He takes account of us in our weakness and shallowness, and assures us as to Himself. He has made promises to us, even swearing, as we are told in Hebrews: "Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath, that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, where Jesus entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec", @Hebrews 6:17 - 20. These are the thoughts in one's mind in view of this meeting.
F.I. You have in mind that the thought of covenant runs right through from Adam.
J.T. That is true, and it especially affects young believers, that they should have confidence in God.
F.I. "God ... for us", is more in relation to our movements here on the earth than our movements as connected with the heavenly side of the truth.
J.T. Yes; it is the public position here, so that we should be confirmed and stand in the truth.
Rem. There are no conditions with this covenant with Abram.
{520}
J.T. Well, there are the terms from God's side. Abram has gone through much, and the covenant is in answer to his desire to *know*. In verse 8 we read "And he said, Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall possess it?" @Genesis 15: 8. That is, he wanted assurance. Many are like that, and it is not simply that we are mentally assured from the Scriptures, but God puts us through circumstances in which He proves what He can be to us. Abram goes through much here; so also Noah had to go through much before the covenant was ratified with him. It is mentioned in chapter 6, but completed in chapter 9. God would have us to be assured as going through things with Him. If He has come in in Christ, and Christ has suffered and died and been buried, God looks for some correspondence with that in those who believe; and then He shows how He would assure us of ultimate results, as passing through these experiences. We are not simply to take up the attitude of mentally assenting to the gospel and making much of the fact that the sheep of Christ can never perish, but there are the experiences resulting from the government of God, and our ordinary circumstances in the wilderness, including our failure, and it is as passing through these that God assures us (see @Romans 5: 3; @Romans 8: 28). He is not assuring persons who merely assent to the gospel and fail to accept the path of His will.
Ques. Is that seen too in connection with Israel? There was the assurance of the passover and the Red Sea, and the espousal to Jehovah in the wilderness before the actual covenant was entered into.
J.T. That agrees exactly with what I have said as to the covenant with Noah and Abram. There is a certain experience that precedes the ratification of it. God looks for some correspondence with His overtures in Christ. The sufferings of Christ command faith, and there are corresponding experiences with us. So that Israel had to suffer in Egypt and go through the
{521}
Red Sea before the covenant was made with them, and in our case, a person who believes is baptised: "he that believeth and is baptised", that is, it is a concurrent necessity to faith; it is a committal to the death of Christ, for "as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto His death", @Romans 6: 3. There is the acceptance of His death and correspondence with it. That is the idea. The Lord's supper is the other side in a positive way, but involving the same thing.
P.H.H. There seems to have been a certain intelligence with Abram. He is told to take a heifer and a she-goat, and so on, but he not only took all those, but he divided them and laid the half of each opposite its fellow, and the birds he did not divide. Would that point to intelligence in the soul?
J.T. Quite so; God did not tell him to divide them. It is a question of the intelligence he had. He placed them in a certain way and God accepted this, and entered into it, as we see in verse 17: "And it came to pass when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, that behold, there was a smoking furnace, and a flame of fire which passed between those pieces" @Genesis 15: 17. God accepted the position of the pieces. It is an allusion to faith's apprehension of the death of Christ, and affords God an opportunity of showing His power, and what His love can be to us. The smoking furnace and the burning lamp would indicate the power of God operating, so that the covenant is immediately made; it is made that day. All this indicates how God works in relation to our faith; it is a question of His love and His power.
F.I. Do you mean that it is an answer to movement on our side?
J.T. That is right; God is looking for movement in believers; we are not to be apathetic towards Him, although assenting to the truth. We are to be moving, so He indicates what is required in the creatures, specifying their age and sex, and Abram supplies them and
{522}
knows what to do with the parts. The death of Christ is a real matter; as evidenced in the dividing of the animals. Christianity does not exist merely in terms, like Eastern religions, it involves sufferings, first infinitely in Christ, then correspondingly in us. These creatures are slain and the parts separated, and yet the wholeness is retained, for the parts stand in relation to one another. That would be figuratively awaiting resurrection.
Ques. Would the scaring of the birds be pursuing the thing to its end?
J.T. I think it shows that Abram had holy thoughts and he could discern the work of the devil. That is another thing that young believers should beware of. Satan would be very active in the birds of the air, they represent his insidious attacks. Do I admit the thoughts he suggests to my mind, or do I scare them away? Many admit them into their minds, but Abram's action shows the spiritual vigilance that repels all such suggestions of the devil.
P.H.H. What would you say about the matter of obedience in connection with this? In the early history of Israel in Egypt, as God's thoughts first became known to them through Moses and Aaron, they worshipped. Does this mark us when we obey from the heart? Then later, in @Exodus 12: 28, they went away and did what Moses had commanded.
J.T. Yes, first we are told that "Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel; and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people. And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped", @Exodus 4: 29 - 31. In chapter 12 it is typically the obedience of faith. Faith is an essential in the gospel. The gospel makes proposals to *all*, but only those who have faith get the
{523}
good of it. God has only one mind for all men (@Luke 7: 41, 42); He desires that they should be saved, but faith in men is essential. No one gets the benefit of the gospel, save one who has faith, and hence the types show that Israel came into things on that ground, the ground of the obedience of faith -- not only faith, but the obedience of faith. That is the first part of the doctrine of Romans, to the end of chapter 5; it sets out what is proposed in the gospel, and made effective to those who have faith. Then chapter 6 begins with the requirements from our side, of those who have faith, and there it says, "as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death" @Romans 6: 3. It is the acceptance of His death. "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life. For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death ..." @Romans 6: 4,5. That is our attitude, and what we commit ourselves to, and that will bring in certain experiences, corresponding to some extent with what is seen here with Abram. This is in order that things may become real to us. Only those who go through such experience realise the assurance. Along with the acceptance of the death of Christ, what exercises there are, so that we come into line with Abram, "who is father of us all". Of course, that is only a relative term, but it is that we may learn from our father how to proceed in faith, and come into the good of the covenant, the disposition of God towards us. I am not speaking of the new covenant, but of the principle of covenant, that is, what God commits Himself to, as regards us. The Lord's supper is the normal result for one who is baptised; that is the next thing.
F.I. Are you linking this thought with what you have said elsewhere, that the elder brethren should wait for the younger, so as to leave room for the expression
{524}
of this obedience of faith in regard of Christ's death?
J.T. Yes; "tarry one for another" @1 Corinthians 11: 33. The passover contemplates that old and young participate together in divine privileges, for it was a household matter. The teaching in 1 Corinthians is: "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed". That brings the passover into the belongings or property of christians. "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth", @1 Corinthians 5: 7, 8. Well, that involves suffering, that is, something in us in accord with the passover. The passover suggests Christ's sufferings; it was roast with fire, and the feast of unleavened bread, which extended for seven days, is the disallowance of sin on our part, and is to bring us into accord with the passover, that is, with the sufferings of Christ. The feast of unleavened bread continued through the whole period; it is a continuous thing, and enables us to come together in a right attitude to partake of the Lord's supper.
W.W. Is the basis of all this seen in @Exodus 19:4, in the third month after they came out of Egypt? "Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles¬ wings and brought you to myself". The covenant is suggested after that.
J.T. That is right. In the journey after the Red Sea, Moses brought them to Marah, and then in chapter 17 Jehovah commanded them to go to Rephidim, that is, the rock that was smitten. Now they are to apprehend the smitten rock. We have not only justification, but the Spirit comes to us through a suffering Christ. The rock was smitten by Moses in the presence of God.
P.H.H. Is that what gives such force to the institution of the Supper in the three synoptical gospels, especially in Luke, where the Lord says, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I
{525}
suffer"? @Luke 22: 15. Is your thought that the Supper for us in its reality is missed apart from approaching it morally through the passover?
J.T. I am sure that is right; so in @Luke 22: 15, we have, "before I suffer", and the same writer in the Acts says, "after he had suffered" @Acts 1: 3. The sufferings are kept in view, whether before or after. The coming of the Holy Spirit is from an ascended Christ, but a Christ that suffered.
F.I. The man in @Deuteronomy 26:5 says, "A perishing Aramaean was my father". Do you distinguish between what marks us thus during the week, and the way we are viewed at the Supper?
J.T. @Deuteronomy 26 contemplates a worshipper coming to God with a basketful of the firstfruits, and the priest takes it out of his hand and sets it down before Jehovah. That is the first movement. The basket, and what is in it, refer to a believer in his heavenly relation, but that is abstract, and as applied to assembly service would be at the beginning. That has to be left for a time, but it is in view, and you come back to it. Then the worshipper proceeds to tell Jehovah, "A perishing Aramaean was my father, and he went down to Egypt with a few" @Deuteronomy 26: 5. He goes through the whole history humbly before God, recognising that he owes everything to God. It is not a mere doctrinal thing, it is a reality with him. He has come all the way and he has the fruits in the basket, but the basket is left for the moment before God. The priest takes it out of his hand. Then he comes back to the basket himself and speaks about it and worships. That is the idea; and the understanding of it is very helpful in connection with what we are saying. It is the going through things first, as Abram did here, the experience he went through. Christ was "raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father" (@Romans 6: 4), but then, "we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death" @Romans 6: 5, and that is to be entered into experimentally.
{526}
Chapter 7 then involves the deepest kind of exercise; what promotes spiritual fibre in us, and makes us, as we receive the Spirit, really christians and really worshippers. Then in @Romans 8 there is suitable response to God.
Ques. @Genesis 17 brings in circumcision as the condition on which the covenant is established. What is the difference between the exercise of chapters 15 and 17?
J.T. Chapter 15 refers to Israel going down into Egypt and remaining there for four hundred years. Abram had gone through deep exercise, a horror, a great darkness came upon him -- a humbling thing -- and then there was the passing of the smoking furnace and the flame of fire between the pieces. That is an objective thought. He had placed the pieces where they should be, that was faith and intelligence, typically. He selects the creatures according to their age and sex, and keeps Satan away, and he is now ready for God to come in and assure him as to what He had promised. This extraordinary thing, this "horror of great darkness", happens as the sun went down. God says certain things to him, and the smoking furnace and the flame of fire pass between the pieces, and on the same day the covenant is made, that God is going to give him the land: "Unto thy seed I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates" @Genesis 15: 18. What is in mind is the territory which Abram is to inherit. Chapter 17 is not that; it is a question of the son; of *who* it is, that is to inherit the land. The kind of man that is to inherit it, is the only-begotten son, not Ishmael, but Isaac. So the covenant in chapter 17 involves circumcision, that the flesh is to be put away absolutely; Abraham circumcised all the males, and then God comes to him in chapter 15. I think that is the order in which we go though the service of God. We see how the Israelite in @Deuteronomy 26 makes his speech; he goes over the history, which corresponds
{527}
with @Genesis 15, but chapter 17 is sonship, that is, *Christ* apprehended as the Son.
Ques. We read in @Psalm 105: 8 - 10, "He is ever mindful his covenant, -- the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, -- which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; and he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, unto Israel for an everlasting covenant".
J.T. That sums up the whole matter, and shows how everything is made sure, and I think that is the line the apostle is on in the second letter to the Corinthians; to assure them as to their position, and so he alludes to the deep exercise he had gone through. He says, "For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened to us in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond our power, so as to despair even of living. But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver; ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us" (@2 Corinthians 1:8 - 11). Then he goes on to say, "For we do not write other things to you but what ye well know and recognise; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end, even as also ye have recognised us in part, that we are your boast, even as *ye* are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. And with this confidence I purposed to come to you previously, that ye might have a second favour; and to pass through to Macedonia by you, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be set forward by you to Judaea. Having therefore this purpose, did I then use lightness? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to flesh, that there should be with me yea yea, and nay nay? Now God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay. For the Son
{528}
of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us. Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" (@2 Corinthians 1: 13 - 22). It seems to me that passage corresponds with @Genesis 15, that is, God has caused the great minister of the gentiles to go through things that his trust might be in God, and now he would bring the Corinthians into the same assurance. That is the principle; the young are brought into assurance with the old, and it is God who establishes us together.
Ques. What you have read to us would be what Paul says. He had been made competent as a new covenant minister. Would this experience contribute to him in his ministry?
J.T. That leads up to chapter 3, which is, in truth, in relation to another thing -- their want of confidence in him. Did he need a letter of commendation from Corinth? That is what leads him to refer to the new covenant. What we have spoken of refers to christianity in general. The apostle is addressing "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", and he shows that, as a minister, he went through conditions of exercise and sufferings that were in keeping with christianity, and all that was intended to help the Corinthians. "For all things are for your sakes" (@2 Corinthians 4: 15); (see also @2 Corinthians 6: 3 - 10). So he goes through all this, and brings it to bear on them, and God through all these things is establishing him with them. That is the thing to lay hold of. Before we come to the passage about the new covenant, he brings that in as additional, to enhance himself as minister in their eyes, for they were questioning him.
{529}
Ques. So is all this written to increase our confidence in God?
J.T. That is just the point we are seeking to get at. If anyone will look through this epistle, he will be impressed with the place that *confidence* and *assurance* have. The Corinthians had been losing confidence; evil elements had been coming in, as the birds in Abram's case, but they were not scared away at Corinth. So this epistle is to overcome all that and establish them again in the light of the gospel.
P.H.H. Is not that largely so in regard of ourselves, that we are assured of things as we see that those who minister to us have suffered in order to bring the reality of them to us? Was that not so in regard of men like Moses and David and the prophets particularly, all of whom are recorded as suffering, in order to assure the people that the things of God were real?
J.T. That is the point as regards the ministers who serve in any prominent way. They not only enlighten and teach the saints, but they are models, and what the apostle brings in in that respect is that he suffered; and he would have them understand how much he suffered, and that it was all in view of them.
P.H.H. Referring again to @2 Corinthians 1: 21 -- "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God". Do I understand you to mean that it was really for the purpose of establishing Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus in the confidence of the Corinthians, so that the full christian light might be embraced by them?
J.T. That is exactly the principle; according to the first epistle they had allowed Satan to come in amongst them through partisan feelings, and Satan had in mind to disrupt the whole position and scatter the saints; that they should lose confidence. Satan's great effort was to discredit Paul, and if he could do that he would discredit his ministry. "If the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteous do?" @Psalm 11:3.
{530}
Paul has to go through this extraordinary experience of tribulation, but all to their benefit; God meaning to establish him with them, not only to establish the minister, but to establish the saints with the minister. He says, "But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead" @2 Corinthians 1: 9. Then he says further, "Now he that establishes us with you ... and has anointed us, is God" @2 Corinthians 1: 21.
-- .L. Would you say that the apostle is concerned that every one should have assurance, even the one who had sinned? He said, "Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of your love" (@2 Corinthians 2: 8).
J.T. That is one line that runs right through the epistle. Paul is assured in God who raises the dead, and the Corinthians are all to be assured, and the man who has been put under discipline is to be assured. Everything is put on the ground of assurance and confidence, and that is the real characteristic of christianity. Chapter 3 brings in the matter of a letter of commendation, and it is in that connection that we have the new covenant introduced; an additional thought in order to enhance the great apostle, as the Corinthians had somewhat withdrawn their confidence from him. He says, "Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or commendatory from you? *Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart. And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God: not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency is of God; who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens" (@2 Corinthians 3:1 - 6); he brings in this additional thought
{531}
from @Jeremiah 31 to enhance himself according to what he was; according to what God had made him as a minister, in the eyes of the Corinthians, that they might have confidence in him.
P.H.H. Is it something like Moses coming down from the mountain in @Exodus 34? It says "And Moses called to them; and they turned to him, -- Aaron and all the principal men of the assembly" @Exodus 34: 31, and then it says, "And afterwards, all the children of Israel came near; and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai" @Exodus 34: 32. Is that like the principle of confidence in Moses, or as in Paul, working out gradually amongst the saints?
J.T. Quite so. The passage in Exodus, from chapter 32 to 34, corresponds with these two epistles to the Corinthians. "For this Moses", they said, "... we do not know what is become of him!" @Exodus 32: 1. That is, Moses¬ importance had waned in their minds. They could get along without him, and that really was the sort of evil that had come in at Corinth. They could get along without Paul, and therefore without Christ; and all kinds of evil were allowed to spring up. So the first letter was to deal with that, just as Moses and the Levites dealt with the state in Israel. Then, after chapter 32, we have the instruction of chapter 33, which greatly enhanced Moses by his faithfulness, and then chapter 34 shows how God honoured him, saying, "Hew for thyself two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon the tables" @Exodus 34: 1. Jehovah passes before Moses and proclaims His name and says to him, "for after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel" (@Exodus 34: 27); meaning that it is no longer the letter, but the spirit; for in truth the second giving of the law was the foreshadowing of the new covenant, and therefore Moses comes out and his face shines. That is, there is increased revelation, increased light, and the saints are to be in the benefit of all this, but they did not have confidence in Moses,
{532}
and so he calls them to him (verse 31). That is what Paul is doing in this second letter; he is calling the Corinthians in love, and they turned to him. So he says in chapter 3, "But when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away" @2 Corinthians 3:16; that is, the heart is changed and is right; there is no veil, and we behold the glory of the Lord, that is the truth as applied to the Corinthians.
W.W. Would you say a word on @2 Corinthians 1: 20, where he brings in "for glory to God by us"?
J.T. It shows that God is using Paul and those who laboured with him. The promises were all yea and amen in Christ, but they were being effected down here through the ministry; the service of these men, "for glory to God by us". It shows how the ministry is used of God to effectuate His thoughts about us.
E.G. Would you say a word on the latter part of verse 6: "For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens"? @2 Corinthians 3:6.
J.T. It seems a sort of axiom. The letter kills, so we must get the spirit of things. The apostle would make it clear, that we are to get the spirit of anything in christianity. We have to get the spirit even of the new covenant, and the Lord is the Spirit of it. The insistence on the letter of anything may kill; that is a general thought throughout Scripture. Christ indeed is the spirit of Scripture in one sense, but the point the apostle is making is that he is a new covenant minister, not of the letter, but of the spirit. He is not bringing forward the actual letter of the new covenant from Jeremiah; he is dealing on a much higher level than that. He is preaching the Son of God, but the spirit of the new covenant entered into his ministry. It is not that he was *the* minister of the new covenant, but a new covenant minister, which ministry conveys the idea not of demand, but of supply. The law written in the heart is what God does; that is the principle of the new covenant. The spirit of it is that God does everything for us, and Paul was on that line. He was not demanding, but supplying, and so he goes on to
{533}
say at the end of the parenthesis, "the Lord is the Spirit" @2 Corinthians 3: 17, characteristically the Lord, not Christ, but "the Lord is the Spirit", because that is what was needed at that time, the dominance of Christ amongst the Corinthians.
Rem. That verse would not justify us in connecting the letter with the old covenant and the Spirit exclusively with the new covenant. Is there not also the spirit of the old covenant, and the letter of the new covenant, as well as the spirit of it?
J.T. Certainly. That is what I was saying, that even the first covenant with Israel, in the spirit of it, applies to us. It is used in that way, as indeed in @Romans 8: 4, as already quoted; "the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us"; again in @Romans 13: 10, "love therefore is the whole law"; it is not abrogated. The Lord is the spirit of it too; He had it in His heart; He loved it and died to establish it. The letter would insist on the formal details of the book of Exodus, which of course brought Israel into bondage, and has brought christians into bondage, too; it is the spirit of things we want: "the Lord is the Spirit".
F.I. So the apostle brought in the thought of life -- "the Spirit quickens" -- in contrast to the ministry of death.
J.T. That is right. Paul's ministry was like that; it was vivifying. With the opposing leaders at Corinth it was a question of demand (see @2 Corinthians 11: 20), and so in the whole ecclesiastical system it is a question of demand, whereas the ministry is life-giving.
P.H.H. Is that largely the force of the new covenant as applied in the Supper, that it has a quickening effect upon our affections at that particular moment?
J.T. It has indeed, and that is the point in it. The synoptical gospels give the first introduction of the Lord's supper, but the words which the Lord gives to Paul actually differ from all. This in @1 Corinthians 11
{534}
is the final word. It is as if the Lord rewrote the thing, because it was to have a new setting. Matthew and Mark give us a Jewish setting, and then Luke adds to the bread the idea of a memorial. The apostle says, "For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me", @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 25. You do not find that in the gospels, nor anywhere, save in the final word as to the Lord's supper, which the Lord Jesus delivered to Paul. If we are to understand this great subject, we must begin with this *last word* from the Lord to Paul, the minister of the assembly; for it is the setting of it in the assembly, formally detached even from our houses, that we have in @1 Corinthians 11. The brethren will do well to follow that, for while, of course, not setting aside what is said elsewhere, it reduces the Supper to smaller limits, as set in assembly service. He says nothing in regard of the forgiveness of sins, or even that His blood is poured out; it is just, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" @1 Corinthians 11: 25.
F.I. In the gospels, the Lord as being here on earth gives it to His own, but in Corinthians it is given from the Man in glory, and that makes a difference.
J.T. The Lord is pressing the new position of the Supper, which is in the assembly among the gentiles. I would like to know what the brethren think of this final word given to Paul, carrying instructions as to the Supper set among the gentile assemblies. What do we understand by the words as to the new covenant: "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me"? @1 Corinthians 11: 25.
{535}
I think we have omitted largely the idea of remembrance that is here attached to it; this is not found in the gospels. The remembrance is confined to the bread in the gospels.
P.H.H. According to the word used, it would seem to be an active calling to mind of the Lord Jesus personally in connection with the cup. Would that fit in with what Paul says in the second epistle about "the Lord is the Spirit", the spirit of the covenant? Should we therefore, as giving thanks for the cup, trace all to the Lord Himself personally as being the expression of it all?
J.T. It is important that it should be regarded in that way. It is "the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" @1 Corinthians 11: 25 -- the "remembrance of me", "my blood". The personal pronouns show that He is concerned to be before us in it.
P.H.H. Is your point that the *Me* refers to the One who is speaking, in the place from which He is speaking, that is, the Lord in glory giving this word to Paul?
J.T. That has to be borne in mind. It is not coming to Paul through the twelve, but direct from the Lord Himself. It is then set in a gentile assembly, and this is the wording, the last word from Christ as to it.
Ques. Would the service of Christ as the Mediator of the covenant come in at that point?
J.T. Yes. He is not said to be the Mediator of it in this wording; you get that from another scripture. We may go very far afield, but the question is whether spiritual intelligence would admit of that, whether the Lord did not intend that it was a matter of recalling *Him*. I believe it is, the more I think of it.
F.I. Not so much bringing God into view?
J.T. When we come to God in the service, we speak to Him about His love, which includes the new covenant, but it is more than the new covenant. It is God as made known in the gospel.
{536}
Ques. What place do you give to the scripture in @Hebrews 9: 16 -- "For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in"?
J.T. That is brought in in a parenthetical way. That chapter treats of the blood of Jesus in a wider sense than the new covenant. The theme of the chapter is largely the blood of Christ, and the new covenant part is brought in there. The idea of a testator, that is, a man making a will, is brought in only to stress the idea of death, which is the leading thought of the chapter. So, if we apply it to ourselves, we are not the subjects of the will at all literally, but in spirit we come into it; nor is the idea of the administration of the will involved in the parenthesis (@Hebrews 9: 16, 17). There will be nothing lost if we bear that in mind when, in the service, we come to God to speak to Him about His love in Christ. The love of God shed abroad in our hearts is more than the covenant; it is the love of God without any modification.
P.H.H. Scripture seems to allow for a reference to the covenant in the Supper, but the real thought is the Person; it is a memorial of the Person.
J.T. Quite so. If one wishes to mention the covenant in speaking to God of His love, there is liberty for that.
Ques. What is the significance of the words in connection with the cup, "This do ... in remembrance of me"?
J.T. It would refer to what the Lord did in connection with it. It would allude to the giving of thanks for the cup, how He did that. That is where the memorial seems to lie, because it says, "as often as ye shall drink it". It is remarkable it does not say, As often as ye shall eat the bread, in the early part; the cup has a vivifying effect upon our souls. We are enjoying the thought; and it promotes what is felicitous; there is enjoyment in the drinking. The scripture does not mean that the covenant is equal to all that is conveyed in
{537}
Christ's blood. The cup is the new covenant, but there is more in the blood of Christ; we cannot eliminate other things from it.
Ques. Should the Lord Himself personally be fully before us in the Supper?
J.T. It is Himself; that He might be in our minds. The Supper is not a memorial of God; it is of Christ: "in remembrance of me"; so He says, "my body" and "my blood".
F.V.W. Would the expression "in my blood", set in movement holy feelings with us, that would extend beyond the covenant?
J.T. We must take account of the blood by itself. Much is said of it elsewhere that ought to be included in our minds.
F.I. Would the drinking bring about stimulation in our affections?
J.T. I am sure the new covenant is just for that purpose. It is not here the everlasting covenant. The word "new" attached to the covenant in Jeremiah connects it with the old, not with the covenant made with Abraham and Noah, but with the one given at Sinai. Every Jew was affected by that demand at Sinai and needed to be saved from it.
J.M. Does the word "remembrance", standing related to the cup also, imply Christ's absence?
J.T. In Luke, the memorial is connected with the bread only, and the breaking of the bread undoubtedly affects our minds, so that the Lord may come in; the cup is the completion, or fulness of the thought of memorial. According to @Luke 24: 35, the Lord was made known at Emmaus in the breaking of bread, but the cup is an integral part of the Lord's supper, and the Lord adds, "as often as ye shall drink it". While attention is focused on the memorial rather than on the drinking, yet the drinking enables us to remember the Lord with greater ease, and enjoyment, and feeling, because drinking is a suggestion of satisfaction.
{538}
Ques. Would it be more in keeping that the Lord should be addressed in connection with the cup, rather than God?
J.T. The word would require that: "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me", @1 Corinthians 11: 25. It is called the Lord's cup, not God's cup. As already said, the new covenant is *included* in God's love. Let that never be forgotten.
