WITHIN AND WITHOUT
@Genesis 7: 11 - 16; @John 20: 19 - 23; @1 Corinthians 5: 12, 13
J.T. It is in mind to consider what is characteristically *within*, that is, in a spiritual sense. Genesis 7, the first scripture read, conveys this idea, and indicates that what is within in our dispensation involves limitations by God. It is said that Jehovah shut Noah in. Noah himself only being mentioned as shut in would suggest that he is viewed as operating, and that the sphere of his operations is determined by God. The Lord, in answering the enquiries of His disciples, after He rose and before going to heaven, as to whether it was at this time that He would restore the kingdom to Israel, said, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority" (@Acts 1: 7). He had been speaking about the Spirit as the promise of the Father, which they were to await; so that the Lord in Acts is evidently taking up the position of operating in an area allotted to Him by the Father. The Father had reserved in His own power the times and seasons, and Acts shows that the Lord was accepting that, and that His present operations are according to the divine determination. Hence in the type it would seem as if this is in mind in Jehovah shutting Noah in the ark until the cover was lifted off. Its having rested on the mountains of Ararat refers also in the type to the faith period dependent on the Spirit. The dove is sent out from Noah and returns to him. Later he sends her out and he now has the evidence from her in the olive leaf brought in at evening that the waters are low on the earth. Finally he sends her out and she returns no more. Then he takes off the
{2}
cover of the ark, which would imply that he can now *see* everything.
@John 20: 29 contemplates that we are in the period of faith, "blessed they who have not seen and have believed". In Acts 1, the cloud received the Lord out of the sight of the disciples. The faith period began. In this connection the ark represents life, having all the varieties of life, but they are inside. Noah is shut in, but with all the varieties of life, so it would seem as if we should consider first this thought of the gradations of life. The capacity of the ark is specified in chapter 6, as if it were large enough to include all the varieties of life. The suggestion is, therefore, that the Lord for the moment is occupied on those lines. When we come to John 20, we have the highest grade of life; it is by the breath of Christ. The status is seen in the disciples being regarded as His brethren: "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (verse 17). Breathing into them would be in keeping with these great relationships, and would imply the highest order of life. In Genesis 1 and in the gospels and epistles, we have life in a graded way, all seen, of course, in christians.
It is the time of life, in that sense, through faith, as John says, "believing ye might have life in his name" (@John 20: 31). It would seem as if we are to be conversant with the various features of life. Noah shut in is typical of Christ engaged in this way; presently He will take on other things.
N.L. In suggesting that they all went to Noah, does that imply that every phase or grade of life responds to Christ?
J.T. That is what comes out. The references are striking, "every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them
{3}
alive with thee: they shall be male and female. Of fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of each shall go in to thee, to keep them alive" (@Genesis 6: 19, 20). In @Genesis 7: 2, "Of all clean beasts thou shalt take to thee by sevens", and in chapter 7: 8 "Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowl, and of everything that creeps on the ground, there came two and two unto Noah into the ark". Again in verses 13 - 16, "On the same day went Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and all fowl after its kind -- every bird of every wing. And they went to Noah, into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which was the breath of life. And they that came, came male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in".
C.H.H. Is the thought that in the faith period divine operations take place in this living way?
J.T. That is what I was thinking -- all in relation to life, animal life particularly, for vegetable life is not mentioned; it would be a millennial thought.
F.W. Is the suggestion that all spiritual life is held in relation to Christ?
J.T. Yes; all would die otherwise. John's gospel has in mind to stress that it is on the principle of faith -- life is on the principle of faith, and the Lord says, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed". So John says that he wrote of the signs that Jesus did, "that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (@John 20: 31). All outside of faith is in death. Paul says, "Having
{4}
judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" (@2 Corinthians 5: 14, 15). "So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new" (verse 17). This is a limited state of things, but life is there; the preservation of life is carried through to the millennial day.
F.W. Would the limited circumstances in which they were in the ark suggest typically that these conditions would promote faith and so help them? I am thinking now of those who would be intelligent -- Noah, his wife, his sons, and his sons¬ wives.
J.T. They are represented in that way. "On the same day went Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark" (verse 3), as if the family of Noah, the persons specified, go in intelligently. The others are said to go *to* Noah, as if there is a lower grade of life contemplated, and it is important that it should have an object, that it should be governed by an object.
I.L. What is the force of verse 19 of the previous chapter, where Noah is instructed to *bring* them in?
J.T. I just read that to show the different phases presented. Bringing in would be Noah's part, but finally *he is attractive* as in the family position inside; he is there in relation to his family. @Hebrews 11: 7 says he "prepared an ark for the saving of his house", which is not as large a thought as the beasts and cattle and fowls. I suppose the idea of the house is abstract, referring to the saints viewed as of him, but the others need an object, to be put under control, that is, the lower forms of life; young
{5}
believers growing up in these forms of life are drawn to Christ.
J.L. Noah was commanded to keep them alive. It would seem as though Noah was in the ark to keep them alive.
J.T. Yes. The more we look into it, the more striking are the variations. They appear to be repetitions, but they are variations to bring out every phase of the position, and one great phase is that Noah is an attractive object to life, to those who live, because they came to him into the ark.
W.H.W. Is this seen in John's gospel where the disciples say, "Where abidest thou" and the Lord says, "Come and see"?
J.T. That is the principle of John's gospel, "Come and see". It is a characteristic word in his gospel; and applied now, the question is, what is there to see? Luke does not stress that side, there it is more the approach of God to men in grace, whereas John contemplates the work of God in the saints, and implies what is attractive. Life is always attractive, even in physical things, so that "Come and see" is a characteristic word. Nathanael represents one who is moved by it. As he came, the Lord saw him. As one invited to come, he may have thought it optional whether he does or not, but it is not optional. If he remains unmoved he is spiritually dead. A subject of the work of God will come, and in coming he is under the surveillance of the Lord. Nathanael came, and as he moved towards Christ, as He saw him coming to Him, the Lord *names* him. Life is marked by movement; and it is named as it is in movement.
C.H.H. What is in mind in the lower orders of life mentioned?
J.T. We have here beasts, cattle, creeping things and fowls. It would seem as if "beasts"
{6}
are distinguished. Applying the thought generally to christians, it would allude to lower forms of life, what appeared in the early stages of the work of God, and then development. We have in the New Testament vegetable life introduced: "the fruit of the Spirit" is such an allusion.
L.I. Would you say a little as to the varieties mentioned here, such as creeping things, fowl, beasts?
J.T. Creeping things, I suppose, represent a phase in us, not to be despised, though certainly not so attractive as the highest orders of life; not of the same interest as a fowl that can fly in the heavens, nor beasts as seen in @Proverbs 30: 30. We read in @Isaiah 40: 31 of how they who wait on the Lord "shall mount up with wings as eagles". The creeping things cannot mount up, but still there is evidence of life there, there is in the designation the idea of number and getting together. It is just the great general thought of graduations of life, all of which are of God. The repetition here shows what interest God has in these forms of life.
F.W.W. Do we get these various features put together by heaven in Peter's sheet?
J.T. It is the counterpart of this, bringing out the idea of a *vessel* as we have had it, bringing the thought down to ourselves. Peter likened the vessel to a great sheet descending from heaven to earth, and drawn up again. So we have to consider that these creatures represent ideas, forms of life to be carried through in us. They take concrete form in christians. Vegetable life is not mentioned in the ark, because it is not the time for it, but still in the New Testament we have reference to Genesis 1 in that sense, because we have the different gradations of life in that chapter.
{7}
F.W.W. Are we to take account of these various features in our local assemblies?
J.T. That is the point to come to, and not to despise any evidence of God's work. Take Nicodemus -- he could not even understand new birth. His is certainly a low form, but the principle of life was there; he remains in the council, but as in it, he says a word for Christ. He neglects association with Christ while Christ is alive here on earth, he missed that great privilege, but identifies himself with Christ in death and brings a large quantity of myrrh and aloes for His burial. You can see he is not a person of Mary Magdalene's type. Mary Magdalene comes in immediately after him in John's gospel, and although she is not much ahead in regard to Christ's resurrection, she is far ahead of him as to affection, and comes into the full thought of the highest grade of life, whereas there is no evidence that Nicodemus did.
A.M.H. Do these lower grades of life suggest persons in whom the mixed condition is particularly prominent, whereas the highest grades would indicate the work of God being more in evidence; but we have to take account of every grade?
J.T. That is the way we may see the truth worked out in John, and in the ark here you will observe the small measure of the window on the top which would afford a view heavenward. There are storeys in the ark; I suppose the upper would refer to the highest grade of life, finished a cubit above.
A.M.H. What is in your mind in the reference to a cubit above?
J.T. People came to the Lord to hear Him in great numbers during His service here, but when we come to the ends of the gospels, we are greatly reduced in numbers, and in Acts 1 it is 120 *names*,
{8}
meaning, I believe, that life in variety was there. We need to have that before us, whether we belong to finished products, or whether we belong to the large numbers, some of which are perhaps questionable as believers.
T.R.H. Referring to the lower forms of life, Paul would not omit at Corinth the weak brother for whom Christ died.
H.S. The apostle also speaks of the least esteemed in the assembly, (@1 Corinthians 6: 4).
J.T. They are characteristically of the assembly, so they have that status. The Corinthians were honoured, the apostle is seeking to lead them to appreciate their spiritual dignity. They were babes, but babes *in Christ*. That gives them a peculiar status, and it is a remarkable thing that the least esteemed in the assembly is able to judge. It seems as if the assembly is preserved and protected in its dignity in these references; those who belong to the assembly have a dignity that does not belong to others.
A.M.H. Whichever form of life they represent, they are all true to the death of Christ in the fact they are in the ark, in the assembly.
J.T. I should think that is confirmed in the fact that the creatures move to Noah; they all move. Noah bringing them in indicated his influence over them; on the other hand, God wrought in Noah so that he becomes an object to them, and they come to him into the ark. What a wonderful thing to think of that movement, to think of the state of men generally, and these creatures coming to Noah into the ark!
Rem. Does this connect with the scripture in @John 6: 44, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him"?
{9}
J.T. I think it does. It is *the work of God*. John 6 shows that many who came to Christ went back and walked no more with Him. That is the principle of apostasy, and the Lord said, "Will ye also go away?" Peter says to Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". The disciples were reduced in numbers. John 6 is a reducing ministry, therefore He brings in the Father's work, which can be seen in type in these creatures which move to Noah into the ark. I think the dove is the most exalted feature, representing the Spirit. Noah sent her out from him and she went out, and returned, and he took her back to him into the ark. She was a beautiful link between what was in the ark and Noah.
J.D. Do we get the movements of life illustrated in John 9, in the blind man who has found Christ as his object?
J.T. That is another view of the working out of life under pressure. Intelligence is seen there developing under pressure. They cast him out; he is an outcast, but his position implies he has been under pressure. Pressure has a great deal to do with refinement and development. The Lord found him after he was cast out. It is another side of the position, but shows the feature of life. The Lord asked him if he believed on the Son of God.
Rem. These animals came to Noah into the ark, and God shut them in.
J.T. God shut Noah in. What should be noted is the divine determination as to the sphere of divine operations today; the Lord Jesus takes a lower *place* in these, so that God might be over everything. When the disciples asked about the restoration of the kingdom to Israel and He said, "It is not yours
{10}
to know". He was lifting them out of the realm of Israel and Israel's hopes, saying the Father has kept that time in His own authority. It was for them to be occupied with the Spirit, and the Spirit's day, and parallel with this the day of life in its variety.
C.H.H. Would you explain the exclusiveness of the position?
J.T. Jehovah shut him in. I think Noah represents the operator at this juncture, he is the man who does things. He comes in after Enoch who goes up to heaven, but Noah is a type of Christ, as doing things: the great Operator. The Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith (@Ephesians 3: 17).
A.M.H. Would this thought preclude the idea of the Spirit of God working in relation to any other families at the present time?
J.T. I was thinking that. We are restricted, but it is a restriction of dignity, and we are occupied with the greatest things; the greatest Persons, of course, but the greatest things; the highest order of life.
F.J.F. The whole position as seen in Noah in the ark is potential in view of development by the power of the Spirit.
J.T. That is the thing. We should greatly stress the power of the Spirit. Our Lord said to His disciples, "Await the promise of the Father", that is, the Spirit.
F.J.F. Would you say that the faith found in the coming families is preserved in the ark? I was thinking of Paul and what he said of the twelve tribes instantly serving God day and night.
J.T. I should think the ark contained what was needed for the establishment of a new world. Israel had not come into evidence yet, but applying it to the New Testament, the twelve tribes would imply the thought of Israel carried through. Every divine
{11}
thought is to be carried through in the intelligent affections of those who form the assembly. Christ is operating within those limits.
T.R.H. In keeping with that Peter remarks that there were eight souls saved in the ark. Would that be a suggestion that there was potentially what would inhabit eternity?
J.T. Yes. You are stressing the numeral eight, which goes beyond the complete period of seven.
Ques. Is there a link between these creatures in Genesis and what is said of them in Leviticus as to clean and unclean?
J.T. Uncleanness in our passage is not like leprosy. The creature is usable in the divine realm, it is a question of being usable. A horse is useful, but not acceptable for a sacrifice. It is a question, I think, of the aspects in which christians are viewed. "Unclean, unclean", as in the leper's mouth is a different thought; he is not fit to be inside the camp, and that takes us to our scripture in 1 Corinthians, "For what have I to do with judging those outside also? ye, do not ye judge them that are within? But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves".
We are viewed in this epistle as in assembly in responsibility, and there is the *without* and the *within*. We should see that within is pure and holy. John 20 has in mind the highest abstract thought of our position, but here in 1 Corinthians we are viewed in a mixed condition, as has been remarked. We are men and women in the public assembly, but there is the within and the without. It is not so refined or exalted a within as John 20 presents, which is the abstract thought; there is no discrepancy contemplated in the disciples, in the first coming of Christ amongst the disciples in that chapter.
{12}
Rem. Does the word to Philadelphia run parallel with this, the evidence of life: "Thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name"?
J.T. Yes. It would allude to the power operative in the assembly, as over against dead forms of religious services; also love for Christ, underlying faithfulness.
A.M.H. Referring to @1 Corinthians 5, does this figure of the ark help us to see how deadly it would be to allow any uncleanness? Intimacy of contact should make for spirituality, and intimacy of contact belongs to the saints.
J.T. Quite so. This is a striking chapter as dealing with this matter of *within and without*. They had one in their midst who was unfit for fellowship, and they were not humbled about it, but Paul prescribes what they are to do, that is, to remove the man from amongst themselves, and to do it in power, with the apostle's spirit present. They "being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ", to deliver the guilty man "to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". That was what they were to do. Then in the last verse, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves". In verses 9 to 12 a list of persons is given, as to which he said, "I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators; ... For what have I to do with judging those outside also?" That is, he indicates the class of persons outside, and then says God judges them, showing that it was never intended that those forming the assembly should be reformers. We have to leave the world to God, we cannot reform it. God never intended to reform it, He will judge it, He has already judged it in principle, but He holds it still in reconciliation in
{13}
view of the gospel, (@Romans 11: 15). Referring to the *inside*, he says, "Do not ye judge them that are within?" That means we should judge what is inside.
A.M.H. You are not reforming there, but maintaining what we really are.
C.A.I. In Revelation the saints are said to wash their robes to go into the city.
J.T. That is a good connection; @Revelation 22: 14 "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city. Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loves and makes a lie". We have the inside and outside distinguished and guarded right through. Earlier it says, as to the city (@Revelation 21: 26, 27), "And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations to it. And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it; but those only who are written in the book of life of the Lamb". Taking the thing in a cursory way, there ought to be an impression with all of us of the great privilege of being inside the divine realm, where the varieties of life are displayed, all under Christ; God limiting us, and Christ being with us in that position, until the cover is lifted (@Genesis 8: 13). In the meantime, the blessed ministrations of the Spirit, as seen in the dove, bring us first-hand knowledge of everything. As soon as life is evident in view of the millennium, that is vegetable life, the dove brings in the witness of it. We know thus that the millennium is near. In the meantime it is the period of faith.
C.H.H. Is the obligation put on the saints to maintain the position *within*, in suitability to the sphere of life there?
{14}
J.T. That is the way it is presented, I think. The apostle had set them up in that way, and it is remarkable the attention that was paid to them. Paul pays remarkable attention to these Corinthians, different from any other assembly in certain respects, as regards his love for them. He tells them, "*Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart" (@2 Corinthians 3: 2, 3). It is a remarkable tribute to the Corinthians as to the place they had in his affections, for that is what he means. Wherever the brethren were talking to him, he would refer to the Corinthians, yet they were guilty of having a wicked man among them, and others, too (@2 Corinthians 12: 21). So he says, "Do not ye judge them that are within?"
Rem. The raven did not return to the ark: what is the suggestion in that?
J.T. The raven is not to be despised. I think it refers, or may be applied, to young christians who have but little spiritual instinct. Noah sent it out -- it was in the ark, and had a place there -- but it did not return. It is a question of its *tastes* as over against the dove.
W.H.W. Does John 20 teach us what we have inside? The Lord there says, "I ascend to my Father".
J.T. John is building inwardly (see @2 Samuel 5: 9), which implies getting nearer to God, but it is within, as well as inward. *Inward* is the direction, *within* is the place, the place of seclusion. Then the outlook is *ascension;* the ark, as a type, has the same thought -- lower, second and third storeys. It is a highly refined thought, and although the brethren of Christ are very numerous -- yet the thought is not
{15}
numbers so much as quality -- and we are His brethren, in fact it *is* a question of quality. Noah and his family are called few, that is, eight souls.
I.L. What do we gather from the statement, "But those without God judges"?
J.T. I think it indicates who they are in the list he gives here, and really covers what the world is, characteristically. There are, of course, other features, but in general this is to show the working of sin; wherever it works, it is morally outside. He is dealing with what is in the outside position, fornicators, idolaters. These all represent sin working in its most vicious form; others may be less vicious, but all come under the same heading, and are outside.
C.A.I. God is not dealing with men in general, or nations as such, but confining His activities to the assembly in testimony.
J.T. God is over all, of course, but in the present economy, involving the assembly, He is dealing with what is within. This administration is through and in Christ. What is without is left with God, so that international matters are with God. We are not having to do with them except in our prayers. Our outlook is heavenly.
C.A.I. Being God's assembly, it is what God has provided for Himself at this time.
J.T. There is God's universal government, as Creator: in this He deals with all. But in Christ He has come in grace and rules directly in the assembly. The Lord Himself in the beginning of the Acts takes this place. God has reserved to His own authority times and seasons, and connects the saints with the period of the Spirit. Thus Christ is not governing the world now, but God the Father.
{16}
C.F.I. The Lord is not occupying Himself with the world, nor with the nations, but with what is within.
E.B.McC. Would the thought of 'without' take in @1 Corinthians 5: 5?
J.T. There you are dealing with one who is within, but about to be put under discipline. That is another thing. "To deliver him ... to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". He is in the realm of divine judgment whilst in the hands of Satan, which is a very solemn thing. For the time, he is without, with recovery in view.
E.B.McC. What is the thought in the spirit being saved in the day of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. The spirit is over against the flesh, but his spirit is himself really. The Lord said, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit" and to the thief He said "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise". It was Himself -- the thief was to be with Him.
A.M.H. How far does delivering to Satan apply today?
J.T. I do not think we can undertake it formally, although it is the principle governing the position when discipline is executed.
A.M.H. Would you be rather concerned if no discipline from the Lord followed on the action of the brethren?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord would act to make the assembly's judgment effective.
A.H-w. Is life according to God preserved only in the assembly?
J.T. That is the teaching in these passages. This man, in 1 Corinthians 5, was evidently a christian, in fact he is presented in that light, and you could hardly put him into the category of those
{17}
who are characteristically *without*, but he is under discipline.
A.H-w. His life is preserved through discipline.
J.T. That is right: the work of God in him was submerged by the working of the flesh, and Satan is employed to break up the flesh.
F.W. The man is not put out into the world, he really belongs to the assembly, but is to be removed from their company, and is in Satan's hands only for a time.
J.T. That is right; Satan being an instrument for the breaking up of the flesh.
C.A.I. Is the thought in John 20 then that life is stressed rather than the place or position where the disciples were? He came to where the disciples were -- I was thinking of the evidence of life in the disciples.
J.T. The passage shows that they were in principle living spiritually, that the doors were shut for fear of the Jews; they had *that* fear, which would mean the legally religious element. It is mentioned to show that they represent the full result of the Lord's ministry. They had judged the Jewish element. There is no discrepancy at all mentioned here, so that the Lord could breathe into them. He confirms what is there potentially in breathing into them, that they are capable of such a life as that, the life which is His. The highest order of life is Christ's life as Man.
E.B.McC. The names of those without are given, but you would not include among them the man to be put away. They are without; that is hardly the place we assign to them.
J.T. I do not think this contemplates that at all. In our minds, we have to keep persons under discipline as a separate class, assuming they are real christians like the man here. So with Ananias and
{18}
Sapphira; there can be no doubt that they were real christians, and what we are saying is evidenced in the fact that they were *buried* by the young men present; their christianity is protected, but not their guilt. We should protect the work of God in a man, for it is pure gold; but we cannot have fellowship with believers who sin until they judge themselves as specially enjoined in verse 11.
T.R.H. "That the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". Would that involve recovery?
J.T. Quite so, and he was recovered quickly, more quickly than the Corinthians recognised. It is important to be able to see the evidence of the work of God especially in circumstances that obscure it.
S.L. "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, *he* also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (@John 6: 57).
J.T. That is an allusion to this high order of life, as also @John 14: 19, "because I live ye also shall live". It is a beautiful thought. We are bound up with Him in one bundle of life.
C.A.I. Would you say that a certain state is involved, and that His breathing into them is the result?
J.T. Yes. They are qualified for such an order of life as that. They keep out the legal element, which is a very important thing. I believe spirituality is always marked by that.
Rem. At the very end of the Psalms it says, "Let everything that hath breath praise Jah. Hallelujah!"
J.T. That, of course, includes all these forms of life that we have spoken of, "everything that hath breath". The Psalms do not go as high as John 20. It is a question of the kind of breath, God's breath. Every animal and bird has life by breath, but under these categories we do not get fish. Genesis 1 gives
{19}
gradations of life rising to man, who receives his life by the divine breath; God breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living soul in that way. No other creature was so dealt with. In John 20 we have a divine Person dealing in the same manner, only He Himself is in manhood, living, and obviously presenting to us the highest order of life, and He breathes that life into His disciples. It is to bring out the order of life that belongs to us as in the blessed relationships spoken of in the message sent by Mary to the disciples.
I.L. Before breathing into them, the Lord says to them, "as the Father sent me forth, I also send you" (verse 21). As they go forth, life would be seen in their testimony.
J.T. That is right. He had the testimony in mind immediately, but the breath would qualify them for heavenly things, for ascension. It brings out the testimony of the assembly in the persons who form it, they know how to act as required in their testimony. If a person is a sinner, and they judge that his sin should be forgiven, they forgive. The Lord gives them that authority. He commits Himself to them, @John 20: 23, "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them". They are trustworthy, because they have His own life. They were *sent* forth. *Apostle* means one sent; but it does not convey the thought of being within, but more the authority of the One who sends. The Lord gives the disciples their position in the message to Mary, and now the power to live in it; then that power is to work in the testimony immediately.
T.R.H. Is the full result of this breathing seen in, "God all in all"?
J.T. It makes room for that, prepares for it; the great truth is that God is all in all. This is more than the breath breathed into the disciples.

LETTING DOWN
@Acts 9: 22 - 25; @1 Samuel 19:11, 12; @Joshua 2: 15, 16; @Acts 11: 4 - 10
These four scriptures are linked in the sense that they treat of the idea of persons being *let down*. They afford opportunity to say much because of the connections and persons involved, and particularly the spiritual import of the passages severally and together. It is this matter, of course, that is of value, for the mere historical records in themselves, could be easily considered and dismissed as mere incidents. Such incidents as persons let down over a wall have often happened, some, it may be, having an historical value, but these have much more than historical value. These scriptures, as I hope to show, afford instruction that applies to us now. The Scriptures bear on persons listening as they are being read, at any time, as we are now. The word of the Lord Jesus always applies, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears" (@Luke 4: 21).
Thus, in taking up Acts 9 we have to place ourselves in the city of Damascus. Stress is laid on the city; in the other account given of this incident Paul refers to it as "the city of the Damascenes". This implies its local character and carries the thought of what it was capable of. Each city has its own distinctive features. Although there was a christian assembly in Damascus, and although the Lord Jesus had been in it Himself, and about the environs too, it was now available to the governor, and shut up by him so that he might seize the Lord's servant. The Lord of glory, the Maker of everything, God over all, blessed for ever, had deigned to move out from His place above to this city, or near it, so as to intercept him who was to be His servant, but
{21}
then the sinner, Saul of Tarsus. This gave Damascus peculiar distinction. The movement was not to slay Saul, as would be the case were the Lord acting in a military way, as He will do presently, coming out of heaven with the armies of heaven following Him. The beast and the false prophet shall be arrayed with their armies against Him and He will have them taken alive and cast into the lake of fire. Such is the punitive power of Christ, but it is not so in this case, for He was on other lines, as He is today. He had appeared in grace to Peter who had denied Him, and, in grace now He is appearing to Saul; who had persecuted Him, in His saints, in the most ruthless manner. The Lord Jesus had it in mind to secure this young man in grace, and He did. He caused a great light to shine about Saul while he was travelling, I suppose, with a certain amount of pomp, and a company with him. He who made the sun and placed it in the heavens was now there, and He caused a light above its brightness to shine around this lawless, violent persecutor of Himself, and Saul fell to the ground. The Lord said to him "Saul, Saul". Think of his name being mentioned twice by the holy lips of the Creator of the universe, nay, more than that -- the Saviour of mankind, the Head of His body, the assembly. He says to this lawless man, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute thou me?" This happened outside of the city of Damascus. Saul was stricken down and led by the hand into Damascus, and the Lord went into Damascus, too, to prepare Ananias to receive Saul. Later the Lord went into the city of Corinth. How many cities He went into, who can say? He went into the city of Corinth and told this same Saul, now changed to Paul, "I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 10). He was perfectly conversant with Corinth, too, and all in it,
{22}
but He would not be occupied with its learning or its worldliness. He would be occupied with His people there. Now He goes to Damascus to visit a brother, Ananias.
I refer to all this only to show what Damascus was in the eyes of the Lord. He went to Ananias and told him about the conversion of Saul and where he was; in a house in the street called Straight. The Lord knows all the houses of His people in a city. He says, "Seek in the house of Judas one by name Saul, he is of Tarsus". He knew where he was and He told Ananias what to do. It was necessary that Ananias should convey to Saul the spirit of the dispensation. He was to see and to know, that the Jesus who had appeared to him by the way had sent Ananias His servant to him. Ananias went and addressed him, saying, "Saul, brother", and laid his hands upon him. I am referring to this because of the advantages Damascus had, and yet its inhabitants were such as would put Saul to death. Luke tells us that the Jews watched the gates day and night that they might kill Saul. These gates doubtless would have been opened to him, and he would have been received by the dignitaries of the city, had the Lord Jesus not intercepted him, and he would have carried on Satan's work against the people of the Lord, as he had done in Jerusalem.
How different it is now! Saul is one of these persecuted followers of Jesus. We are told here that "Saul increased the more in power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ" (@Acts 9: 22). He was thoroughly in the work, a lover of Christ now, and Damascus did not want him. We are not to be deceived by appearances, by religious things, the allowance of cathedrals, preachings and Bibles.
{23}
Everything turns on whether Christ is respected and loved, or whether He is hated. The passage here shows that the city had turned against Christ, for they watched the gates day and night to kill Saul, but the Lord had means of getting him out other than through the gates. The people think that Saul could only get out through the gates, for "they watched the gates day and night to kill him". That was the position. It was a changed Damascus, a changed world for Saul. The greatest lover and preacher of Christ in it, is now to be waylaid as he issues through the gates.
This brings out what saints can do for the Lord's servants. They have been in dread of Saul, but now they are his servants. They have recourse to the wall of the city, that which, according to man would keep Saul in, or an enemy out. They let him down; "the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket". That is what they did. It shows the resourcefulness of love, the love of the disciples, true love. Not that the love is mentioned, but the fact shows that it was there. True love is not only that we love God and Christ, but also that we love the brethren, particularly the *servants* who are outstanding and faithful in their service. David said, "By my God have I leaped over a wall" (@2 Samuel 22: 30). They do not leap over it here. The Spirit of God had more in it than Saul's escape. He shows us in this remarkable city how that a servant, being served by the brethren, may be let down by them. I hope to show later how ultimately all is caught up into heaven, so all the lettings down have in mind that we might be worthy of being caught up.
In Peter's vision in Acts 11 everything was drawn up into heaven. That is the last movement. It is an ascending movement. In the meanwhile the servants and saints let each other down. The
{24}
servants are often best served by the saints when they are let down. Instead of exalting him, instead of praising Saul for his remarkable ability in confounding the Jews, the circumstances now require that they should let him down. Not surely that they do not appreciate his remarkable ability to serve; it is said that "Saul increased the more in power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ". Young men are easily inflated, especially if successful in ministry. Here the saints did not premeditate such humiliating circumstances, but the circumstances are such that the saints serve Saul in the form of letting him down. They are not intending that he should stay down, nor is the Lord intending that. The time is coming when we shall all be taken up, when the power of the Lord will take us all up. In the meantime the lettings down are helping us, and the Lord is using His people to help, not that they have any animosity against anyone, but circumstances require it. Saul requires it to effect his escape from the Jews here. The attitude of the citizens of Damascus require it too, but still it was no accident that they had to let him down. They did it, and they did it well. They attest their skill; they used a basket and he tells us himself what we do not learn here, that it was through a window and through the wall. It is *through* or *by* the wall, the wall being instrumental, as much as to say that what men set up as barriers God uses for the good of His people here, for the deliverance of His servants. The disciples, and the window, and the basket, and the wall, are all used for the welfare of this great servant.
That is the first thought I had in mind to present, and it is wholesome for those who serve, and everyone should serve, for the Lord has given grace to
{25}
everyone, all according to the measure of His gift. There are special servants who serve in a public way and they need this particularly. The saints do not devise the circumstances, the Lord brings them about, and the saints use them. They did what wisdom required. The servant is let down and he is a better man as he reaches the ground than he was before. There is the testimony to the care and wisdom of the saints in the way they did it. It was a downward movement, and they are doing it gently, as the basket would imply. They put it through a window, which was an outlet, and would perhaps imply that there is light in what is done. There are three things, the basket, the wall and the window, instruments by which things are done. The basket is the vessel *in which* the thing is done, and Paul is in the vessel. He would understand that. It is a very important thing to understand what the vessel signifies spiritually. He was himself a vessel, and now this vessel, rightly chosen, is used by the disciples to let him down. You say, you are putting thoughts into the passage that are not there. But why should the Spirit of God tell us all this? He could have confined the report to the fact that Saul escaped, but he tells us all this. He has to remind us in our service that circumstances come up in which the brethren are obliged in wisdom to let us down. Paul would never forget this experience. He records it in @2 Corinthians 11: 32, 33 later, changing the wording somewhat; he puts in "window" and leaves out "Jews". He calls upon the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to assure them he was not lying. He was thus telling it because there was in the happening a lesson to all who should come after him. He was about to relate another experience, that he had been taken up to the third heaven. He did not have long to
{26}
wait for the opposite movement of going up. If the Lord lets His servants down He will surely counterbalance it by lifting them up. He will not allow us to be long down. In @2 Corinthians 12, referring to his exaltation, Paul says he did not know whether he was in the body or out of it. It is a question of God's power; Paul says that he was caught up to the third heaven and into paradise, @2 Corinthians 12: 3, 4. The counterbalance must follow, he was let down by a thorn for the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should be exalted above measure. Normally the brethren do not use flattery, but on the contrary if circumstances require it they let each other down. God can do many things, accomplish many results, by one action.
Now the passage in Samuel corresponds somewhat. Michal is said to be a lover of David. She let him down too in very similar circumstances. Saul the king is set to murder his son-in-law, showing how little we can rely on natural relationships. In divine things there is *nothing* more unreliable than natural relationships. Michal is said to love David, and she shows that she did at this time. He is in his house and Saul sent his messengers to watch the house. Think of the murder in that man's heart, and yet he is the king of Israel! This shows how official positions in the things of God are no guarantee against evil. But Michal was a relation of David, and in the most intimate relation too -- she was his. Later she proves unworthy of such a husband. A certain religious organisation of today corresponds: to a point loyal to Christ, but later proved unworthy of Him. The Spirit of God occupies us with Michal's love at this time. She is David's wife here, but she replaces him by an image, which is rather suspicious as to her own state. Still she loved David, and the Spirit of God would warn
{27}
anyone here who may be on the Michal line -- loving Christ at the beginning and despising at the end.
This lover of David, in the place of wife, is later a despiser when he dances before the ark. How sorrowful! We are to watch our hearts. The apostle says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (@2 Corinthians 11: 2). In the espousal the best is looked for. There is great antagonism to Christ at the present time, therefore the need of guarding Him is great, and it is within the range of everyone of us to guard the Lord against the murderer. The Lord is beyond it personally, but He is here in testimony in the assembly which He speaks of as Himself (@Acts 9: 4, 5). As thus here the enemy attacks Him, and hence the need of loyal protection. Are we in this wifely position in which love is normal, and in which the very best should be forthcoming? Are we yielding the very best in a military position: guarding the Lord and His people from the murder that is current? It is a very great matter to stand up loyally for Christ, in the household, in the office, in the school, not putting an image in His place to deceive people. Michal let him down by the wall through the window, and in this she served well. She is in keeping with Rahab, who let the spies down by a cord through a window. It is a line of truth running through Scripture, and she is in keeping with it, for she lets him down through the window, and he *escapes*. David escapes, so that he is yet alive, yet in the testimony, yet ready for kingship; Michal has done well. I am speaking now to the young, particularly to sisters here, as to how far we carry this service, and as to whether we are ready for it. As to the image or teraphim, covered with a net of goat's hair, the Spirit of God has mentioned it no doubt that we might fully understand
{28}
Michal, especially in her typical significance. She has it in the house and uses it, it implies an idolatrous state; it is the image. Still she let David down through the window, so that he escaped. She had love for David.
In the book of Joshua we have a more exalted case perhaps than these as regards the letting down. She is Rahab, a great sinner, but later a saved one: hence the more valuable as a witness of divine grace. Saul, too, was a great sinner and hence also a greater monument of grace. He enlarges on this in @1 Timothy 1: 16, saying, "Mercy was shewn me ... for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal". The more one repents, the more one judges himself before God, the more one magnifies the grace of the Saviour, the greater the testimony he bears to the grace that saves. Rahab was a sinner, but now she is a changed person. The Spirit of God enlightens us as to her particularly in James where she is said to have sent the spies out by *another* way. She learnt the other way rapidly. She not only let the spies down through the window, but there is much said of the cord used. It is not a basket. It was no doubt the product of flax, for Rahab had flax in her house. She does not use a basket, or vessel of any kind, she uses a cord strong enough to let down two men through the window. She was evidently a skilful person. Skill always goes with spirituality, as we see elsewhere; not only understanding, but skill in understanding. There is much that is very slipshod in our understandings as christians. Many have very little shamefacedness in acknowledging their ignorance of things that they should know. Gabriel told Daniel that he had come to make him skilful in understanding.
Rahab evidently had this cord. It is called a line when she sets it up in the window; there
{29}
it is a matter of testimony. But as a cord it is a question of *strength*. It represents something the Lord looks for in us as helping His servants in a spiritual way. Hence she lets them down; a covenant having been made between her and the two spies. The cord is now called a line, and is set up in the window as a token; it is to be *seen*. The word scarlet is put in, a colour that catches the eye. It is a testimony to what happened in that house. It is a testimony of a covenant, one of the most important things in Scripture. It is not only that the spies were let down, but they were told what to do afterwards. It is not always that servants are told what to do by the saints. The servants usually tell the saints what to do, but here is a woman who served these men. Potentially they are to be her saviours, and they were when Jericho was taken, but now she is telling them what to do. Let us not be too shy to tell a brother who lives amongst us what he should do. Even Paul is amenable to advice from the brethren. Rahab tells the spies to go to the mountains, meaning spiritually *another* way from the ordinary. That is the provision for these servants of God, as to their way. You may wonder why I am stressing this. It is because God would have us reciprocal. Reciprocation among the people of God saves from clericalism. Even as the king of Israel was to be from among the brethren, so the greatest servant is one of the brethren, and he loves to be one of them. He is happier and safer as he maintains this attitude. The principle of reciprocation is most necessary and indeed essential to our mutual salvation. Rahab understands Israel and what God has been doing for Israel, and hence was spiritual, and so she sent the spies out another way. At times, if you can get a brother to go another way to that which he intends to take,
{30}
you have gained a victory. The spies, as guided by Rahab, were saved from their pursuers.
The last scripture is to show that all these lettings down are in view of ascension. These servants must have felt it, having to take orders from a woman. Balak took orders from Deborah. Even David was helped by Abigail and saved from blood shedding. All these down-goings are most helpful and wholesome, and establish mutual feelings amongst the brethren, binding them all together in the great spiritual organism in which God has set us. They all have their glorious finish in the up-going which Peter speaks of in Acts 11. It is a well-known passage so I will not go into it. He says, "And again all was drawn up into heaven". The saints all belong to heaven. It is what comes down from heaven that goes back into it. Our origin spiritually is heaven. Christians are heavenly. The vessel was let down. Peter says *descending* from heaven, a dignified word: he saw "a certain vessel descending" (verse 11), not falling, but being let down by the four corners. There is dignity in the descending, but, too, there is the care of heaven in binding the sheet by the four corners. *Four* indicates universality, and the sheet is perfectly intact; it is secure. The Lord says that, "hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18). Such is the great heavenly vessel that has come down. The assembly is in mind. It contains humanity, as you might say, but cleansed of God. The creatures are identified by Peter, "all the quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven", and the voice is about what is in that sheet: "What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common" (@Acts 10: 12, 15). The contents are the subjects of the work of God. The great incident happened thrice, as if God would indelibly impress
{31}
His great servant with it. "The vessel was straightway taken up into heaven;" like the Lord Himself (@Acts 1: 11).
Thus we may well accept the down-lettings. The saints, too, should be alive to this service to the servants of God, and to each other in a general way. They do not make the circumstances, they do not contrive to get a brother into a tight place and to let him down. That is *not* love. We are to respect one another, and to show honour to one another; "to whom honour, honour" (@Romans 13: 7); "each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves" (@Philippians 2: 3). The saints in Damascus did not make the circumstances we have been considering, God did. He makes all these circumstances, and they are used rightly for the promotion of healthy formation and profitable service amongst us in holy, happy reciprocation of love with all. Work is always going on in the saints in this sense, so that we may be fitted to ascend. All were taken up into heaven. We belong there. We come down here in principle to serve, to be taken up again to be with Christ for ever. What a glorious prospect this is, all to be taken up again into heaven!
{32}
SPIRITUAL VALUES
@Matthew 11: 7 - 19, 25 - 27; @Matthew 12: 6 - 13, 38 - 42
J.T. The thought in mind is that we might consider these scriptures as presenting *spiritual values*. Spiritual appraisement is necessary, specially in a time of crisis. Principles come first, but we also have to think of persons and to appraise them aright, for persons involved in any given critical state of things have to be considered. It is not to be overlooked, however, that in His sovereignty God sometimes uses persons that are in themselves unsuitable, as illustrated in Balaam, Joab, and many others. In such instances the works speak for themselves. But even as to those suitable, they are secondary to divine principles. Inasmuch, however, that principles work out in persons, so persons are essential, and these passages are read because they bring out this side of the truth; first the greatness of John the baptist appraised by the Lord Himself, and then the greatness of Christ Himself brought out here both personally, and, we may say, officially. He is greater than the sabbath, and greater than such as Jonas and Solomon. Then we have the greatness of those who belong to the kingdom of the heavens. In chapter 12 we have the greatness of man as compared with the lower creatures: a man is better than a sheep, for example. So that in brief we have the greatness of Christ in these passages, the greatness of John the baptist, the greatness of those who form the kingdom of the heavens, and then the greatness of man relatively as over against the lower creatures. I used the word crisis because this section brings out the rejection of Christ in His ministry; it is the turning point in His ministry: hence these values are made
{33}
prominent as that which is required to stand in critical times.
A.M.H. You said that principles must precede persons, which obviously is right. Have you any special principles in mind at this point?
J.T. Well, no. I was thinking rather of the persons as I enumerated them, but principles do appear, such as comparative judgment. The fact comes out in chapter 11, that all places and cities come into judgment, bringing out the question of local responsibility, and how the truth has been received; how the evidence of God's work has been received and appraised. The thought of leadership is another principle that comes out in chapter 12; others too are seen. Chapter 12 is very full, a long and important chapter, leading up to the brethren, and how they are marked off; the sin against the Holy Spirit is significantly seen here. Other most important truths appear additional to what is especially in mind.
Returning to the first scripture read, here is a servant who at this particular juncture is somewhat in the shade. He sends to the Lord asking Him, "Art *thou* the coming one? or are we to wait for another?" We are apt to overlook the whole history of John and discredit him because of this, but the Lord, after the messengers depart, speaks of what a person John was, ignoring for the moment this shadow over his history, occasioned by his questioning the Lord as to whether He was the Coming One. He was in prison: "John, having heard in the prison the works of the Christ". We learn here that allowance is to be made for a man's circumstances if a shade comes over his testimony, his service, or himself, and the Lord takes occasion to say "that there is not arisen among the born of women a greater than John the baptist". It is an
{34}
encouragement, it seems to me, for all in the service. But then He challenges those who are listening as to what they went out to see. I think the Lord meant to bring out what John really was. They did not go out to see "a reed moved about by the wind", or "a man clothed in delicate raiment". There must have been something more in the man than these thoughts convey, something which drew the people out to John.
A.M.H. That would be the opposite to the sounding brass or tinkling cymbal. Are you suggesting that there is substance with John?
J.T. Yes. John was really the test at the first. All Judaea and Jerusalem went out to him to be baptised; and the Lord did too. It appears here that John has lost power, but personally he is as great now as he was then; they went out to him before, but now they are saying, "He has a demon". Why is it different now? We are challenged if, having responded to the testimony of God earlier, we are indifferent or opposed now.
A.M.H. I suppose that feature might particularly apply to some locality where the condition amongst the saints is not so good as when they first came to the Lord. It casts them back upon what was their link with the Lord originally.
J.T. Just so. The substance of the testimony has not altered, so it is now a question of change of mind. They certainly would not have gone out to be baptised by a man who had a demon.
F.J.F. Would that expression "among the born of women" include the Lord Himself?
J.T. No. He is always unique. "He shall be great" (@Luke 1: 32). He has no peer at all. The Lord is referring to persons born of women in the ordinary sense. Here it would be the great ones
{35}
of that order, as over against persons who are born of God. Those in the kingdom of God are born of God; not that those in mind were not, such as Moses, but they are not viewed on that basis in the Old Testament. It is still a question of men as they were, that is, of the old order. Those in the kingdom of God as the Lord points out, are born anew; "he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he". It is the little one. As we learn from other scriptures, they are born of God. It is to bring out, at this juncture, the new thing. It does not say anything just like this before, but now the time has come, He is going to bring in another order of things. He introduces that thought here as a necessary one among what is great.
F.W. Is that why John is spoken of by the Lord as greater than a prophet? There were prophets who spoke of the coming of the Lord, but John the baptist's ministry was to direct attention to Him personally.
J.T. Quite so, and it brought about real movement. Some persons were saying "He has a demon", but there were others who valued him rightly. The Lord says, "From the days of John the baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and the violent seize on it. For all the prophets and the law have prophesied unto John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, who is to come. He that has ears to hear, let him hear". He is appealing now to those who were born anew. It is a question of having ears to hear. It requires that because He is bringing in new thoughts. There is such a thing as the kingdom of the heavens, and people are seizing on it. The powerful ministry of John would lead them to it. The law and the prophets had prophesied up to him, but now the kingdom of the heavens is taking form, and people are pressing into it. That is to bring out what
{36}
John was in his ministry. He was not calling attention to himself, but was pointing to something beyond what he had part in. He was a real witness belonging to the old order, but pointing to the new.
C.A.I. What a man is gives character to his service. John is not officially presented by the Lord, but what he is as great in himself.
J.T. Yes. What a man! He was Elias indeed, so that the full thought of the Old Testament is embodied in him. He is pointing to another order of things and discrediting the old order in bringing in the new. The way the apostle John presents John's ministry is that he preached people away from himself to Christ. He heard the Bridegroom's voice and he was glad to disappear. His joy was fulfilled. What a beautiful tribute to a man in his ministry!
F.J.F. Would you say that in pointing to the Lord he pointed to the One in whom the light of every economy was centred?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord Himself in His exposition to the two going to Emmaus had this in mind: "And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" (@Luke 24: 27). John was really on that line, pointing to Christ and the new order of things. I think it is very touching that Moses and the prophets pointed to a better order of things than existed, displacing the whole of the old system really by a new.
Ques. Is that why the Lord says here, "He that has ears to hear, let him hear"?
J.T. Yes. You have to pull yourself up and see what all this means. It is a formula that points to a peculiar truth that requires an anointed and circumcised ear, as the ordinary ear would not take it in. The appeal usually stands in relation to
{37}
parabolic or symbolic truth; you have to get the meaning of the words, which depends on the work of God in you.
C.A.I. Is it important for us in this way to be concerned to get the measure of the servant and the bearing of the ministry which he has?
J.T. Yes, whether it is a servant or any one of the saints. John here has lost heart a bit, and in dealing with him we must review his whole history. It is a question of values.
F.F. Had he led them in the ministry of Matthew 3, the repentant remnant, to God's beloved Son? I am referring to the voice from heaven after the baptism.
J.T. That is how it culminated. John was baptising. Jesus came from Galilee, and others were coming from Jerusalem and Judaea which were more distinguished than other places, but the Lord took no credit for His locality. He just came up from Galilee to be baptised. He came up like the rest from His own locality, whatever stigma attached to it. He accepted that and was baptised, and heaven owns Him. It was a question of fulfilling "all righteousness", and John was brought into line; he baptised Jesus, who, as coming up out of the water, is owned from heaven. John is thus in thorough accord with the mind of heaven, in his service. All that enters into what the Lord says here. I suppose none of us would venture to say this about John from the facts given earlier, but the Lord is dealing with it from His own point of view. It is very comforting to have such an appraisement, especially when difficulties arise and crises come. We must not overlook values, for the work of God is the work of God. Then, alongside of that there are the dispensational values, that I have a value, not because of anything in me or in my service, but
{38}
because of the dispensation. That is another important matter. When the Father names the families, all this will come out, their values according to the dispensation. That is a matter of God's ordering. How well off we are to belong in our dispensation, the most exalted and honoured!
A.M.H. That is a thing we have nothing to do with. It is God's sovereignty. It magnifies His grace.
J.T. Those who had gone out to see John are addressed in this section. They had left Jerusalem and Judaea to see something. Why did they do it? Now they are saying that John has a demon. The Lord is saying, that whatever people think, the divine values remain, which is a very important thing to see, that what God is doing has its own unchangeable value, and He will stand by that.
F.W. Would this kind of greatness be illustrated in Samuel -- the official priesthood passing, and Saul also superseded? Samuel introduces David.
J.T. Quite so. And although Samuel himself was set aside by the people, he keeps on serving them. "Far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you" (@1 Samuel 12: 23). What quality there is there! How the man is above the rejection that he may receive at the hands of the brethren; Samuel is outstanding, and as he dies Abigail comes into view.
A.M.H. What is the thought in Abigail coming into view?
J.T. A great servant passes away; J.N.D., for example. Where was Abigail when he died? that is, the assembly, as of good understanding and of beautiful countenance and knowing what to do (@1 Samuel 25). This is the chapter that tells us that Samuel died. And immediately we have a Nabal who rejects David. Samuel had anointed David,
{39}
but Nabal rejects him; but Abigail does not reject David. So that in referring back to the period 1884 - 1890, what happened was that those who professed to be the special friends of the great servant who had recently departed to be with the Lord divided the saints. They acted professedly on what was called 'the ecclesiastical issue;' that, as a certain meeting had rejected a letter of commendation from another meeting, the latter must be regarded as 'out of fellowship', and all gatherings were called on to bow to this. It was professedly Abigail, but it was *not* Abigail. Abigail knew how to act, she knew exactly what to do and did it. That is what I was thinking of. If the Lord removes leading servants, what is to take their place, what can be relied upon? David, of course, is there, but even David was not shining too well. For the moment it was Abigail who held the ground; that is to say, if we hold to assembly principles, although servants are removed, the truth will stand. The assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.
L.D.M. The young man of @1 Samuel 25: 14 is a good guide.
J.T. Quite so. He knew where to place the information. He went to Abigail and told her what her husband had done. He had true judgment about Nabal.
F.F. Is Abigail the answer to David's personal features?
J.T. She corresponds in the beautiful countenance and good understanding, being the feminine side, and she becomes the wife of David (one of the types of the assembly), and she is worthy of it; the qualities are there before she comes to David.
A.M.H. Your point is that she is, as it were, the product of Samuel's long service, in a subjective way.
{40}
J.T. She would be the continuation of it in a special way, showing the fruitfulness of that service; Nabal, the governing side, utterly void of formation according to God, corresponding with Saul.
E.S.H. The Lord is bringing the assembly forward at the present time, and if we get the idea of it as seen in Abigail we would make room for her. It is the greatest thing at the present time, being of far greater value even than outstanding service.
J.T. Quite so. We are coming to it here. Matthew 16 gives us the reliability of it; "hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". I think we are prepared by these chapters for such a thing as the assembly, how precious and invulnerable it is!
F.J.F. Would not what you were saying previously be of great encouragement to those who, like John, have come under the oppression of political powers in the earth?
J.T. You refer perhaps to our brethren in certain countries, where limitations have been imposed on the people of God. Quite so. It is well that we should have a right estimate of them. The Lord makes much of John being cast into prison.
The next point to be considered is the Lord's own greatness. We have been remarking, of course, that He is incomparable, because He confines the full knowledge of Himself to the Father. In verse 27 He says, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him". The word "knows" is real knowledge, not a mere objective acquaintance with a person (See footnote, New Trans.). That is, the full greatness of Christ personally is outside the range of all creatures, even the most exalted; it is confined to the Father. The Father is revealed by Him, but He
{41}
does not say that the Son is revealed. So that we are now in the presence of the inscrutable, which is an important thing to keep before us. We are brought to the inscrutable, and it promotes reverence and worship: He was down here as a Man, yet it is said by Himself that no one knows Him but the Father.
A.M.H. Not knowing the Son is a difficulty to many. Is the Son used here as a name for that Person, not suggesting that we have no knowledge of the Son of God. For instance, John bore witness to Him as Son of God. Is the term used here to indicate that Person? We do not know Him in Deity.
J.T. It is to designate the Person. @Ephesians 4: 13 says, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man". That is what is knowable, but Matthew 11 is knowledge of Him in His abstract Personality. He is compassed *only by the Father*.
F.J.F. That marks Him off from every other person.
J.T. It certainly does. It is to bring out that He is inscrutable.
A.M.H. We can know Him objectively as Son of God, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1: 4). That would be objective knowledge.
J.T. That is right. We get instances of this as in @Matthew 14: 33, "Truly thou art God's Son". They knew by the miracles.
F.W. Is it perhaps the difference between comprehending and apprehending?
J.T. That is so. Apprehending is more limited; comprehending is that you go all round a thing, taking it in fully, which is impossible for the creature in regard to the Persons of the Deity.
{42}
L.D.M. What is the force of the expression "Until we all arrive"?
J.T. This is from our side and is the effect of ministry, which is to help us on, to promote interest and movement. A definite point is to be reached in connection with the Son of God here, but the Son of God apprehended in this public way, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead". Alongside this there is the revelation of the Father to Peter, which is the greatest thought of it, perhaps, but there are all these objective things which point to Him as Son of God.
W.H.U. Are the gifts given that we might arrive at the knowledge of the Son of God as stated in Ephesians?
J.T. Quite so.
C.A.I. Is that exemplified in the man in John 9?
J.T. Well, instead of some gifted man going to that person, the Lord Himself went to him, and asked him the question, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" (@John 9: 35). He was ready for it.
Ques. Does the Father reveal the Son to us in some measure?
J.T. The revelation to Peter, Matthew 16, is complete and we come into it. You come into what is already there. It is a fact brought into the testimony -- the revelation by the Father to Peter -- the Spirit brings us into that. I believe that is how it works out, not that you have a further revelation, but the thing is there. That is where the foundation of the assembly lies.
A.M.H. Paul's statement is very remarkable, as to God's Son being revealed in him (@Galatians 1: 16). Is that an inward comprehension of the greatness of the Son of God?
{43}
J.T. I think so. Perhaps not exactly what Peter had, but it is a remarkable statement, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations". It had the proclamation of the gospel in mind more than the structure, because the foundation of the structure was already there.
W.H.U. Would God's Son be set forth characteristically in Paul, as a result of what was revealed in him?
J.T. I think so. Paul would exhibit sonship in all that he was, more than Peter would, although one would not detract from Peter, but Paul was taken up in a heavenly way. Sonship properly belongs to heaven, while Peter comes in more with the foundational side. Paul would work out the inward thoughts in the heavenly city, the most intimate relations between Christ and the assembly, but in the saints viewed as heavenly.
W.H.U. Take @John 3: 35: "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". Would we come into the knowledge of the Son of God in that way?
J.T. Yes. Wherever you get administrative thoughts attached to Him the testimony is in view. "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (@Matthew 16: 16), was the revelation made to Peter in relation to the testimony down here; a living God as over against an apostate dead religion. With Paul the revelation is in view of the gospel. Then Paul goes much further in connection with the thought of sonship and speaks about the heavenly side of it. God is "bringing many sons to glory". Ephesians works it out, and it is in that connection that we have the intimate relations of the assembly with Christ, and how the assembly comes down in
{44}
the dignity and fulness of sonship. She *has* the glory of God, @Revelation 21: 10.
F.J.F. The inscrutability connected with the Son makes it impossible for the human mind to view the Lord as Man and as God at the same time.
J.T. Viewing Him as Man leads to what we have been speaking of -- the full-grown man in us. It is remarkable that in this gospel Satan says to the Lord, "If thou be the Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone" (@Matthew 4: 3, 4), meaning that sonship was in mind, and that would be developed in us. We come to what sonship is in man; sonship in man in testimony here is implied. According to @Matthew 11: 27, sonship in Christ, although in manhood, implies that He was a divine Person, and had part in the Deity. No one knows the Son but the Father. Elsewhere we read that He is His equal, so only a divine Person can know a divine Person in the sense of this passage. If He were less than God, if He were a creature even in the most exalted way, He could be compassed by creatures.
G.R.D. You spoke earlier of the personal and official greatness of Christ. Would the inscrutable attach only to what is personal, or also to the official greatness of Christ?
J.T. Well: it is the same Person. Another person might be Lord, but nobody but the Son of God could be spoken of as Scripture speaks of Christ, even in official positions. Even as He casts out demons, or does anything, it is different from anybody else. Only a divine Person could do such things as He did them; so the Lord's Person is guarded in every way. In @Matthew 12: 8 the official is seen particularly. "For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath". It is a very remarkable
{45}
statement here because He is dealing with the liberty of the saints. A very important item of the truth is contained in verses 1 to 8 of chapter 12. We have the greatness of John and those who belong to this dispensation, and the inscrutability of Christ as to His own Person, but He is to be learned from, He is a model for us at the end of chapter 11. We are called upon, as labouring and heavily laden, to go to Him to get rest. Then He shows how we are to be in liberty, not only to be relieved and at rest, but in liberty. It is in that connection that He is Lord of the sabbath, because the sabbath stands here as His, and not as used by the Jews for judaism, as it is often brought in amongst us; tying up the saints.
F.F. This would be God's sabbath centering in Christ.
J.T. He is Lord of it, but in truth it is God's sabbath, and that is what you get in verse 18. "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight. I will put my Spirit upon him". That is what He is to God, but He is Lord of the sabbath and why can He not relieve man on the sabbath? Why cannot His disciples eat corn on the sabbath? It is to bring out the liberty that belongs to us. He is in an official place, He is greater than the sabbath because He is Lord of it, and He is bringing us into liberty, so that I think the idea at this juncture is that you come out of the sphere of judaism.
L.D.M. The liberty is a spiritual liberty. Is the turning point in this gospel in the rejection of the Spirit? The Lord speaks very solemnly about the Spirit in this chapter.
J.T. Quite so. The force of His language is remarkable. Indeed He was doing things by the Spirit of God. Judaism has a great place with
{46}
many, I mean the legal outlook, but these first eight verses are intended to set us free, not simply by doctrine, but by the Lord's *example*. Verses 1 - 6 say, "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears and to eat. But the Pharisees, seeing it, said to him, Behold, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath. But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him? How he entered into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only? Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? But I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple". He is greater than the temple. Then He goes on to say, "But if ye had known what is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless". It is a remarkable word that we are guiltless in doing the things that legal people say should not be done; but the Lord is setting us free.
C.A.I. Things can be done if there is the knowledge of the Lord in the situation.
J.T. Quite so. As He walked through the cornfields His disciples were hungry, but what they needed was there. It is a question of what is needed, and they appropriated what was there. He defended them, making them guiltless. We are here now in the midst of great values in Christ, not only Himself personally, but the power that is operative in the kingdom, the Spirit of God.
Rem Would the right appraisement of persons, disciples, in relation to the Son, keep us from being legal?
{47}
J.T. That is what I was thinking. In a crisis we are apt to lose sight of these values, what persons are, and principles too, principles coming first, for, as already said, God may use persons to maintain the truth who are not in keeping with it, such as Joab, Jehu and many others. The truth is always the truth.
F.F. Would the force of the quotation, "I will have mercy and not sacrifice" mean that *we* should have mercy?
J.T. That is it. When trouble arises in a meeting, we are apt to lose sight of these things, and then, of course, the assembly drops out of view.
L.D.M. Is the apostle helping the Galatians on this line? "Christ has set us free in freedom" (@Galatians 5: 1). Is that the greatness of what God has brought us into?
J.T. You can see how He brings in great things, such as Jerusalem above.
L.D.M. I was thinking of that.
J.T. Yes, and new creation. "Neither is circumcision anything" (@Galatians 6: 15). Think of the greatness of the things mentioned: new creation, eternal life, the Israel of God, and others you get in Galatians, great things brought in to lift us out of the smallness of legality.
L.D.M. We have sonship too, another of the great things.
F.F. It gives force to the expression "All things have been delivered to me by my Father" (@Matthew 11: 27). All things, pointing to and centering in Christ, where liberty is.
J.T. Yes. You are impressed with that thought, that all things are in God's hands. Here is a Man rejected personally in a most murderous way, but He "answered;" see the holy buoyancy with which He answered: "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the
{48}
heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes". He was not disturbed. If the heavens and the earth passed away, He would be the same.
F.F. So the man with the withered hand was healed, that he might lift up both hands in the sanctuary and bless God.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord brings into this chapter the entire overthrow of Satan, "the strong man".
Ques. What is the thought in having mercy and not sacrifice?
J.T. We should emphasise the thought of mercy. A man might be a legalist, and yet give a good contribution to the box, but it is better to be liberal spiritually. What God regards as of greatest importance is the state of a man's soul. What is proper to christianity, is what God is thinking about. A person may sacrifice and gain a reputation in that sense, and yet be a legalist. God would stress at certain times, "I will have mercy and not sacrifice". It is a question of what God is doing. I may hide my true state by my sacrifice.
A.M.H. "If I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I profit nothing" (@1 Corinthians 13: 3). Do you think the phrase "Lord of the sabbath" includes the thought that He could dispose of it as He will? It was set on a certain day in legalism, but now He introduces it in another way, or setting. Is that His action as Lord?
J.T. Quite so. I suppose the principle of it, as has been remarked, is Himself, and so it would be for us the ability to lie fallow and absorb the truth. The Lord is pleased to change it, and it is
{49}
a great matter to us that He is Lord of the sabbath and can turn it round.
A.M.H. I was thinking of @Hebrews 4: 3, which speaks of those who enter into rest. Has that a moral application?
J.T. I think so. The legalists amongst the Jews, as we see here, were using the sabbath as a weapon against the liberty wherewith Christ sets us free. The Lord implies that He can take it out of their hands, because He is Lord of it, and He did that.
W.H.U. Would you say a word about lying fallow?
J.T. That is what the sabbath means in a spiritual sense. It has often been remarked that the proportion of time that sabbath keeping required in the types, was about twenty-eight per cent of an Israelite's time. That in itself speaks strongly as to how God has more to do *in* us than *by* us. We have to learn to lay ourselves open for divine workmanship. As clay in the hands of the Potter we have to be formed. We all know in manufacturing how certain elements have to go under certain conditions so as to be usable, and that is the idea, we must come under certain conditions to be useful for the divine service. The sabbath indicates some of the divine conditions we have to go through.
C.A.I. The sabbath was for man and not man for the sabbath, so God reaches His end through it.
J.T. The sabbath is in this sense a means to an end. The Jews were using it to bind up the people of God. The Son of man is Lord of it, which would imply that He has made it available to all mankind, not only to the Jews, and it has become available spiritually now. We are to understand it and take it up. God has great things in mind and He is working with certain materials. So before we have
{50}
any material for the tabernacle brought forward, after the instructions to Moses on the mount, a great deal is said about the sabbath. That is the divine thought; before the material for the tabernacle is brought in, the sabbath must be kept, and we have a word added, that God rested on the sabbath and *was refreshed* (@Exodus 31: 17). That is not mentioned before. The sabbath is formally mentioned first in relation to the manna, and later, in Exodus 31, after the unfolding of the pattern of the tabernacle, which spoke of Christ, it is said that God rested and was refreshed.
Ques. Does the scripture, "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body" (@Hebrews 10: 5), bear upon this?
J.T. That is to bring out that the mere typical offerings in themselves were nothing to God. "For blood of bulls and goats is incapable of taking away sins" (@Hebrews 10: 4), so that a divine Person had to become Man. "For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified" (@Hebrews 10: 14). It is to bring out that state. The offerings in the Old Testament, in themselves, could not effect anything. They were types of Christ's coming in, but when Christ came these offerings were set aside. "He takes away the first that he may establish the second; by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (@Hebrews 10: 9, 10).
F.W.W. In Exodus 16 they go out and find the manna and after that they called it Manna. Do we get things substantiated in our souls before we name them?
J.T. Just so. The manna and the sabbath are parallel thoughts. As I appropriate Christ as manna I am restful, a new line comes into view in
{51}
the sabbath; we are to be restful and develop on this new line. Manna is food for development and formation; in the sabbath keeping formation takes place. Undue activity hinders formation.
L.D.M. The feast of booths follows the injunction to keep the sabbath (@Leviticus 23).
J.T. Quite so; where the saints would be in love together. The sabbath is the beginning of all the feasts in Leviticus 23. It is the prime thought of God. He begins with that, and the end of all these feasts is that we may come into restfulness with God. You come into rest where God rests in Christ. If God is resting, you are also, in Christ.
Rem. It really involves formation, I suppose?
J.T. That is the point, it is formation, and, while you get the pattern, you get no material for the tabernacle until the sabbath is accepted (@Exodus 31: 12 - 17 and 35: 1 - 3).
C.A.I. So a wrong or legal view of the sabbath would depreciate the value of man, but the Lord says, "How much better then is a man than a sheep!"
J.T. It shows how distorted things were, a sheep must be saved, but not a man. Legality is really malformation. You have no assembly material in legality as shown in this scripture. It is in the liberty of Christ setting us free we have formation. There is no formation apart from keeping sabbath.
A.M.H. Would legality damage perhaps by causing us to enlarge on detail, and thus we might lose a brother? A sheep would be something important to their minds but they are forgetting the brother. I was thinking of how many things come up amongst us and we may be perturbed at the thought of losing some detail or some activity, which might be encroached upon, but in the meantime
{52}
we are losing our brother, who is of far more value to us as a live element towards God.
J.T. The final thought is a comparison between Christ and certain servants who went before. It is in connection with the sign as in verse 38: "Then answered him some of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher, we desire to see a sign from thee". There had been many. This gospel especially stresses the great number and variety of signs the Lord had performed; still they are asking for a sign. He says in verse 39, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas the prophet. For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas is here". He is making the most of Jonas and the effect of his ministry, but He says there is more here, and the effect is not seen. A sorrowful state is seen here. The Lord is calling attention to the hardness of the soil, and even as to Solomon and his glory, "behold, more than Solomon is here". It is well to keep that word *here* in mind in this section; indeed the important point at any time in the testimony is what is actually existent in any given place in the power of the Spirit of God. It is a question of what is in this town now by the power of the Spirit of God.
C.A.I. To lack discernment and appreciation of the value of what is here has a solemn consequence in the next section in connection with the evil spirit coming in.
J.T. If the truth is not valued, room is made for the evil spirit to come in, and he will come in. Alas,
{53}
he *has* come into christendom. Things swept and garnished are more pleasing to Satan than ever judaism or paganism was. He takes on the refinement; generally the best sites in every town are occupied religiously. Satan promotes that sort of thing.
G.R.D. Would this last thought of yours connect with what we speak of as the moral greatness of Christ as distinct from His personal and official greatness?
J.T. It is what is here and would imply what is actually operative. It was by the Spirit of God He was doing things. It implies the Spirit. It is not who but *what* is here -- the great power operating for men.
C.A.I. He had that which He could draw attention to at the end of the chapter, "stretching out his hand to his disciples".
J.T. That is a beautiful thought. It is now a question of values, and that is the culminating thought in the chapter. Christ has brethren in the true sense, they do the will of God, operating -- now, at least -- as Christ did in the power of the Spirit. They fit in with all these great thoughts. Among the brethren values will be recognised.
A.M.H. Do you think the days of Jonas are something like looking back to the days when the gospel was largely blessed in a revival, but that it is a greater thing to see the assembly coming to light, and more place given to the Son of God?
J.T. I think that is right, it is what is here, the assembly, and God is bringing it forward through the light being given, in contrast to the great gospel activity of earlier days. One often realises how little we understand the things we are engaged in, how poor our estimate of things that are *here*.
{54}
A.M.H. Would the wisdom of Solomon come in in the way the Lord has helped us of late in our care meetings, in the matter of appraising things as you have been speaking?
J.T. Quite so.
{55}
YOUTHFULNESS IN THE SAINTS
@Genesis 37: 2 - 11; @Genesis 39: 2, 3; @Exodus 24: 5; @Exodus 33: 11; @Numbers 11: 27 - 29
My thought is to speak on *youthfulness* in the saints. Any feature of humanity that is worth calling attention to is found in the saints; in the Lord Jesus, of course, all was in infinite perfection, but I do not bring Him in here. I refer to humanity in creatures. Jesus Himself looked upon a young man, and loved him, calling attention, I suppose, to what there was before the introduction dispensationally of the new generation; it was in the probationary period. If He looks upon a young man now to love him, he is one of the saints. How often the Lord must have looked on the apostle John in a personal way! John must have been conscious of the Lord's admiring look. The Spirit through him tells us that he was the disciple whom Jesus loved.
I venture to bring forward this subject, basing my thoughts and remarks on these passages in the Pentateuch -- Genesis, Exodus and Numbers. Many corroborating scriptures could be produced, but for convenience I thought it well to restrict myself to these passages from Moses about youth. The book of Genesis may indeed be regarded as an old man's book. With the exception of Joseph, little is made in the way of special reference to youth, but special reference is made to Joseph, such references as light up the whole book, directing the attention of faith to one young man.
The first mention of him is at his birth, and the suggestion is that he was spiritual -- if not in any concrete way, certainly potentially -- for Jacob, we are told, as Joseph was born, would leave Padan-Aram,
{56}
to which land he did not belong, and in which he had spent too much of his time. It was not the land of promise, and any other land must be foreign to faith, whatever its glory according to man. It was not the realm of faith, so Jacob significantly spoke of moving away as Rachel bore Joseph.
I refer to this as important, for youth, which is to develop to maturity and experience so as to be eligible for a crown, generally begins early to manifest the evidence of the divine work. In some sense God begins at the very earliest possible date in view of building up vessels such as I have mentioned. Even a Paul, although living a good period of his life in lawlessness, yet spoke about being separated from his infancy. God had done it. In Joseph the Spirit of God would direct our view to the spiritual side in him appearing in a dark scene; the darker the surroundings the more brilliant is the shining out of the work of God. Perhaps nobody but Jacob could discern what was there. Jacob certainly discerned something, and that something is enlarged upon as he proceeds with Joseph, for, as many of us know, Joseph is put before his mother in the display of Jacob's family before Esau. Esau is the brother who proved false, but had every opportunity of recovering himself by the spiritual element in his brother's family. If we have to do with Esau's counterpart now, we shall not testify much to them by mere doctrine, or learning, but by spiritual power.
So the spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned of no one. Did Esau take notice of Joseph's appearing before his mother? It is doubtful, but the testimony was there, and that is the irrefutable testimony, spirituality, which the natural man cannot compass. The history of Joseph is built up on
{57}
those lines. In Genesis 37 he is seventeen years of age -- just a youth. Having considerable ground to cover, one can only make a few remarks as to what marked him at this age. Verse 2 refers to "the generations of Jacob", but mentions only Joseph; the Spirit of God brings Joseph before our eyes and would have us to retain him before our eyes throughout this book. He is Christ in type. He is seen feeding the flock with his brethren; it is a good occupation for a youth to be occupied with livestock, typically the saints; tending them. In this service he is associated with his brothers, whose conversation was not profitable, but the contrary. He brings an evil report of them to his father, not undertaking at his age to rebuke his brothers -- that was his father's province. Everything is perfect in this respect, the seemliness of youth. The apostle said to Timotheus, "Let no one despise thy youth". If that injunction is heeded in the way in which we comport ourselves in youth, then no one can despise us. If it be the manner of a grown man, no one can despise that. Joseph brought tidings of his brothers to his father.
And then we have the record that his father loved Him above all his sons, Joseph being the son of his old age. He was loveable, and the sequel shows that he retained this affection throughout, it was not lost on him. Jacob made him a coat of many colours. All this distinction brought upon him persecution; his brethren hated him more and more. Such is the natural attitude as the spiritual shines. It is a very good test, for if we are free of persecution, we may well question our spirituality as to how much of it there is.
The young man was not cowed by their hatred, and the next thing is that he has the mind of God; he is trustworthy. The mind of God is given to
{58}
reliable persons; and it is not obtained even by reading: although it is most important to read the Bible and books that are helpful -- those who do not, suffer loss, and everyone knows it who knows them -- but it is not that here, it is a dream, which is one of God's ways of conveying His mind, and Joseph was capable of this. He got light as regards the house of Jacob. His brethren are first told, the persons immediately concerned, he told his brothers what referred to them, and told his father what referred to him, which is another important thing. If you have anything to tell, tell it to the persons involved, because they are the ones to be told. The result here was that "they hated him yet the more". What a terrible feeling to be hated more and more, the tide of envy and hatred rising against one! Joseph experienced it in his youth, and according to the record, there was no unseemly resentment on his part, none at all, in fact -- he is a wonderful type of Him who was led as a sheep to the slaughter and opened not His mouth.
We are told in chapter 39 that Jehovah was with him; and I may say here, there is nothing more important to say to young men and women than what I am calling attention to now. We see beautiful progress here; Jehovah was with him, and not just occasionally. This always marks those whom God approves. The time comes in the history of a person when God is with him. Jehovah was with Joseph. He was now a slave, but Jehovah was with him, and that fact appears in whatever he is doing, even the most menial thing would bring it out. If he were to clean his master's boots, he would do it well, God was with him. Then, we are told, he was a prosperous man; that is increase. That is the divine way, for spirituality means increase more and more. Chapter 37 does not say
{59}
Joseph was prosperous, but here in persecution, in captivity, he is increasing.
What I have said about him suffices just now; one could say much more, for he is one of the most striking types of Christ in the book of Genesis. In fact the whole of the Pentateuch is lit up by the account the Spirit of God gives of this young man. I am mentioning these particular traits and incidents because without some understanding of them we shall never acquire an elder's crown; we may aspire to it, but never attain it. We must build from the bottom. There are no short cuts in divine things. The Psalms tell us about this young man, how the word came that he was to say, that is, his ministry, and how the word of the Lord tried him. Here he is a prosperous man, and that speaks much.
I now come to Exodus to bring out another thing in regard to youth, in chapter 24, but shall comment very briefly on this passage. Having built up the foundation in Genesis for ministry in young men, we have youths here sent by Moses to do *priestly* work. I want to call attention to the fact that God, before naming a thing, would bring out that it exists, that it is functioning. That is one point I seek to make clear from this passage. Many of us in our youth have desired to be known as teachers or evangelists before the needed ability marked us, whereas, God's thought is, let the thing shine before naming it, let it be there unquestionably. Even Paul was not sent out formally for a considerable time; yet he was able to preach and to pray, he was a priest, for the Lord said to Ananias, "Behold, he is praying". A great feature in a young man is that he is marked by prayer; indeed it is the public testimony to priesthood. We are told to pray always. The Lord in Luke is seen about ten times
{60}
in prayer. So ability for service should be in evidence before it is formally named. It is very pleasing to God that one humbly goes on with any work he can do. Let somebody else name it, not oneself, not the person involved. It is to be noted that we are not told who these young men mentioned in Exodus 24 were, not a word as to this, but that they are young men and that Moses sent them. He would know them, of course, but they are not called priests; their service, however, was priestly.
I now go on to Joshua. He is not called a young man when first introduced to us in Exodus 17, but he is in the passage I read in Exodus 33. He is a military man as introduced to us, a trustworthy man too, who did well in breaking the power of Amalek by the edge of the sword, but now he is said to be a young man and not departing from the tabernacle; not simply that he is there, but he is not leaving the position -- that is the idea. You might be there and your mind elsewhere, but his mind is there. That is his determination, which is a very good thing in young people, that is determination in the things that are right, but not determination to carry out one's own will, which is often seen in young people to their ruin, but Joshua is in a position in connection with God's will, and he is not departing from it -- "from within the tent". Moses went into the camp, but this young man did not depart from within the tabernacle. It is a fine trait in a young person when you know that a certain attitude or position is right, that it is of God, to resolve to continue in it. We are told in Romans 7 of an almost unspeakable experience or analysis, but the Holy Spirit enabled the servant who went through it to write it down for us, so that *we* may understand how he comes out triumphantly with the power of
{61}
determination; and I urge this on young people, to resolve to do what is right at all cost. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". That is a resolve, and he who made it was used of God, more than any believer.
In moving on to Numbers 11, we come to Joshua again, but now, alas, in a very different role. He is still a youth -- one of Moses¬ young men. In this connection there is one thing I cannot omit saying, that this young man, who became a great servant of God, at one time had bad hearing, not physical hearing, but spiritual hearing, which is a very dangerous thing in the house of God. It is a great disadvantage to people who are seeking to listen to what the Spirit of God is saying if they cannot hear physically, but it has to be accepted, or overcome as far as may be, but when there is poor hearing in a spiritual sense, that person is dangerous. He will misconstrue things that are said, he will report them wrongly, he will give out what he thinks is the sense instead of giving the words used. I am referring to Exodus 32. Moses and Joshua were coming down from the mountain, an old and a young brother together, and the young one says, "There is a shout of war in the camp". Moses says, "It is the noise of alternate singing I hear". Suppose Moses and Joshua have to give evidence as to what they heard, what would be the result? The young man says, 'The voice of war', which would be favourable to the idolaters and would seem to vindicate them. Moses says, 'The voice of mirth', which would not vindicate them, but indicate idolatry; you will thus see the position. Suppose one says, 'To whom are we to listen?' I should say the old man, the brother of *experience*. Joshua would bring in a false report that time if called upon, had he not been corrected by Moses. When spying out the land, he brought
{62}
no false report, but now he would tend to vindicate his brethren, when they are not to be vindicated; they are idolatrous. Moses will condemn them, he will tell the facts, his experienced ear knew it was the voice of mirth. Paul brings it down to our dispensation, @1 Corinthians 10: 7, "The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play". That was what Moses heard, and he knew it, and he condemned Israel.
I now return to the book of Numbers, where we still have Joshua, who is said to be "Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his young men". Watch the last phrase; I think it is the first time we get it. We hear also of Joab's men, and the men of other leaders. They are apt to be partisans -- a dangerous thing -- and sometimes seen in young brothers. Now Joshua says, as he learned that two others were prophesying in the camp, "My lord Moses, forbid them!" Forbid what God is doing! See how easily we get into a false position. This is a most estimable young man, a servant of Moses, one of Moses¬ young men; there are others, and that is where the danger lies with young men in the things of God. It is a remarkable statement here that he was one of his young men, being also his attendant, and having been on the mount with him. Another young man here observed that these men were prophesying in the camp, and he came and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp". You cannot blame this young man. He had something important to speak about, information that Moses should have, but here is Joshua, who ought to know better, saying, "My lord Moses, forbid them!" Others might say that as Joshua said this, it must be right, but it is not right, Joshua is not saying the right thing, honourable as he is. I am speaking of this to show what we
{63}
all are liable to. "My lord Moses" -- no man like him, Jehovah said later; he is worthy of Joshua's allegiance, worthy of his loyalty, but Joshua has no license for telling Moses what to do. Abishai said to David that Shimei should be put to death, but David refused, asserting that he knew he was king of Israel. It is a question of the dispensation and Moses represents this here. Why should any one say to him, "My lord Moses, forbid them"? Forbid what? God gave Eldad and Medad the Spirit, not Moses. It was taken by Jehovah from Moses, and given to these men. It was to some extent reducing Moses¬ importance, and Moses accepted it most beautifully.
We do well to observe that partisanship even in relation to Moses, an honoured servant, is to be repudiated. "My lord Moses"! Who deserved such respect more? But Moses says, "Enviest thou for my sake?" He did not want that. He says to Joshua, "Enviest thou for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!" Partisanship in favour of a servant rather limits God, and shuts out His sovereignty, and we must always make room for this. Joshua failed in that, great servant though he was.
So these scriptures in the Pentateuch, specially these ministerial books, adjust us. They are written for our learning that we might see our tendencies and forestall them, and resolve to do the will of God. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". I could say more in regard to Moses himself from Exodus to bring out youth as maturing; his history is alongside Joseph's and David's; from an infant he is before us. Stephen says that when Moses was full forty years old "it came into his heart to look upon his brethren". He identified himself
{64}
with his brethren who were slaves. He elected to suffer with them, valuing the reproach of Christ, and identifying himself with the Hebrew slaves as his brethren. In his advanced years Moses was commended by Jehovah, saying, "He is faithful in all my house" (@Numbers 12: 7).
{65}
ANGELIC MINISTRY
@Luke 1: 8 - 12, 19, 26 - 33; @Daniel 8: 15 - 17; @Daniel 9: 20 - 25
I wish to speak this evening about angelic ministry, although in Scripture much evidently is held back as to angels, and we are warned against the worship of angels, or as to them, enquiring into what we have not seen, angels themselves refusing expressly to be worshipped.
Still, Scripture has much to say about them. They existed before man, and evidently before the earth, for Jehovah tells Job that the sons of God -- obviously referring to angels -- shouted for joy as the foundation of the earth was laid. They are not to be regarded as being at a great distance from us and unknowable by us, for in the epistle to the Hebrews we are enjoined to use hospitality, and some, it is said, entertained angels unawares, implying that it was a great honour. We know that saints of old entertained them, Abraham, for instance, and Lot; Manoah and his wife, too, and others; so that they are capable of communicating with the saints, or christians, being sons of God themselves, they have some affinity with us as sons of God. Then we know that, as to the assemblies, Christ sent His angel to testify the book of Revelation to His bondman John. And later He says He sent His angel, without mentioning John: "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify ... these things", so we should understand something of angelic communication.
Moreover, they are said to be in the heavenly city in which we have part. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed there, and twelve angels are at the gates. If we make a present application, they are not far away from us in an administrative
{66}
sense, and then we are told in a very comprehensive manner that God has made His angels spirits and that they are sent out for ministry, sent out to minister to those who are heirs of salvation; so that we are attended by them. If we do not understand them, then we have scarcely appropriated much that God has provided for us. You will understand that I am not speaking of them abstractly, or as by themselves, but in the sense in which they are introduced in Scripture as having part in the service of God and in the testimony of God, and as I said, attending every day upon those who are heirs of salvation.
We see them first formally attending a rebellious person, Hagar, but she was of the household of faith, employed in it, and therefore came under the notice and service of angels. Any such as she, who may be rebellious, for she fled from her mistress, would do well to take note that angels may be attending them, for although we turn aside as chafed, or fretted, or in self-will, the ministrations of God follow us, specially by the hands of angels. They had a great deal to do in the Old Testament, even the law being given through the service of angels, and in that connection we are taught that they represent what is mysterious. Christians ought to be initiated in all mysteries, and we should learn that mysteries belong to us. We read of the mystery of the seven stars which the Lord revealed to John, the seven stars which He held in His right hand being the seven angels of the assemblies, but it was mysterious. If the truth be known, every christian had part in that mystery as representative of the whole, for these angels are in the Lord's hands, He holds them. First it says He holds them, and then that He *has* them. They are mysterious, inclusive of all that forms the assembly, for it is a question of
{67}
responsibility, representation in responsibility, and anyone who elects himself out of that brings his christianity into discredit and doubt. I mention that, so that we may see how this thought of angelic ministry is interwoven with christianity as well as with the dispensation of law. And in that connection the thought is peculiarly mysterious; we have records of repeated angelic services, the persons serving speaking as God Himself in several instances, so that in various ways they represent divine attributes, and even the divine presence in a very concrete way.
Three men came to Abraham, two were angels; they visited Lot later, but as coming to Abraham they are mentioned as men. Indeed, it is doubtful whether men could be in communication with these beings intelligently, save as they appear in that way, that is, in some form intelligible and knowable by us, for we are limited.
This brings me to Gabriel who is called a man, "The man Gabriel". He represents what I have been saying in a very remarkable way. Again I would say, I am not seeking to bring the matter before you in any academic way, or treating it by itself, but it is a question of what the angels bring to us of God, the various attributes and features of the blessed God that are represented in them. As I said before, they are not far away, because they are attending us, and particularly in Gabriel's service. He and Michael are the only ones called by name. No doubt each angel is named, as each star is named, but we have these two, one of them is called an archangel, and Gabriel is mentioned by name, and he is evidently a being of rank, for he said to Zacharias, "*I* am Gabriel, who stand before God" (@Luke 1: 19).
{68}
Now I want to dwell on Gabriel, and that is what I have in mind in making all these remarks. He it is that is spoken of in all the passages read, and he evidently represents the priestly side of angelic ministry. Their services most generally correspond with our own, all divine service being expressed in some way or other in the Lord Jesus. Of these two angels specified by name, the one represents military service, that is Michael, and the other priestly service, both seen perfectly in Christ, who is "head of all principality and authority", including angels. Every function and service from God is expressed in Christ, and we love to see it, whether it is expressed directly in Him personally, or in the saints here, or in the angels, it is the same thing. There is instruction in the variety of persons through whom the services come. God has pleasure in the services in whomsoever they may be.
In coming to Gabriel we see him here in the holy place, showing what latitude these beings have, and yet they are subordinated to man. We christians, it is said, shall judge angels. A wonderful thought. We are to judge the world, too. But it is very remarkable that we are to judge angels. We shall have to say to them, and that is another reason why we should be conversant with what Scripture teaches as to them. Angels as a whole, even those fallen, are subordinate to man, Christ being Head of all principality and power as Man. He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, but He is crowned with glory and honour -- far beyond angels, indeed, He has gone far beyond all the heavens, showing His deity. He is above the angels, in fact He speaks of them as His own, which is another indication, by the way, of His deity. We could not think of Paul saying, "*I* ... have sent mine angel", although he did send a representative in Timothy, in some sense like an angel, but Jesus
{69}
says, "*I* ... have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies". The angels are God's and Christ regards them as His, and He uses them.
I hope no one will think I am enlarging unduly on this point, because of what I have said, but they are not far from us, and they have to do with all that is current at the present time in a wonderful way. Everything is being regulated under God on account of the saints, "those who shall inherit salvation". Here we have a priestly angel, one who has liberty to appear at the right of the altar of incense, which is in the priestly sanctuary of the temple. I present him thus so that we may see how, in the most spiritual things, we need this angelic service, for our bodies may limit us in the most sacred relations with God. The Lord Jesus Himself had the ministration of angels at the most critical time, an angel ministering to Him in Gethsemane. They minister to us, too, and we constantly need them, for our very bodily limitations interfere with us in the most sacred and spiritual features of the service of God. Here we are on high ground, for the angel has in mind one who is to make way for Christ; he is concerned about him who is to thus serve the Lord Jesus, to make His paths straight. So Gabriel is here at the right hand of the altar of incense as if he were ready to make effective the whole position.
The position was that Zacharias was offering incense, doing it well, as far as the natural eye could see. The people outside were praying; things appeared to be in order, yet there is unbelief in the whole position, and Gabriel is going to bring it out, under God. How we may be engaged in the most orderly way in the service of God, both within and without, and yet unbelief mark the whole position! Gabriel's service here is to bring
{70}
that out, not that it is the stated service, but it brings it out in result; the true state of things is brought to light. That is to say, Zacharias, although serving as priest and offering incense, doing it in order externally, is not in the exercise of faith, -- for without faith it is impossible to please God, but the angel is here to help what is going on, not to set it aside. He stood at the right of the altar of incense. You can see therefore how these great beings excel in strength, and how they are entirely amenable to the will of God, and ready to do what is needed. Here he is at the right of the altar of incense ready to make effective what was apparent. The unbelief is brought out, Zacharias is exposed, and is caused to be dumb for a season; but his mouth is opened later, and he praises God, thus the angel's ministry is a perfect success. Zacharias is humbled, Elizabeth is humbled too, but at the end they are seen as two priests. Zacharias and Elizabeth at the end of the chapter are praising God in a truly spiritual way.
So Gabriel says, "*I* am Gabriel". Why did he say that? To bring out the service entrusted to him and the great place he had in the service of God, as if Zacharias were to understand that an immediate representative of God was there. He stood before God, as an active servant ready to do His behests. We have to attend to the success of everything -- it is the success of things that stimulates and encourages, and the success in the incoming of Gabriel is that Zacharias and Elizabeth become worshippers in the true sense, as they never had been before, as seen at the end of Luke 1.
You will understand that we should make room for angelic service in whatever form it may appear. Some one may say he does not understand. Well, as we consider what Scripture says, the Lord gives us understanding. Every reference to angels in the
{71}
Bible is for us and we are to understand that. If they serve others why not us? Are we not in need? It is needful, therefore, for all unacquainted with this subject to look into it prayerfully.
In the next paragraph in this chapter, we have Gabriel formally called by his name, and going to Nazareth to visit Mary, and understanding the position. The greatest thing is in mind. It has often been remarked that if an angel were told to sweep a crossing, he would do it. Whatever is needed in the will of God, the angels will do as directed, and this is characteristic of them. Now Gabriel is entrusted with the greatest message -- informing Mary of the incarnation, that a divine Person is about to become a Man. We are to understand that all these mighty beings are available for us in the greatest of our transactions, and in drawing near, this priestly angel -- in fact he is called a man -- sympathetically explains. How sympathetic he is with Mary! "Hail, thou favoured one! the Lord is with thee". What a word that is! how assuring! The greatest transaction is in mind, a divine transaction, but still she has to do with it, for Isaiah says, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel" (@Isaiah 7: 14). How accredited she is in that remarkable scripture! And now Gabriel is before her, he has come to her; he goes in and says, "Hail, thou favoured one! the Lord is with thee". We need such stimulating words from priestly lips, sympathetic lips, as great matters are before us. It is a poor thing for any of us if he has not had a great matter to attend to. Christians are called into the greatest matters, and God would have us to understand their greatness, and He would have us to understand how to deal with them, and serve in them.
This was the greatest of all transactions in what it involved, the incarnation, but Mary has to do
{72}
with it. A poor person in Nazareth, yet heaven takes her into account, one of its dignitaries visits her, enters in unto her and greets her in the words mentioned above. Then he tells her the great and glorious story of how she is to be honoured. "Blessed art *thou* amongst women", he says; and, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God; and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus".
I am not going to occupy you with Michael by himself, but the facts recorded as to him bear on us, as to whether we understand that the great matters we are called into require angelic services. Of course, all services are under Christ: Michael's, and Gabriel's, and the services of every angel are under Christ. It is a question of what He is doing. The Spirit of God brings it home to us. I am not seeking to make ourselves great in our own minds in the flesh, we are unfit for any place at all before God as in the flesh, but think of what we are by the Spirit. In the chapter I have been calling attention to, Luke 1, it is said of the Lord: "He shall be great". It is not the greatness of a Simon, who gave out that he was great, but what enters into the incarnation is the greatness of Christ, the greatness of man in Christ. The greatness of man is involved, and as we understand that we have to do with great things, we become great persons in that sense. We are stimulated and encouraged by priestly service, as we see in Gabriel's communication to Mary. Mary would understand her great blessedness later when she was with the Lord. A certain woman said to the Lord, "Blessed is the womb that has borne thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked", but He said, "Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it". That is what christians are characteristically, and the blessing lies in that, so that the Lord through Gabriel, through a priestly
{73}
minister, encourages us as to our blessedness, as the Lord also said, "Blessed are *your* eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear" (@Matthew 13: 16).
Later on, the Lord met His lovers as He arose, and said, "All hail". He greets those who love Him and gives us to understand how great we are, and that we are persons called out for great things. It stimulates us to undertake and begin things in a spiritual way in the disallowance of the flesh. Mary says beautifully at the end, "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word". She is subject, and that is what characterises, in moral greatness, those who are called into the great things of christianity.
Now I come to Daniel to show how angelic service gives us understanding. It is not that angels are the teachers, but we see here how the principle of giving understanding is set out in Gabriel, who is called a man. It is said "the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2: 7). That is the point. Daniel is greatly concerned about the vision of the great empire before him. These matters are of great importance just now, and brethren should understand them as seen in the book of Daniel. He is particularly concerned about the little horn, which became so great, antichrist in character. And someone with a man's voice speaks and says, "Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision". You see how in answer to an inquiry of a soul as to these matters, understanding is given (@Daniel 8: 15 - 17). Gabriel is a great personage, but subservient to a human voice, which says, "Make this man to understand". In the verse read it says, "I Daniel had seen the vision". Let us take that in; we are prone to overlook important truths brought before us, and God is bringing things before us at the present time in view of the end. We have a word in @Revelation 13: 18, "He that has understanding
{74}
let him count the number of the beast". That is said to all the assemblies, it is not for the future only, but for the present. God would call our attention to what is current in a spiritual way, so that we might understand. Daniel is greatly concerned about what he sees, and a man stands before him and says in a man's voice, "Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision". Why should I not understand? Here is a human voice speaking to a man telling him in a most imperative way to give Daniel understanding. It is a great personage who speaks, evidently greater than Gabriel.
Then Daniel prays. He gets this part of his instruction and the next chapter shows what prayer is in these matters. In the ninth chapter, Daniel is not concerned about the empire of the beast. His book affords great instruction as to these matters, but he is now concerned in his prayer as to the time of the complete fulfilment of the divine counsels in regard to Jerusalem and God's people. Heaven was pleased with that. God is looking for prayers of this kind. What do these things mean that are transpiring? Has Scripture anything to say to us? Is there a voice to us? When will be the time of the end? We sometimes hear people speaking platitudes, that the Lord will come shortly, whereas there is no evidence of faith in the remarks. If we speak of the Lord's coming, it is because we love it, we are those who love His appearing. It is not simply the belief, but we love His appearing. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". The Lord's appearing and entering into His rights is the idea. He has not yet come, He is still rejected; we show His death till He come, but He will come. Daniel wanted to know, having understood certain things by books; certain dates were given. We have no dates to go by, but we have *promises* to go by, and the Lord says the Father has reserved all as to times and
{75}
seasons in His own authority. Even the Son does not know, a remarkable word which we ought to understand, that the Lord has taken a subservient place in the economy of God, and everything is in the Father's hands.
@Hebrews 10: 37 says, "He that comes will come, and will not delay". Why should I be talking about His *tarrying*? He is *not* tarrying, He will not tarry a second when the moment comes. It is a question of the Father's will. The days are in His authority, and when the fixed day arrives, the Lord *will come*. For these things we do well to keep the Scripture before us. So, too, in regard to the falling asleep of the saints. Christians sometimes say 'Gone to heaven;' 'Going home;' but we should keep to Scripture, and such expressions go somewhat beyond Scripture. We add human words and thoughts when we should be using scriptural words and thoughts. Daniel had dates; he read Jeremiah, and in reading the Scriptures he got the mind of God. That will regulate our minds, feelings, and hopes accurately. So he prays, and confesses his sins, being a contrite, humble man. He did not say his fathers only had sinned, he also had sinned. He says, "Whilst I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God; whilst I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding". How beautiful this is! The Lord can do such things for us now; it is a priestly matter. Then Gabriel addresses Daniel in the same spirit as used in addressing Mary, calling him by name, saying "Thou art one greatly beloved".
{76}
How fully in the thing he was! What a man was Daniel in the regard of heaven! And so it says, "I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding". Not only was he to understand, but to be made "skilful of understanding". Then he says, "At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art one greatly beloved". What can be more precious than a word like this? The Lord has His own way of telling us, as we do His will, that He is pleased with us. He gives us to understand that we are highly regarded by Him, "greatly beloved".
Then the angel proceeds, saying, "Seventy weeks are apportioned out upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make expiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal the vision and prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies". What a comforting word that is! -- seventy weeks and all this is to come to pass. What strengthening of heart! We are not given dates like Daniel, as the Lord Himself said, @Acts 1: 7 "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you". It is for us to move in spiritual power, and if we do not get literal dates we get inklings of what is near at hand. The Lord gives us to understand things that indicate the finish. We do not assert things emphatically, but we get assurances, we get the sense of the position, we get to understand by the Spirit how the matter is, and we are restful. It is a question of the sensibilities of the assembly. The Lord stresses the Spirit as over against times and seasons. For us it is a question of the Spirit, everything lies in Him, "he shall guide you into all the truth". Note particularly what Scripture says. The Father has kept the times and seasons in His
{77}
own authority. Paul informs us in detail as to the Lord's coming, and we say to Him with the Spirit, "Come".
The special point in Daniel 9 is the finish of things, also how we get understanding, and become skilful in understanding. Today, as we are near the Lord, we get impressions as to His coming; and we put things together spiritually, so that we have assurance and can convey assurance to others. Thus we are kept steady and confident, and thus take our part in the service and testimony of God.
{78}
GUIDANCE
@2 Kings 7: 3 - 9; @Acts 16: 6 - 10; @John 6: 15 - 21
It is in mind to speak of guidance; such guidance as comes through righteous spiritual calculation. There is, of course, direct guidance for christians. The books of Exodus and Numbers teach us as to direct guidance from God through this dark world. It was never His thought to leave His people to find their own way through the world; so He came in for Israel, even in Egypt, and went before them in the cloud. Then, as the tabernacle was reared up, the cloud came down upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled it. The people were to move. They had come out of Egypt by divine direction in the pillar, now they are to go through to Canaan, through the wilderness, in which there were no roads. And so they were to observe the pillar of cloud by day and the fire by night on the tabernacle. The tabernacle represented the testimony that God would render. It is indeed called the tabernacle of testimony, so that, whilst the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night were to guide, they were to guide in relation to the tent of testimony, which means for us that as we, believers in Christ, are concerned about God's testimony. As we recognise the assembly, disallowing all that is contrary to it, we shall find direct guidance from God.
That is the general position. Any Israelite taking it into his mind to separate himself from the system of things set up by Moses under God, and seeking to find his own way, would fall in that wilderness. His guidance depended on maintaining his position, the position divinely assigned to him, in relation to the tabernacle. Israel was divided into four camps of three tribes each, and they were to encamp around the tabernacle; one on the east, one on the south,
{79}
one on the west and one on the north. They were to remain in each camping place until the cloud lifted from the tabernacle, and then they were to move according to their allotted positions on the march. No one was to be governed by his own will. The governmental dealings of God required that the exercise of unjudged will in the wilderness meant death. The salvation of each Israelite depended on his moving as divinely directed, keeping his assigned position and, as encamped, watching for the lifting of the cloud. As the cloud lifted, movement began. The tents were pulled down, the tabernacle too, its furniture carefully covered and carried in the wilderness, and every Israelite moved on with it. Whether they encamped for a night, from evening only till the next morning, they would have to move on with it. If it were a day, or two days, or a month, or a year, they were to move only as the cloud lifted. So that the means of guidance was very definite. Everyone who had eyes to see could see when the time of movement had begun.
As I said, this is the great general position, for what I am speaking of from Exodus and Numbers is just a type of our own times. Some have chosen individual paths, many have grouped together and set up systems of religion of their own, but the only means of guidance is in relation to the assembly, for it is in relation to it that the cloud stands. If anyone thinks that I am referring to those who are designated 'brethren' as over against the others with a religious designation, it is an entire mistake. When I speak about the assembly, I speak about all christians. But when one speaks about the assembly in a concrete way, one is forced to think of those who recognise it, who move as of it, and who disallow all else in thought and practice. Such are certain to have divine guidance through this dark world. Darkness which may be felt is settling
{80}
down upon christendom, not only on heathendom and judaism, but on christendom, and it is most essential that we should understand how guidance is obtained, direct guidance from God. It is found, as I have been saying, in relation to the assembly, but what I have in mind, not ignoring what I have said, is guidance reached through righteous spiritual calculation. I use these words advisedly, for we may calculate selfishly, thinking only of what may accrue to us in reaching certain ends, therefore I stress the words *righteous* and *spiritual*.
I have selected first of all these four leprous men at the gate of Samaria, often used in gospel testimony and rightly so; but that is not what is in mind now. They represent persons who calculate righteously and, I may say, spiritually. They weigh thoughtfully the circumstances in which they are. They are able to say that if they do not do anything, they will die. Something, therefore, has to be done. Many come to that, not knowing what to do, but that something has to be done. It is a point of importance to determine that something has to be done. The next thing is, What is to be done? I must tax my intelligence, my discernment, my spirituality. I must tax my love too. I must calculate as to whether I am governed by love in facing my circumstances, whether I am thinking selfishly or in love.
Now these men were calculating, as I might say, sensibly. They were able to determine one thing -- that if they did not do anything they would die. Often we allow things to rest, knowing that something ought to be done and yet nothing is done, whereas God is testing us by the circumstances. He would bring out what He loves to see in us, the fruit of His work developing in His people. To this end He sometimes places us in circumstances occasioning a dilemma. Hezekiah, for instance, was sick. He
{81}
turned his face to the wall, meaning there was no outlet, but he prayed, he mourned, he did something. He did something, turned his face to the wall, which meant that he could go no further -- a dead stop, but he was able to pray. God heard his prayer and added fifteen years to his life, when he had given up life. These men, these lepers, accepted the fact that to do nothing meant death. Is it possible that God brings us to such a pass without an outlet? No. He always makes a way. We are told in 1 Corinthians 10 that God always makes an issue. He never allows us to be tempted beyond what we are able, but always makes an outlet. That is most important. We must therefore look about for the outlet. It is somewhere.
Now these leprous men said, "If we say, Let us enter into the city, the famine is in the city". They are right-thinking men. They do not say they will kill us. No, they will be in the same plight as those inside the gate. Those inside are no better than those outside. All are facing death. Then do not go there. "If we abide here", they said in their calculating, "we shall die". They were conversing at the gate. The gate was shut, I need not say. They were outside. According to Leviticus they should be. But a certain extraordinary set of circumstances had arisen, and those inside are little better than those outside, if any. 'Then we will not go inside, nor shall we stay as we are'. There is a way, at any rate there is a possible way -- 'let us go to the Syrians'. The Syrians are living men, they have food. What I am aiming at is to point out that as we calculate in this humble, simple way, we find *some* light. The more we dwell upon the situation, the more we shall find that there is some light. It was dusk indeed when they went out to the Syrians, but there was some light; and if there be some light, move in that.
{82}
In such circumstances we must challenge our hearts. Am I selfish? No. Well, there is light in that fact. It is the work of God. So that there is some light. Even although it be dusk, move in it. You say: I can hardly see a yard ahead of me. But, you do see a yard ahead of you, so move that way, the Lord is in that direction. That is the thought, move that way. These men moved thus, and the nearer they got to the Syrian camp, the more light they got. There were no men in the camp. "There was no man there". *God had moved*. God had observed these four lepers. He was going to use them for the deliverance of Israel. There is only a little light, but they are calculating righteously and in a balanced way. They are calculating according to intelligence, and they are moving in the little bit of light that they see through their calculations, and as they move in that direction God moves; and if God moves, victory is sure. The thing is reachable and would be presently reached -- the desired end.
And then what comes out is that these men are capable of right thinking in regard to others. They are not selfish men. They are immediately seeking the deliverance of those in the city. They want to live, and there is a little bit of light in which they are moving, which involves that they are not to die but to live; and now they think of others. As they reach the Syrian camp, they are tested as to their cupidity, as to their selfishness. They go into one tent and take silver and gold out of it and hide it, and they go into another and do the same. They are for the moment selfish. I have already alluded to this matter of selfishness, that it is the occasion of darkness in our souls. It is certain to occasion darkness. Now they have found the way of life, are they to be selfish? Deliverance has come to them. Are they to use what they get selfishly? This, indeed, is the secret of the whole matter in this passage, that
{83}
they immediately judge themselves and abandon their selfishness. They thus become persons who think for others. If I am not capable of thinking for others, I am scarcely worth speaking of morally. As soon as I begin to think of others, to deny selfishness, to act in any measure in love, I am a testimony to God.
These men are now sharing in the deliverance that moving in the light has brought them to. They are not selfish. For a moment they were, but they are able to judge themselves. "We are not doing right", they said. How many there are who, although obtaining deliverance through the gospel, are not doing right afterwards! Let us challenge our hearts, dear brethren, as to this matter. Are we doing right? Deliverance according to Romans, the great foundational epistle, leads a believer to find his feet; and he says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". One constantly comes back to this -- that a believer finds his feet; but in what way? "*I myself*" I am resolved to be a righteous man, to do the will of God. And these men say "We are not doing right". They might have carried on and hidden all the wealth there was in the camp of the Syrians, but they did not right in doing it, and judged their conduct. Hence the next chapter in Romans says, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" (@Romans 8: 4).
So that guidance, such as I am speaking of now, leads into that position -- that I begin to see that I must do the will of God. God is not helping me to acquire my own selfish ends at all. He is helping me in order that I may reflect Him, at least in some little way. "We are not doing right", they say. "Let us go and tell the king's household", we should not be acting selfishly. The secret of the want of guidance with many of God's people is just this, that
{84}
selfishness is at the bottom of their exercises; whereas a righteous holy calculation in a time of uncertainty will certainly bring us into light. Even although it is dusk at the beginning, it will gradually lead us on into the clear shining of the day, and in the light of that day I judge myself, and walk in the light as God is in the light. If I am doing what is wrong, I am not in the way of God. So they tell the king's household. Let us not forget the king's household. If light and deliverance have come through the guidance I have been speaking of, I am not to be selfish in the result, but unselfish. "If we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another" (@1 John 1: 7); that is, we think of the king's household. Let us not forget. No selfish person really thinks of the king's household. He thinks of himself. Seeking the king's household is consideration for the Lord and His people.
So that we shall find a clear shining of day as we calculate righteously and spiritually. It may be just dusk for a while, but it will be gradually the clear shining of God, and I walk in that. And, as I said, as walking in the light as God is in the light, we have fellowship with one another. We think of the king's household, that is, *all christians*. One challenges one's own heart as to the brethren with whom one is walking, whether one may not be too narrow, forgetting the wideness of the interests of God here below. The more excellent way, the way of surpassing excellence, is to widen out in love, and take account of all that belongs to God in this world. Walking in the light as God is in the light, we think of the brethren. So in this city the Lord is helping His people. Perplexity indeed there may have been, but as we move in whatever little light we have, God will be with us. No one who loves God wants to make one inch of movement until he is assured
{85}
that he is right; and as it is right, God is in it. God will soon make it manifest that He is in it, and we shall come to the king's household. In this city we are in it in relation to everyone that belongs to God in it.
Well now, I want to show from Acts 16 how the apostle Paul and those who laboured with him moved. As I have been saying, the Lord could easily have told Paul that the preaching was to be in Europe; but He did not do so. The Spirit, we are told, would not allow him to preach the word in Asia, verse 6, and verse 7 says, "having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them". All that is searching. Is there something wrong with Paul? Could another serve better than he in those fields? That would be the way it would come to him. Twice over he is hindered. Do not go there, the Spirit says, and yet He does not tell Paul where to go. These are remarkable things. The point is, Can I transfer this to myself? Can each of us enquire as to himself, why these happenings, why these circumstances? Well, the apostle Paul does not seem to be overwhelmed by uncertainty. A vision appears in the night to him (verse 9). The night suggests that there was some darkness, but there was a vision, and it appeared to him. Let us be looking out for this. If the circumstances are extraordinary, there may be other such circumstances which will be light to me. Let me wait for these, for if God brings in one extraordinary circumstance, He can bring in another, and this other may be what I need. So then let me tax my mind; my resolve being to do the will of God. I have begun with that in mind. I have resolved to do nothing else but the will of God. Let me begin with that. Next, Am I selfish in my service? Do I seek a name in it? Do I seek any material gain in it? Let me challenge
{86}
my heart about all these things. Why these baffling things? Something is to be searched out. David says, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my thoughts; And see if there be any grievous way in me; and lead me in the way everlasting" (@Psalm 139: 23, 24). That is a wholesome challenge.
Now this vision in the night appears to Paul, and he hears a Macedonian man speaking. How did he know that it was a Macedonian man? Was it by his dress? It is remarkable that God should take that apparently roundabout way to introduce the testimony into Europe, but it was the way. Immense results were to accrue from all this, and it was most remarkable that the ministry should come into Europe after such severe exercises. That is the point. I have to go through these exercises: the result is so important that I must go through them. God says, as it were, I require you to go through them. Then I must be subject. I have resolved already. I have made a vow as in Romans that I will serve God's law. God is pleased with that. Every moment of my life that I carry out that resolve I am pleasing to God. Now He says, Do not go there. Well, where shall I go? There is no evidence that Paul was perturbed. A Macedonian man says, "Pass over into Macedonia and help us".
I have now come to the verse that was in mind in reading this passage (verse 10). "And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings". I want the brethren to look at this expression, "concluding". A process has been gone through, a series of circumstances, causing perhaps uncertainty, but now the facts are all put together in the renewed, righteous mind of the apostle, and he *concludes*. He concluded
{87}
what was right, and that is "that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings". With what firm tread the apostle would move on, as indeed, we are told, he did, from Troas, where he was, to Philippi! He had extraordinarily painful experiences in Philippi, but still the sequel shows great results. The gospel came into Europe to stay for eighteen centuries with the most blessed results.
Now the final passage, in John 6, bears on all that I have said. They wanted to make the Lord king. He had been feeding the multitude, and the men who witnessed this sign wished to make Him king, and He goes up into a mountain. His disciples go into a ship to cross the sea. He does not tell them to do it. According to Matthew and Mark He did tell them, but not according to John, who says, "But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea, and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to Capernaum". That is what they did, coming to a decision themselves. According to the subsequent verses they did what was right. They did what was the only thing to do at the moment. The Lord did not tell them to do it, according to this passage. He had gone up -- He was alone -- pointing to our dispensation, in which He has gone up. As the Lord was about to be taken up from the apostles, as you will remember, He said many things to them; but in various matters He left them to decide what would be done: as for instance, to appoint another apostle. So it is that the Lord taxes, as it were, our growth and experience. He would say to you: You do that, I leave it with you. He has given us understanding. John says, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true" (@1 John 5: 20). What is that understanding for? It is to do what has to be done. If it is to be done, do it, do not ask the Lord; ask Him for help, of
{88}
course, but what thy hand finds to do, do it. An apostle had to be appointed, and they selected two, and put the two before God, "and the lot fell on Matthias".
Here in John 6 the Lord does not say, Go across to Capernaum; but they did that. The Lord intended them to do it, and they did it. Having gone they rowed twenty-five or thirty stadia, and this exercise is noted. The Spirit of God tells us about how many stadia they rowed. Is it for nothing that we are told? Was it in self-will? No; they are going in the right direction. The Spirit tells us what they did, and they having done it, the Lord walks on the water so that they see Him. He says, "It is I: be not afraid:" as much as to say, You are going in the right direction, and I am coming to support you in what you are doing. Is that not comforting? Let us then be honest men and women in our circumstances, let us think honestly, according to the instincts of the work of God. He will certainly make a way for us. And so the passage here says, as you will observe, "But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid. They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went". Not where He went, but to which *they* went. He is honouring them. The end is reached. The end that you have in mind is reached and the Lord is saying, I am with you in it. They received Him gladly into the ship, and as they did, the end is reached. That is what I had in mind to call attention to at this time. We have arrived at difficult times. Paul says, "difficult times shall be there" (@2 Timothy 3: 1). They are here now. Let us be honest men and women. Let us challenge our hearts as to what is in them, what our motives are, whether they are selfish motives, or whether they are the more
{89}
excellent way, the way of love. In the latter the Lord is with us, saying, "It is I". As we receive Him into our matters, the end is reached at once, reached by us, and it is the right end, that which is according to God.
{90}
THE INHERITANCE AND ITS BORDERS
@Ezekiel 47: 13, 14; @Ezekiel 48:1, 20; @Psalm 45: 7 - 11
J.T. It is in view to call attention to certain thoughts that God intends should be in our minds as in His service. These thoughts in connection with the inheritance which we share together as in assembly as brethren, show how provision is made for Christ to have two portions, as seen in Joseph. The last is an outstanding thought in this section. Then the borders of the land as in the remaining part of chapter 47, with provision made for the stranger, in verses 22 and 23.
Chapter 48 shows the inheritance of each tribe from the east to the west, there being no irregular borders as in the book of Joshua. Beginning with verse 8 to the end of 22 we have the Spirit of God enlarging on the portion that is called "the heave offering", as that which is for God in general. Other thoughts appear, particularly the city at the end, wherein the tribes appear again, but in general that is what is in mind in Ezekiel, in these passages. The psalm confirms the place of Christ as Beloved, "anointed ... with the oil of gladness above thy companions", corresponding with the portions for Joseph first mentioned. Then, in the psalm, we have the position of the queen, and the power of forgetfulness, which also corresponds with Joseph, who learned in Egypt to forget his toil and his father's house. These thoughts I think may be profitable to consider at this time. It is a matter of importance what is in our minds in sitting down together at the Lord's supper and proceeding with the service of God, for our minds are to be enriched. There are many other features, but the thought is that Christ as seen in Joseph might be before us now.
{91}
E.W.C. Does it suggest that as Joseph inherited with his people in their entrance into the inheritance, Joseph having two portions amongst the brethren, that the Lord inherits now with His people?
J.T. It brings the Lord in as amongst us, but provision is made for His personal distinction. The passage directs our minds to Genesis, where Joseph is a leading typical figure.
E.B.McC. In what is determined by God here, that Joseph should have the double portion, is there the recognition of who he is and of what he has wrought?
J.T. The reaction of scripture to what had been said earlier is remarkable. The references to Genesis throughout Scripture are outstanding, and Joseph represents a spiritual thread particularly in Genesis. Jacob represents the Father; of course, Abraham does too, but Jacob moved out of Padan-Aram as Joseph was born, implying that Joseph gives the spiritual touch, and throughout the history of Jacob, Joseph is in mind. He is the loved one, Jacob loved him above all his sons. Psalm 45 is 'a song of the Beloved'. Joseph in Egypt typifies Christ amongst the gentiles; Jacob moves out to him there. Genesis 48 brings out the father's affections and the sovereign placing of families, including Joseph's place as having one portion above his brethren. That thought is to be kept in mind throughout. It is in view now in Ezekiel, and comes in in view of the inheritance which the tribes are to share together.
Rem. Joseph was only very young when put in front of his mother.
J.T. You are alluding to @Genesis 33, where Jacob's meeting with Esau is mentioned. The incident shows that Joseph is the spiritual link in the book of Genesis in the history of Jacob.
E.B.McC. We see him glorified by his father by
{92}
the gift of the coat of many colours. He is distinguished in that way with glory.
J.T. He is marked out, and begins his mission as a revealer of secrets in that chapter in a household way. His dreams refer to the household, his father and mother and eleven brothers. Then his interpretations are seen in prison, then in the royal court of Pharoah; so that as we follow Joseph in Genesis, we are on spiritual lines and reach the father; he is subordinate to the father, but honoured in that he has a double portion.
A.M.H. Whilst God, the Father, has given Christ this special portion, are you bringing Ezekiel before us to show that we give it to Him? As for instance in the @Song of Songs 2: 3, "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons".
J.T. Yes. Ezekiel adds greatly to the idea of the inheritance, it varies from what we get in Joshua, giving straight lines for dividing the tribes, all sharing alike. The passage says, "ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers; and this land shall fall to you for inheritance". Then we have "the border of the land", that is, the boundary. But, as we have said, the outstanding thought is that provision is made for Christ at the outset. Whilst He shares with us, and is recognised in a mutual way, yet His Person is always guarded. In chapter 48 from verse 8 to the end of verse 22, we have God's portion, of which much more is made, of course, and this should be noticed in this setting. It is to be in mind in regard to the assembly; such a great portion is for God. It is called the heave-offering. "The whole heave-offering shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand; ye shall offer the holy heave-offering foursquare with the possession of the city".
{93}
We get this at the end where all the tribes are represented, "and the name of the city from that day, Jehovah is there". In connection with these thoughts we have the presence of God.
E.W.C. What is the distinction between the setting of the inheritance here, and the setting in Joshua?
J.T. As already remarked, the possessions of the tribes in Joshua had irregular boundaries, and one tribe seems to encroach on another, and this might cause irritation. There is nothing of that in Ezekiel. The inheritance is apportioned in Joshua first to those who valued the inheritance, that is Judah and Joseph. Judah, as represented in Caleb, comes forward asking for his inheritance; and Joseph comes forward in the daughters of Zelophehad. They get their inheritance first. The remaining tribes obtained their inheritance by lot at Shiloh, Joshua having rebuked them for their slothfulness. In this section of Ezekiel we have great spiritual wealth contemplated; the river of God, that flows out of the house being mentioned here. A river is a source of wealth; the saints take on the wealth afforded to them by the Spirit, so that there is no danger of irritation being caused by what might appear irregular, that is some possessing more than others. These are the thoughts that are to be in our minds; the wealth of the river, then the boundaries of the inheritance, as the passage says, "This shall be the border whereby ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel". Then there is Joseph; let us not forget that Joseph has the extra allotment -- two portions; Christ is at once set in your mind. Before there is any allotment we must always make room for Christ.
C.F.I. Are these portions suggested in Psalm 45?
{94}
J.T. We shall come to that, and we shall see that the link is with Joseph in the psalm, the heading of which refers to the Beloved, and full provision is made for Him. Christ is the King, and the writer is welling up with good matter concerning Him; he is full of Christ who has affected his heart powerfully. Christ is seen as anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions. That brings us to our chapter here. The companions come in afterwards, each getting a portion on the feminine side which the psalm indicates, because the queen is in mind. Joseph's wife was a gentile, and in Egypt he learned to forget his toil and his father's house; the allusion is to a state of forgetfulness of what is unsuitable in the assembly. The daughter is to forget, too. "Hearken, daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; and forget thine own people and thy father's house". That brings us into accord with Joseph, it is a question of state, whether we are free as though those relationships did not exist; free from all natural links.
Rem. As carrying these thoughts in our minds, we would be enriched in our service Godward.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Scripture is full of thoughts we should have, and they are essential to prosperity in the service of God.
C.H.H. Is the double portion of Joseph in relation to divine service a necessary regulating thought? I was thinking of the intimacy that love brings us into, but the true Joseph is still to have the double portion?
J.T. That is never to be lost sight of, and then the straight lines of Ezekiel 48 are regulating. There is no suggestion of any irritation or anything to grieve the Spirit in the service. Then there is the great scope given to the divine portion, that which is *for God*. We must distinguish between what is for Joseph, as related to the tribes, and what is for God.
{95}
The holy heave-offering is for God, and this comes in as outstanding in the chapter from verse 8 to 22. It requires great attention to get the details as to the measurements, but clearly the proportionate extent of the heave-offering is very great.
C.F.I. What is the link in the service of God in passing over from what is due to Christ, and what is due to God?
J.T. You can see that Christ is in charge of everything, Joseph represents that, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". The Lord is over everything in the service as High Priest, and as we proceed, everything must converge on Him. So that it is the *Lord's* supper, hence everything as to it refers to Him. When our position is defined, everything is regular and there is no suggestion of irritation. There is thus room for the Spirit. He will be regarded as the Holy Spirit in relation to the Lord (@1 Corinthians 12: 3), the Spirit of adoption in relation to the Father, and the Spirit of God in relation to God.
A.M.H. Is your thought that we should give more time to the development of what is for God in our gatherings?
J.T. Yes. There should be proper scope for Christ too, but we are limited because of the allotted time for the service. Ezekiel 48 would indicate that a good proportion ought to be for God, and we should never lose sight of that. We have here the city where all the tribes appear, and God is there.
C.F.I. In connection with the portion for God, have you in mind our speaking to God in the light of relationships established in ascension, or on a lower level?
J.T. It is a question of what is in the mind of the person who addresses Him. There is only one word for God in our language, and it would have to be indicated what was in the mind of the speaker if
{96}
he uses the term God in speaking to God. "There is one God, the Father". It would seem as if the service requires that God should be apprehended as the Father and spoken to as the Father, then spoken to viewed as God "all in all" -- it is God all *in* all. That ought to be the great end before us.
E.B.McC. "The king's daughter is all glorious within" would bring in the saints, but Joseph comes in as having a double portion, and God has what is mentioned here -- the great portion.
J.T. That is the way the truth stands, but the feminine side is provided for in the psalm, and it has indeed a great place, verse 9. "Kings¬ daughters are among thine honourable women; upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir". Then, on a lower level, we have, verse 10, "Hearken, daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; and forget thine own people and thy father's house". It seems to me that the word "forget" there should be linked on with Christ as seen in Joseph. It leads us into our own position now. @Ephesians 2: 22 contemplates the *gentiles* "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". "*Ye* also" -- Christ is the chief Corner Stone -- it is a state of forgetfulness in us. Christ, like Joseph, has forgotten His toil and His father's house for the moment, and the daughter is to hearken, and to forget her father's house and her own people. It is a state of forgetfulness -- things that are forgotten have their legitimate place, but, as in assembly, we are free of them for the moment.
L.M. Does that state of forgetfulness depend on satisfaction?
J.T. It requires power in the soul, too; in partaking of the Lord's supper we need power to *call Him to mind*. It is an active power in the mind, power to bring in what is positive, to bring Christ to mind. It is the same power in forgetfulness, the
{97}
power in the mind to forget, not simply that we lay the thing aside, but we are in a state of forgetfulness as to all that is extraneous at the moment.
L.D.M. How much depends on the saints sitting down in satisfaction and being able to move forward as drinking into one Spirit!
C.F.I. Would you say we can be there in the restful liberty suggested in the queen standing on the right hand in gold of Ophir?
J.T. Yes. The queen is the *full* feminine thought in assembly service, answering to Christ; He has her at His right hand. He would have some answer to Himself in that respect, but the *way to it* is that the daughter inclines her ear and forgets her own people and her father's house. There is the power of forgetfulness of what is merely natural. The things might be legitimate at other times, but not now -- it is a state we get into. It all lies in the Spirit. First, focus the mind. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7: 25). I have *control* of it, and by that power we call Christ to mind in the memorials. Correspondingly we have power to forget.
W.H.W. It needs the power of the renewed mind (@Romans 12: 2). Is there significance in the fact that before we get what is due to God, Judah is brought in -- his name means praise.
J.T. The heave-offering is between Judah and Benjamin. Verse 7 brings in Judah and verse 23 Benjamin, "And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin one portion". It is Judah and Benjamin, the same link which existed under Joshua. We have excellent relations between these. Judah is the leading brother, and in Psalm 68 we have "little Benjamin".
F.J.F. Is there any difference between the power of forgetfulness and the power of abstraction, that we had before us previously?
{98}
J.T. It is a cognate thought. Really, the power of abstraction enables us to forget, shutting out all else.
E.B.McC. In referring to the queen in Psalm 45, you said that this is the highest thought of the assembly.
J.T. It is the greatest thought in this connection, it is not the body, but a royal position that she is in. The queen at His right is an abstract thought in the service. We have suggested here the *full* thought of the assembly, which is ever before the Lord. He loved the assembly and gave Himself for it -- the whole thought is always in His mind, and He would have it in our minds. We *come* to it, by way of the daughter, who hearkens and forgets.
W.H.W. Does the queen give us the thought of His complement?
J.T. It does, but here it is not the body, but a royal thought which He would ever have before Him, and would look for an answer to in the service; yet not to enlarge it unduly, but as making room for the holy heave-offering for God. All must have God in view, "of him ... and for him are all things".
E.W.C. What is suggested by the Lord forgetting? In what connection does He forget?
J.T. He forgets His relations with Israel. God had made Joseph to forget his toil and his father's house. God made him do that. It was the state he was in, so he had no ungratified longings in Egypt. It was a state by itself. God had made him to forget, otherwise he would have longed for his father's house and sought to go back to it; but Jacob and his family go to him. The type requires this.
E.B.McC. Joseph says, "Tell my father of all my glory in Egypt".
{99}
J.T. That was to bring his father there, so Jacob comes out. It is all a spiritual matter. If you follow the thread represented in Joseph you will reach the Father, outside of judaism, in a state of forgetfulness of all that attaches to the natural.
F.J.F. Was that power seen in Paul?
J.T. The link with the Jews was very strong with him, but he overcame it. It is remarkable, but I suppose his history is intended to show us how strong the Jewish link was; the link with his brethren in the flesh. He should not have gone to Jerusalem, but it was because of his love for them that he went; the mystery requires a state of forgetfulness of all that.
C.H.H. Is the suggestion in chapter 47 that in mutuality and the power of forgetfulness the inheritance is entered into, and the outcome is that God gets His full portion?
J.T. Yes. This is a matter to be looked into each by himself. Such wonderful measurements we get in the holy heave-offering, proportionally very large and specified, whereas the portions for the tribes are not measured at all. The thought I have is that the brethren are not thinking of that, they are not enlarging on their portion; God is everything.
C.H.H. Do we spend too much time in the divine service on our own portion as against the goodly portion that is mentioned here for God?
J.T. No doubt. The assembly has God in view: glory to God in the assembly.
W.H.W. Does the link with Joseph act in setting us free from the world, as suggested in Jacob leaving Padan-Aram?
J.T. That is the beginning of the spiritual touch right through in Jacob. As Joseph is born he proposes to leave Padan-Aram. He was detained, but what was the thought. The time had now come
{100}
to leave. It runs right through till he is with Joseph in Egypt outside of Canaan. We have in the river here, chapter 47, a very remarkable type of spiritual power and fruitfulness. In it the Spirit brings Himself before us. We have in @John 16: 13, "he shall not speak from himself;" not that He does not speak of Himself, but not *from* Himself; it is what He hears He speaks. We are constantly brought back to the Spirit. In Ezekiel 47, after the prophet has found out that the river cannot be passed through, he says (verses 6 and 7), "he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river. When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other". As we carefully go back to any subject in Scripture, we are sure to see something we had not seen before. So these trees are the fruit of the river, in fact he calls it "the double river" in the second section, showing that the thought is *increasing* in his mind, and these trees are there, all pointing to fruitfulness.
W.H.W. Does all this suggest the great spiritual wealth that we may draw upon in connection with the service of God?
J.T. That is the end in mind in the book of Ezekiel. Up to the end of chapter 39 we have generally Israel's failure and God's faithfulness to her, but from chapter 40 onwards, the ministry bears on the service of God. The more we look into these chapters the more enriched we shall be, specially in regard to this river -- it is to be proved in one's experience. It is an infinite thought, involving the Spirit, who is a divine Person. It is said to be "a river that I could not pass through". You come back and see something not seen before. That is a point of greatest importance in divine things, specially in regard to divine Persons. We are brought back to a passage often considered, and see something different, something new. In verse 7
{101}
it says "When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other".
F.W.W. It would encourage us to be on the lookout for new fruit.
J.T. That is just the point in going back. Verse 6, "And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? And he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river. When I returned ..." That is the thing, the man brought him back, but he returned, that is, he was interested. "Behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. And he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east district, and go down into the plain, and go into the sea; when they are brought forth into the sea, the waters thereof shall be healed". He is brought back and learns that "by the river, upon its bank, on the one side and on the other, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, nor their fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, for its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine". That is very remarkable.
D.R. Should we be continually expectant of fresh disclosures in this service?
J.T. On those lines. He says the man brought him back, and *he* returned. He was fully with his leader, therefore you get all this, down to the end of verse 12, in regard to the river.
L.D.M. He is brought back to the door of the house.
J.T. Yes. "He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward" (chapter 47: 1). It is as brought back that Ezekiel sees the waters issuing from the house. Leadership is a thought running through these chapters, beginning with the
{102}
fortieth. As we are amenable to spiritual leadership we shall get fresh disclosures.
F.W.W. What do you mean by that?
J.T. What we have in these meetings as we come together in a mutual way. Where room is made for the Spirit things can come up freshly. So here we find remarkable freshness, vitality and fruitfulness from the river. And then how Christ is honoured in these circumstances, as we have noted. There is a double portion for Joseph, and the brethren are content with what they have. They are not vying with one another, but are content with their portion, and there is a full portion for God -- the holy heave-offering; and the administrative state in the city where all the tribes are represented, and God is there.
H.R. Does the question of leadership and the moral state of the people, as in Joshua, have to be established before the division of the land?
J.T. That is what the earlier chapters of Joshua bring out, especially at Gilgal where the reproach of Egypt was rolled away, where they ate the old corn of the land. The inheritance is given to heavenly people, and typically they were brought into a state of heavenly-mindedness.
F.J.F. Should we always be ready to give the Lord His double portion, leaving time for what is for God?
J.T. That is my thought, and in the assembly we recognise the authority of Christ. When Rebecca arrived at the end of the journey, Isaac was in the field coming from the well at Beer-lahai-roi, and he was meditating. Rebecca enquired who was the man, and the servant replied, "My master!" He did not say, 'My master's son'. It was a question of the general position in which the assembly is set. Christ as Lord is owned there. The Holy Spirit maintains that. Joseph was lord of all Egypt, but as
{103}
type of Christ, according to what we get here, he is one of the brethren, but as among the brethren he has a double portion; that is to say, when the Lord recognises us as His brethren, we make provision for His Person. He is not just one of us, He is above us, but He is pleased to be amongst us.
W.H.W. He graciously identifies Himself with us as His brethren. We on our side recognise that He is above us, being anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions. When Judah recognised Joseph's position, it seems to result in Joseph expressing his affection for Benjamin.
J.T. The link between Judah and Benjamin is very interesting. How beautifully Judah speaks about him in @Genesis 44. I think Benjamin is abstractly *the brother;* the overcomer. In the circumstances, he is always an object of his father's affections. Judah is the brother in activity, the brother who knows what to say, who understands the father's feelings, and understands Benjamin, too, and the place relatively he had in the family. We need these two thoughts. The abstract thought links us definitely with Christ, because Benjamin is more a brother to Joseph than any of the others, being of the same mother. Joseph gives him that place, too, in the disclosures in @Genesis 45, but Judah is the one who prevails above his brethren for good. The king comes from Judah, "of him came the chief ruler".
C.H.H. You spoke of the oil of gladness -- would you say a little more about that? It seems very attractive.
J.T. The assembly ought to be the place of gladness, not a place of dolefulness. The Lord's supper promotes gladness and satisfaction.
C.F.I. He is not ashamed to call us brethren. But we give Him His distinctive place, and that would make way for the heave-offering for God.
{104}
J.T. Yes; as He is fully owned. We see in these allotments in Ezekiel 48, that when we come to Judah, we get the heave-offering, which is suggestive, because he is the active brother; he understands. In Genesis he brings about the full result in Joseph; whilst Judah is speaking, Joseph could not control himself, and had every man put out. He would make himself known to his brethren. It is Judah's speech and attitude that affect him; so you feel it is in keeping with this that the heave-offering comes in by the border of Judah; and when that is described, we get Benjamin.
E.B.McC. When the state exists in the assembly where He is free to declare the Father's name unto His brethren, would that link on here?
J.T. Just so. Judah is the brother who is practical in the assembly. What he says in Genesis brings about the change. Joseph would have everyone put out now. It is now a time for family relations and affections. Joseph calls attention to his mouth to show it was himself, and then the special expression of affection towards Benjamin, and he kissed and wept on all his brothers. He also sends his father a message.
E.B.McC. There is a remarkable state of mind found in @Psalm 45. The mind is fixed, under control, and thus brings in rich thoughts as to Christ. "Thou art fairer than the sons of men". It would greatly enrich us if our minds were set in that way.
J.T. It is one of the Maschil psalms, a psalm of instruction, a song of the Beloved, a very rich psalm. It alludes to the power of the Spirit in the soul, making much of Christ, the heart welling up with the good matter of what it has composed. The service of song comes in under David, and David, of course, is of Judah. "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah and bring him to his people". This would include prayer. Judah is marked by prayer. David
{105}
prayed, Solomon prayed; also Hezekiah; and Jabez (@1 Chronicles 4: 10). The king is subservient to the service of God, but kingship is required because of its power, as in David, to make provision for the service as depicted in 1 Chronicles. What David was and did is attributed to the tribe of Judah. When Israel came out of Egypt "Judah was his sanctuary" (@Psalm 114: 2). You can understand why Judah's portion is given, and then the holy heave-offering involving the service of God, and then Benjamin. The same thing is seen in Jerusalem, which really belonged to Benjamin, but it came to Judah, being a supreme thought in connection with David; meaning that true brotherly feelings and love prevailed between Judah and Benjamin.
W.H.W. Love in that way doing away with boundaries, would you say?
J.T. Quite so; love overcomes, it never fails us. It was in the divine mind that Jerusalem should be in the hands of Judah, the city of the great King. The Lord Himself calls it that, but it primarily belonged to Benjamin.
F.J.F. So those happy relationships among the brethren lie behind the service.
J.T. If the relations are not right, as seen here, you cannot have the heave-offering, what God would stress. What we are looking at now is the beautiful relations amongst the tribes, nothing to cause friction, no irregular borders. If God allows angles to cause discipline, that is His way, but not here in actual service.
L.D.M. Here they offer the holy heave-offering foursquare with the possession of the city. Is that what you have been saying as to the brethren being together and God getting His portion, "foursquare with the possession of the city".
J.T. The city is an additional thought to bring in the administrative side. The heave-offering is one
{106}
thing, but the city seems to be treated as the administrative side by itself, and all the tribes are there again in another setting, three on each side, and then Jehovah is there (chapter 48). The administrative side secures the presence of God week in and week out amongst us in a general way.
E.B.McC. Conditions should be such that the holy heave-offering and the sanctuary are found in the midst of the brethren.
F.J.F. We get the apostle rising to the thought of God at the end of certain sections of his ministry. He bursts out into worship.
J.T. That is in keeping with the Lord's words, "my Father and your Father ... my God and your God". God is the final thought. "God ... all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15: 28), not God all and all, but all *in* all. The state in the saints makes room for Him and no room for anything else.
{107}
ENTERING THE HOLIEST
@Psalm 72: 20; @Psalm 73: 1 - 28
In what I have to say at this time, David will be prominent. He is mentioned in the verse read in Psalm 72: "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended". Were they all written down we would have had a large book of prayer. No doubt allusion is made in this verse to the fact that he was characterised by prayer. Why should his prayers be ended? We have to enquire into this matter. David is clearly honoured by the Spirit of God calling attention to his prayers; as indeed all who pray characteristically are honoured. Solomon's prayer, recorded in @1 Kings 8, is the longest in Scripture, and God said to him, "I have heard thy prayer;" not only did God hear it, but as it was finished, He signalised it by filling with glory the house that Solomon had built. God so valued that prayer.
I mention these facts for our encouragement, that we may be marked by prayer. The Lord, the true Solomon and the true David, speaking to men said that "they should always pray and not faint". He is Himself seen praying, as you will remember, some ten times in Luke, mentioned there, no doubt, because priesthood is in mind. Priests are marked by prayer; we are a holy priesthood and should be marked by prayer. God honours us as praying; even the Lord Jesus Himself, as He was praying, was acknowledged from heaven, according to Luke, as the Father's beloved Son; and indeed it was "as he prayed", Luke says, that He was transfigured before His disciples; God thus honours prayer. Luke further tells us that one of His disciples asked Him to teach them to pray. Just after the narrative of His visit to Martha's house, he says, "And it came to pass as he was in a certain place praying,
{108}
when he had ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray" (@Luke 11: 1), which He did. Doubtless He had Mary and Martha in His mind when He was praying. All these facts are most important for us at this time when prayer is so essential.
I proceed now to show by the Lord's help, how these Psalms, 72 and 73, fit into the present moment -- the former referring to David's prayers ending, and the latter introducing his great musician and singer, Asaph. My remarks in the main will refer to these two great servants of God, having the service of God in the sanctuary in mind. Great stress has been laid upon it of recent years, and it will continue, for God is looking for the very best from His people at the present time. David and Asaph represent this; they represent in type the best that the Holy Spirit produces in the saints for God.
We have other allusions of this kind to David, not in regard to his prayers but in regard to his words. The second book of Samuel records "the last words" of David -- a very formal statement (chapter 23). They allude to kingship. It is important that we should have the light of kingship at the present time. We are living in times foreseen in the book of Daniel, the time of the iron and clay, which do not mix. It is important, therefore, that we should have the light of kingship, which really hinges on sonship. The glory and lustre of royalty depend on sonship, so that @Psalm 2: 6, 7 tells us of the Son and at the same time of God's King. "*I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness". And then to the Son it is, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee". So that sonship and kingship go together. The Son is King, and hence the description that David gives us of kingship refers to Christ. David does not say that he was all that he says a king should be; he was not, nor could any mortal be all that a king should be.
{109}
David's description is abstract, but it has a full concrete expression in Christ. He is all that could be desired in kingship. "The ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God; And he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, A morning without clouds; When from the sunshine after rain, The green grass springeth from the earth" (@2 Samuel 23: 3, 4). He is, in a word, a divine provision, *par excellence*, for man. It is what David says in his last words. If we have not David himself, we have his last words brought down to us by inspiration, and the Holy Spirit within us giving fulness to them, so that we should have kingship in our hearts and be able like the psalmist in @Psalm 45: 1 to say, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer". It is a feature of moment in these modern times as they become more and more accentuated and every godly man is concerned. David's last words are intended to have a great place in our hearts that there is such a King, not simply a desire for Him, but the very King Himself in all His infinite greatness, the King of kings, sitting at the right hand of God. David's last words are to be honoured in our souls in the power of the Spirit, so that we might go through the maze of current political principles as they become more and more oppressive, and that we might be subject to the powers that be, whatever their character. At the same time, we should have the sense of victory in our souls in the apprehension of the King as described by David.
Another thing that comes out in David's last words refers to young people. By the last words of David, the Levites were numbered from twenty years and upwards instead of twenty-five or thirty. In a typical sense young people are thus authorised to take part in assembly service five years earlier
{110}
than was usual. That David should have thought of this in his last words is of great significance, especially as the statement is found in relation to the service of God. Let us read these scriptures as applying to ourselves. That is how we get the force of them. Let young people here read @1 Chronicles 23, with the thought that it is written for *them*, that they have a right from God to take part in the assembly at an early age. It is as if the Spirit of God was thinking of you young people, even centuries ago, so that you should be free to take part as regulated by other scriptures in the divine service, beginning at twenty years of age. You will understand it is not literal, that it is a question of spiritual stature, and that the service of God in the land -- in the assembly viewed thus -- is less onerous than it is in the wilderness. That is the point that David makes. Young people, as believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. Thus they are qualified to have part in the assembly, "in whom *ye* also have trusted, ... having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquires possession" (@Ephesians 1: 13, 14). Hence we are made sensible that we are the property of God. We are anointed, sealed, and have the earnest of the Spirit. These three things together make us rich in whatever part we have in the divine service. In type, all this is by the last words of David.
Now we come to his last prayer. This Psalm 72 presents Solomon to us. It is an extension of David's last words in which he describes what a king should be. Now he is praying about him, and so the psalm begins, "O God, give the king thy judgments, and thy righteousness unto the king's son". The king's son is in mind; it is as if David and Solomon sat together on the throne.
{111}
They did sit together on the throne, as the Lord Jesus sits on His Father's throne. And so we are told that David made Solomon king. The chapter does not say he sat *actively* on the throne with his father, but he sat on it and we may be sure, graced it. He is the son, and it is as if in our psalm, David prayed for him at that time. He prayed for the king, but the king's son is in mind throughout the psalm. David says, "He will judge thy people with righteousness, and thine afflicted with judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills, by righteousness. He will do justice to the afflicted of the people; he will save the children of the needy, and will break in pieces the oppressor".
The whole psalm is about the king. Among many other things, we are told (verses 10 - 17), "The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render presents ... prayer shall be made for him continually; all the day shall he be blessed ... His name shall endure for ever ... all nations shall call him blessed". You see an enlargement of David's last words, but this is a prayer -- but a prayer of certainty. I bring it into the present moment because it really refers to Christ as He is now; it is the Solomonic character of Christ in view of the millennium, and that, I believe, is why we are told that the prayers of David are ended. Everything is now secured from the standpoint of kingship and is "Yea" and "Amen" in Christ. It is as sure as the foundations of the earth that every matter referring to government is finally reached in Christ. We may have to endure much, as the next psalm, the exercise of Asaph, shows, which I hope to enlarge on a little as applicable to us; but Psalm 72 is Christ as He is above in His Solomonic character. Every divine thought as to kingship, as to rule, is there infallibly. *We have nothing to ask for in that respect*. There is nothing to be added to what
{112}
is there. It is final. It is only a moment, and it will be applicable to all here below. There is nothing at all to be asked for in regard to what is of Christ above. The prayers of David are ended. I stress this because we need it. We are in troublous times, the times of the iron and the clay, particularly of the clay. It is a state of things in which there is no certainty, for iron and clay do not mix, we are told. There is no fusion. It is one or the other, but whatever prevails it will only be for a moment.
For believers, it is a question of endurance, a question of our intelligent endurance, and to know how to behave ourselves in such a state of things. In spite of the fact that it is the iron and clay, it is part of the four monarchies that God has ordained. Things are more difficult for us as we reach this point, but nevertheless God furnishes us with what is needed so that we might go through. We are to go through, and in going through to be like God in Christ. How He behaved in the presence of an unrighteous politician, and yet one called "the governor" in Matthew, the governmental gospel! Although Pilate is constantly called a governor at the end, yet he is a most unrighteous politician. He says, "I find no fault in him" and yet he hands Him over to the scourgers, and finally to those who put Him to death. Nevertheless, the Lord says to him, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above" (@John 19: 11).
Pilate enquired, "Thou art the king of the Jews?" The Lord said, "Thou sayest it ... I have been born for this ... that I might bear witness to the truth" (@John 18: 33 - 37). He is the true King. Every divine thought of kingship is there infallibly, and that is why we do not need to pray on that line. It is all finished. The Lord is just waiting for the Father's moment. The Father has kept everything in His own power till the Lord Jesus takes charge
{113}
here below. The day is appointed, but it is kept in the Father's power and only waiting for the clock, as it were, to strike and all will be put in movement, and this wonderful kingship described by David will come into public effect. Hence, the word is, "Have patience, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the Lord" (@James 5: 7). Well now, that is Psalm 72.
Psalm 73 is by Asaph, the leading singer in David's economy. He was a prophet, too, a most remarkable man. He wrote eleven of the psalms in this third book of Psalms, so that he is a very interesting servant, an instructed man. This first Psalm in the book, which is his, gives us an account of his experience in regard to the wicked. What is up in heaven is all certain. David's prayers are ended, and Asaph is not praying for what David is not praying for. Everything is as clear as noon-day up there. Everything is final and just waiting for the day so that it may begin to take effect. I may say it is taking effect now in a spiritual way in ourselves as here this afternoon, with hundreds of others like us who love the Lord Jesus in His kingship and who bow to Him. The first thing a believer in Christ does normally is to confess Him -- that Jesus Christ is Lord. That is His kingship. His title is Lord in the christian economy, but this is kingship. That is what is in it, so that, as I said, it is taking effect in this moral way, called the kingdom of God. But His kingship as applied in a coming day, the millennium, is what David had in mind. "All kings shall bow down before him".
And then, as I said, Asaph presents the experience of those of us who have the Spirit down here. That is what this third book would instruct us in. In spite of the place that God has given Christ in heaven there are the wicked down here, and as soon as the Holy Spirit came down, men were
{114}
mocking at him (@Acts 2: 13). Peter tells us, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (@Acts 2: 33). You can understand that Asaph, had he been present, would have asked why the people on the streets of Jerusalem should be mocking at the presence of the Holy Spirit. This psalm is to teach us that the wicked are for a time allowed to continue. It is the day of grace. God is bringing out a wonderful thing in the interval between the advent of the Spirit and the time when Christ will reign. This wonderful thing is what we rightly call christianity, the kingdom of God as it is *now*. It has continued all these centuries, and hence the need of patience, in view of the Lord's coming, is stressed in Scripture. These men are mocking, but Peter did not call fire to come down from heaven on them. He explained to them what the Spirit meant here below. Then he goes on to say that this same Spirit is available to them; "Repent, and be baptised each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 2: 38). Then he says, "For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call". This has been going on for eighteen hundred years. That is *God*, dear brethren, His wonderful patience, His longsuffering being salvation. And He is calling upon us to be like Himself, like what He was in Jesus. The Lord said, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above" (@John 19: 11). Jesus suffered from the ruling powers, and we may be called upon to suffer from them. He suffered death at the hands of Pilate, and yet recognised that Pilate had power from heaven. That is the position.
{115}
Well now, Asaph is in great concern about all this. He does not understand. Many of us perhaps do not, and so he says what covers the whole position. "Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are of a pure heart". That is a very fine saying. It is a general statement; but I may say it and yet be chafing at seeing my neighbours prosper while I am not prosperous in this world's goods. So it is that Asaph says, "But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped; for I was envious at the arrogant, seeing the prosperity of the wicked ... . Their eyes stand out from fatness, they exceed the imaginations of their heart". This is the way he goes on, but is all this the truth? If Asaph were at one of our Bible readings and unfolded all this to us, what would any spiritual person say? He is occupying the time fruitlessly. That is what we should have said. He is mistaken. These men are not nearly so well off as he thinks they are. But still, this is Asaph, one of the greatest servants in David's time. Do we not well to look into this matter as to whether we are not in some little way in his state now? You take the Great War a few years back. What a terrible thing! People say, Where is God? Why are these men allowed power to commit such crimes? Well, it is a good question to face, but then Christ is on God's throne. He is on the Father's throne. If He were on His own throne, He would not have allowed them to go on one second. He will destroy the man of sin with the breath of His mouth. The beast and his lieutenant will be taken alive and cast into the lake of fire. Satan will be bound by one angel, and put into the abyss, when Christ takes His power. Christ is now on His Father's throne and He tells us Himself, "Neither does the Father judge any one" (@John 5: 22). So that as on His Father's throne it is grace. Christ is the Executor of grace, that is the idea; so He gives the Spirit, as Peter says,
{116}
and is giving it now, forgiving people's sins, having the gospel proclaimed from week to week, and so on. That is what Christ is doing, but the change will soon take place, and that is where Asaph missed it. David is encouraged with Christ in heaven and says, 'I have nothing more to pray for', but Asaph has much to pray for, he is in a turmoil. He has no peace. He is envious of the wicked, mistaken about them, talking mistakenly about them, too. That is the thing I want to urge, dear brethren, for we are living in most treacherous times and we are having to do with certain powers that are scorching us, or some of our brethren anyway. This psalm is to show us how to get on in those circumstances, and so Asaph says in verse 17: "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end".
It is all settled now. These men go on for a year, for five years, a decade, twenty-five years. Look at the prophet Daniel. You see them one after another. Take Belshazzar for instance. "In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain". That very night! That handwriting on the wall -- we may look for such handwriting in relation to current history. It is sure to be there in due time. So these great monarchs of old -- take Alexander himself: Daniel sees the great horn broken, and his kingship divided into four parts (@Daniel 8: 8). We see Herod ordering James to be slain with the sword, and to please the Jews taking Peter too, and putting him into prison; but the angel opened the door, and Peter went out. He went to the house of Mary. Nobody touched him; the outer gate even opened of itself. What happened to Herod? He was eaten with worms. That is God, the way God deals with men of this kind. "Then understood I", says Asaph, "their end". You cannot imagine him writing a psalm that is worth anything in the service of God while in such a state as described in the first sixteen
{117}
verses of this Psalm. He says, "Truly God is good". You may say, that is fitting for any psalm; but, when he begins to tell us of his envy of men, prosperous in this world, and being proud and all that, there is nothing there for anyone to get good out of. But we must consider the whole psalm. It is a Psalm, it is an experience, and it is for us to look into it and see whether we do not need to judge ourselves as possessing a state similar to the early part of it, that we are envious of our neighbours, or even our brethren. God would have us delivered from this sort of thing, and Asaph would tell us that if we want to get delivered, we must go "into the sanctuaries of God". Let each read verse 17 over and over again. Underline it, and see if you cannot realise it. The Lord says in @Matthew 6: 6, "But *thou*, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret". That is a thing to be noted, to shut doors when needed; to keep out things that hinder you in your relations with God, and "pray to thy Father who is in secret". Try that in regard to any matter at all that troubles you. The Lord further says, "Thy Father who sees in secret will render it to thee". He will show you that those people that you are envying, that are flourishing like a green bay-tree, will come to nothing in a moment. "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, for the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it" (@Isaiah 40: 7). That is the principle governing poor man, unregenerate, unsaved, in this world. However much power he may seem to have, however much wealth he may seem to have, it is just for a moment and it is gone.
Verse 18 says, "Truly thou settest them in slippery places, thou castest them down in ruins ... As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt thou, Lord, on arising despise their image". When God awakes -- what does that mean? Well, we are told in this
{118}
very book, this third book of Psalms, @Psalm 78: 65, 66, that the Lord "awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine; and he smote his adversaries in the hinder part, and put them to everlasting reproach". That is the idea, and so Asaph says, that when Jehovah awakes He will despise the image of these men. They have their coats of arms, of course. It is remarkable how heraldry comes into view if people want to make a show. How people look up their ancestors, their coats of arms, their seats, if they think these will add anything to them. "Whose is this image and superscription?" Caesar's. "Pay then what is Caesar's to Caesar", is God's word to us at the present moment. What will God do when He awakes? He will despise Caesar and all such. Christ is the image of God. The Holy Spirit puts His stamp on us so that in believers too there is representation of God. God does not despise that, but Asaph says as to these, "Thou, Lord, on arising despise their image". You see the irony with which God will deal with all this that provokes such people as Asaph -- God will deal with them suddenly; they are destroyed in a moment. These are most important things. It is a question of peace in our souls -- restfulness in our souls -- in the midst of the gross darkness and confusion caused by persons in high places. How the soul revolts against it, but God would say as it were, Just be patient and wait and let Me do these things. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord". Your business is grace, to exercise grace. That is the christian's business. That is the service Christ is maintaining at the present time. He is on His Father's throne, and our privilege is to enter the holiest, where we see everything clearly. We see Christ as He is above, and see the means whereby God can do everything and carry out His will. We see how the wicked must go,
{119}
for everything must be according to Christ. Psalm 2 is the basis of it. The divine decree is that everything must be according to the Son.
That is what I see in the holiest, and I come out with shining face, and say to myself, I am just as assured as David was when he finished praying. I see the whole matter settled, and it is settled in Him above as we have in that little hymn of Mr. Wigram's, 'Not a cloud above'. That is Psalm 72. 'Not a spot within', that is Psalm 73. Nothing of myself; the flesh, which darkens the vision, judicially out of the way. Asaph is entirely free now and so he says, "Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand". Let us underline all these verses too -- the confidence that entering the holiest inspires. "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee" -- no longer envying men in their prosperity. I am satisfied. That is the position, dear brethren; that is the state, answering to Psalm 72, which in Psalm 73 bears, according to God, all that conditions here involve; a state that is in those who enter the sanctuaries of God and see everything settled above and everything settled in their own souls, and that it is only a moment and all the evil will be dealt with. The Holy Spirit sets up a millennial state in our souls, and normally every christian is a testimony to that coming glorious day. So that there is a state of happiness, of peace, of satisfaction, developed in Asaph in this psalm. I commend it to the brethren in these days that we are in, so that there might be a testimony for God such as was here in Christ as He appeared before Pilate. James says, "Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you" (@James 5: 6). That is the attitude. God has marked it out for us, that the Spirit of Christ should be seen in us in testimony.
{120}
THE ASSEMBLY A VESSEL FOR DIVINE PURPOSES
@Acts 10: 9 - 12; @1 Corinthians 11: 17 - 25; @1 Corinthians 5: 3 - 5; @1 Corinthians 14: 23 - 25; @2 Corinthians 8: 23, 24
J.T. The object in proposing these scriptures is that we might look at the assembly as the vessel for divine purposes as here on earth. First, for the service of God, the Lord's supper being expressly connected with the assembly as such -- partaking of it, the saints are gathered together in assembly. Then for discipline in chapter 5; for ministry of the word of God, particularly prophecy, chapter 14, inclusive of the temple -- the saints being said to be the temple of God in chapter 3, as having the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit of God dwelling in them collectively; finally, the collection for the saints. All these services or divine uses are connected with the assembly. She will have other functions in the coming age, according to Revelation, and according to Ephesians, but one reading would not suffice to consider all; so that the services contemplated in 1st and 2nd Corinthians are selected as representative of our subject. In using the word "vessel", reference is made to @Acts 10: 11, where what came down, in the vision, is so designated. It was "a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet bound by the four corners". "And this took place thrice, and the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven" (verse 16). This is the Spirit's account of the matter, and Peter uses the word, too, in his account in chapter 11. Being the Spirit's account, it expresses the mind of heaven as regards the thing mentioned, that it is a vessel. The economy relative to the assembly implies not only one thought, or one assembly, but many; what refers to the whole must work out in the sub-divisions, and the idea of a
{121}
vessel must attach to each assembly. The assembly is viewed in Scripture, as in Corinth, as a *whole* idea -- *the* assembly of God in Corinth, not simply what is characteristic; it conveys the completeness. The word, however, is used without the definite article when the apostle speaks of the functioning of the assembly in the locality, as this is characteristic, as in our passage in chapter 11: 18, "when ye come together in assembly". The foregoing is an outline so that we might look into it intelligently.
C.A.I. What is implied in the expression "in assembly"?
J.T. That we are in function. It has often been illustrated by members of a legislature, with the speaker in his place and the mace on the table. The house is in function -- not simply in committee -- it functions. The whole idea is there.
C.A.I. Does it relate definitely to the saints being together in a certain way?
J.T. In relation to one another with their minds in a certain attitude, as of the assembly. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" -- such thoughts govern us as "in assembly".
E.B.McC. You emphasise the thought of a vessel. What is in your mind as to that particular figure being used here?
J.T. It is a word used much in Scripture. We have the word in @Isaiah 22: 24, "they shall hang upon him ... all the small vessels, as well the vessels of cups as all the vessels of flagons". That is, all are dependent on Christ. In a detailed way we have such a vessel as Noah's ark, the great containing vessel used to save him and his house. We have the same idea applied to a coffin. Joseph was embalmed in an ark -- a vessel, evidently; he commanded that they should carry his bones up into Canaan when the people went up, and this was done,
{122}
presumably the same vessel being used. Then we have the idea in the ark of the covenant, and the vessels of service laid on the table of the tabernacle.
E.B.McC. Here it would contain that which is light for the world to come; the heavenly city will be this in the future.
J.T. Applied to the local assembly, it would answer to the assembly as a whole. The Lord said, "On this rock I will build my assembly" (@Matthew 16: 18). It was something for His own use, not exclusively His, for it was God's assembly, but He said "my assembly", and He uses it in the sense of which we are speaking, as the great vessel of service; a containing vessel, too, because of the gifts which are in it. Every divine thought has a place there, so our primary thought is that we might see how important the idea is as in our minds in each locality, and to see whether the concrete thought may be realisable. The thought should be maintained, and each one functioning in it; so that the work of God goes on from that point of view in the locality.
J.S. Is there any distinction between "my assembly" and "the assembly of the living God?"
J.T. The assembly of God, as we have it here, would be the assembly as in relation to God. It is God's assembly. The assembly of the living God would be just to stress the thought of life as over against deadness in current religion and the like; whereas "my assembly" is the Lord inferentially implying that it is His, a very precious thought, too; He uses it for divine purposes; thus it may be viewed as God's or Christ's. We can see that in the working out of the services of the assembly, it is usually God's assembly, the assembly of God. Sometimes the locality is greatly stressed, or the persons in the locality, as in the epistles to "the assembly of Thessalonians" (made up of people in that city) "in God the Father".
{123}
J.R.F. Even in a day of ruin, you would still hold to the thought of the whole body, and the assembly in the locality?
J.T. That is the primary thought; we must get the initial idea that is in God's mind as to the assembly, and see how it works out in the sub-divisions of a locality. We were noting the other day that the word is in the singular in the early chapters of Acts. It is not until chapter 9 where Paul comes on the scene that we have the plural, assemblies, and we find that expression frequently afterwards. In @1 Corinthians 7: 17 Paul says, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", not the assembly; the principle of catholicity is thus preserved, and the whole thought is presented sub-divisionally. Of course, christendom belies all this, and so the apostle began his admonitions by referring to the divisions among them. Christendom is divided by sectarianism; admittedly so; they use the word 'non-sectarian' to gloss it over, as it were, but it does not remove the sects.
Rem. Does the vessel particularly stress the idea of unity, as in the persons composing it?
J.T. It seems so. We have before us the great thought of the one whole, in our respective localities. We hold ourselves in relation to it, and clothe each other in that way as of it, so that it functions; that is one of the greatest things for us, that in every locality where the saints are, it is functioning -- in principle, and in practice, able to stand by itself, although recognising the universal unity. Every local assembly is furnished so as to act for itself, without denying that it is ready to receive help, as furnished of God, from other parts; but the principle is that the assemblies are set up, the apostle choosing elders in each of them (@Acts 14: 23); not only an elder in each, but *elders*. God thus provides for the assemblies. We never read in Scripture
{124}
of one elder having rule over an assembly. We also have deacons mentioned, so that there should be no lack. All these services are to go on; the Lord's supper, and all that enters into that; discipline, ministry, the collection, and all that enters into each service. With reference to the collection, we read in chapter 16: 2, "On the first of the week let each of you put by at home".
C.H.H. Is the governing feature of this vessel that it descends out of heaven?
J.T. Yes. It lifts it off the level of the ordinary so-called churches. The names of the greatest saints have been attached to these churches, but these buildings do not come up to this vessel coming down from heaven, and going up again perfectly intact, because it is knit at the four corners; and it has an immense capacity, for it contains all the creatures that went into the ark. The suggested capacity of the vessel is very remarkable.
L.D.M. Do you get the whole thought in chapter l, "The assembly of God ... in Corinth" and then its catholicity in the thought of "in every place"?
J.T. That is right, *in every place*. We have to determine what a place is sometimes. It involves great difficulty amongst us to determine the boundaries of a place, but the Spirit of God assumes we ought to be able to do it.
J.S. Do the different designations which we have of the assembly convey light as to her heavenly relationships?
J.T. I should say so. The most exalted relation mentioned is "the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" -- the word following is that "the tabernacle of God is with men" (@Revelation 21: 2, 3). These thoughts are all intended to affect us in testimony now.
{125}
T.R.H. In the tabernacle there were vessels: are the thoughts attaching to all these put together in unity in the assembly now?
J.T. Yes. Coming to the New Testament, the vessels are ourselves. One is to be a vessel "to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" (@2 Timothy 2: 21). That should be applicable to everyone in the assembly.
F.J.F. Does the Lord act in regard to the assembly in the same manner as mentioned in all these four instances quoted?
J.T. Yes; but the Lord's supper in itself is what *we* do. In chapter 11 the apostle complains because they were not doing what they should do; what we do is to be according to what Christ did in the institution of the Supper; so that if we apply the word "my assembly" to 1 Corinthians 11, the Lord is in mind, and what is done is after the pattern He set out. It is a question of the way things are done. The Corinthians were doing things very differently, disgracefully, in fact; so Paul says, as to their gatherings, "it is not to eat the Lord's supper" -- so bad was their conduct. Hence, in the verses read, it is a question of the order and the way in which things are done. But the Supper is not all. There is the service of God, which develops out of it. The Lord's supper is a memorial, and through it He comes in amongst us and takes the lead in the matter of the service of God. The assembly is essential to it; He needs it for the service of God, and it runs on into Ephesians where we read, "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".
F.J.F. Is He present as Head when we come together for discipline?
J.T. The apostle is writing apostolically and speaks of himself as present in spirit. He says, "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my
{126}
spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this: to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus" (@1 Corinthians 5: 4, 5). It is clear that the assembly is contemplated. The word is not used, but "ye ... being gathered together" the apostle says. He is there in spirit, which has to be understood in relation to the organism, as indicating a real presence in some sense. He stresses the man "being such" as described, as if to make sure that there was no mistake about what the man was. They ought to be able to say whether the man was really such as was reported, so the action taken would be in the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
L.D.M. Would it help to say a word as to the distinction between gathering together in chapter 5, and then chapter 11 the coming together "in assembly;" and @chapter 14: 23, "the whole assembly come together in one place"?
J.T. The first has already been remarked upon. The expression "come together in assembly" being considered as characteristic, that is, we are together as of the assembly and holding each other in that way, so that it is in function; not simply that we are together in a room, but in assembly, referring to our attitude of mind, so that we are governed by the truth of the assembly; and as in this attitude of mind, we give scope to the Holy Spirit, for the assembly depends on the Spirit. That in general, I think, is what the assembly is in chapter 11; but the word is not used in chapter 5. What is stressed there is power, the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, they being there. Still the saints are together, "ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ". It is humbling when discipline has to be executed; as in the case of
{127}
the woman in @Numbers 5, there is no sweet savour offering. It is a humbling state of things, and what is needed is power and discernment to deal with such a matter.
L.D.M. I was wondering whether the gathering carries a judicial idea?
J.T. It does. I am not saying the idea of the assembly is not implied; I believe it is.
A.M.H. Matthew 18 intimates that in exercising judgment we are in assembly.
J.T. Quite; Matthew 18 indicates that such authority is set in the assembly.
A.M.H. What is the thought in "my spirit"? Does that leave room for exercise and the entering in spirit of all the saints into what is going on locally? The spirits of the saints would be in the matter as knowing of it.
J.T. Quite so.
A.M.H. Does it help to link up with the universal thought?
J.T. It does; and it depends on the organism in which christians are as one body. I suppose this is implied in Paul's spirit being there. It lent apostolic authority to what was done. It was the actual presence of his spirit in some sense. Perhaps in our weakness we hardly realise what the organism is.
A.M.H. That seems a very important point, the truth of the body underlying the assembly, so that it operates in a living way as the saints are together.
J.T. As to chapter 14 -- we are now not exactly together in assembly, but "the whole assembly come together in one place", as already remarked. It would mean that the sub-divisional gatherings in a town or city would be given up for the moment, so that such a meeting should be held. It ought to be on an evening which would not interfere with other services. First, the apostle gives the great effect of such a meeting, because it affords opportunity
{128}
for *prophetic* ministry, which he regards in this chapter and generally as the greatest kind of ministry. He shows immediately the effect of prophetic ministry, the man whom he contemplates as coming into the meeting "is convicted of all, he is judged of all; the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon his face, he will do homage to God". Then from verse 26, to the end of the chapter, we have order again taken up, this time in regard of ministry. Chapter 11 is order in regard of the Lord's supper and the services of God that follow, but here it is order in regard of ministry of the word of God. So that two or three are to speak. It says, "But if there be a revelation to another sitting there, let the first be silent. For ye can all prophesy one by one" (verses 30, 31). Then in verse 32, "And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets", meaning that each prophet should rule his own spirit; he rules his own spirit in such a way that he is amenable to the influence of the Holy Spirit, and he sits down if another has a revelation; and he would not be a fourth speaker. Verse 34 shows that women are to be silent in the assemblies; verse 35, "it is a shame for a woman to speak in assembly".
C.H.H. Do you think that the Lord being emphasised in 1 Corinthians 11 is to regulate the feature of disorderliness that was found there?
J.T. It seems that the apostle seizes the opportunity to bring in the Lord's supper as involving the authority of the Lord. It is the *Lord's* supper, and it would seem as if it is intended from that point of view to subdue us, so that we might avoid all disorder, and that would run on through all the services. If it is to take part audibly, we must be regulated by the truth governing the position and in every way maintain what is suitable in the assembly.
{129}
T.R.H. Are you carrying forward the thought of the vessel through all this -- a vessel for the divine services of discipline, ministry, collection?
J.T. That is exactly what is in mind, to the end that in each of our localities we might see that the assembly is that characteristically; that it acts and can function in all these services. You can see what we have on our hands in our care meetings, and prayer meetings, because at the moment this vessel is the supreme thought of God. If we get that into our souls, all meetings and thoughts would converge on it, that the assembly might function.
J.S. What would be the character of a word given on Lord's day morning; and would there be more than one?
J.T. A 'word' is given, not a lecture or discourse. Brevity is one thing that should mark it, because much else enters into the occasion, which, in the mind of God, is very full, and should not be hampered by anything that would not promote what is on hand, the worship of God. One is speaking under the Lord's headship, and would convey that it is from Him, and as in power, it affects everybody. I have constantly seen that a word of that kind has promoted what was on hand and prospered it. You would not have two or three words. We are dealing with great matters and brevity should mark us. If we look at all that is said about the Lord's supper itself, in its assembly setting, 1 Corinthians 11, it is brief.
E.S.H. You say that the word should be given as under the headship of Christ. It would seem to arise out of the occasion. You would not think of one coming with a word prepared.
J.T. Quite so. The Spirit selects a suitable man, one who is efficient in giving ministry and is likely to be useful at such a great moment. It is a heart matter, a matter spiritually *felt*.
{130}
T.R.H. Would you have the functioning of the vessel in view? It would promote this.
J.T. Yes. You get illustrations in the Old Testament of persons speaking spontaneously, the Spirit coming upon them; that is a formula in Old Testament times, and the result was just what was needed, and it had its own divinely designed effect.
C.A.I. Should we expect a word?
J.T. Well, it is a feature of the truth that God speaks in the assembly. Moses went into the tabernacle to speak to God, but then he heard the voice speaking to him from off the mercy-seat. God spoke first. The word of God is a feature of the assembly. The word of God is heard there.
A.M.H. Is the word to direct attention to some feature of Christ Himself, that He would support in following up?
J.T. That is what it usually is. Normally it regulates and stimulates our spiritual sensibilities.
C.A.I. In some of our meetings a word is *unusual*. Should that be so, or should we be concerned about it?
J.T. Some years back many said there should not be a word; but I do not think that thought is held anywhere now. The word of God should have a place in the assembly.
A.M.H. Is it particularly serviceable at a point where the saints are moving either from the Lord to the Father, or to some feature in connection with the Lord not yet touched, and would lead forward?
J.T. I think so. At the end of a feature of the service, it may turn the hearts and minds of the brethren to another thing that is needed.
L.M. Is that borne out by Joshua, "Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God"?
J.T. Quite so, in view of the people moving over Jordan into the land. You get in @Luke 10: 20 a beautiful thought, "Yet in this rejoice not, that
{131}
the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens". Rejoice that your names are in heaven. That is brief, but it is wonderfully stimulating.
Rem. Is the assembly of God in a locality definable now?
J.T. We are now trying to make it clear. If you have the definition in the whole condition, we should get at the truth. We are dealing with the assembly as it *was*, and that is right. Thus we see how the truth is applicable, whether it can function now, and it can. The best authority for that is the Lord's address to Philadelphia, only one assembly, but the word intimates plainly that He is thinking of the whole assembly. He says, in @Revelation 3: 10, "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial;" and in verse 9, "they ... shall know that *I* have loved thee". He is thinking of the whole.
E.B.McC. What you are saying would produce men. That the tabernacle of God is with men would be evidence in a locality that the assembly is functioning properly.
J.T. Just so. It is composed of men normally, but you would have to consider the word "men" in @Revelation 21: 3 in its context. It is a question of that order of being -- men as such, not a special nation.
E.B.McC. I was thinking of Christ's glory, as seen in those who serve -- "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory".
J.T. The persons Paul speaks of would be men characteristically. The idea is full-grown -- a great feature of the truth -- we are to be men in this; and he says, "Whether as regards Titus, he is my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf" (@2 Corinthians 8: 23). One would like to have commendation like that.
{132}
A.M.H. What is the point in Paul's mentioning that? To bring it to bear upon the Corinthians?
J.T. What better letter of commendation could there be than this? He had been with them, he brought Paul word of them, causing him great joy.
A.M.H. They possessed distinctive characteristics not found elsewhere in the world.
J.T. While on the way, these men might have been exposed to all sorts of things, such as robbery, like Ezra coming up from Babylon with his brethren: he was ashamed to ask the king for anything more, and trusted God. These would be trustworthy men, they would trust God that the robbers should not take the money from them, but their faces would indicate something. "Messengers of assemblies" -- as if they were dignified, and Christ's glory connected with them, and entering into both the assemblies and the servants. A messenger of an assembly would convey whatever the assembly was, that is, the assembly would be reflected in its messenger.
C.H.H. Would that characteristic shine out in service?
J.T. I think so. A brother would look after the money, but not do it as though he were cashier in a bank. These brethren would bear something in their countenances as to the dignity of their service -- "Christ's glory".
W.H.W. Would they give a visible indication of the unity of the assembly?
J.T. Yes. In the gift to meet the need of the saints, because that is the point in these two chapters. "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift" (@2 Corinthians 9: 15), so that *glory* here would be in the reflection of what God is in Christ.
E.B.McC. Paul speaks about having things clear before the Lord and also before men. Their righteous acts come before men as well as before the Lord.
{133}
"We provide for things honest, not only before the Lord, but also before men. And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things, and now more diligently zealous through the great confidence he has as to you" (@2 Corinthians 8: 21, 22).
J.T. That is particularly important when money is involved.
F.W.W. Does this apply to what we speak of as special collections, or the collection as a whole?
J.T. This is a special collection clearly, but I suppose what we are saying would govern the whole matter, because all giving ought have the character of glory, and therefore the box on the table is glory.
F.W.W. It would not apply merely to the collection which is made now on one Lord's day in the month?
J.T. I think it applies particularly to a special collection, and the letters are intended to stimulate the brethren so that they might give, and the Lord is brought forward as the model. "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched" (@2 Corinthians 8: 9). Then in @1 Corinthians 16: 1, 2 the first day of the week is brought into it, the only occasion in which we get the first day of the week in 1st and 2nd Corinthians, and it is in connection with the collection.
F.W.W. Have you any thought as to the frequency of this character of collection?
J.T. It cannot be too frequent. It is the infrequency we have to consider; not that one would complain at all as to the giving of the Lord's people, because I think God is greatly blessing the brethren on that line. The remarkable place it has in the Scriptures is to be reflected in us. The thought of
{134}
giving is seen in God and in Christ and the instruction here ends thus: "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift". The assembly is the home of love in this respect as in others; it reflects God; it is God's assembly, and the principle of giving would be there, so that the box is glory, the whole position in the service of God is glory to glory.
C.A.I. Do we understand that in chapter 16 the apostle has in view the special collection?
J.T. Clearly it is.
C.A.I. In connection with the regular collection, would that be laid up for?
J.T. Nothing is said of a local collection or local needs, but of love acting towards persons at a distance.
L.D.M. @Acts 11: 29 bears this out as a result of prophetic ministry, "they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister to them; which also they did". The promotion of love is there in this giving.
J.T. Particularly at a distance. John speaks about *seeing* your brother having need -- that would be local, but here it is a thing that is witnessed to, you *hear* of it, it is love operating to overcome prejudices, national, for instance; you do not allow anything like that to interfere with the operation of love.
A.M.H. @Deuteronomy 14 puts together the Levite and the stranger, the widow and the fatherless, as if they all had some common place in the mind of God.
J.T. They all are generally in mind, I think. The allocation of certain amounts for each group covers the matter.
A.M.H. That helps. Where it is done, the giving becomes much more generous. The saints have a definite idea of the size of the need before them.
{135}
There is plenty of affection and it only requires something to be presented to call it forth.
J.T. The subject of giving seems to be taken up in Scripture as a matter to be promoted by *stimulation;* that is the tenor of Paul's remarks. He boasted of the Corinthians to the other assemblies to stimulate them, and he boasted of other assemblies to the Corinthians with the same intent.
F.W.W. What the Lord said of the widow, (@Luke 21: 1 - 4), would be stimulating.
J.T. Yes, indeed. The Lord said she "has cast in more than all". He immediately began to talk of the throwing down of the temple, as if it were not great enough, for what the woman represented required a greater thing, and the assembly is the idea, being the residence of the best that is of heaven.
A.M.H. Does this scripture help us in the working out of what the Lord spoke of as "my assembly", the universal idea?
J.T. Yes. Only a divine Person could thus speak, but it works out mediatorially. He uses it in the promotion of the divine purposes and designs, everything being in His hands and He over everything (@Matthew 28: 18, @John 3: 35).
Rem. Had this principle of giving become characteristic of the saints at Ephesus who were told to "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive"?
J.T. Just so -- a very blessed word.
W.H.W. We are to remember those far off as well as in our own locality.
J.T. The "sheet bound by the four corners" gives the universal thought.
{136}
DIVINE OPERATION IN ASSEMBLIES
@Acts 9: 31 - 43; @Acts 15: 40, 41; @Acts 16: 5
In looking at these scriptures, it is in view of considering divine dealings and operations, whatever form they may take, as having the assembly before us, particularly as in the plural sense -- that is *assemblies*, what we have been accustomed to name local assemblies. At the outset the thought was in the singular, that is, God operating in relation to what was at Jerusalem, and the Lord, in speaking of the assembly, viewed it that way. He spoke of it as *His*, and spoke of it as having administrative authority including the exercise of discipline. The singular idea prevailed in the early history of apostolic services. In @Acts 2: 47 the Lord is said to have "added to the assembly", and while it is doubtful if the word is in the original, the idea, however is there. The assembly is more than a number of christians: it involves building by the hand of the Lord, for He said, "I will build my assembly".
The Spirit seems to have left the use of the word until something of this kind appeared in the apostolic service. The service of the twelve was generally foundational, for their names are in the foundations of the heavenly city, not in the general structure. @Acts 9: 31 uses the word in the plural, and although it is disputed by some authorities, it is maintained by others that the word *assemblies* should be there, and the New Translation has it. Clearly from the context, the plural thought is conveyed in the references to localities. It is not one assembly in so many places, but assemblies in these districts. In relation to Paul's ministry the word 'assemblies' is prominently used, as seen in the passages read, and in the revival in which we have part it has its full place. Thus we have the idea of local assemblies
{137}
and it is with these that one would be occupied now, so as to show how the divine operations have the assembly in view in its local sense, always, however, keeping the general thought of one assembly in mind.
In Acts 9 the time had come for it, the gospel having spread abroad, as we are told here, throughout all Judaea, Galilee and Samaria. The saints at Jerusalem were scattered, too, and about to enter on heathen territory, and assemblies were about to be established there also, as the sequel shows. Saul of Tarsus was ravaging the assembly, meaning the assembly at Jerusalem, but he had set out for other lands, to Damascus and Syria, armed with power to seize members of the assembly there as at Jerusalem. The Lord Jesus was watching all this intently; His lordship is stressed in this chapter. Saul was going too far, as agents of the devil usually do. It never fails that an agent of the devil discredits himself by want of wisdom. How can he have wisdom? Whatever he has is usually turned into foolishness, like that of Ahithophel. Saul went out from Jerusalem, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord" (@Acts 9: 1): so that he was now in direct issue with the Lord. Was he stronger than the Lord? He asked that question later as an apostle -- are we stronger than He? (@1 Corinthians 10: 22). He discovered, perhaps more than anyone, how utterly impotent the creature is as having to do with the Lord. In grace He may allow us to prevail, as He allowed Jacob of old, so that Jacob could be ennobled, but Saul was not on that line. Heaven will not ennoble a man who is on the line of breathing out slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. So Saul was brought down, not destroyed, but brought down in grace, for he was to be imbued with the sense of grace. Perhaps he realised as no one else did, how that he was to carry it right through his preaching and his teaching and
{138}
his constructive work. He was brought down in grace; he was thoroughly secured by the Lord in grace; not only his personal salvation was in view, but also his apostleship.
We have the word *vessel* in this and the next chapters, very significantly. In this chapter it refers to Saul, and in the next to the assembly; both are vessels, the assembly, of course, being the great abiding vessel for God. Saul is a vessel in the Lord's hands, as He says, "This man is an elect vessel to me" (@Acts 9: 15). He was thoroughly secured, and "increased the more in power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ" (@Acts 9: 22). As a vessel, the apostle's heart was full of Christ. He preached Him as the Son of God at once. He escaped the enemy in the attempt to slay him at Damascus and arrives at Jerusalem, where he is introduced to the apostles by Barnabas, a man with great sympathy in the work of God.
Saul is sent away to Tarsus because the Jews in Jerusalem would have killed him as they tried to do at Damascus. He escaped their hands in both places, the brethren protecting him. He was there under the divine eye, and heaven was greatly occupied with that man, although not yet formally entrusted with a commission. He received his commission in relation to the assembly; not that the assembly gave it to him, but the Spirit of God in the assembly at Antioch commissioned him. The assembly is brought into it very significantly so that he and the assembly are bound up in a peculiar way henceforth. He is secured from the hands of Satan -- a wonderful triumph -- and the Lord is making it to operate in view of the assemblies, that they should be helped. So we have this verse: "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the
{139}
fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 9: 31). They increased; this is what I want to show -- how divine dealings have this in mind; and one would include even international matters. Whatever is transpiring on earth must become subservient sooner or later to God's service in the assembly. God's thought is in the assembly; however feebly it may be seen, it exists, and God will see to it that it is cared for. The Lord Jesus says to Philadelphia, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee". What a comfort that is! The Lord is doing that. I have spoken of political and international matters coming under the Father, but all assembly matters come under the Lord, and He promises Philadelphia that He will honour her in that way. It will be publicly known that Christ loves the assembly. Of the religious opposers who say they are Jews and are not, the Lord says, "I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee". One often wonders how that takes place, but one trusts to the Lord's words for the accuracy of it. We ought to take this to heart, as showing the place the assembly has with the Lord. So here the assemblies had rest, throughout all these places, Judaea, Galilee and Samaria, where the Lord Himself had wrought personally. The persecution for the moment was over, the storm had subsided, the Lord had said, "Silence; be mute", and the assemblies had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
The next thing in this chapter is that what heaven does brings about ministry confirming it, and carrying
{140}
it forward. It is important therefore that those who minister should be on the alert for what the Lord is doing from His side, to carry it forward and enhance it. And so we find Peter, who represents the ministry here, going "through all quarters". He sensed evidently that this was now the order of the day, so he goes through all quarters, knowing that the testimony is no longer to be confined to Jerusalem. No minister ought to be confined to any one place, not that he should not have a local setting, but he is not to be confined. He is to be universal as set in the assembly; his outlook and field of service are to be universal. Peter sensed this, so that he went to all quarters, indicating that there are no restrictions with God, for God is limiting Himself to no boundaries. Peter in his service goes to Lydda and he finds Aeneas lying on a bed where he had been for eight years. The ministry is now working out the idea of the assemblies, the thought is current, it is in the Spirit, the divine movements are universal, the outlook is universal. The great vessel, Paul, prepared specially for the service, is already in the field, but for the moment in abeyance, although soon to be sought out by Barnabas and brought to Antioch.
Peter for the moment is the leading minister, and my point in reading these verses to the end of chapter 9 is to show how the minister, without any formal directions, works out what was already in evidence. Peter has some sense of the truth now developing, and hence says to Aeneas, "rise up, and make thy couch for thyself". It is to bring out suitable local conditions. If local assemblies are to be useful to heaven, the conditions which Peter effected in these two towns must exist. The first is that those who are local must understand that they must do things for themselves. They may look further afield for help if necessary, because there is
{141}
"set ... in the assembly" that which is available universally. The word of wisdom, the gift of government, and so on, should be always ready and available to help in any local assembly. That is a divine provision for saints everywhere; but Peter says, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself". We have often talked of this, and I bring it in here to show how the ministry is moving in relation to what heaven is doing.
The second feature is that the thing to be done must be done in a *living* way, not merely in a legal way as a matter of light, right doctrine, and principles; in the doing of things we want to have a living touch. Dorcas made garments, and no doubt made them well, but you cannot get life in garments, nor was it necessary for her to be converted to make garments -- I do not say she was not, but an unconverted person can make them. The women who were weeping, and showing Peter the garments Dorcas had made, cannot be said to have been assembly material, because Peter put them all out. But Peter was greatly concerned about Dorcas, and there can be no doubt that the Spirit of God records the facts as to her as containing instruction for the local assembly. The point is that these things should be living, and if things are living, that means love is there. Love is life, as @1 John 3: 14, "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren". Spiritually, life is love in activity. Peter presented her living, that is the thought, there is now in Joppa a *living woman*. It is the feminine side, the subjective side of the assembly, whilst the objective side is seen in Aeneas -- such as would attend meetings for care, and do the necessary ruling or governing part. They are the people specially who ought to understand that they must do things for themselves, they must learn the mind of God for themselves, and know what to do in
{142}
local matters; whereas the feminine side represents a practical general condition which must be living, so Peter, having prayed, says, "Tabitha, arise". When she opened her eyes she saw Peter, that is, she saw him whose name signifies material for the assembly. God would work in us by presenting something objectively that I myself am to be, in due course. Peter gave her his hand and raised her up, and having called the saints and widows, presented her living. It is a scripture that one has often gone over, but it is a most significant incident at this juncture of the testimony and applies in a peculiar way in this country. We are to understand the way of attending to our own local matters, maintaining at the same time spiritually living conditions.
The next chapter, which we did not read, brings out the heavenly side of this matter in the assembly; the time had come for it. It lifts us out of time, for in truth this vessel, as it is called, is drawn up into heaven in a final sense. It is definitely said to come to the earth in this chapter. Peter says "it came even to me", because he had to understand it, and at the end it goes up again into heaven. Cornelius is a gentile, belonging to a band called Italic. How remarkable that the Spirit of God should bring this man forward at this juncture to set out in him the great heavenly thought! One feels the smallness of one's understanding as to the heavenly side of things. Cornelius in his own account says, "A man stood before me in bright clothing" (verse 30). The Spirit says that Cornelius saw "an angel of God coming unto him;" and Peter saw "the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet, bound by the four corners and let down to the earth". These visions point to what is heavenly and belongs to heaven: a vessel coming down and definitely returning to heaven, and remaining there. And what thoughts are in it -- "all the quadrupeds
{143}
and creeping things of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven"! What wonderful thoughts God presents to Peter in all this great array of creatures in the vessel let down! Men are symbolised in them. This is witnessed in Peters word to Cornelius, "to *me* God has shewn to call no man common or unclean" (@Acts 10: 28).
Why should Cornelius be selected for all this? That is what heaven can do; God had made him what he was. He feared God with all his house, and had been occupied in alms-giving, and the Spirit of God says an angel came, but Cornelius says later "a man stood before me" in shining garments -- all to impress him and make him suitable for the divine purpose. At that time, Peter is on the alert and ready for his meal, a very simple matter; he is on the housetop, and becomes in ecstasy -- another beautiful thought suitable to heaven -- in fact the whole scene has been planned by heaven so as to impress us. One feels, as one is speaking, the need of being impressionable by what the Spirit of God presents: He groups things together to impress us. Peter is impressionable and gives a beautiful account in chapter 11 of how he understands that he is to call nothing common or unclean as the result of the word from heaven saying. "Rise, Peter, slay and eat". That is perfectly intelligible, and it means that you appropriate what there is. He would not do that -- nothing common or unclean, so the voice says, "What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common". We have Peter's own statement as to how he understood that, and those who heard him were carried by it and glorified God, saying, "Then indeed God has to the nations also granted repentance to life". The assembly is the home of these things, also the home of cleansed persons. It is the place where confessions will be accepted. Heaven makes a great deal of repentance.
{144}
Repentance causes joy in heaven; it is one of the most interesting things to heaven.
The assembly is the home of grace. It reflects heaven; of course, in judgment and discipline too, but the assembly is set up in grace, so of all these creatures God says, They are cleansed. What a transformation! It is a question of God and what He has in the assembly, what the assembly is as the vessel of grace. You can understand that these creatures as they appear here are not kept up in heaven, heaven has no such creatures. You are to understand the spiritual import of this. God is going to have up there persons who have been like them, Cornelius and all of us, but it is to bring out what God is, how He forms the assembly of such as are cleansed, setting it in heaven and causing it to be representative of Himself here.
So you can understand how affected Peter was in going to Caesarea and how qualified he was. As the three men were at the gate of the house, the Spirit of God said to Peter, "Go down, and go with them". It is a matter requiring subjection; the operations of the Spirit in the assembly are on this line now, the time has come for it; so that you can understand how affected Peter would be as to whether he is equal to this great matter. It is a new thing, and how beautifully he meets Cornelius! Cornelius would worship him. Peter says, "Rise up: *I* myself also am a man ... to *me* God has shewn to call no man common or unclean". He is learning heaven's mind as to the assembly. He goes into the house, and a company goes in with him. What a fine sight -- Peter the apostle walking alongside a Roman officer, and entering into his house! Peter is full of heaven's mind and Cornelius is ready for him. Perhaps Peter never spoke to a more interesting company. Cornelius had called together his kinsmen and his intimate friends. And while Peter
{145}
"was yet speaking ... the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word" (verse 44). They were brought into the assembly. It was not patronage on the part of Peter, it was the Spirit of God. The assembly was added to and ornamented by these men, a new element altogether, and in keeping with what was there. It was real material from among the nations, suitably brought in through Peter's ministry according to the Lord's appointment. As the Holy Spirit fell upon these men, how Peter must have been affected! He immediately commands that they should be baptised, meaning that he uses, with alacrity, the keys of the kingdom which the Lord had given him. He commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord.
In the other passages, Paul represented the ministry. In chapter 13 he and Barnabas had represented it. They had worked in Antioch for a whole year to bring in assembly conditions; so that the assembly was there, and certain distinguished servants ministering to the Lord in it. The Holy Spirit could speak there. There was that now amongst the gentiles in which the Holy Spirit could speak, and from which He can send out servants. Then we have Paul in chapter 15, where Barnabas left him. He represents the ministry. So we are told that Paul chose Silas and went forth "committed by the brethren to the grace of God. And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies". Chapter 15 is a crisis, but God gave unity in the truth, and although Barnabas and Paul separated, the ministry went on and the assemblies were confirmed: that is, amongst the gentiles, the assemblies in Syria and Cilicia. Paul's ministry had that effect, and one would seek to promote this divine thought, that God is never diverted from the economy set up in the assembly, that is in local gatherings. In @Acts 16: 5 we have further reference to the confirmation
{146}
of the assemblies. "The assemblies therefore were confirmed in the faith, and increased in number every day". There is the continuance of the thought that the ministry has in mind to carry on the mind of heaven and establish it here as in the assemblies, so that they might be available for divine uses. These uses are another matter, but in order that the divine uses may be exercised, the assemblies must be confirmed and established, and the ministry has that in mind.
{147}
THE WAY OF GOD
@Acts 18: 24 - 28; @Matthew 21: 8 - 11; @Genesis 24: 27
I wish to speak about *the way of God*, and begin with the passage in Acts 18, because there we have persons spoken of as in that way. Apollos was not altogether in it, so that he may be referred to as being in it in a defective sense. Aquila and Priscilla come before us in the chapter; a man and his wife, who evidently were well matched, being of one mind in the things of God, and no doubt, also, in the ordinary affairs of life. They are peculiarly distinguished, being mentioned some six times in the Scriptures. Sometimes Aquila is mentioned first, and sometimes his wife, indicating that the Spirit of God had pleasure in them as workers together; indeed, they are called by the apostle Paul fellow-workers, who staked their neck for him. They were of one mind in that too, evidently; jeopardising their lives for the great servant Paul. Such husbands and wives are of great value in the things of God, and so marital relations ought to be held in view of this. Engagements and marriages are divinely appointed and holy, and not intended to be the subjects of mere table talk, but held in relation to the service of God, and the testimony of God. Aquila and Priscilla are seen here acting together according to this. Apollos is partially in the way, knowing only the baptism of John, that is, his knowledge of christianity was defective.
The next chapter speaks of twelve men similarly instructed although not acting in service, and evidently not as well instructed as Apollos, but the whole section indicates how persons may be partially in the way, but not wholly in it. Apollos was not in any human organisation, as many christians are today. When viewing things in connection with
{148}
the truth of christianity from the standpoint of a particular denomination, we are apt to be defective. Associations of that kind are sinful, being condemned by Scripture (@1 Corinthians 1: 11 - 13). However much this remark might jar on some ears, the fact remains that human construction, and arrangement, and organisation, in the things of God are highly repugnant to the Spirit of God. However far removed it may be from the ways of these human organisations, yet it retains the character of lawlessness, and any christians so linked are pretty certain to be defective in their knowledge of the truth. In fact, many are devoid of the Spirit of God because of such defective instruction. What precedes the sealing by the Spirit is properly the reception of the gospel, and in connection with the gospel the word of the *truth*, the gospel indeed including the word of the truth (@Ephesians 1: 13). Truth is regulating. Christ is said to be the truth, and the Holy Spirit is also said to be the truth, so that the sealing of a believer requires the reception of the truth. Any partial refusal of the truth jeopardises the person, for the Holy Spirit cannot be at liberty to seal him, that is, to fall upon him, or enter into him, whatever form that may take. Hence, many at the present time are at a great disadvantage, and hardly in the way, certainly needing to be shown it more exactly. The fellowship of God's Son, the fellowship of His death, and of the Spirit, embodies the idea of the way of God at the present time. The word implies that the saints are bound up together in relation to the Son of God, the fellowship of God's Son, in relation to His death, which is very exclusive. This is a word which no christian need be afraid of, for the death of Christ is very exclusive; it excludes all that is contrary to God. We have also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of truth, and this is rigidly exclusive of all that is of man. The fellowship
{149}
spoken of in the epistle to the Corinthians embraces the way of God, and it is the way for us amidst the labyrinth of the ways of this world, religious and otherwise combined.
There is another thought in the fellowship, namely, that it includes fellowship with one another, that is, christians normally, so that the matter becomes very practical, and I am sure that what I am saying will appeal to every exercised person in this hall. The way of God is a singular thought. There are, of course, plural thoughts, such as "His ways past finding out", which is another thing, but this is one thought. Now Paul, who himself was in *the way*, calls these two -- Aquila and Priscilla -- fellow-workmen; this man and his wife would thus be linked on, in Paul's mind, with @Matthew 21. In that chapter Matthew contemplates the way; it is not said to be the way of God there, but it enters into the teaching of it, as the context shows; it is the way on which Christ trod. Now it is the way into which the truth directs, so that those on the way should reach finality. Here the Lord is on His way to Jerusalem, which was the point to be reached -- in that sense finality.
In Matthew, as you will observe, Christ is on the way. He is set on the ass and the colt, that is the old and the young are used, and the disciples put their clothes on them. I am now linking on my remarks with Aquila and Priscilla, and with all of us here, who would in any way seek to help others in the way, for that is how they are presented. If we are on the way, and seek to get others into it, we would labour to get them to stay in it. Mark says a certain man ran into the way, and left it again. That is a dangerous matter. Some are impelled to enter on it, but do not remain. The man in @Mark 10 kneeled to the Lord Jesus, being reverential, but later left the way, and many have done
{150}
that. If we run into the way we are likely to run out. Entering into the way is a matter for deliberation.
The disciples here are used of the Lord. They are used in getting the ass and the colt, procuring them for Christ, and now they put their clothes on them, and He sat on them. According to the verse I read, (verse 8) "a very great crowd strewed their own garments on the way, and others kept cutting down branches from the trees and strewing them on the way". That is what they were doing, it is a question of the way and those in it. Here Christ is moving on in the way to a definite or final end, He is moving towards Jerusalem, which, spiritually, is where the way leads. All those who receive the gospel are brought into the idea of Jerusalem. If this be so, persons who are leading and directing in the way will have something of "Jerusalem above" about them, such as garments, speaking figuratively; they will not be conformed to this world in their habiliments and appearances, but they will be transformed by the renewing of the mind. They will be marked by something of Jerusalem above, what is morally elevated -- not of this world. "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (@Romans 12: 2). It must be by the renewing of the mind.
The branches here strewed in the way alongside the garments are fresh branches, not branches blown off by the wind; they are *just cut down*, which suggests freshness; the people keep on cutting them down, and keep on strewing their garments on the way. The branches are from living trees, and the way is strewn with them. The established church service, for instance, is about three hundred years old, and as such you could not consider it as fresh; it does not indicate the way that Christ is on; neither do all the
{151}
other things borrowed to any extent from judaism. In making these remarks I am not attacking anything, but mention these facts to show what "the way" means. It is a fresh matter, and the thought comes home to one's soul in connection with the guiding of people's feet into the way. In @Luke 1 Zacharias and Elizabeth are spoken of. They are both growing old, and when old we are inclined to be old in our ways, and also spiritually; these two were not ready for the answers to their prayers. One of the most important things is, not only to pray, but to be ready for answers. Zacharias was not ready for the answer to his prayers, and therefore he was made dumb for a period, but when his mouth was opened he praised God. He was a priest and had often taken part: indeed, we are told that he was offering incense, but did he ever speak with freshness before? Now he blesses God in spiritual energy. It is a beautiful passage. The first thing he does when his tongue is loosed is to bless God. He speaks about our feet being guided into the way of peace. He was not doing that when he was not ready for answers to his prayers. The son -- John -- was about to come, and he was not ready for him, but now he can talk about divine manifestations and the dayspring from on high; what freshness! This is a very great service, surely, and it runs through Luke. Here in Matthew it is no antiquated religious ritual that is in mind in these branches being cut down. Ritual and all the paraphernalia that goes with it would never draw me to Christ, or into the way of God. The divine thought includes freshness. The branches were cut from growing trees, and they are strewn in the way. You see, dear brethren, if we look at the figure, for it is that, it is a question of freshness and keeping on with it, so that the whole way is strewn with suggestions of life. These branches would not be used again; if the Lord went
{152}
that way again, there would be another cutting down, that is the principle.
I think, therefore, that Aquila and Priscilla had in mind that Apollos, who is showing such excellent signs of becoming a great servant, should come into their circumstances. It is not a meeting-room matter although it was in the synagogue where he spoke, but Scripture does not say that they talked to him in the synagogue; that, indeed, would be an antiquated place, evidently it was in their house; they "took him to them". That is a principle in the chapter, it is what the chapter begins with. They were not 'society' people according to the world's estimation, for they were tent-makers. They had travelled, however. Aquila came from the east; he had been to Rome, which place he was compelled to leave because the Emperor directed that all Jews should leave Rome. He was still regarded as a Jew, although a christian. It is remarkable that these two persons are said to have had an assembly in their house in Rome, and they also had an assembly in their house elsewhere, no doubt at Ephesus (@1 Corinthians 16: 19). They were that kind of persons. You could look into their circumstances. If you had an assembly in your house you could not have novels and other such worldly things lying around on the tables and shelves, because that would be utterly incongruous in a house where saints met in holy assembly.
I refer to this because one's house is like one's garments, it is near to one and thus suggestive of our circumstances. My house should certainly be "in the way", and should attract others into the way. They "took him to them". It is not a matter of standing at the door of the synagogue as the people are coming out, to talk to him about the way more exactly. It was most important that he should get into the right atmosphere if he should learn the way
{153}
of God more exactly. You can understand how important this service was to Apollos, about to become a very great servant. These two people took him to them and talked to him about the way of God. He would be impressed not only by what they said, but by their way of living, their lodgings or house; they would not put on appearances, being outwardly ordinary persons making tents. Paul had lived with them. How one would love to hear them telling how they and Paul conversed together in that lodging place at Corinth; and possibly they went regularly together to make tents. What would be their conversation? Whatever it was, you may be sure that Paul predominated, and Apollos, coming into contact with Aquila and Priscilla, would come into the gain of that. So that Apollos would be impressed not only by what they said, but by their immediate circumstances, and the accuracy with which they spoke to him of the things of God. He was an accurate man, Luke says of him, "an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus. He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly" (@Acts 18: 24, 25). We are reminded of what a man Apollos was; a potential servant in dealing with the things of God so far as he went in an accurate way. Then we come to this brother and his wife -- I think it is well for sisters to notice Priscilla, how thoroughly she was equal to her responsibilities and privileges. She certainly would not intrude or interfere with what was being said by Aquila to this brother, but she would in a subject way add to it. What a conversation it must have been!
I want to convey how necessary are these branches, spoken of in Matthew 21; they speak of freshness; one great need of the moment is getting souls into the way of God; to do this things must be
{154}
fresh. I do not believe anything is more effective on exercised souls than the truth ministered in freshness. There is always plenty of staleness and doctrine, but what is needed is freshness, not in speculation, but given with spiritual accuracy. That is what comes out in this passage, the accurate way in which Aquila and Priscilla instruct this brother, who is a man of gift. It is a question of their moral character, and ability to instruct him in the way of God more exactly; they took him *to them*. There was nothing about them that would in any way discredit the things they brought to the attention of Apollos; we see him thus set on the way, a needed man at the time, no doubt. Verse 27 says, "And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace". That is, they were people of faith, and Apollos was able to help them much. I think the word here is to be noted, as it indicates that persons to be helped, in this sense, *must believe*.
I want now to dwell further on this cutting down of branches. I have enjoyed the thought, and hope it will be enjoyed by all of us, as it indicates what is fresh. They kept on cutting them down, and the Lord Jesus rode triumphantly, in these circumstances, into Jerusalem, and the question is, "Who is this?" not who are the people cutting down the branches, but who is this glorious Person who is before us? It is a question of who Christ is, and one thing that the Lord would stress is the inexhaustible resources, the unsearchable riches of Christ. "The prophet ... from Nazareth" was not all, but there was truth in the designation. What a beautiful note, "Hosanna to the Son of David". The blind man began the note and it is carried through under these circumstances (verse 9); the children take it up (verse 15)
{155}
and the Lord says, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise" (verse 16).
The passage in Genesis is to show how the assembly is to be reached as the bride of Christ; not here as the mother. It is one of the most interesting sections in Scripture, that is, as presenting the assembly, typically, as the object of Christ's affections. I read that one verse because it shows how the servant of Abraham brings in the idea of the way. "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren" (verse 27). "I being in the way". If we refer back in the chapter, we shall see what an exalted man he was. He is under oath to his master Abraham for one thing, to secure a wife for his son, from Abraham's family, and that he was not to take Isaac out of the land. It is a *heavenly* matter, one of the most exalted subjects you can treat of. The servant is thoroughly with his master, and I may say that if we are to reach the thought of the bride of Christ -- what the assembly is to Christ as the object of His affections -- we do well to look into the way of this servant. He takes ten camels of his master's. The servant is over everything that Abraham had, suggestive of the resources available to us in a spiritual sense as on this line. The resources are abundant, ten camels of his master's were enough. I want to show that the way is the way of prayer; how beautifully he prayed to God about this great matter.
There is no time to go into details, although all is *worthy* of looking into. How he prayed and told Jehovah the whole matter, and Jehovah answered him exactly according to the desire of his heart. He is entirely free from personal consideration, entirely free for the will of his master. And when the prayer is answered, he bowed down and said, "Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his
{156}
faithfulness from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my masters brethren" (verse 27). Three times in the one verse appears the word "master". It is a very beautiful passage and is intended to help us to reach this refined and glorious end, the assembly, the bride of Christ; the object of Christ's supreme affections. Is it not attractive? Is there here any who would not wish to reach this, and get the idea into his soul? The servant says, "I being in the way", and this is to be noted. Ten camels indicate power enough, but the camels alone will not do, prayer is essential to this matter, and the prayer secures an answer and he finds her whom he sought. He had his ideal for Isaac: one who would be suitable for Isaac -- for we must learn the assembly from our knowledge of Christ and what is suitable to Christ. The gospel brings Christ to me, and Christ seen in the gospel must have a counterpart, and I must learn what she is to be from what Christ is. This is the line on which the servant of Abraham finds Rebecca. It is "the way", hence he could say, "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren".
It is the way of diligent prayers, and answers to them. It is one of the most remarkable passages of Scripture. Abraham did not say anything of the age Isaac's wife must be; he named only the *family*, but the servant thinks of the person and what she should be like. He has the ideal, he gets his answer, and he is "astonished at her" (verse 21). Some may read this verse without realising what a work this was for Rebecca -- to provide sufficient water for *ten camels;* for a girl to undertake the work and to succeed, without exhausting her agility, for it says she ran to her brother. Think of the energy! It points to what should, in this sense, mark the assembly.
{157}
The assembly involves Christ's brethren. The servant says, "my master's brethren" -- that is the point. It shuts out sectarianism. It is a question of Christ's brethren, not persons known religiously as 'brethren'. In that connection there is no moral value to be attached to the designation, because it has become a religious term; it is only of value as held in faith and spiritual power. It is a question of "my master's brethren". As to these, each gospel gives us a clue: Matthew and Mark, those who do the will of God, and in Luke those who keep the word of God. Brethren are marked by doing the will of God, and keeping the word of God. In John the Lord says, "Go to my brethren;" that is the Master speaking, and we want to be amongst His brethren. This is no mere religious designation, it is a heavenly eternal thought, and that is what in type the servant is alluding to here: "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren". Surely this is attractive to every christian here. Much could be said about it as developed in Joseph's history, but it is urgent today that the Lord's people should understand the significance of the word "brethren". Jehovah led him to the house of his master's brethren, where she was who was to be Isaac's bride. It is as apprehending the brethren, you apprehend the bride.
I would urge the thought of being in the way; it is marked by prayer. The servant of Abraham, as consciously in it, exults as knowing that it led to the house of his master's brethren, where he finds Rebecca.
{158}
THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
@Matthew 28: 2 - 10; @Mark 16: 2 - 8; @Luke 24: 1 - 9: @John 20: 1 - 17
J.T. The object in mind is to show that the facts relative to the resurrection of Christ, as mentioned in each gospel, indicate a certain feature in that gospel. Thus in Matthew the authority of Christ is stressed in the angel's appearance and what he says. In Mark there is one person seen, a young man, with a white robe, indicating persons who minister and that they are to be marked by energy and purity. In Luke we have two men in shining garments, indicating the priesthood -- two *men*. Our priesthood is a heavenly one, priesthood having in mind the service of God in the assembly, inclusive of prayer. In John the facts related plainly indicate spirituality. We shall perhaps see all these features as we proceed to look into these scriptures under the Lord's good hand.
A.J.C. Do you think there is a moral order in what you have outlined, commencing with authority?
J.T. Yes. Authority is stamped on the dispensation, especially in relation to the assembly, for Matthew contemplates the assembly. He is the only one who mentions it directly. In it the authority of Christ is essential. Then we have the *ministry*, that is, preaching and teaching, ministry generally; Mark presents this to us, involving service in the assembly. Luke gives us an example, in his last chapter, of the saints gathered together; and Jesus comes in -- Jesus Himself standing in the midst of them. John is engaged with spirituality, heavenly things. It is only as spiritual that we lay hold of and value the heavenly calling. John speaks of Christ as ascending, and refers to our being His brethren. The Lord says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
{159}
E.B.McC. John would rightly come in last, but the others who come before are necessary.
J.T. Yes. Of course the order in which these gospels stand in the Bible is not inspired, but I think the order is right.
C.F.I. Why is there an angel in Matthew and a young man in Mark? Why does the figure change?
J.T. Well, the angel, and the facts relative to him, plainly indicate authority. It is, I suppose, because an angel is a known instrument in which God sets out His authority. "His angels mighty in strength ... that do his will" (@Psalm 103: 20, 21). Characteristically they do the will of God. Here the facts are that "an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men". It seems to me that those facts, mentioned as they are, unmistakably stress the idea of authority. Then the angel says, after speaking to the women (verse 7), "Behold, I have told you". He speaks with authority.
S.F. It was a special moment, and heaven announces it by an angel, descending to communicate the great and glorious triumph that a Man had broken the power of death.
J.T. He rolled away the stone from the sepulchre -- not to let the Lord out, but to show that He had gone out, that He was risen. The angel is seen *descending* from heaven; it does not say he was sent, but descended, clothed with heavenly authority and power, and that against evil. He rolled away the stone and sat on it. The stone was sealed, we are told; for Pilate said, "Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how. And they went and secured the sepulchre, having sealed the stone, with the watch besides" (@Matthew 27: 65, 66). The seal
{160}
here would symbolise not only Jewish authority and power, but Roman. The whole power of the Roman empire was in that seal, but then, the angel rolls away the stone and *sits* on it. Can anyone remove him? Could all the armies of the Roman empire remove him from that position? No; so that it conveys not only formal authority, but active power.
E.B.McC. His sitting would challenge all opposition.
J.T. That is the thought; *he* can sit there; not simply stand, but sit, perfectly restful in the sense of the authority and power supporting him, and power in himself, indeed; so that the guards, we are told, trembled for fear of him. They became as dead men.
F.W. Did the angel descend because the Lord was risen? He did not remove the stone to let the Lord out of the grave, as you said, but because the triumph had already been reached.
J.T. It is important to keep that in mind. The stone did not need to be rolled away for Him to come out. The Lord could not be held by a stone or any physical limitation.
E.B. There seems to be similarity between the presentation of the Lord Jesus on the mount of transfiguration and the features emphasised in these closing chapters of Matthew, Mark and Luke. The Lord's countenance became as the sun in Matthew, in Mark His garments on the mountain became shining, and in Luke two men appear with Him in glory. Would that be right?
J.T. Yes, there is correspondence. John does not give the transfiguration. Matthew is formal authority. This is essential now, because we have come to democratic times, and authority is vested in power in men as such. Some go so far as to say the voice of the people is the voice of God. The divine idea in authority is that it is vested in one Man. He delegates it to others, but all power is in
{161}
Him. The Lord says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth" (@Matthew 28: 18). Of course, in this provisional time the powers that be, whether they be monarchical or purely democratic, are accepted by the believer as ordained of God (Romans 13).
A.J.C. Is the evidence of this power seen in the angel sitting upon the stone intended to remain with us?
J.T. That is what it is written for. One would seek that it might come to us in that way this afternoon. Authority is vested in Christ, and, as delegated, is granted to us here; but all authority is in His hands. This operates in the assembly now in a spiritual way; in the future He will take His great power and reign openly over Israel and the nations.
E.B.McC. His look would strike terror into the heart of his enemies, but his clothing, being white, would define his moral qualities.
J.T. Yes, we note the absence of all darkness and corruption, such as is often found in those who rule among men. Whiteness would mean purity in the exercise of authority.
P.B. Sitting upon the stone he would reflect Him who sits in the heavens: "the Lord shall have them in derision" (@Psalm 2: 4).
J.T. Yes, in that Psalm we have, "*I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness". It is God's prerogative, God's authority vested in Christ.
L.B. Would it be a joy to the heart of God that He could invest with all authority One in whom there could be no failure.
J.T. Yes. A Man after His own heart. David was Christ typically, so that God says, "*I* have anointed my king upon Zion". It is a question of God's sovereign selection and right seen in that King. He says to the Son, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee" and "I will give thee
{162}
nations for an inheritance" and, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry". All that enters into the position, and attitude of the angel here.
C.C. This would be calculated to consolidate the work of God in our souls when we see there is no power on earth to interfere with what God is doing.
J.T. Yes, that is what is in mind, that we might understand that authority is vested in Christ and stands against all that is against the testimony, but is in favour of all that is for it. So the angel says to the women, "Fear not *ye*". The "ye" is emphatic, as much as to say, I am not against you. Those who are doing the will of God have all this support. "Fear not *ye*, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one". He knows what is in our hearts here today; what our motives are. He says, "I know", so the angel means divine representation as to knowledge. "Ye seek Jesus the crucified one", not only Jesus, but the crucified One; you are accepting the reproach. Then he says, "He is not here, for he is risen, as he said". So that they should not be looking for Him in the tomb; but he says, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". All this is for us; divine instruction and power are for us.
F.W. In spite of the crucifixion He is still the Lord. Would that be in keeping with the beginning of the gospel, "Emmanuel ... God with us"?
J.T. That enters into it. It is God's power. It is not simply where His body was, but the *Lord* has been in death. "Come, see the place where the Lord lay".
E.B.McC. At any moment this power can be manifested again. It should give us great encouragement at the present time that it will be manifested.
J.T. We are to be just waiting. Those of us "who love his appearing" are awaiting the expression of His power against evil, putting down all rule and all authority; and also it is the power by which
{163}
we shall be raised if dead, and quickened if alive, when the Lord comes; and the power, as is said, by which He subdues all things to Himself. So it is for us.
E.B.McC. The Roman guards trembled and became as dead men, and I suppose rightly so, at the manifestation of such power.
J.S. Would you say the power is still available, that is indicated at the end of the chapter, "make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". The power is still in Christ's hands, and no power of evil has ever caused it to cease.
J.T. So it is not against the nations yet. It is making disciples of all nations. It is a question of *grace*. All this power is now exercised in grace, "baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". It is God revealed in grace; so the dispensation is strikingly preserved in spite of the opposing elements represented in the Jews and Pilate. The angel says to the women, "Go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you. And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word. And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail!" The word was, "Go quickly", and they move under the direction of the angel. Here Jesus calls the disciples His "brethren". "Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me". The angel calls attention to the disciples, but Jesus calls us "brethren;" and He salutes, you might say, the women as moving under authority. That is the point in bringing this forward, to show that, as we move under authority the Lord honours us.
{164}
C.F.I. They were to go without fear.
J.T. Yes; and He says, "Hail!", as if to honour them, and to honour us too, as we move in subjection.
L.B. Would you say the Lord is showing us that no power can go against us?
J.T. Yes. He assures us that we shall be supported, and no power can stand against Him. But we have to go to Galilee and see Him there: we are His brethren.
A.R. Would there be a distinction between the Lord's use of the word "brethren" here and in John's gospel?
J.T. Well, there would be, I think, in the sense that we have different facts attached to the use of the word in each case. It is here, "bring word to my brethren". It would have the same force as in John's gospel, only there it is a message, not for them to do anything, but announcing His ascension and their relationship to Him. It is not a direction for them to do anything, but simply an announcement of the relation in which they stand to Him and to His Father. He is the ascending One and we are His brethren; and His Father is ours, and His God is ours. What is stressed in John is the family relationship. In Matthew He is owning the relationship to Him, but only in the sense of being His brethren. He does not say His Father is ours and His God ours, but simply that they should go to Galilee to meet Him there.
J.S. Would it be right to say that the brethren come in as in relation to the testimony established in resurrection?
J.T. I think so, and we have what Matthew learned as to brethren from the Lord's lips at the end of chapter 12. The Lord points out His brethren as those who do the will of His Father who is in heaven. That is what marks *brethren* in
{165}
Matthew. John does not say that, but it is involved in what John quotes from the Lord's words.
S.F. Does Matthew present the power to be here with us to the end, and John the ascending line, so that we follow where He has gone?
J.T. That is the idea, I think; as was indicated at the beginning, John is the spiritual and heavenly side. Brethren in John is not a moral thought: it is the thought of divine counsel; but in Matthew, Mark and Luke it is the moral side. "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother". The brethren in Matthew are those who do the will of the Father, and in Mark who do the will of God, and in Luke those who hear the word of God and do it. We are marked off as brethren on these moral lines, but John presents us as brethren from the standpoint of counsel.
F.W. Would it be right to say that we need the Spirit to put it all together?
J.T. Quite so. The endings of the gospels were written to confirm the apostolic teaching. They, however, go beyond christianity, extending into the millennium.
F.W. One is thankful for that, because I think you have said before that we really reach the gospels through the epistles.
J.T. Quite so. If we did not have the epistles, we should be governed by such a prayer as we get in Matthew for instance. "Our Father who, art in the heavens". We would not rise to our proper level.
C.F.I. Why is Galilee stressed here as the meeting place?
J.T. Well the effect of it is to make little of Jerusalem in the minds of believers. Luke makes much of Jerusalem. The disciples were to stay there until the Holy Spirit came down, which is pure grace from the Lord's point of view. He says, "beginning
{166}
at Jerusalem", but Matthew in this respect ignores Jerusalem. It is a judicial gospel, showing Judaism is set aside, and the testimony is carried on in the place of reproach, that is Galilee.
J.M. Why is "go quickly" stressed?
J.T. Well, it carries authority. We are often very dilatory. One says, I will go to the care-meeting tonight, or I will not go. We think it is optional; whereas the Lord would imply that if the thing is to be done it *must* be done. If I do not do it I am remiss. If I do not do it quickly I am remiss. "Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently". It is imperative. If the Lord has something to do here it must be done and at once. That is the principle.
S.H.B. Would the sense of our relationship to the Lord help us affectionately to submit?
J.T. It is those who know Him who readily submit. Galilee was the place they were to go to. The Lord in Mark went up to the mountain, and called whom He Himself would, and they came to Him on the mountain and He appointed twelve that they might be with Him, that He might send them forth to heal diseases. They were *with* Him and thus knew who He was. He was "full of grace and truth", grace first. So Mark says that on the mount of transfiguration, after the glory was withdrawn, "they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone with themselves" (@Mark 9: 8). That is the Lord known personally, "Jesus alone with themselves". It is that Person known.
S.H.B. I was thinking of that expression, "he shall be as the light of the morning" (@2 Samuel 23: 4).
J.T. Quite so. The king gives an account of what the king should be. Those are David's last words. It hardly implies that he was that. It is what a *king* should be. Christ alone answers to it.
S.F. I suppose the light of the morning is here in
{167}
the resurrection of Christ. Can you help us as to these women being first at the sepulchre and the first carriers of the message to the disciples, the brethren?
J.T. They represent the subjective side right through in the endings of the gospels, that is, the assembly viewed in subjection, and answering to the heading of @Psalm 22, 'The hind of the morning'. It is a feminine thought and indicates agility. Their love makes them active.
E.B. The sepulchre is seen in all these four scriptures. Does that mean that the Lord having gone into death, there is to be this kind of result?
J.T. That is the thought. The grave is not the end of these wonderful things. The Lord is seen standing right through, and active Himself. He sat at table at Emmaus, but generally in the position in the endings of the gospels the Lord is standing. He is waiting to serve. His love is as great as it was when He died. The love that led Him into death is now active, and He is ready to serve even wandering ones; to go after them, and bring them back too. He is active in love. It is really wonderful what He did on the first day of the week as told in these chapters, and the result is like Himself. 'The hind of the morning' implies that the assembly is to be active in love too, we are not to be slothful; so they went out quickly and "ran to bring his disciples word". This is to bring out the agility of love.
L.D.B. "Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage". Does that suggest that while authority is there, it needs something more to bring forth homage from our hearts?
J.T. Just so. They held Him by the feet, which is hardly what they should be doing, as those feet
{168}
were carrying the Lord to exercise love; but they did Him homage, showing they were worshipful.
L.D.B. Would you say something about "Hail!"?
J.T. It carries the thought of a respectful salute, and that all is well. It conveys that, and here it is to persons already in movement under divine authority, showing how the Lord owns us as we serve Him.
E.B. Would you say that acting under authority comes first, and then the Lord takes us on and greets us?
J.T. The angel had told them what to do, to bring His disciples word, and to go to Galilee. Then, "as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail!" And He says further, "Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee". He changes the word from "disciples" to "brethren".
E.B.McC. Would this help us as to a ministry meeting, that having a word one should give it? Here "they ran" and the Lord meets them and speaks another word to them as to His brethren.
J.T. I think so. In the meeting you might change in thought and use the word 'brethren' instead of 'disciples'. The former would convey family feelings. One often finds as you proceed that you get richer thoughts than you possessed at the outset.
E.B.McC. We should not be slow in giving a word if we *have* one.
J.T. Give it as soon as you have opportunity. The ministry meeting requires that if a brother sitting by gets something, the one speaking stops to make way for him. A revelation is the most important thing. What you bring is not so fresh as a revelation, and the revelation might include a change from 'disciples' to 'brethren', something richer.
C.F.I. How would one be conscious that there was a revelation?
{169}
J.T. It is through the organism, what we are as one body. It is a great matter if there is a revelation, and if we are sensitive as in the organism, the one that is speaking will make way. The organism is implied here in @1 Corinthians 14.
S.H.B. How do you distinguish between the revelation, and the word prior to it?
J.T. The word preceding might be something you had digested before and you bring it with you, and you are warranted in doing that according to verse 26.
S.H.B. The revelation is more something that would come to a brother when he is there.
J.T. Yes, the Lord would see the need of it. Some state in the meeting might arise as the meeting is proceeding, and the Lord may cause by the Spirit that something else should come in, and so way should be made for it.
S.H.B. We should be spiritually sensitive so that if one was speaking, and a revelation was given to another, the first would sit down.
J.T. That is the thought, and whether we are equal to it spiritually is the question.
A.J.C. Should it be a development of the word already ministered?
J.T. Not necessarily. The Lord might have something else. Something might be needed instead of the word given, or the word given might be in order, but something more urgent arises. That is the idea.
A.J.C. We are not bound in that way; a different thought might be brought in?
J.T. Quite so. It is a question of what the Spirit gives. Still, you do not ignore what has been said. Mark, we have already intimated, presents "a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe;" and the women "were amazed and alarmed; but he says to them, Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the
{170}
Nazarene, the crucified one". His account is like that of Matthew, but the point is a young man clothed in a white robe, which I suppose would mean something that covered him right down. It is how a minister appears. He is sitting, we are told, on the right, that is, where the best should come from. We read of God's right hand. Peter takes the lame man by his right hand. It is a question of the best in our service. Levitical service requires a certain age. In Numbers it is thirty years of age, that is, fulness of manhood, mature manhood. It contemplates the best, and the best given energetically, that is, in the energy of youth, but in purity. One has no impure motives in the service, as Paul says, not making "a trade of the word of God". One is personally pure.
E.B. They see the young man sitting on the right of the sepulchre. Would it have any correspondence with what is said in Samson's riddle, "Out of the eater came forth food"?
J.T. That is the principle, not like Matthew, where it is what is external; the angel rolls away the stone and sits on it. He does not enter the sepulchre there; it is not from that point of view. In Mark the idea of a grave is with the minister; he is crucified with Christ and baptised unto His death. It is His death as stressed in @Romans 6.
L.B. Is that why he says, "Behold the place"?
J.T. Yes; he says, "Behold the place where they had put him". It is abstract I suppose, although the actual hands that did the work were those of Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus; only Joseph is mentioned in this gospel. There is some distinction implied in the reference, because He was not placed where His murderers intended to put Him. "And men appointed his grave with the wicked, but he was with the rich in his death" (@Isaiah 53: 9). It was a grave hewn out of the rock, as if God honoured
{171}
Christ in that way. The point is to see that He was *there* -- placed there by those who buried Him. The grave was there -- a testimony, but He is no longer there. The young man was there and by the right side. It was a remarkable thing, the experience of being in the Lord's tomb. You see in John 20 how Peter and John were concerned about going in. In Mark it is just that they went into the sepulchre, but the young man is sitting there.
E.B.McC. Instead of finding a dead body they found the energy of life in a young man.
F.W. In Matthew it is the Lord, suggesting authority, as you have been saying. Here in Mark it is Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified One, and the place where they had put Him. Why are those thoughts put together? They do not stress the greatness of the Lord exactly, do they?
J.T. I think it is what belongs to the Servant. Who is He that is serving? Jesus the Nazarene. He announces Himself as that to Saul, and Peter announces Him in that character in @Acts 2: 22. It is what is proper to the servant because it implies reproach.
A.J.C. Is it necessary to look at this scene and see where Jesus has been, and become assured He is not now here? We should move on from that point.
J.T. These are thoughts proper to service, but then you are intelligent too, not only in the sense of reproach, but that He is risen: you know that. He is not here. We are no longer looking at the sepulchre -- in fact we could not find it -- God has seen to that; it has not been preserved. Men would have preserved it, but it was never intended by God to be a shrine. Christ is not here, but the word is "behold the place where they had put him". It is a question of the Lord's entire submission to the divine will. He has been placed there. That is where He was.
{172}
There is a moral thought in it. "Behold the place where they had put him". That is, the Lord had gone that length, as He says to Peter, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst" (@John 21: 18). That is the will and natural energy of a young man, but He says, "when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire". Peter was thoroughly resigned to martyrdom. Jesus said this, "signifying by what death he should glorify God". What Peter says in his second epistle indicates how he understood that the Lord shewed him he would die a martyr. Peter wholly accepts this.
F.W. I wondered if this would deliver us from this world. "The Nazarene" is in keeping with the message. Men have their cathedrals, whereas the message here is in connection with the despised and crucified One.
J.T. That is the thought, and the Lord accepting it in the gospels is evidence of that.
C.F.I. Why is Peter especially included in the message?
J.T. There is a beautiful thought in it. Luke says, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". But here it is, "Tell his disciples and Peter;" as much as to say, Peter, you are not left out because you sinned so grievously. It is *grace*, which is something every servant should have in his soul -- "so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life" (@Romans 5: 21).
S.F. You spoke of Mark giving us the minister, or servant. Mark has much to say in a very little time, and Paul says, "I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue" (@1 Corinthians 14: 19). It is the condensing of mighty things into a small compass.
{173}
J.T. Yes, he is brief and pungent. His gospel is by far the shortest. That is a good thought for us who are ministers -- to be brief, not too brief of course, but we should avoid being lengthy.
G.C. Is there a suggestion that those who take up service should go the *whole way*? They take the testimony upon their own spirits.
J.T. That is right. Paul says to Timothy, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings, in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer" (@2 Timothy 2: 8, 9). A young man has to *remember* that.
Now as regards Luke, I believe his account would help us as to the great subject that is being so stressed amongst us, namely, the service of God in the assembly. In chapter 24: 3 we have, "And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment". We are often in perplexity about things, and constantly, of course, questions are being asked which should be answered, but I believe this scripture would help us to find the truth, each finding it for himself. "As they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment". That is, the answer is not going to be deferred. The two men are there suddenly, but it is as we are in perplexity about things, as we are really concerned, because these women were persons of reality. Verse 1 says, "on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning". This shows that they are people of sacrifice, sacrificing ease and comfort for the great things before them, and now being in perplexity, they have not to wait long before their perplexity is dispersed. Clarification is a feature in Luke. "Two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment". The same thing is seen in chapter
{174}
2: 9, which says, "an angel of the Lord was there by them", referring to the shepherds abiding by their flocks by night. They also were sacrificing, and the angel stood by them -- just there, without any show, and ready to serve them. So these two men are here, ready to serve them in removing their uncertainty, for we should not be in perplexity in the assembly. It is not a place for perplexity: it is a place of clarity, where we have clear understanding, and know what to do.
F.W. Do you mean the light of a matter is granted quickly when there is the state for it and the exercise as to it?
J.T. The explanation will come. The light necessary will come.
J.S. Would we learn this lesson from verse 13 of the chapter, in connection with the two on the way to Emmaus? The Lord draws near to them and meets them as they converse. They were downcast, and the Lord draws near and furnishes needed instructions; they became fitted to take up their position in the assembly.
J.T. Yes. In the first assembly meeting these two are ready. They related what had happened on the way, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of bread. They furnished light for the occasion.
J.M. Is it significant that the women sought the body of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. Well, it shows their affection, the interest they had. Those going to Emmaus spoke of it also. The Lord made everything clear to them. That is the thing at the Lord's supper. In Romanism it is enshrouded in darkness, whereas these two men are in shining raiment: the very opposite to darkness. The position is made clear by them. Luke concisely records the facts relative to the Lord's supper; the instruction the Lord gave to
{175}
Paul is very concise. It is remarkable how, clear @1 Corinthians 11 is as to this great subject.
Our chapter says, "two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment". They said, "Why seek ye the living one among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day. And they remembered his words". They are receptive and teachable. Everything is made clear by these men. They only recalled what the Lord had said, and these women remembered. It was a matter of taxing their memories, and that is what the Lord's supper implies. It is calling Him to mind.
L.B. These men have shining garments.
J.T. That is heavenly clarity. The Lord appeared to Saul, and "a light above the brightness of the sun" shone upon him. It was a light from heaven, the luminous character of it is emphasised. As the hymn says,
<blockquote>'And heav'nly light makes all things bright, <br>Seen in that blissful gaze'. (`12:3)</blockquote>
S.F. So there is a right move in turning from the sepulchre, though it is a most necessary point to reach at a given time. We are not, in assembly service, to remain there, but to rise.
J.T. Quite so. Heaven is the objective; that is, God as there. Christ is the Minister of the sanctuary: "minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man" (@Hebrews 8: 2). It is a wholly spiritual matter.
C.F.I. Would we get this light by the Spirit?
J.T. Yes, but the Spirit teaches us in every respect: "he shall guide you into all the truth" (@John 16: 13). There is something special here -- shining garments; it is a heavenly touch that is imparted when you are dealing with heavenly things
{176}
according to the divine purpose. Ephesians is the epistle that enlarges on this, that is, heavenly light, it is specially our epistle. "Arise, shine! for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee" (@Isaiah 60: 1). That passage is quoted in Ephesians, and made to fit there significantly. Isaiah 60 is Israel's light, and it means that Ephesians is the assembly's light, the light that governs us particularly as a heavenly people.
C.F.I. one feels we have had much exercise as to the service of God, but if there was the longing desire seen here we would get more help.
J.T. Yes. Often lately there has been great perplexity as to the new covenant, where it should come in, and as to many other questions. There are still questions with many of us, and I believe this scripture indicates the divine readiness to furnish light as we seek it. The two men are by us.
A.J.C. Would the shining garments be in contrast to legal thoughts?
J.T. Yes, to anything that would becloud or confuse. We are so apt to stress one thing too much, and one of the greatest dangers is pigeon-holing certain truths. The true way is to hold the truth as a whole in our souls in intelligent affection, and then there is room for enlargement all the time, for we can never limit the truth of God. It is always capable of enlargement. If any new feature is apprehended it is not simply taken by itself, but in relation to the whole scope of truth.
F.W. Is that why the women brought the word to the eleven and the rest? It was not a question of apostolic ministry, but spiritual apprehension.
J.T. Yes, and so later we have the eleven and those that were with them. Authority is there, but in a modified way. It is a *broken* state of things, but still authority is there and "all the rest" are affected by it, and stand related to it.
{177}
J.M. Would this light shine at the care meeting as well as at the Supper?
J.T. Well, I think heavenly light is always our light especially as we see it coming to Paul. "A light ... from heaven round about me". It is the clarity of it, a light "above the brightness of the sun".
J.S. Would we not come under the Lord's leading if He comes in as He did here? "He himself stood in their midst" (verse 36). The Lord would come in and lead.
J.T. Yes, He does become our Leader, but there is the thought of order, and Paul says, "rejoicing and seeing your order". How am I holding any given truth? Am I holding it as something I am in the good of? The truth is infinite in its bearing, and if I hold it in that way I will be always ready for expansion.
L.D.B. What is the thought of *suddenly* (verse 4)?
J.T. I think you do not have to wait for light if you need and desire it. We do not have to wait for years to get a difficulty cleared. The Lord gives understanding in all things, and He is always ready to do it. "Run, speak to this young man", we have in Zechariah; showing it is urgent. Heaven is ready to enlighten us.
S.H.B. It encourages us, as we look back over the last few years, to see how we have proved this.
J.T. It does. The Lord is helping us, and if we take up this attitude we shall get help. Nothing will be dark to us although the Lord may see fit to leave things in abeyance for a time, and it is better not to force anything. "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding" (@2 Timothy 2: 7). Be careful in looking into Scripture, and indeed into anything from the Lord. Look into it and weigh it over. "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding" -- *think* of it.
{178}
We may now look at John. He implies spirituality. Mary is not ready for this at first. "She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb. And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb, and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in. Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying, and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself. Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed" (@John 20: 2 - 8). These two brethren are seen here as spiritually intelligent. They are governed by *what they saw in the sepulchre*. There are no angels now, but they note the position of the linen cloths, and the handkerchief. That is what affects them, and they saw and believed; it is said that John saw and believed. That is, he was governed by the position of the cloths as he saw them in the tomb, and that caused faith and light in his soul. It is a spiritual matter.
E.B. Are you emphasising the handkerchief that was placed upon His head?
J.T. That is one feature. I am to understand its position and that of the cloths. The word is "cloths;" it is not one idea, but several. I understand the cloths are as they had been wrapped around the Lord when He was placed there. They are in order. It means that the Lord left without a struggle. He did not undo them. He just left. It is to bring out the *spiritual* nature of the resurrection. But somebody placed the napkin by itself,
{179}
as if to point to His personal dignity involving His headship.
S.F. That is very beautiful.
J.T. It raises the whole question of spirituality, and yet these men went to their own homes. We may be intelligent and yet not have the same affection as Mary. She did not go to her own home. She stays by the tomb weeping. *She* gets a word from the Lord.
A.J.C. The Lord having passed into new circumstances, there is instruction in that for us that we might move on.
J.T. He has passed out of material things into a spiritual realm. He can come in, although doors are *closed*. It is a spiritual matter.
S.F. There is no thought here of holding Him by the feet.
J.T. Not a word about that. Mary, I think, represents the general state of the saints; the general subjective condition is dark and confused, but there is affection for Him and the Lord owns that. The angels are serving here too. Peter and John are satisfied simply because of what they saw in the sepulchre. They saw and *believed*.
E.B. How different from that which would require direct legal proof. If we were more spiritual we would pray for spiritual suggestions and get them.
F.W. Was it spirituality that lead them to go away? "The disciples therefore went away again to their own home".
J.T. I would say it implies that there was no need of staying there any more. The Lord is not here, but "their own home" does not fit too well with spirituality, I think. You would be desirous of finding Him. That is the next thing. Mary wanted *Him* -- but she was dark as to His resurrection.
{180}
E.B.McC. They are not shining garments here, but "white". Why is that?
J.T. The whole aspect of the sepulchre now points to the Lord's dignity; whiteness being, as usual, purity. His head and feet are stressed. The feet would refer to His walk here, but His head would refer to His dignity; headship is implied. Mary needed to be revolutionised. She spoke about carrying Him away. That is a poor thought.
G.W. We have spiritual intelligence in Peter and John on the one hand, but affection in Mary on the other. We need the two features.
J.T. It is to Mary's credit that she wanted the Lord, but she needed to have her soul enlightened. The appearance of the angels would mean that she needed to be completely changed in her outlook. She must not think she could carry Him away. He is a divine Person and you cannot compass Him.
A.J.C. So spiritual impressions as light from God are not sufficient in themselves. Mary waited for the Person.
J.T. Yes. If Peter and John had waited, they would have had more than the cloths pointed out. We need the Lord. He came in amongst them in due course.
{181}
THE DIVINE ECONOMY
@Matthew 28: 19, 20; @1 Corinthians 8: 5, 6; @John 20: 17; @Ephesians 2: 18
J.T. It is in mind to stress these scriptures as speaking of the *Father*. The first, in Matthew 28, contemplating the three Persons of the Godhead, to the name of all of whom we are baptised. The second, in 1 Corinthians 8, shows how christians distinguish between the divine Persons, discerning the Father to be regarded as the one God; the Son, as acting in a mediatorial way in effecting everything for Him. The third scripture, in John 20, speaks of the Lord associating us with Himself in His relation with the Father -- His Father our Father, His God our God. Finally how we draw near, how we have access to the Father through Christ by the one Spirit (@Ephesians 2: 18); this verse in a very concise way presenting the economy into which God has come, and how we recognise it in drawing near. It is hoped that we may be helped in looking at these scriptures from these points of view, and have more intelligent liberty in our service to God.
A.M.H. Baptising *to* the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The word 'to' helps in what you are saying, that it is the great end in view.
J.T. You mean it is not 'in', but 'to' -- "to the name". It is in keeping with what is in the Lord's mind when He says here, "make disciples;" the apostles are to *make* disciples. Being baptised to the name of divine Persons involves the economy that they have come into; we are introduced into all the wonderful light implied in the name of the three Persons. It is the faith period that is in mind, what God is as thus presented. We are baptised into all that, introduced into all by baptism, and taught to
{182}
observe all things whatsoever the Lord had enjoined. He then says, that He is *with them;* "behold, *I* am with you".
W.H.U. Would you help us as to the difference in baptising "in the name" of the Lord Jesus (@Acts 10: 48), and *to* the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit? What difference should we have in our minds?
J.T. Here baptism is 'to', or 'unto' the Name. It is a question of what we are introduced into, as over against judaism and paganism.
C.A.I. Is this dispensation set up in the light of the relations of divine Persons to one another as thus revealed?
J.T. Yes, here it is the order in which They are set. We could not reverse that order, the order is "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". This involves the economy into which God has come, and in which all that He is in grace and power is presented and available to us.
W.H.U. Would baptism 'in' the name bring in divine authority? Baptising 'to' the name introduces us into a system connected with that name.
J.T. Yes. Baptism had existed before. "All were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea" (@1 Corinthians 10: 2), not unto the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 'In' the name would mean that all that name stands for is available. I think there is protection in it. 'To' involves what we are introduced into, the light and privilege generally of christianity; the making, indeed, of disciples.
A.M.H. Would you say a little as to the making of disciples? You emphasised that.
J.T. It implies that the apostles had moral power and hence would exert influence for good over men. One not only affords light to people, but influences them by what is in oneself, and that influence
{183}
would be exerted to bring persons into what is involved in this wonderful light. You not only enlighten people, but you influence them in a formative way. We see it exemplified in the apostles in the @Acts 14: 21, and in the epistles. What great concern they had! Peter preached, we are told in Acts 2, and the other eleven were there with him. Those who were convicted said to him and to the other apostles, "What shall we do?" showing that they apprehended what was implied in the light conveyed, not simply that they were to be enlightened, but what they were to do. He says, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call. And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation. Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls. And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles" (@Acts 2: 38 - 42).
I read those verses because they bring out the effect that Peter's service produced on his hearers, and how they not only directed their questions to him, but also to the eleven as if they discerned that there was something peculiar and distinctive about these men, that they could rely upon their help. Peter is the only one who is said to have answered them, but they directed their questions to all. They were in principle, *made* disciples, because they persevered in the apostles¬ doctrine, showing how profoundly the apostles had affected them. The point is that they persevered in the *apostles¬* teaching and fellowship; they were affected by the ministers.
{184}
A.M.H. So that they would, in fact, become constitutionally different from this perverse generation.
W.H.U. Why do we get a change in the term? They are not baptised here, apparently, to the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, but to Jesus Christ (@Acts 2: 38).
J.T. "In the name" here, I think, involves protection, and a certain status in the testimony of God; baptised in *that* name.
W.H.U. Which term would we use today?
J.T. I would use both. Matthew 28 conveys the idea of being introduced into christianity, the whole revelation of God; the other involves our being under the protection of the Lord Jesus, especially as Lord; He is made Lord.
L.D.M. You put that second.
J.T. Yes, I do. I am only saying what *I* feel free to do.
F.J.F. Paul at Ephesus in @Acts 19 baptised certain ones *to* the name of the Lord Jesus, who had previously been baptised to the baptism of John.
J.T. Paul speaks about Christ to these men. "And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John. And Paul said, John indeed baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus" (@Acts 19: 3, 4). They were baptised *to* the name of the Lord Jesus there.
F.J.F. The other name, as in Matthew 28, is not mentioned in Acts 19.
J.T. If Scripture says a thing once that is enough.
L.D.M. The economy is established in Matthew, but the entry into it depends on our submission to the Lord Jesus.
{185}
J.T. The mediatorial service of Christ is stressed in the epistles and in the Acts too. As viewed in that way, He is doing everything; so all the result is through Him, as we see also in 1 Corinthians 8: 6 -- "One Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him". When we come to the actual instrumentality of the making of disciples, it is by Christ. By God, of course, too, but in the detail as to the persons it is by Christ -- "and *we* by him". I think we would be helped to dwell on this thought of being *made*. It is what the Lord intends as to the inauguration of christianity; not simply to enlighten people; it was that, but that they should be made disciples.
A.M.H. Have you the thought of *making* exemplified in Peter, in that his shadow falling on the sick healed them. Would that be the substance in the man brought to operate on persons?
J.T. Quite so. You see in Acts 2 how it is wrought out, how the people took account of these twelve men. If a few brothers go out preaching the gospel in the street, one preaches while the others stand by. Can people see in them anything different from the ordinary bystander? Why do these convicted persons direct their questions to the eleven, as well as to Peter? Peter stood up with the eleven. The Spirit of God records that, as if these were persons already made by Christ. He said to Peter, "I will make you fishers of men" (@Matthew 4: 19). Why do these convicted persons discern that these other eleven men should be questioned as well as the preacher? When moving about among men you would like to find them coming to you if in soul need.
A.M.H. You would like them to know that you belong to that wonderful company.
J.T. That is what I thought; that in preaching one should be worthy of imitation.
{186}
C.A.I. In Acts 3, when the lame man was healed, he was seen standing with them. Does he become part of what is there already?
J.T. Yes. The enemy could not overcome that fact. The same was seen in Lazarus, they believed because of Lazarus (@John 12: 9 - 11).
Rem. Peter says, "Be baptised each one of you". Have you any thought as to that? No one was to miss this blessing.
J.T. I suppose the transaction would be individual, not as it was with Israel in the Exodus. They were baptised together as a whole as they crossed the sea (see @1 Corinthians 10: 2). Here the transaction is individual. It must have been a remarkable time when these three thousand people believed. The idea of baptism would spread. What does all this mean? So many of them submitting to it, and very real in it. You could tell that they were not merely religionists, changing their religion, but they were genuinely affected by the gospel.
A.M.H. "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", evidenced that they were real.
J.T. And "in breaking of bread and prayers". Many of our young people say they have confessed the Lord after a certain preaching, but that is all they have done. They are hardly *made* yet, but these people "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers".
E.S.H. Would *persevering* indicate that there would be difficulties in the way, and the element of opposition to meet?
J.T. The word "persevere" would imply that; and it was "in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", showing how the converts were affected by these twelve men. Peter did not specially call attention to himself, but there was something that
{187}
affected them so that they would follow what these men taught. They ask what they are *to do*, and they do it. Then they are added, and they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers. The "making" included all these things. Why should any one who confesses the Lord stop at confession?
C.A.I. Does *making* involve all that is recorded of these men?
J.T. I was thinking that it exemplifies the meaning of the Lord's words, "make disciples". Nations have been baptised in an external way, that is, they have changed their religion. For example, Russia changed her religion and has now gone back, in apostasy. There is no genuineness in taking it up in a national way.
W.H.U. Would the making of disciples carry the thought of securing material for the assembly, not merely to bring in relief by the gospel, but to secure the persons?
J.T. That is the idea. Making disciples would mean that a new system of teaching is brought in, and these three thousand people are genuinely affected by it. They are not merely changing their religion, but are genuinely affected, not only by what these men say, but by what the apostles were. They must have taken them as their models. Paul says, "*Ye* became our imitators, and of the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 1: 6).
L.D.M. Is there a slowness to avail ourselves of the teaching? The recognition of the Spirit in the temple means that a new constitution is built up. Is that often lacking with souls who confess the Lord?
J.T. Just so. It is most interesting to see in the early chapters of Acts, how God supported these twelve men. Chapter 5, as already alluded to, is very striking as to the power they acquire, especially
{188}
in discipline. After Ananias and Sapphira were dealt with for sin, it is said, "And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, but of the rest durst no man join them, but the people magnified them; and believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;) so that they brought out the sick into the streets and put them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter, when he came, might overshadow some one of them. And the multitude also of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset by unclean spirits, who were all healed" (@Acts 5: 11 - 16). That paragraph is to bring out how God is supporting the twelve even in the presence of severe antagonism that might terrify some, but the people magnified them. "They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch". I believe that what has been remarked as to these chapters is of prime importance as to ministry, that the persons who minister are to be the reflection of the things ministered, and hence affect their hearers rightly.
J.H. Does that mean that the teaching according to Matthew is to so morally affect us that we help to affect others?
J.T. Yes. Matthew is very stringent. Of course, grace runs through Matthew, as in the other gospels, but he stresses responsibility and what is needed for the time, so that the assembly might be supported. In giving this instruction the Lord says, "*I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age". That is the principle of the inauguration of christianity.
C.A.I. Does the economy in this way become operative and effective towards us through these
{189}
men being brought into it? John in his epistle says the apostles¬ fellowship was with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, and we have fellowship with the apostles.
J.T. Yes. The apostles have a particular place. Perhaps it is something not noticed much by the brethren, but John says, "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ" (1 John 1: 3). Then "that *ye* also may have fellowship with us", that is with the apostles, not, in this respect, directly with the Father and the Son. In setting out the testimony the apostles have a special place.
F.W. The scripture in Matthew emphasises the three names of the divine Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but in Acts 2 it is God and Christ and the Spirit. Would they understand then that God was the Father?
J.T. Peter had said, "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (@Acts 2: 33). Clearly the twelve understood, for the Lord unfolded the thought of the Father when He assembled with them, especially as seen in John 14 to 17; and @Acts 1: 4 says, "being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father". Then He alludes to the Spirit, "*ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit". When they enquired when He would restore the kingdom He says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you" (@Acts 1: 7, 8). It is clear, therefore, that the twelve had in mind the thought of the economy, for the Lord had distinguished between the Father and Himself and the Spirit.
{190}
F.W. I had in mind @Acts 2: 38, 39. "Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call". There is no reference in connection with that to the term "Father" as indicated by the Lord in Matthew.
J.T. But he said in preaching, "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this" (verse 33). The apostles would have the economy in mind throughout. Christ received the Spirit from the Father to give to the saints -- to the assembly. When we come to 1 Corinthians, Paul says, "to us there is one God, the Father". So that for all true christians, Paul included, it is clearly recognised that the Father is God in the economy, and that the Son -- that is the Lord -- has all things in His hands to accomplish. Things are done by Him; "and *we* by him".
A.M.H. Does God stand in relation to the call to the conscience, for it says repentance towards God, and in coming to God we learn that He is the Father?
J.T. I think that is how it comes out in the epistles. It is the gospel of God concerning His Son. That is the general position. Paul says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (@Galatians 1: 15, 16). John says, "the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world" (@1 John 4: 14). This shows that the thing was in their minds. I believe the Father is spoken of in every epistle. Clearly the divine economy was in the minds of the apostles throughout.
{191}
C.A.I. In this dispensation is God known in relation to any other name than Father, or are our relations with Him always in relation to that name?
J.T. That is as viewed in the economy -- the economy operative. Of course, Christ is said to be the true God in John, and God is the true God. In John it is said of Christ, "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5: 20). Not only that, but He has part in the creation, He is representative of God, being Himself God. He is called the true God, and so is the Father.
Ques. One has wondered how far we really are right in addressing the Lord so much in prayer, or whether more should be addressed to the Father?
J.T. That is a good point to have before us. We must be clear that the Son is to be honoured as well as the Father is honoured. We are thus kept safe in our souls as to His Person. So long as we are well grounded as to the Person of Christ, we can look at the economy. If we look at the epistle to the Corinthians we can see how He has taken a lower or mediatorial place as One who is to do everything, having God in mind. That is why this passage is so important. It is very concise, showing how Paul puts the truth to the Corinthians. "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 6).
W.H.U. Would the nature of our petitions govern us in regard to the Person addressed?
J.T. Well, it is not easy to divide them up.
W.H.U. I was wondering if we would more naturally address the Lord when speaking about assembly matters, and God when speaking about the pressure and circumstances of our brethren.
J.T. You would have to make full allowance as to how divine Persons are addressed by the apostles. God certainly is addressed in regard to assembly
{192}
matters. The best way to reach the truth is to look into what Scripture says. Look at the examples we have of prayer. How very much more prayer is to the Father and to God than to the Lord! Yet we must keep clearly in our minds that the Lord is to be prayed to.
F.J.F. Paul in asking about the thorn says, "I thrice besought the Lord" (@2 Corinthians 12: 8).
J.T. That is a good example of one praying to the Lord. But God is addressed in prayer and worship, in the examples we have in Scripture, much more often than the Lord Jesus.
Ques. Would Paul address the Lord there because he is accepting the discipline connected with it?
J.T. It would seem as if the Lord took the matter up with Paul in view of the abundance of the revelations, lest he be exalted above measure. The Lord is particularly interested in the matter, lest His servant be damaged in any way. "This man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (@Acts 9: 15, 16). The Lord seems to take a peculiar interest in these two outstanding servants, Paul and Peter. This would not mean that they are the only ones, because we all in measure are interesting to Him. It would seem that in making us His ministers, He would take special interest in us.
A.M.H. Job says, "thou wouldest have a desire after the work of thy hands" (@Job 14: 15). Each one taken in hand by the Lord is peculiarly precious to Him.
F.J.F. "But the body is ... for the Lord, and the Lord for the body" (@1 Corinthians 6: 13).
J.T. That is a good scripture as confirming what we are saying.
{193}
A.M.H. "By whom are all things, and *we* by him". This would turn the mind especially to the Lord in relation to formation.
J.T. Quite so. If one wanted to be helped and to be fitted for the service, one should certainly turn to the Lord about it.
R.M.D. Would emphasising the thought of the one God, the Father in any way limit the thought of the Father to the present dispensation?
J.T. No, I do not think so at all. "To us" would be, of course, to christians, but Matthew shows that the revelation extends to the Jews too. The earlier chapters of Matthew contemplate the Jewish remnant and their being brought into the light of the Father.
C.A.I. Will Israel be blessed in millennial conditions in relation to the Father?
J.T. Yes. The revelation of God involves the Father.
A.M.H. Has the scripture you read a final reference to Israel? We do not baptise *nations*, do we?
J.T. It does not seem as if it were ever carried out. On the other hand, I suppose going out from Galilee would imply the Jewish remnant viewed in that connection. It is a Galilean situation, having the nations as such in view. The remnant of Israel in reproach -- not in Jerusalem -- are in view, Christ now known as with them, and they carrying on in power to the end of the age.
A.M.H. We baptise *out* of the nations, taking out individuals.
J.T. Quite so. God visited the nations to take out a people.
F.F. Would the passage in @1 Corinthians 8 be in view of the liberty of christians, setting us free by this knowledge of the Father?
J.T. That is the way it is put. "To us there is one God, the Father". It is "to us". It was definitely
{194}
taken up by the apostles. The economy was understood, and they regarded God as the supreme object of worship, and all that God conveys is set out in the Father, but not in any restrictive way because elsewhere the Son is said to be the true God too. It shows that we have to look at each passage in its own connection, and view it from the standpoint of the economy. The apostles moved in relation to the Father, as now representing the one true God as Jehovah did in the Old Testament. Now the other two Persons have come to light and They are operating in this subservient way. They are pleased to take that position. "By whom are all things" refers to Christ as Lord, the Spirit operating in relation to Him to bring in everything for God. "Of whom" (chapter 8: 6), would mean that we are "*of*" God, the Father, but it is Christ who has brought us in "for him". He has *made* us for God. "By whom are all things" is instrumentality.
R.M.D. Would "by whom are all things" be what John refers to in the opening verses of his gospel? "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being" (@John 1: 3).
J.T. It is the same thing, only he is alluding there to creation, all that had been effected before, our Lord being then in the form of God. Now He has become incarnate, and in this position is the one Lord, Jesus Christ. Peter says, "God has made him ... both Lord and Christ" (@Acts 2: 36). Paul says, "one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things". He is the One doing things, and we by Him. There is a positive result in the service of Christ in this way.
C.A.I. Would the reference to the gospel of God concerning His Son in Romans, and also God having sent His own Son (@Romans 8: 3), indicate that God as referred to is the Father?
{195}
J.T. The word God never loses its fulness. The word Father is more limited, so that the word God should stand out in our souls. God judges, for instance, but the Father judges no one, so we are to understand that if it says, "God our Father" that Person is to be regarded as God. If the judgment is to take place, it is through the Mediator, the Son, the Lord. The Father "has given all judgment to the Son" (@John 5: 22), because He is Son of man, but still God is doing it. God made the worlds, but then One now known as Son, did it in detail. It is very difficult to put the truth of the Deity into words; it is impossible really. There is this doctrine, of course, but if we are to get the truth, the way is to set ourselves, as it were, alongside the Lord and in dependence on Him, compare the Scriptures. See how the disciples looked at things! They are the ones commissioned to teach and we are to learn from them. "Teaching them", the Lord said, "to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you". Let us see how they looked at things.
John 20 fits in, after we see there is one God the Father, as Christ's Father and Christ's God. We are now on another level. It is a question of being brought into our proper relations and privileges, and how we are being brought into our position which answers to the purpose of God. The Lord is going all the way here; it is a climax to regard Him in this light; His Father, our Father; His God, our God. He is bringing us on to a wonderful plane so that we are to understand that we are His brethren. He calls us "My brethren".
F.J.F. Does this involve the truth of his Headship as set forth by Paul?
J.T. Well, of course, that is Paul's line. This is the family side. Paul is the family line too, but headship has to do in its fulness with the administration: "head over all things to the assembly, which
{196}
is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" (@Ephesians 1: 22, 23). It is what He is in a public way, so to speak. The Lord in John 20 takes up Mary who is now thoroughly adjusted and in touch with Him, and gives her the message to the brethren. He says, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". He is bringing them into the family position, answering to the purpose of God. He has in mind, too, what they are to be here in testimony: the passage goes on to that, but He would first set them in their souls on this wonderful level.
L.D.M. Do you get stress laid on the thought of the disciples? "Where the disciples were". It is not the assembly, but rather the persons.
J.T. It is persons, and an inner thought -- where *they* were. The next time "his disciples were again within", again showing the inner thought, which they understood. They are in the spirit of the thing; they were again within, and "then came Jesus". The Spirit of God records the fact so as to produce an effect in our minds. It is that inner things are in mind. John has that in mind. David built "inward", (@2 Samuel 5: 9).
In @Ephesians 2: 17 Christ is seen as preaching. "Coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh". This shows that the full thought in preaching is a mediatorial thought, an administrative thought. It is not the apostles here, but it is the Lord Himself who operates, and by Him we have access, "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". So that the three Persons are there together. Christ is preaching, and now He is available to us, by whom we draw near to God the Father in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that the three divine Persons are
{197}
there together as we draw near to the Father. The passage contemplates that the economy is understood, that God is to be worshipped, or spoken to by us, but it is *through* Christ and *by* the Spirit.
Ques. Perhaps some of us do not understand clearly your thought in the word 'economy'.
J.T. The word is often used as that in which things are ordered and administered. The word rendered "dispensation" in @1 Timothy 1: 4 (New Translation), conveys the thought. It is the Father, the Son and the Spirit, viewed as they are seen in Matthew 28, operating in that relation. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35). Thus chapter 4 is to be taken up in that light, that the Son is now operating in this dispensation. He says to the woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (@John 4: 10). That is the position. The Son is operating in the economy, the Father has put everything into His hand, and He is speaking about the wonderful gift of God, and who He Himself is. The delight in, and knowledge of, Himself is put in the believer's soul by the Spirit. If she did ask, she would get the living water, which implies the Spirit. Another thing that comes out is that the believer, as receiving the light of the economy and the Spirit, becomes part of it, because the woman immediately proceeds to the men and tells them about Christ. She says, "Is not he the Christ?" -- the One who is doing things. She is affected, and the men are affected, too; so the thought spreads.
A.M.H. In this scripture in John 20 there is no question but that the Father is presented to us in family relationship, but would it be right to say that in Corinthians it is rather the character of the economy that is brought before us, and the abundance of
{198}
*grace* with the Father? Would you bring relationship into that line or not?
J.T. I think it is more what you say, the abundance of grace in the Father. It is the Father, the point is not whose Father He is, but that Person in that relation. Hence the Lord says the Father judges no one. In administration the appellation denotes grace; love too, of course. So that "to us there is one God, the Father" would mean that Paul would have in mind what God is going on with in the economy. Christ is operating, and He has brought us into it.
A.M.H. The highest level is that we are brought into this relationship together with Christ and with the Father. We often speak about sons of God, but not often of sons of the Father. Would you say something as to that?
J.T. I think sons of the Father is quite right, but generally speaking it is sons of God. The Father is a progressive thought; God being the *ultimate* thought; and it is God according to the scripture in Hebrews 2, although God is not mentioned formally. "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory" (@Hebrews 2: 10). That is God and what He is doing.
Rem. "Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (@Romans 8: 17).
J.T. Quite so.
L.D.M. David says in his wonderful prayer, "And now, Jehovah, thou art that God" (@1 Chronicles 17: 26). I was wondering whether there was some anticipation of the economy in David's mind, because of the variety of expressions he uses in addressing God.
J.T. There is such peculiar richness, that you might well say he goes beyond his dispensation.
{199}
F.W. Would sons of God be a more appropriate expression for us because we are sons of God in Christ, not directly?
J.T. We are sons of God. The formal statement to us is "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 26). Other scriptures, particularly @Ephesians 1: 3 - 6, show that our position before God is in Christ, but the best authorities, including J.N.D., connect faith with Christ Jesus in @Galatians 3: 26; that is, that Christ is the object of faith. I think, too, we are safe in saying that we are sons of God in a sense directly, for it says "ye are all God's sons", and also "because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (@Galatians 4: 6). This makes us consciously sons; but hearts crying "Abba, Father" places us directly in relation to God, and yet we cannot ignore that there must be a mediatorial thought in it.
F.W. The question of sonship is important in that way. We are sons by adoption, not by birth.
J.T. We come into it now by faith, and the Spirit is the Spirit of adoption in us. "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father", and this makes us consciously sons, but, still the mediatorial thought must be there, because we are there before God in Christ, and our access is by Him. We cannot even draw near to the Father except by Him, @John 14: 6.
E.S.H. The adoption is "through Jesus Christ to himself" (@Ephesians 1: 5).
J.T. He would have us to understand the position -- that all is in and through Christ. God loves to hear us speak to Him in the Spirit of adoption as Christ spoke to Him.
F.J.F. Is everything directed to God the Father in that way, because He has remained in what might be called the essential place of God?
{200}
J.T. Well, everything, as we might say, that stands related to the economy, but other things have to be borne in mind. The Lord is seen as God. "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5: 20). We must make room for that. It is remarkable in John's writings, especially in the epistles, how the pronouns are used. We cannot be sure whether it is the Father or the Son, showing that we should not pigeon-hole these inscrutably great things. The best way is to hold the truth in faith and make room for enlargement in ourselves.
{201}
PURCHASE FOR DIVINE PURPOSES
@Matthew 13: 44 - 46; @1 Chronicles 21: 18 - 25; Genesis 23: 11 - 19; @Revelation 3: 18
I wish to speak at this time about *purchase*. The idea of buying and selling is very old, but I wish to dwell upon purchasing as divinely introduced. In this respect it came in with Abraham. It was in the world before, for the Lord tells us that they builded and planted in Sodom and bought and sold; that is how the world went on. Merchandising had a great place, and has more now perhaps than at any time. It belongs to the world, the realm represented in Tyre. Christians in business have to be on their guard as to the mercantile spirit, lest they make it an object, lest rather than a means of livelihood, it becomes a pleasure; it may thus be classified with sport. Therefore, a believer has to watch lest he be drawn into the current of buying and selling as affording him satisfaction. The apostle enjoins us to be as "they that buy, as not possessing". Otherwise we shall be on the level of the man who said, "Soul, thou hast much good things laid by for many years" (@Luke 12: 19), and pull down our barns and build larger ones, and buy our houses accordingly, and our cars.
All this is a snare, and there can be no doubt it marked the Sodomites, great sinners as they were, but they did in this respect what was in itself legitimate. "They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all of them" (@Luke 17: 28, 29). That happened in Sodom, which in that sense represents the industrial field, the mercantile field, besides the wickedness that goes with money-making. "The love of money is the root of every evil" we are told, and industrial occupations largely
{202}
afford the means for the acquirement of wealth. The antediluvians were pleasure-loving, social people (compare @Luke 17: 26, 27) and sociability must have been in Sodom too. Mere social relations may readily merge into what is actually in opposition to the people of God, and we have to be wary of them. Of course, we must be considerate of men as such, for they are creatures of God as we are. While refusing their worldliness, we have to clothe them in this sense. So you find in the heavenly man, that is, in Abraham, good terms existing between him and the inhabitants of the land; although he knew from the divine promise that the land would all be his; he was also heir of the world. What a different outlook on the world this fact would give to Abraham! And in truth, as the gospel was preached to Abraham, who is the father of all believers, he would learn in some degree to clothe men and women with creative thoughts. They belonged to God as the Creator. We need to do this, otherwise we shall not be in their confidence.
I mention all this in a prefatory way. The antediluvians, as I was saying, must have had great social facilities for families, such as that of Methuselah and others. "They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all of them" (@Luke 17: 27). So much for the social and industrial or commercial side of human affairs; the christian has to be on his guard as to both, and see how God came in with the idea of purchase, in a most interesting manner. Why should He have to purchase anything through His people, as Abraham and David, when He created everything? The cattle on a thousand hills are His. Why then should He have to go into the market to buy cattle? Why should He have to buy land, or why should He have to buy persons? Well, these
{203}
are important questions which I hope will be somewhat answered in what I have to say, for I believe it is important that our souls should be instructed in this matter of divine purchase. It is set out in the clearest manner in the passage in Matthew 13. Verse 44 introduces the thought of a treasure found. It was hidden. The man found the treasure, as you will observe, hidden in a field, "and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field". There is joy in the matter, this matter of divine purchase. The Lord here likened Himself to a man, and incidentally it may be remarked that whilst the Lord felt everything as no one else could feel the weals and woes of mankind, also the disregard of the rights of God everywhere, yet He would be by no means doleful or depressed. An incident of this kind shows what marked the Lord. There are many others, too, of course, to help us in this respect, but this one shows the readiness with which joy came into His heart -- the joy of the treasure. Why should He have to buy the field? He was the Creator of it. He owned it creatorially. Why should He have to buy it? Well, that is what He did. Buying is sometimes difficult, especially if the article or commodity desired is not on sale, not specially on sale. There is no evidence that this field was advertised to be sold, yet the Lord had the joy of the treasure which He found in the field, and the purchase must be made.
The seller is not in view here, yet the Lord in the type, in the parable, would buy the field. There is something in it which causes Him joy. Think of that! How it should appeal to us! He had us in mind in this matter, dear brethren. I suppose the thought of *finding* alludes historically to what He found in Peter, and John, and James, and Bartholomew, and Mary of Bethany, and many others. He found in them what He loved. David never found
{204}
such interest, such joy in men. He had his men; Solomon had his; but they never found such joy in men as the Lord did. Solomon was a figure of Christ in this respect, for he had a wonderful heart; God gave him a wonderful heart. He was a man of great affection. But think of Jesus, the Creator of everything! He created Adam. There was not one thing done that He did not do. He created Eve. It was not a mere matter of workmanship, for His heart was in it; and now He has Peter, and James, and John, and many others, and they are wonderful in His eyes. He saw something beyond what others saw. He names it -- a treasure, and He introduces the idea of purchase, not to purchase the treasure, but the field in which it was; that is, it belonged to the field, as the trees belonged, in Abraham's mind, to the cave of Machpelah. So this treasure belonged to the field; it was greater than the field. But He would have the field, and would sell all that He had in order to buy it.
Now that raises the question as to the position at the present time. Our chapter tells us what the field is. A field suggests the idea of a sphere of workmanship; but it is not the thought of a tilled field here. The time for that is coming; the Lord Jesus as the true Solomon will speak of everything relating to the earth, so that it will be understood why Solomon spoke of all the living things on earth. David spoke of heavenly things. The day is coming when Christ will speak of everything here below. How suitable everything here will be in its own setting! as He said of Nathanael, "an Israelite, in whom there is no guile". He will grace the coming world with such persons -- guileless persons, who can name the Lord Jesus in reverence and affection, saying "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" (@John 1: 49). Such persons will adorn the coming earth; but in the meantime He is not purchasing
{205}
the field for that, He is purchasing it because of this treasure. And this treasure is not Jewry, nor is it the nations as such. It is an unnamed treasure here. The Lord hides it, so that we are in a Colossian position. It alludes to ourselves, the Lord has hidden us, but He has the field, and has right-of-way, in order to get each of us.
That brings in the question of the earth and what is going on at the present time: whatever interferes with the Lord's rights of purchase on the earth must not be, for He has His people in it; He has His treasure in it. Here we are in this hall tonight, and there are many more of the Lord's people in this city, unknown to us, but known to Him. He has some of us, perhaps all -- He is already valuing us as belonging to this treasure. We read in this chapter of a man who brings out of his treasure things new and old. The scribe of the kingdom of the heavens does that. The Lord is speaking about the treasure in the parable, and anyone instructed in the kingdom of the heavens will understand what He means.
As I said, we are here tonight belonging to this treasure. Let us take the thought into our hearts. We are hidden. We do not want newspaper advertisements. The world does not know us, because it knew Him not, and faith accepts that. We would be in correspondence with Christ in everything. But still, the Lord has much people in this city, as in Corinth. He said to Paul, "Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 9, 10). What a great thing to realise that in our service no one shall set upon us to injure us! "I have much people in this city", the Lord said. The Lord had right-of-way in Corinth.
{206}
The next verse brings in enlargement of the thought. It is no longer that He has *found* something, but He is looking for something, for the thought became enlarged, as I may so say, in the blessed Lord's mind. He is looking for something; that is, if we were in the treasure, then He would look for us in another point of view -- a pearl, as a merchantman seeking goodly pearls. The Lord is now seeking something. Well, I believe that enters into this. The Lord has the assembly in His mind, and He has sought it and bought it, and it is "one pearl of great value". The context shows that it is an advance in thought -- it is the thought of superiority, a superlative idea. We read of approving "the things that are more excellent". That is what the Lord has in mind for us at the present time. We have entered upon the time of translation, and things are pressed forward by the Spirit of God in a peculiar way, and the end in view is that the saints should be ready when the moment arrives. It is very beautiful in that sense; it brings us all into it. "But ... of that hour no one knows ... but the Father". So that the saints are to be aglow with anticipation and desire that as the Father's moment comes, the translation will take place -- the coming of the Lord, too, into public glory.
I want to show now from David and Abraham how this worked out: everything is presented perfectly in Christ. The idea of purchase is in the epistles, but in Matthew 13 we see it in a beautiful setting in these parables. You will understand that they were spoken inside the house (verse 36). It is a private matter. The Lord is going on with us in this way. It is a secret position, involving the mystery. "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens". Well, the Lord would impress us with the greatness of it, so that we might value the things involved in the mysteries of the
{207}
kingdom of the heavens. When we come to the assembly it is not mysteries, but mystery -- the great divine thought transcending all others, the mystery.
Now David in type helps us through his failure. He is used to help us. I do not believe any of these failures of the great servants of God would be recorded save to help us; they are written for our learning, and everything happened as types for us. David had committed a great sin, but his sin resulted in this wonderful end, the purchase of the site of the house of God. I speak of it now as to how it works out in believers, for one observes great want of definiteness of purpose in the brethren. I have taken up this matter of purchase or buying, because it contemplates a very definite transaction, that one has something in his mind. One has begun to be definite, to set value on things, to appraise things in their true value; and having appraised them in their true value, then we want to have part in them, something that we can call our own, and if so, the price has to be paid. In this sense, we are not so much looking for gift. One is assured of one's own disposition, which I suppose is natural to us all, to want gift. God is a Giver. The idea of gift is infinite in Him. "If thou knewest the gift of God" the Lord says, and again, "It is more blessed to give than to receive". Gift for service is attractive, but it is apt to be a snare; it is to be desired, and God gives it; but there is the thought of suitability for it, which must be acquired. Thus gift is rightly valued and used as received from God.
David is offered the threshing-floor as a gift, the threshing-sledges for wood, and the wheat for the oblation, but he would not offer to Jehovah what cost him nothing. He would buy all for "full money". But Ornan, who would give all to David, was a remarkable man; he was not a man to be
{208}
despised. He had four sons too. Why should they be mentioned? He is going to be honoured in this matter. He is already honoured because he is offering for the house of God. The two men are honoured -- the purchaser and the seller, the seller because he wishes to make a gift, and the purchaser because he will not offer to God what cost him nothing. His four sons are with their father. They are threshing wheat. They are real workers and workers for a purpose -- the staff of life, wheat.
Well, the prophet Gad had said to David that he should go up and rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. That was the message, and I hope each of us will place himself in the position to receive a message at this time. It is a prophetic time we are living in. Some of us were noticing that Gad and Nathan were David's prophets; Gad particularly was David's seer. And now he serves him as before, in this matter of the house. "The angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah". Observe that! Speaking of prophecy, it is not simply that a brother has a word, he speaks in the name of Jehovah. Those who listen are to judge. Is it indeed in the name of the Lord? Is it indeed a commandment? If it be, it is on the level of 1 Corinthians, and do we not need imperative words, dear brethren? We shall get them if we are ready for them. Notice that David went up at the saying of Gad which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah. So that our prophetic meetings become of great importance, but then speaking in the name is not enough. I must be worthy of the name; one has to go to the meetings in the name of the Lord. Think of the import of the name of the Lord! This would
{209}
affect a man as he leaves his house if he is to be used publicly at a prophetic meeting; what sobriety, what sense of responsibility would mark him!
The angel's word is short: it is prophetic. The circumstances were disturbed and peculiar, for David had just sinned, and sins cannot be fully dealt with in a second, you know. After denying the Lord, Peter was not set up until the Lord had probed him (@John 21); and David had to go through his exercises for this sorrowful sin, but he obeys the divine word immediately. Immediately the word came from the angel to go up, he went up. He was subject. "David went up at the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah". How important it is that we have an ear for what is in the name of the Lord and are subject to it! We discern it has come to us in the name of the Lord.
David is now imbued with the idea of purchase. He understands what is needed. No doubt he had read Genesis. Men of faith would read books God provided. The Scriptures are a wonderful provision for us. There can be no doubt that David read this chapter in Genesis, and indeed, I believe the Psalms are constructed on similar lines to the Pentateuch: each has five books. The Spirit of God through the psalmists would carry forward into the Psalms the great divine thoughts in the Pentateuch. The idea of purchase enters into them, as here. David is not behind Abraham. He used the very same words, "full money". It is a true man that says that sort of thing. He is not bargaining for a lower price. It is a question of uprightness.
The idea of manhood enters into all divine transactions, and certainly any one of us who is in any way in the service of God, and every one of us is called into it, should be marked by manhood. So David says that he will pay the full price. So we are told in the passage that David gave to Ornan for
{210}
the property six hundred shekels of gold by weight. There is weight and measure. It was the weight of six hundred shekels, for coins are apt to be adulterated, but gold by weight is the pure metal, and that is what David gave. And observe that he bought the *place*. He would make full room for the house of God and for all that pertained to it.
I would like to speak now of Abraham and of the burials of the brethren. If we are in our graves, our spirits are with Christ. If we are in our bodies here, we are in the house of God. That is the position. David is, in type, looking after the saints in their bodies, making plenty of room for them. The early chapters in Acts show how room was there: there was great increase in the number of persons. But the saints have to be looked after in view of their disembodiment. Both Peter and Paul contemplated putting off their tabernacles. Provision had to be made for this. The apostle Paul says, "those who have fallen asleep through Jesus", a most beautiful expression. The Lord sees to our falling asleep, and to our burial. Devout men carry us to our burial, all under the Lord. The Lord is saying by the Spirit in Genesis 23 that He is providing with the greatest care for the burials of His people. Does not love enter into it? It does indeed. Abraham was in the presence of his dead when he said this. It is not until he makes the purchase in the most formal manner that we are told in verse 19 "after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife". "After this;" and every burial since that time is "after this", that is after this care of love has been expended, this precious interest in the burials of the saints. It is a matter of faith. Nothing is more a matter of faith. It is the father of the faithful who buys this burying ground. Jacob takes it up in the most definite way, and would
{211}
be buried there. He was carried over into Canaan to be buried in this cave.
We read that the cave was in a field, and I think that this thought of a field is worthy of note, for do not the saints need room for the expression of love in our burials? They are not cold affairs, such as we find with the unbelieving. I do not know that I have ever been at the grave of an unbeliever, but I conceive it would be a cold matter. God forbid that anyone here should be an unbeliever! The unbeliever keeps death as far away from his mind as possible, but not so the believer. Paul enters into this matter, saying, "to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better". Of course, that would mean his burial. We are not told of his burial. It is remarkable how little is made of the burials of christians, but the general thought is stated in the Acts as clearly as possible. Stephen's burial, and the burials of Ananias and Sapphira -- the latter two erring ones, and yet such are provided for, as it were, in this field, in this cave. The love of Christ follows up everyone, even such persons as are under the discipline of the assembly, under the discipline of God, are buried. I think it shows the genuineness of their christianity, that they were both buried.
So Abraham secures the field and the trees -- the whole position. It is an actual transaction, and that is what I am aiming at -- to show you that buying means a definite transaction to get something that faith sees is needed for the Lord's people. Let nothing be omitted that is needed for the care of the Lord's people, whether in life or in death. Love would see to that as in Abraham and in Paul, and in the Lord Himself. How wonderfully He acted at the grave of Lazarus! "Where have ye put him?" How touching that is! "Jesus wept". However, I am speaking now of this matter of purchase, that we should understand that we should be definite.
{212}
We have things in our minds, we know what is needed, and we get them. It is a matter of purchase. If it costs me something then I value it ever after. If it does not cost me something, then I am likely to think lightly of it. It is not a question of salvation or redemption, but I am speaking of things that are needed, and faith will purchase them, will pay for them, so that they might be secured and available for the Lord's people.
I would refer finally to the Laodiceans. The Lord says, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest" (@Revelation 3: 18). That is a very remarkable word and in keeping with the last address to the assemblies. The Lord tells the overcomer here that He has sat down with His Father in His throne. He is there tonight, and hence the gospel is going forth, and who can interfere with His rights in His field? As to these Laodiceans, the Lord had written to them through Paul, and he tells the Colossians to have their letter, that is the epistle to the Colossians, read in Laodicea; and that the letter to Laodicea was to be read to the Colossians. Had they taken heed to it they would not have needed this counsel, for it combated the evil and ceremonialism of philosophy. It was the admission of philosophy and vain deceit into the professing body, that made it rich in its *own* account -- higher criticism and all that. Now we see the result of this epistle to the Colossians being unread and unaccepted in practice as divine truth. Philosophy, vain deceit, and ceremonialism are what mark the professing body today. It thinks it is rich, but the Lord says, "*thou* art the wretched, and ... poor". "I am about to spue thee out of my mouth". Yet He says, "I counsel thee to buy of me". It is a transaction
{213}
with Him that the Lord urges. You will remember that the foolish virgins were told to go and buy from those who sold, but before they could buy, the Lord had come, and they were left outside. The Lord would not open to them, although they wished that He would. Here the Lord is telling the Laodiceans to buy of Him. It is a peculiarly touching word, that the Lord is counselling *such* people. He was about to spue them out of His mouth, but in the meantime, He is giving them counsel, and that is, that they should come to Him and buy. He is not offering anything for nothing: they are past that. They have been investigating and found out things that nobody had known before, they think. They are not trying to get things for nothing.
Although He is the great Giver, the Lord says He is ready to sell. "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest". The Lord is counselling them, and indeed ourselves, to buy the requisites. If we say, We are rich and increased with goods, the Lord says, as it were, None of the things that you have are requisite; the idea is, that you buy the requisites for an entrance "into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ". What are the requisites? Gold tried in the fire, and white raiment. In this book and elsewhere there are those spoken of who wash their robes, but now you can see that it is a question of *having* needed things, of coming to Christ, as He counsels, and buying the things you need.
May God bless these thoughts to us.
{214}
THE REMNANT (1)
@Isaiah 1: 9; @Isaiah 6: 1 - 13
J.T. I have in mind to read in the prophet Isaiah, in relation to the remnant, hoping that the Lord may help us in considering the subject from the standpoint of Isaiah. What is in mind for this reading is largely that we may see how, in a practical way, we come into the truth of the remnant, involving generally the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament. Isaiah 6 is the prophet's own account of how he came into the truth and became a messenger: a servant in ministering it. That is, it would be a matter of moral instruction in the first reading, as to where we are in our souls; and how we judge conditions in ourselves. Verse 9 of the first chapter has been suggested because it gives us the general position. A remnant is a sovereign matter. "Unless Jehovah of hosts had left us a very small residue, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah". The apostle Paul brings this in in Romans as developing the truth of the remnant of Israel. It is a very important verse, because although we must judge ourselves to have part in it, the remnant is the result of God's sovereignty.
The verse in Isaiah 1 is outstanding. It is set there to govern the whole book. It shows that Israel or christians would be just as the world if God did not act sovereignly amongst them. They would be like Sodom and Gomorrah. There would be no remnant. There have been many nations of great historical importance, but there is no remnant of them; but Israel will have a remnant; and in christianity there is a remnant. Outside of these we can scarcely speak of a remnant. A remnant is what God sovereignly provides. He says, "Yet I have left myself seven
{215}
thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him" (@1 Kings 19: 18).
H.H. Is it what God has for Himself here over against the great unbelieving mass?
J.T. The first chapter corresponds with the great professing system of things around, and in this verse it stands out that God is acting for Himself in leaving a remnant.
L.E.S. Would a sense of the mighty power of God for the protection of His heritage be conveyed in Isaiah's name -- 'Salvation of Jah'?
J.T. Just so. Aside from that principle there can be nothing. Paul's last word, we may say, as to salvation is that the *elect* may obtain it; "that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory" (@2 Timothy 2: 10). It is the sovereignty of God, and for those who are chosen -- predestinated.
A.N.W. The apostle refers in @Romans 9: 27 to both Isaiah 1, which you have quoted, and to other verses in @Isaiah 10, saying, "But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved".
J.T. That amplifies what we have been saying.
Ques. Is the government of God moving in relation to all the evil and failure? If it were carried right through it would lead to judgment as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah.
J.T. That is what the world is coming to. The government of God is employed subserviently, in order that this great thought of God as to a remnant, should be carried out; the remnant is to be the nucleus of what is called "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ" (@Revelation 11: 15). The millennium will not be the product of any governmental dealings of God; these culminate in Sodom.
{216}
Indeed, it is said that the city, the characteristic centre of government, is "called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified" (@Revelation 11: 8). The governmental ministry of God, as we may call it, is provisional, and would make way for the sovereign work of God, the result of which is to abound.
W.B-w. When Abraham interceded for the righteous in Sodom, did the Spirit of God have the remnant in mind?
J.T. Well, Abraham interceded for the righteous. He had to do with a great war, and his part in it was to rescue the righteous, his brother Lot; which he did, but the righteous that he rescued elected to remain in Sodom and did not become a remnant. God had no thought of a remnant there. Lot had to get out; there is no remnant of that kind. The remnant is a sovereign matter; it is not anything of the world. Although there are christians in the world positionally they are not of it, and their responsibility is to get out. I do not think that even Abraham had the idea that Lot was any part of Sodom. Sodom was a thing by itself. There is no remnant at all of that.
Ques. So that at a certain point Abraham ceased to intercede. Had he reached the mind of God in the matter?
J.T. Yes. The great thought of government is in @Genesis 18. God was on His way; the place where He met Abraham was not the terminus of God's journey. He was on the way to Sodom; that is, on the way to *judgment*, not to the rescue of a remnant. Whatever was of God, Abraham respected it, and God stayed with Abraham, showing great consideration for him, and He honoured him. Abraham is exercised enough to go with Jehovah; God is on His way to something, and Abraham falls in line with that; he is not making himself the end of the
{217}
matter; for the moment it is judgment. God did not say anything, whilst He was under the tree, about Abraham commanding his house after him. It is when Abraham is interested enough to move on the way to the judgment of the world that God says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" (@Genesis 18: 17). God brings him into the secret of His mind, seeing that Abraham is already on the way with Him. He is taking sides with God; and then he says, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (@Genesis 18: 25). He begins to speak about the fifty that might be in the city, and he goes down to ten; but it is a question of the earth and the judgment of it. That is where the ten fit in -- the righteous in Sodom -- they belong to the righteous, and however few or many, God respects them. So God did not stop at Abraham's ten; Abraham stopped. Thus the position in Genesis 18 greatly aids us as to what we are saying now. It is a question of the world, and what God is doing; but there is no remnant of it at all; it culminates in Sodom, in evil; so that God has to destroy it. Meanwhile, there are instrumentalities He uses, and these are in relation to the righteous. He is the God of all the earth; He is the Judge of all the earth; He is doing right, and whoever is doing right, God is with him in this provisional way.
H.H. Would you say that God's government is in favour of the righteous, as well as being against the wicked?
J.T. Clearly so. God is ready to listen to Abraham about the righteous, and that is comforting in regard to our prayers.
D.R. Would you define the thought of the remnant? The natural thought of it is that it is more or less a fag end.
J.T. As already said, the remnant stands connected with the sovereignty of God. As to quality,
{218}
it is essentially equal to the prime thing; it develops into what abides before God.
J.T-n. Do we see the sovereignty of God in relation to Joseph and his brethren? In speaking to them he said, "God sent me before you to preserve life" (@Genesis 45: 5); and "God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance" (@Genesis 45: 7).
J.T. Yes; that brings out the present position, that is, Christ among the gentiles. Joseph in Egypt was, in type, Christ among the gentiles, and is to be looked at from that side. "Christ in you the hope of glory" (@Colossians 1: 27), alludes to that position and it is in relation to the perfecting of every man. It is this which God is set for; to "present every man perfect in Christ".
R.W.S. The moral state in Lot was not right, in that he goes back to the city after being rescued from those who carried him away.
J.T. At what expense and trial Abraham rescued him, and yet he is again found in Sodom, so that he cannot be viewed as a remnant; yet, he is called a righteous man with a righteous soul -- a very important matter. He felt the state of things in Sodom day by day, but then he should not be there.
W.B-w. The principle of God's sovereignty is one side of the truth, but there must be separation from evil on our side in order to prove that we are part of the remnant.
J.T. That is what we should see. That is how it comes about practically. The first thing now is to see the moral side. We get five chapters by Isaiah before he tells us of his own moral history. First we have "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah" (@Isaiah 1: 1) -- that is the period of his ministry; we do not get such accounts in the
{219}
New Testament. His period belonged to Old Testament times -- prophetic times, so that we get the kings in whose reigns he ministered; but in addition we get his own history morally; that is what is of value now. It is not simply that we are in the mind of God sovereignly, but our own moral history is of great importance -- each one has to look into that himself; that is chapter 6.
S.McC. Is it not interesting that in @Romans 11: 2, where we get the thought of the remnant, we have, "Know ye not what the scripture says in the history of Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel?"
J.T. Quite so. Elijah pleaded against God's people; but what was the divine answer? "I have left to myself seven thousand". Elijah was out of the testimony for the moment, but was brought back into it again. He came back into it at Horeb, and he is allowed to continue on. Isaiah tells us after five chapters what his own moral history was; how he saw the Lord at a certain time, that is, at the end of a reign of fifty-two years, of a monarch who became a leper. A very great monarch he was at the beginning; but he became a leper because his heart was lifted up in him. God was helping him, and he became inflated and became a leper. He entered into the temple of God as a priest, when he was only king. I think that is important to see. Isaiah refers to the year that king Uzziah died, showing how long we may serve and serve well, and yet become inflated and have a poor end. Uzziah was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a separate house.
L.E.S. Would the four kings suggest what is favourable generally in relation to the testimony? Would it not suggest present circumstances?
J.T. There was good in Uzziah, and Hezekiah was a good monarch. There was good in Jotham, but Ahaz wearied God and men. So that the
{220}
prophet to some extent had to serve under difficult circumstances. God has called our attention to prophetic ministry, but we ought to be reminded, I think, that it is usually under difficult circumstances. We are not always to be in favour, if we are true prophets. Stephen enquires, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" (@Acts 7: 52).
H.H. Leprosy refers to state, not exactly sins, which are forgiven. The thought of our state is important for us.
J.T. Yes. Uzziah *became* a leper; that is important. Another important consideration is whether leprosy is judicial, or whether it is the normal product of sin in a man. The first recorded case is judicial, that is Miriam. Then we have Uzziah here, and Gehazi, both judicially dealt with by God. It is a very solemn thing to be a leper judicially. Of course there is also the natural working of sin in the flesh. God brings it about judicially too. It is a most solemn thing, and that was the case with Uzziah.
H.H. Yes, that is very serious.
J.T. That a man should serve well, and then become inflated and leprous is a very great warning at the present time.
Rem. The recognition of the sovereignty of God in connection with the remnant would always rebuke pride and inflation. The sense of being where we are sovereignly on God's side, would produce deep thankfulness accompanied by humility, and probably deep desires to be morally suited to the position. God's remnant would be morally suited to Himself.
J.T. That is really what comes out in Isaiah's ministry. It is as he judges himself, and is cleansed, that he says, "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?
{221}
And I said, Here am I; send me". It is remarkable that that voice was heard. It is "who". The moral side is in the forefront as this voice is heard; that is, the moral experience or process that he had been through, as recorded in the first seven verses. "In the year of the death of king Uzziah, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Seraphim were standing above him: each had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he flew. And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory! And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts. And one of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; and he made it touch my mouth, and said, Behold, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated" (verses 1 - 7). It seems to me that this is the great thought for us at the moment, as to whether we have been with God on these lines, because in the process of cleansing, we get an impression as to service. It is not something that we simply learn afterwards; we get an impression as to service, and the seraphim represent that, in this passage. So that the cleansed man is ready for service; the two processes are concurrent.
C.DeB. Is this much the same principle as in connection with Job? "... now mine eye seeth thee" (@Job 42: 5).
J.T. The process is thorough. He becomes a priest, as we see at the end of the book, as a result
{222}
we might say, of the processes he has been through. Jehovah says to the three friends, "My servant Job shall pray for you". He is ready to serve, as the process is finished. Thus am I available to God as a result. I am cleansed, but the impression I receive in the process constitutes me a vessel suitable for service. The Lord on the cross brings out the prominence of God's service in His thoughts. What He says as making expiation, and what He says as completing it shows He is ready for service -- holily, of course, infinitely so; there was no need of a process there. He says to God, "Thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel" (@Psalm 22: 3). The praises of Israel are to go on, and He is to establish them, so He speaks of them on the cross. Then as having come through it He says, in verse 22 of that psalm, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee". He is the Model; and here Isaiah is ready for the service; the need is great. In the presence of this wonderful account of the man's conversion the voice is heard, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"
J.T.Jr. Is the cleansing from the divine side here? It is a glowing coal taken from off the altar by one of the seraphim. The cleansing is sovereign, too, is it not?
J.T. Clearly. The seraphim are ready; they are occupied in service Godward, and ready to meet the need. Isaiah is impressed with the glory and with the holiness of the scene, and, thus impressed, he is ready to serve God. That is what we get when the voice is heard. John says, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him" (@John 12: 41). He is ready to speak of Him.
L.E.S. Would you say that, if we accept the judicial side, the seraphim are ready to serve us? They are in the service of God.
{223}
J.T. They are ready to serve men as need exists. Isaiah too is ready to serve; he comes out of this as a servant, as a vessel, ready.
Ques. It seems that what he *saw* brought him to the realisation of his own state, and the state of the people; but it is what he *heard* that encouraged him to be ready for the service. Do you think that there may be many who have not heard the voice of the Lord, because of the lack of moral cleansing?
J.T. I think that is the lesson for us. There is great need for service, and thank God there are many coming forward; but more are needed.
H.H. This would indicate that you have to be sent. The emphasis is on *send* according to the note. "Here am I: *send* me". It is not "send *me*".
J.T. The Lord says constantly in John's gospel that He is sent; and according to chapter 9, the work of God in believers is marked by the idea of being sent, which Siloam signifies.
A.N.W. Why does the instruction centre on the lips?
J.T. In view of what we are to say, I suppose, because ministry is largely what we say. "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him". He spoke twice according to John's report there. In @Isaiah 53: 1 he says, "Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?" It is the sorrowful judicial side in chapter 6; the message that he received is very trying to have to deliver. It is not like a gospel message; it is judicial. In the prophetic realm we have to be prepared for that. The answer to Isaiah is, "Go; and thou shalt say unto this people, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
{224}
and understand with their heart, and be converted, and healed". That is a very distressing thought. It is a difficult thing to bring yourself round to the judicial side of the actions of God; you would rather have it the other way. That is the point in what God is doing publicly; we have to get round to what God means in it. We shall not be used in a prophetic way unless we get God's thoughts and give up our own. You can understand how the prophet says immediately, "Lord, how long?" That is a technical expression of faith -- "how long". God's ways are not our ways (@Isaiah 55: 8), and cover long periods of time to reach an end, we have to suffer in patience meanwhile.
W.F.K. Peter was part of the remnant of Israel. The Lord prepared him for his service.
J.T. Peter's ministry is largely governmental. It is to those who are affected by the government of God; so that he says, "Beloved, take not as strange the fire of persecution which has taken place amongst you for your trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you" (@1 Peter 4: 12). We must accept it; it is a time of governmental dealings.
A.P.T. Do the circumstances surrounding Paul's conversion colour his whole ministry? Would it synchronise somewhat with the "Holy, holy, holy" here?
J.T. It would. He saw the Lord, as he said, "Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?" (@1 Corinthians 9: 1). The link is there. I suppose he would never forget the impression; the idea of holiness, that the Lord's appearing to him would convey to his soul. So that there is a striking link there; only he has to go into the city, which is another important side. He has to go into the city to be told what he must do. We must submit to our brethren to start with. I must be *told* what I must do.
{225}
R.W.S. Were you linking this "how long" with current happenings?
J.T. Yes. The message is, "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and healed". I think it covers the whole message; and, of course, covers the whole period in which we are now, in which this state fully marks the Jews. It is the passage the apostle quotes in Romans, corresponding with his last words to the Jews at Antioch, quoted from @Isaiah 49. So he says, "... lo, we turn to the nations" (@Acts 13: 46), and also, "This salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear it" (@Acts 28: 28). But the message goes on to show that it is a question of the moral state of the nation here: "Until the cities be wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land become an utter desolation, and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the solitude be great in the midst of the land" (verses 11, 12). That is enlarged on in the Lord's own prophetic discourse as recorded in the gospels; then we have the final thought of the remnant. Verse 13 says, "But a tenth part shall still be therein, and it shall return and be eaten; as the terebinth and as the oak whose trunk remaineth after the felling: the holy seed shall be the trunk thereof". That will presently take place. The christian period is, of course, ignored in this passage. On the prophetic side it is a question of the Jews being back again in the land, and God having begun this work in a remnant, so that the holy seed is there. It is not there yet; you cannot detect it anywhere yet except in isolated ones who are genuinely converted. This prophetic word refers to the coming day when the veil is removed; when God begins to work again, and brings to light the
{226}
holy seed. It is what was there before; it is not a new thing, for the holy seed remains.
The Lord had this passage in His mind during His ministry, but particularly towards the close when they were refusing Him. It is remarkable how often you find this passage in the New Testament, each instance showing it is judicial, the testimony being refused; this must precede, and then the holy seed comes to light again. So that the Lord in @Matthew 10: 23 says, "Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come", also, "Go not off into the way of the nations ... go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (@Matthew 10: 5, 6). This ministry would run on, overlooking the assembly period, until the last days, "until the Son of man be come". There will be a ministry fitting it here, so that the holy seed comes to light. Where is this holy seed? It is the trunk. It is brought to light through this terrible discipline. Look at the passage, "And I said, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the cities be wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land become an utter desolation, and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the solitude be great in the midst of the land. But a tenth part shall still be therein, and it shall return and be eaten; as the terebinth and as the oak whose trunk remaineth after the felling: the holy seed shall be the trunk thereof". The holy seed is mentioned; that is the trunk; the substance is the holy seed.
L.E.S. @Romans 11: 22, 23 would fit in here; "Behold then the goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since otherwise *thou* also wilt be cut away. And *they*, too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them in".
{227}
J.T. Romans 9, 10 and 11 deal with this whole matter, to reconcile the preaching of the apostle "to the Jew first", but later to the gentiles, for there is no difference. The idea of a remnant fits into that section strikingly. I think we ought to see that the idea of the remnant is not something injected; it is a continuance of Israel's whole history; Israel's whole history is in mind. It is the substance, or the trunk. Job has a remarkable passage which fits in here. He says, "For there is hope for a tree: if it be cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender branch will not cease; Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground, Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a young plant" (@Job 14: 7 - 9). The word "cut" there would mean a hand does it judicially; there it lies; "yet through the scent of water it will bud", the life is in it, "and put forth boughs like a young plant". It is very striking, I think, as confirming what we get here. The seed remains there; it is viewed as the same right through, although the trunk apparently had been dead.
C.A.M. Those three chapters in Romans serve to show that the apostle had that seed in his soul, but it had to wait.
J.T. He would be waiting, I suppose; he connects himself with the seed in 1 Corinthians, not with christianity; not as one coming in after, but as coming in *before;* that is the remnant. Personally he represents the remnant *before* the time; using an "abortion" as a figure. In fact, he says so: "*I* also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin" (@Romans 11: 1). There was a remnant then, but he had come in before the future time of it; and it is well to consider the apostle Paul from that point of view in order to get an idea of the coming Jewish remnant.
{228}
C.A.M. That would mean that the prophet goes through in his own soul the import of what he is going to say; so that he knows what the remnant is to be.
J.T. Well, you can see how feeling he is; and all this will be most touching and sobering to us if accepted. Isaiah says, "Lord, how long?" as much as to say, 'I am ready for the message, but I did not expect such severity;' it is a most serious message, "... how long?" He felt for his people.
A.P.T. Romans 11 speaks about being grafted in. What is the difference between that, and the seed that is there?
J.T. The word "grafted" there means that we gentiles are brought into something in which we were not before. It is the public position of the assembly. We are linked on with the substance of what was there; what was in Abraham. We are grafted into the public position. The gentiles will be cut off, but all Israel will be saved. That does not mean *every* Israelite, but the nation will be saved.
F.H.L. Would the principle be seen in the people themselves at the beginning? The carcases of some fell in the wilderness.
J.T. Yes. The whole nation came into Canaan. It is a remarkable thing that the second numbering is almost identical with the first; the same number go in as came out, although those in the first numbering almost all fell in the wilderness. The link is in Joshua and Caleb; the substance is always there; it goes right through; and even if it comes down to the gentiles now, it is morally the same.
L.E.S. Paul says, in his testimony to Agrippa, "And now I stand to be judged because of the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, to which our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night hope to arrive" (@Acts. 26: 6, 7).
{229}
J.T. Quite so. He identified himself with Israel from its source.
A.B.P. Do we see the remnant in @Matthew 26 at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper?
J.T. Yes. Simon was not a leper *then*, but what he had been was owned; he did not die a leper; he was fit for fellowship. There was a fine scope in his house for ministering to Christ; there the woman anointed His head. The synoptic gospels do not give her name; it is to bring out the importance of the *act*, and to show the scope for it in the leper's house.
W.B-w. In this case the trunk remained. In the case of Nebuchadnezzar's dream that Daniel interpreted, the stump remains. In this case it is the trunk. Is there some difference?
J.T. There is a difference. It is "felling" here -- it is "whose trunk remaineth after the felling". In Daniel it is not what is felled, it is the *root*, the stump held under bands of iron and brass. It is God preserving the root substance of Nebuchadnezzar during the seven years of his discipline. It is the same idea, however.
W.B-w. You mean Nebuchadnezzar was converted afterward?
J.T. Well, he was probably divinely affected before, but he had to go through all this so that he would have a man's heart. There was something there that God would protect during the period of his affliction and discipline. It is kept with a band. It is not allowed to grow. There is the suggestion that as subjected to correction one is not marked by growth. Correction is a negative thought; formation is a positive thing. The stump is kept with bands of iron; the chastening goes on; after that he stands up, and has a man's heart.
W.B-w. I get help from that, because I see that God is going on. He is working out great
{230}
things, as we see in the conversion of a great king like Nebuchadnezzar.
J.T. Quite so. It is a consideration for any of us under discipline, if there is anything of God in the stump, or root; the disciplinary period is for the reduction of what hinders growth.
W.B-w. Has all that to do with the ways of God on the earth?
J.T. Here it is after the felling; after the tree is cut down. As Job says, "yet through the scent of water it will bud". As God begins to work in Israel there will be a response to the truth; that is what is meant; and it bears fruit immediately.
R.W.S. Over against that truth, it says, "and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be" (@Ecclesiastes 11: 3).
J.T. There is no life in that thought at all. It *falls*, being *cut* down would be an act of God.
A.P.T. In @Daniel 9: 26, it says, "And after the sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, and shall have nothing". How does this truth apply in relation to that scripture?
J.T. "After the sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off". That was when Christ died. Therefore, it is already fulfilled up to that point and we view it thus as only one half-week to be fulfilled. All the prophetic truth that still remains unfulfilled must enter into that week, but Christ is cut off and has nothing from the Jewish standpoint. Of course, He has the assembly, but that is another matter. That does not enter into these weeks at all.
H.H. When does that one half-week come in?
J.T. In one sense, it may be a week. Christ's ministry entered into the first half because it is "after the sixty-two weeks" (which added to the seven weeks make sixty-nine weeks) He is cut off. Sixty-nine weeks therefore have passed and that
{231}
leaves only one. The Lord's ministry enters into this, covering at least the first half, according to the facts given in the gospels. But other happenings, as @Daniel 9: 27 shows, enter into the *week*. But the second half is stressed in the book of Daniel and in the book of Revelation. "... a time, and times, and half a time ..." (@Revelation 12: 14). The assembly will not be here to see it. We may see preliminary conditions that point to it, but we are to be kept out of all that enters into it. The Lord promises Philadelphia they shall not see it: "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, *I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth" (@Revelation 3: 10).
A.N.W. Do you think we may not see the beginning?
J.T. Not strictly.
W.F.K. Is this "holy seed" carried forward in the assembly?
J.T. Well, it is; it is in the remnant. Paul speaks of himself as of the remnant, so that it was there in him. We may see it in Paul's history. He alludes to it, saying, "And last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also" (@1 Corinthians 15: 8). Also that there should be "a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal" (@1 Timothy 1: 16).
A.E.H. Do you think the fact that the Messiah was cut off in the last week might suggest that some part of the burdens of the first half of that week may come in before the assembly leaves?
J.T. I do not think so. We see conditions very like it now, but *held in check*. There will be a covenant between the "prince that shall come" and the many of the Jews for one week, and this certainly has not taken place. Gabriel's account to Daniel makes it plain that the ministry of Christ
{232}
would be in the first half of the week, because He was cut off *after* the sixty-ninth week.
W. In Matthew, John the baptist speaks of the axe being laid to the root of the tree.
J.T. It is *trees* there. "And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. *I* indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; *he* shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable" (@Matthew 3: 10 - 12). The trees there are unregenerate people that are of no value; they are to be burned. There is no idea of a stump left.
W.B-w. Malachi refers to the wicked being as stubble. There is no stump left there. It has to be burned. He refers to a remnant coming in, but speaks of the wicked being as stubble to be burned, (@Malachi 4, 1).
J.T. That corresponds with what our brother mentioned before; the axe is laid to the root of the trees, and what is not good is cut down and burned. There will be a terrible time in Palestine in the last days -- attack after attack. The Lord alludes to that especially. It is the time of Jacob's trouble. There has never been any equal to it, nor will there be. "And if those days had not been cut short, no flesh had been saved; but on account of the elect those days shall be cut short" (@Matthew 24: 22). It is the pressure God puts them through to bring out reality; because He is not content with anything else but what corresponds with Christ.
The Lord says of Paul, "*I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name". We should consider the extent of his suffering. You marvel
{233}
how he could stand it, but it is all to bring out the marvellous enduring quality that was there.
S.McC. Is it not interesting, that whereas the history in Daniel 9 is spoken of in weeks, the testimony of the witnesses in Revelation 11 is spoken of as in days; as if God preserves their special testimony in an extended kind of way?
J.T. That is a good way of putting it; day after day; what they were under His eye; the same as Christ in measure. What Christ was under God's eye, day after day, these two witnesses will be under His eye. The saints are under God's eye peculiarly in days of pressure.
H.H. No two days are the same in the eye of heaven.
J.T. In the gospels you read, "Days are coming, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it" (@Luke 17: 22).
A.N.W. The half means that one half belongs to the other half.
J.T. Spiritually the last half is the filling out of the first. The Lord's ministry gives character to the whole week, I suppose.
J.H.E. Paul speaks of filling out sufferings.
J.T. Yes. "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tabulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly" (@Colossians 1: 24).
{234}
THE REMNANT (2)
@Isaiah 7: 3 - 15; @Isaiah 8: 5 - 20
J.T. This morning we observed in chapter 6 that Isaiah was brought into the ministry, and how in the moral process of his soul, according to the vision he saw, he learned how to serve. He sees "the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. Seraphim were standing above him: each had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he flew. And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" (@Isaiah 6: 1 - 3).
While it is a kingly position, it is also a priestly position. The seraphim are representative of the priestly side of the service of God, while the cherubim would be more the governmental side. Isaiah sees here how the seraphim behave in their service, and how holiness marks them; and then they serve *him*. They serve Jehovah, but one of them serves the prophet. "One of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar". The seraphim served the Lord in the celebration of His holiness, they recognise their creature estate; in coming to the application of the truth of atonement they also recognise it, and use the tongs. Christ had to do with the altar as *suffering;* He endured it in its fulness, the infinite fulness of divine wrath poured out. The seraphim show that they know what to do; recognising at all times their creature limitations, an important matter in service. We cannot go beyond creature limitations, the Lord *can* in His service. The word says, He has become "higher than the heavens", as regards His priesthood (@Hebrews 7: 26); and in regard to gifts given to the
{235}
assembly, He has ascended up above all the heavens, (@Ephesians 4: 10). The gifts are limited, and creature limitations attach to them; so the seraphim uses the tongs, meaning that he does not experience the full force of wrath, but he takes a glowing coal, representing the fierceness of wrath against evil, "which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; and he made it touch my mouth". The sinner needs this touch in view of special service, for in the process he becomes a vessel of service, and so immediately it is said to him, "Behold, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated". All is fully dealt with. Then the voice is heard, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" and Isaiah says, "Here am I; send me". It is well to recall this again to see how it applies in chapter 7, how the minister now is dealing with a special case in himself. What follows in chapter 6 are general facts as to the remnant, and what the remnant undergoes so as to reach the divine thoughts as to it.
In chapter 7 we have a special case, and verse 3 reads, "And Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, thou and thy son Shear-jashub, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field". Isaiah is a family man. In the next chapter he has another son. He was a prophet, and his family is brought into the service; the child here having a name which signifies the point of view of the testimony at that time. This, it would seem, points to family education, and shows how our children ought to be brought into the service. The child does not say anything; he is apparently young, but is to be a sign, and is to be used as to his growth and age. Verse 16 reads, "For before the child knoweth to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land whose two kings thou fearest shall be forsaken". Thus the minister has
{236}
his child in the house, and his age will determine certain things. The person who is being helped, or the person addressed, that is Ahaz, will be instructed by observing this child.
We are approaching now the presentation of the truth of the remnant in the minister -- a special case; which shows how the family is brought into it. This boy's name means, 'A remnant shall return'. Wherever there is a feature of the remnant, it will endure, as seen in chapter 6; but here it is that the remnant *returns*. It points to the moment, I think, in which we are, the remnant has come into the light, and it is marked by returning; and this boy, as in the family of the prophet, is to remind us of this.
A.B.P. Do you link this in any way with chapter 1: 2, where Jehovah says, "I have nourished and brought up children"? Isaiah's prophecy opens with God speaking as a father.
J.T. They had rebelled against Him. *They* were not usable in the service, but the point here is that this man has a family, and the family is usable, as seen in a young boy. His father can take him by the hand. He signifies something. He is not pulling away from his father in self-will. He is evidently docile, in keeping with his name.
L.E.S. Does this suggest that we are to be with every movement that marks the ministry?
J.T. That is right. The idea is that the family is brought up in that relation. It is what often comes out in our meetings -- let us have the children with us in it.
C.A.M. Would it indicate that the prophetic ministry is increasing in its influence and power? In chapter 6 we have moral conditions in Isaiah and the remnant, and now we have extended influence in the prophet.
J.T. Yes. The boy is with him; Isaiah is free to take him. "Go out now to meet Ahaz, thou and
{237}
thy son Shear-jashub". The boy is there with his father; and then the position is, "at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field". That is, the name of the child, and his being with him, have the testimony in mind, and king Ahaz is to see that.
J.T-n. What is the importance of the place where this testimony is brought out? -- "at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field".
J.T. The aqueduct would refer to running water -- the supply of water; the fuller's field, I suppose, would point to self-purification. It is a public position. The aqueduct would be, I judge, a principle, and so would the fuller's field; but the boy is a living person. From the divine side there is a perfect testimony presented in this way, and Shear-jashub is a living person. He is quiet; not scampering about, or pulling away from his father; he is there in the presence of these principles, apparently not detracting from them. Ahaz, over against this, is not equal to the reception of the testimony; he is not receptive, but the testimony is perfect.
R.W.S. There must have been exercise with Isaiah, and with his wife, at the birth of this son, and he would have been given this name as a result.
J.T. Well, that is what one was thinking. The prophetic idea must have been there when the child was born; the name given to him means that a remnant shall return. It is obvious that the service is not to be fruitless; if Ahaz is not affected, others will be.
J.T-n. Does that have a bearing on our first impression of the Lord? Isaiah at the end of chapter 6 had learned the lesson, not only as light, but experimentally in his soul, so as to understand this thought of the "holy seed" and that "it shall return;" the fruit he bore was thus named.
{238}
J.T. Quite so. Another thing that comes out is the readiness with which God would help those in responsibility in the testimony. Ahaz was in the place of responsibility. The history of the second book of Kings shows that Uzziah reigned a long time, and at first did what was right, God owning him. Kings who reigned in Israel were generally bad, but still God went on bearing with them. That shows that He is ready to use anyone in responsibility, if he is at all usable. He used Uzziah, and Jotham; and now God is ready to help and use Ahaz, as he is being attacked by the northern king. Ephraim and Syria have joined against him, but God is ready to help him. This indicates how we are situated. God will use anyone available, if he is usable; and if he is ready to listen to the prophetic word.
C.A.M. The prophetic word from the temple in chapter 6 appears to lead on to sonship and to the incoming of Christ.
J.T. The son in verse 3, apparently, is the child of verse 16. The Son in verse 14, born of the virgin, is Immanuel. So we have two sons. When we come to chapter 9, we shall see how one of them is taken on. "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given" (@Isaiah 9: 6). We are leading up to it here. We have the suggestion of families, one Isaiah's family, and the other that of the virgin.
H.H. Is the exercise of Isaiah connected with Shear-jashub? In Ahaz there is no proper exercise at all, yet God owns him.
J.T. Yes. That is the next thing for those who serve in this way, the kind of persons we have to deal with. We cannot always turn them aside, and say they are not spiritual men. We must make the most of them. Ahaz is here as king, and God is ready to help him. God gives him a most encouraging prophetic word through Isaiah.
{239}
C.F.N. Does the position at the aqueduct in the fuller's field show how the remnant would be reached?
J.T. I think so. There is a combination there in the prophet himself, and his son, and the aqueduct and the fuller's field. It is from the divine side, the fulness of the testimony. Then we see the kind of man we have to deal with, and we cannot ignore him, for he is the king. He represents a brother active in a meeting or district. God said to Ahaz, through Isaiah, "If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established". He spoke to him again, saying, "Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God". God is for the moment going on with this man, seeking to help and use him.
A.R.S. What would you say about Ephraim joining in with Syria?
J.T. Well, this combination against him was a serious matter for Ahaz -- but God would assure him that all would be well, saying to him, "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall not stand, nor come to pass; for the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years shall Ephraim be broken, so as to be no more a people; and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established" (@Isaiah 7: 7 - 9). That is, these headships are not to be reckoned of value. Headship is an immense thing in Christ, but it is not in these men.
H.H. Ahaz needed the prophetic word because of this confederacy working against him.
J.T. That is the thought. The prophetic word implies that. There was no true wisdom in these heads, and they were not to be feared.
Rem. The prophetic speaking seems to take two forms; one to comfort the heart by showing what God would do; the other would be an encouragement
{240}
to spirituality -- a sign in the height or the deep.
J.T. Quite so. How clearly it shows how far God is ready to go to help those in direct responsibility, for Judah was yet owned of God, and here He is ready to go a long way to help such in responsibility. Ahaz says, "I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah;" there was a sort of legality and pride about him, so he would not ask. When God is ready to serve us, why not appropriate the service? It is a very important matter. In all such emergencies we need, in our weakness, to be assured, because it is a question of our being *believers*. "If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established".
J.T.Jr. Do the governmental dealings come in first, that is the attack of these two kings? Then God comes in after the governmental dealings have started?
J.T. Yes, to fortify the responsible person. I think the teaching would be to show how God supports brethren in a district, or generally; how far He is ready to go to assure us, because we do need assurance. On account of the peculiar form of sin at the present time, we especially need assurance as to God's part in what is current.
J.T.Jr. It suggests that the true idea of kingship has been lost. We have the true idea of kingship in the previous chapter, but there is another king here, but the features of kingship are not in him.
J.T. Quite so. Isaiah in chapter 6 saw the King, and spoke of Him; he saw His glory and spoke of Him, we read in John's gospel. This passage is developed in John's gospel. The miracles of Christ are called *signs* in John's gospel, corresponding with our chapter. The idea is to establish faith; there never was a time when it was more needed. There were those who were affected by the signs and they
{241}
believed, yet the Lord could not trust them. New birth must underlie faith, or it is ineffective.
H.H. We must be characteristically believers.
J.T. Characteristic believers is what John has in mind. He tells us as to his writings that "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (@John 20: 31).
A.N.W. Belief is to be established by the prophetic signs.
J.T. That is it. So that the first sign in John is that in Cana; the sign of the wine at the marriage. The next one is in Cana, too, but the first has reference to wine, and the second has reference to noblemen; two elements which tend to draw out *legal* objections. That is, we object to a nobleman. In some, the legal conditions would object both to the distinctions owned in the government of God, and wine. The allusion is to a certain state in us that is unable to observe what God honours, what is of God, and the distinctions that God has established among men. Of the first one it is said, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him" (@John 2: 11). That is real faith; they had it before, but it was weak. His *disciples* believed on Him. The next sign is the nobleman in Capernaum whose son was raised; it is said of that nobleman that he *believed*. "The father therefore knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house" (@John 4: 53). It is not as the jailor that believed householdly. He believed himself, and his house believed as well; not "with his house", but "and his whole house". That is the enlargement of faith; it extends to the whole household; not simply the head of it, but the household itself. This is a most important matter, because it accords with the idea
{242}
of the remnant. It is a great point in John's gospel, that our houses should be believing ones, not simply baptised, but believing households.
C.F.N. Is that the kind of faith implied in @Isaiah 7: 9, "If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established"?
J.T. Yes; and you will observe by the note, that it is not simply a statement, but it is a sort of a poetic phrase. The prophetic word in verses 4 to 9 has a poetic ending, which would be kept in mind, and recalled in a given connection. *If we do not believe we shall not be established*. We shall be shaken with the wind. It is said here of Ahaz, "Then his heart and the heart of his people shook, as the trees of the forest are shaken with the wind". That is what is going on to a great extent now; people's hearts failing them for fear. The word to believers is, to be established; and that is through *faith*.
W.B-w. The nobleman in John 4 was tested out to the seventh hour. That would help to establish him in faith in all he would need to go through.
J.T. Yes. It was reverting back to history. He recalled the moment when the Lord said, "Thy son lives". The word the Lord uses is "son", not 'child'. The man is dignified already as a courtier, but dignified now in a real way. God would set us up in the dignity of the truth, beyond any other distinction. The man reverts back to history, and this leads him and his house to real faith.
L.E.S. Would the bringing forward of the two sons in Isaiah 7 have in mind the household; to support the ministry and then carry forward the remnant?
J.T. There are two families, Isaiah's family and the virgin's family. In Luke, Mary is prominent, not Joseph; he is prominent in Matthew. Here it is the virgin's side. Mary appears in chapter 2 of John's
{243}
gospel, but she failed in the position. As corrected, the Lord identified Himself with her and the family; "After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days". He identifies Himself with His mother and His brethren; He is in the family. She is adjusted and now He identifies Himself with her. In John 4, the next miracle brings out the courtier as a believer, and his family, and his house.
Ques. In your reference to wine and noblemen, had you in mind that legality, the spirit of democracy, and temperance, would hinder us from being characteristic believers?
J.T. Just so. Because these things, legal objection to a creature of God, or a radical objection to distinctions which God makes among men, are not of God. It is objectionable. It is not of faith.
A.B.P. Why is the nobleman rebuked by the Lord? He says, "Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe".
J.T. Well, the Lord says "ye". It is a general thought, just as when the Lord came down from the mountain, the disciples were discussing the matter of a boy who was a lunatic. He rebukes them all, even the disciples were included.
H.H. In @John 4: 48, "not believe", *not* is a strengthened negative. That would be a word to us as to believing.
A.P.T. Zacharias was a priest serving in his course, but he did not believe.
J.T. That fits in here, a man serving in his course; doing the right thing, but though he had been praying, evidently, for a son, now that son is promised, he does not believe. Unbelief comes in as to the things we pray about, but do not expect an answer; we forget our prayers, which God does not like. The man is dumb for a season until the answer
{244}
comes to his prayer. There are two prophetic messages here. Jehovah spoke *again* to Ahaz. You will notice it is Jehovah directly speaking to him, after having said, "If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established". Jehovah spoke again to him, "Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; ask for it in the deep, or in the height above. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah". That is, he is not speaking as a believer at all. In spite of a most assuring message through Isaiah, he is not accepting the truth as presented, and now God goes on to say that He will give a sign, even though Ahaz does not want it. God proceeds with the thought of Messiah, for the Messiah must come in; it is a question now of what God will do of Himself. Immanuel must come in, "God with us". God must come down here Himself -- the greatest thought of all.
S.McC. What do you understand by the change in the way of speaking here? Firstly God sends His servant Isaiah, saying to him, "Go out now to meet Ahaz ... and thou shalt say unto him". In verse 10 Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz; also in verse 13. "Hear then, house of David".
J.T. Well, it is God speaking Himself. No doubt all was through a prophet, but still, God speaks Himself directly. The Holy Spirit says at Antioch, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", but through whom He spoke we are not told; but it was the Spirit Himself. So Paul says, "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me". Through whom did He witness? No doubt a brother would be employed in each city, as at Caesarea. Of course, to one who has the Spirit, God can speak directly, but prophetic messages, as in the case of Ahaz, are usually through others. But the great point is that God is speaking; it is the voice of God, and it makes it all the more serious for Ahaz. It is God speaking directly to him.
{245}
God used Elihu to speak to Job, but God Himself addressed Job in chapter 38. God goes on; that is the wonderful thing about it. God goes on with us, and with men like Ahaz, and gives plenty of opportunity, but the time comes when God ceases, as in the case of king Saul. The Lord ceased to speak to him -- a most solemn thing.
A.R.S. In Hebrews God speaks first in the Person of the Son; then we are warned in the second chapter as to what He says. "For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things we have heard, lest in any way we should slip away".
J.T. Yes. Jehovah goes on to say, "Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good".
A.N.W. That you connect with Immanuel, but verse 16 with Shear-jashub.
J.T. Yes, verse 16 is the child present.
J.T.Jr. There is an allusion to the house of David: "Hear then, house of David".
J.T. That is the point. He is of the house of David, and owned as in that position. God goes a long way with His people in that sense, but the time comes when He ceases to speak to us. It is a remarkable thing that *the virgin* is introduced here. Ahaz would have no part in *that* state.
W.B-w. Would there be some similarity between Ahaz here and Herod at Jerusalem when Jesus was brought before him -- Pilate also; are they the same kind of persons, unbelieving? Christ was a stone of stumbling to them (@Isaiah 8: 14, 15).
J.T. Quite so. The testimony was there before them. That brings up the subject of government, and shows what government is, as constituted now. Pilate represented it, as representing the fourth
{246}
monarchy. Herod is disallowed; the Lord says nothing to him at all; there was a spurious side to his position. This matter of government is important because, according to John, the Lord talked with Pilate, conversed with him, but never with Herod. God maintains Pilate's rights. A politician is one thing, but when he becomes a governor or president, he is then *representative of God* in the sense of government (@Romans 13: 1 - 6). The Lord converses with Pilate, and tells him that He was born a king. Pilate is true to the abstract thought of the position, when he says to the Jews, "I find no guilt in this man". He was true to the position; he was not a politician then, he was a governor. Politics are not of God. Kingship is of God, government is of God. So that Pilate says he finds no fault at all in Christ; but then he scourges Him. That is not true government. The soldiers put a crown of thorns on Christ's head, and a purple robe on Him; and Pilate brings Him out to the Jews. Pilate is on the downward grade -- hopeless. Presently he hands Christ over to the Jews, who crucify Him. So all that brings out that side of the matter -- how uncertain those in authority are. Government is clearly of God, but how much can you trust those exercising it? General facts show how little they can be relied upon. They take on christianity as Henry the Eighth took on Protestantism, or Constantine took on christianity; he might be orthodox, but you cannot trust him. The Lord makes the most of them, and if they are on the side of right, we must pray for them, and God will support the side that is right.
A.N.W. The Lord said to Pilate, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above".
J.T. Quite so.
A.P.T. Of Herod He said, "Go, tell that fox" (@Luke 13: 32). What does that mean?
{247}
J.T. That would be a politician, a scheming man. You can never follow what he aims at.
C.F.N. Would you tell us what you had in mind as to the virgin, and Immanuel?
J.T. We are coming on to very high ground spiritually. God is going on with this line, whatever Ahaz may be. It is His own matter now, because it is a question of Himself coming in. He is not waiting for anyone to ask Him. If God waited for that, it is a question whether He would ever come, but virgin conditions are needed. We have later the idea of a virgin in Hezekiah -- an unconquered one, but that is not the point here. It is a state, with power of conception according to God, so that God has a means of coming in.
A.P.T. *The* virgin, "the" is emphatic according to the New Translation. What would that mean?
J.T. There would be no other. It points to her uniqueness in the prophetic mind, as the mother of Christ, saluted as "favoured one" by Gabriel (@Luke 1: 28). She had found favour with God.
L.E.S. Would what you speak of as a virgin state make room for the prophetic ministry, so that as a result, it can be said that "God is indeed amongst you"?
J.T. The virgin state is the power to receive impressions, so that something is brought forth. "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (@2 Corinthians 11: 2). This is essential to assembly growth and formation. It is the feminine side -- the mother side, but here, of course, it is unique because, from the circumstances, she is the only one. We have the virgin-daughter of Zion (@Isaiah 37: 22), but the word there is different. We see how things are grouped here: holiness in chapter 6, and now a virgin state -- a unique person, *the* virgin. She conceived and brought forth a Son, and called His name Immanuel, which is "God with
{248}
us", -- God the Mighty One. So that all is well. In the next chapter, we have it as the expression of the remnant, the prophetic spirit says, "for God is with us" (@Isaiah 8: 10).
J.T-n. Does that link on with the teaching of Matthew's gospel, how He came in, connecting Himself with the remnant, and then in the last chapter where He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth"?
J.T. Matthew contemplates Immanuel throughout; his gospel is built up on Immanuel. This is because of what is to be established in the assembly for the testimony; for power is needed. The Lord says to His own, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18: 20), and again, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age" (@Matthew 28: 18 - 20).
H.H. Does the "little power" of @Revelation 3: 8 provide for the coming in of Christ?
J.T. That is the thought. The Lord's supper set in relation to the assembly is to make room for Christ in it, of course. Matthew says He is with us always, so the *position is secure*. Now in view of Immanuel being with us, in chapter 8, we have another member of the family, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, whose introduction signifies discipline. The meaning of his name is 'Swift for spoil, hasty for prey'. Of him Jehovah said, "For before the lad knoweth to cry, My father! and, My mother! the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria". The time that the things spoken of are to happen is reckoned
{249}
by his growth; before he says, "My father! and, My mother!" the Assyrian would come in. "Jehovah spoke again to me, saying, Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah which flow softly, and rejoiceth in Rezin and in the son of Remaliah, therefore behold, the Lord will bring up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall mount up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: and he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow it and go further, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel!" (@Isaiah 8: 5 - 8). The Assyrian is the enemy of God's people whilst they are owned of God and in their land. He comes even to the neck. The last enemy is the Assyrian, the northern power; north of Palestine. The four monarchies of Daniel 2 have to do with the Jews as *disowned* of God; not openly owned of God. They are still owned of God in this chapter of Isaiah. Ahaz is still of the house of David.
W.B-w. Was this partially fulfilled in chapters 36 and 37 when Rab-shakeh came up?
J.T. Quite so. Where Hezekiah as we shall see, is, in a certain sense, a type of Christ.
R.W.S. So that each time these lads were seen, faith would link up the prophetic word with them.
J.T. I think that is the lesson for us today. What our families are to be; there is written on the family something in regard to the testimony. On the one hand, that the remnant shall return, and on the other, that the enemy will attack; the family denotes that. So it makes the christian family very important, and hence the need of right formation, so that it may represent the truth in some way.
A.E.H. The general teaching seems to bring us to the distrust of mere human kingship, and full trust in what God provides. They cared more for Rezin
{250}
and the son of Remaliah, than for the waters of Shiloah which flowed softly. God's judgment of this is very serious.
J.T. Just so. As we connect Shiloah with John 9, we see the force of it; the word implies what is *sent*. Then Immanuel being there all is secured. The prophetic spirit in verse 11 seems to be exultant, saying, "For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and he instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, Ye shall not say, Conspiracy, of everything of which this people saith, Conspiracy; and fear ye not their fear, and be not in dread. Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he will be for a sanctuary; and for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem". This is for the support of our position in the truth.
H.H. Whose disciples were they in verse 16? "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples".
J.T. I would say the Lord's. It is the Messiah speaking there. In verse 18 He says, "Behold, I and the children that Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel". The disciples as instructed persons are the custodians of the testimony and the law. It is a very important matter here. It is placed as a trust.
R.W.S. "He will be for a sanctuary". To what does that refer?
J.T. I suppose it is what the disciples found in the Lord. You would find them with Him. They went into the temple, of course, but their real religious centre was Christ. Peter referred to the Lord Jesus coming in and going out amongst them, from the baptism of John until He was received up. They had their spiritual exercises in that connection.
{251}
A.N.W. Would you say a word as to the testimony and the law?
J.T. The testimony is what God commits to men, and it was taken out of the hands of the Jewish high priest and placed with the apostles. The believers, we are told, persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles. I suppose that is how it worked out historically.
A.N.W. These verses would apply peculiarly today.
J.T. That would be the test. How important to understand what Christ handed over to the disciples!
W.B-w. Would this binding up of the testimony be what took place in the early part of Acts?
J.T. You can see it working out there. The New Testament always explains these allusions.
W.B-w. Isaiah 7 would refer to the early chapters of Luke's gospel.
D.R. The virgin state and that of the disciples implied what could be trusted.
J.T. That is practically how it works out. A state of things as effected by God -- the virgin conditions -- and authority. You feel that conditions must be brought about which are trustworthy, involving the development of doctrine. During the past hundred years, conditions came about which God owned, in which He developed the truth. God had confidence in certain persons and conditions, so that there has been the unfolding of the truth. It does not fall to the ground. It is held in a trustworthy way.
J.T.Jr. The word is directly to the prophet, now He speaks to him with a strong hand (verse 11). Would that be the support He gives to our souls to take in the truth?
J.T. Yes. Support is given to what the prophet represents; that is, responsibility accepted in a condition
{252}
of things which God regards as trustworthy; and, as we have been seeing in John's gospel, it develops in that way. There were some that believed because of His signs; to these the Lord did not trust Himself; but there was a man from among the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, who represented those in whom God was working. New birth is the foundation of trustworthiness. Later His disciples believed on Him; they became real disciples, and He identifies Himself with them, and with His mother as corrected (@John 2: 12). The Lord is identifying Himself with conditions like these; so that if we are conscious that God is with us, that settles everything. What can anybody say if "God is indeed amongst you"?
J.T.Jr. Would it be confirmed also in the word 'instruct'? It says there, "He instructed me" (@Isaiah 8: 11).
J.T. Quite so.
C.A.M. Saints should follow those among whom this testimony is found.
J.T. Yes. I think what has been said about John ought to be taken account of very definitely as to trustworthiness -- the correction and adjustment of Mary, the Lord's mother, in chapter 2; and then His disciples believing on Him, as observing His *glory*, not simply the signs. That is confirming. Jesus abides with them in Capernaum, and the household idea is brought in; and in chapter 4 the nobleman as a believing man, and his house. There is a development of subjective conditions which are reliable.
A.P.T. Does verse 18 refer to Isaiah's children?
J.T. Possibly it would literally, but in the use made of it in the New Testament, it refers to Christ and His disciples, see @Hebrews 2. What these men were is seen in the Acts. Peter says, "Look on us".
{253}
What men they were! In chapter 2 it is stressed that they were Galilaeans, but in spite of it, see what men they were! In chapter 3 there was the man who was cured made to walk. It could not be denied.
{254}
THE REMNANT (3)
@Isaiah 9: 6, 7; @Isaiah 10: 20 - 22; @Isaiah 11: 11 - 16
J.T. What came before us yesterday as to families and the testimony of God, is to be carried through to chapter 9. We have names given earlier to children in the prophetic family of Isaiah, Shear-jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz. In the family, the former would always be the reminder of the great fact that 'a remnant shall return', and then Maher-shalal-hash-baz is the opposite side, referring to the Assyrian, and we have to guard against him. There is exercise in chapter 8 and pressure in relation to that which is ready to attack what is of God. Then we have in that section, Immanuel, that is, 'God with us', which is the complete guarantee against the Assyrian attack.
Now we have a family thought in relation to Christ in chapter 9, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given", so that we are now on the line of family greatness in one who is of it, somewhat corresponding to @Psalm 87. It speaks of such a one being born and distinguishing a certain position. It is as we come into the light of Christ as on our side, that we begin to see the dignity of the heavenly family. It is not here 'God with us', but one owned as born and given, a Child born, a Son given, upon whose shoulder the government is, who is great enough as on our side to take on all these wonderful titles. "Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace;" and then, "Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with judgment and with righteousness, from henceforth, even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this". So that we reach finality here
{255}
as apprehending Christ on our side. There is a correspondence with the epistle to the Hebrews which also introduces finality; what Christ is as Speaker, and then what He is on our side as Son of man and Son of God.
L.E.S. Would you say a word as to the Child born and the Son given?
J.T. The Child born brings in distinct family connection, One born among them, born "to us". Luke opens it up: "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God". So the angel says later, "For today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord". Unto *you*!
A.N.W. Would you say a little more as to what you mean by the Son of God on our side?
J.T. Well, He is taken up in that way as born. God says, "This day have I begotten thee". That is on the divine side, as in @Psalm 2: 7, but He is also on our side, and the truth of this is developed in the epistle to the Hebrews. The Son is the priest, and He is on our side. "For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens" (@Hebrews 7: 26). He is Son consecrated for evermore on our side. "Such a high priest became us" -- the "us" denoting the saints, in their greatness, needing such a great Person, the Son Himself. The education and experience of the other chapters we have been looking at would lead to this, so that we come to see that He is on our side -- "to us". We get in @1 Corinthians 8: 6 an enlarged thought, "to us there is one God". As we begin to take on the truth, we see how God is in relation to His people; christians own one God, the Father. Here the Son of God is in relation to His people, and this gives us confidence and dignity, as lifted out of the littleness of human things
{256}
into the greatness of the divine family. We progress into this through discipline, and by observation, too.
A.E.H. What is the bearing of Christ being on our side in this scripture. Is it on the line of priesthood and divine service?
J.T. The earlier paragraph reads, "Nevertheless the darkness shall not be as when the distress was in the land, at the time he at first lightly, and afterwards heavily, visited the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, -- the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations: the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them light hath shone" (@Isaiah 9: 1, 2). That refers to Christ as dwelling in Capernaum. The scripture then continues, "Thou hast multiplied the nation, hast increased its joy: they joy before thee like to the joy in harvest; as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. For every boot of him that is shod for the tumult, and the garment rolled in blood, shall be for burning, fuel for fire" (@Isaiah 9: 3 - 5). What you see in that section is the *light shining*, leading up to what we have in verse 6 of our chapter. In @Matthew 4: 12 we read that the Lord Jesus, having heard that John was cast into prison, went and dwelt in Capernaum; and in verse 16 of that chapter that "the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in the country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up. From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh". The statements in Matthew bring in this section of Isaiah. The Lord left Nazareth; He was brought up there, and in it He exhibited the kind of ministry that Luke would
{257}
bring to us (@Luke 4: 16 - 22). It is a well-known passage depicting what happened in the synagogue of Nazareth. After this He went and dwelt at Capernaum (@Matthew 4: 13). So that now He is one among them. He dwells there. It is called "his own city", and it would appear that He had a house there; Mark 2 would indicate that. Now that brings in the position. All that precedes, in Isaiah 6, 7 and 8, would teach us what He was as come in from the divine side. Matthew takes up the trend of the history as in Capernaum, where Christ actually lived, and you can see how the inhabitants of Capernaum would begin to look at Him from that side -- what He was amongst them. It is what Christ is "to us;" what He is amongst them. Think of all the times the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst His own there! What would the next door neighbour think of Jesus? There would be the thought among the Jews of one born to them. Light springs up there. Light usually comes down from heaven, but here is a question of what the Person *is* substantially. There was light in that house where He lived. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (@John 1: 4). It was as dwelling among them. Faith is especially needed to appropriate Him as on our side. The truth gradually dawns on us that God has, as it were, set Him in our midst.
H.H. As to christians, it is Christ among the gentiles.
J.T. Well, you see how those in whom God was working among the Jews would be morally dignified by the appreciation of Christ dwelling among them, moving in and out; light radiating from Him.
H.H. Capernaum is mentioned in Matthew 11, and the very great light is in the end of that chapter. "No one knows the Son but the Father;" the light becomes exceedingly great, does it not?
{258}
J.T. Yes. At the moment of which we are speaking there were some in Capernaum who appreciated that glorious Person.
A.P.T. There were four: the four men that bore the paralytic. Were they part of the "us"?
J.T. Exactly. That is Mark's view. Mark contemplates the Lord, as you will notice, going into Capernaum in the testimony. @Mark 1: 9 says, "And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan". And then after His first preaching, verse 21 says, "And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught". We have the account of the preaching in verses 14 and 15: "But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings". Then we have Simon and Andrew and James and John following Him, and then "they go into Capernaum" (verse 21) -- the Lord and these men that were drawn to Him; then "he entered into the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished at his doctrine". Now He is in Capernaum. Mark tells us later, "And he entered again into Capernaum after several days, and it was reported that he was at the house", or, as the note says, 'At home, in the sense of not away on a journey'. And four men bear a paralytic to Him. These evidently represent a sympathetic feature of the gospel in keeping with the house in which the Lord was. They bring this paralytic to *that* house. They bring him up to the roof and let him down before the Lord Jesus. Anybody could come to that house, light was radiating *there*.
A.N.W. Later we have, "are not his sisters here with us?" -- another "us".
{259}
J.T. Quite so, the inhabitants of Nazareth "where he was brought up", said, "whatsoever we have heard has taken place in Capernaum do here also in thine own country". They claimed Him in a local sense, to honour them. The Lord is not on that line, for the *us* in @Isaiah 9: 6 would be the ones in whom God is working. "Unto us a child is born".
W.B-w. In Capernaum He first meets the spirit of an unclean demon in both Mark and Luke. Why is that?
J.T. That would indicate the state of the city, would it not? The Lord had come to dwell in that city. What was in the synagogue represented the religious condition.
W.B-w. "Walking by the sea of Galilee" -- He finds persons who accepted His teaching.
J.T. Yes, that characterises the gospel by Mark. The relation of the ministry of Christ to the sea is stressed. Matthew is not concerned exactly in that way. What he brings out in chapter 4 is that the light is *seen*. It is not simply that it is shining, but it is seen and people are affected. So that I think the *us* begins there.
A.A.T. The writer of the Hebrews says, "Let us therefore fear" (@Hebrews 4: 1), and in chapter 6: 1, "Let us go on to what belongs to full growth".
J.T. No doubt Paul is the writer and the *us* there would mean that he is coming down to identify himself with the people; he speaks as one of them. I think that is how Hebrews stands. The apostle could do that, being a Jew.
F.H.L. In Matthew 4 it is to those sitting in darkness that the light springs up.
J.T. The light rising up brings out what we are speaking of. It is what was among them. What has just been mentioned, the unclean demon in the synagogue, would indicate the religious state of the place. Think of people sitting down with such a condition
{260}
as that! They were evidently unaffected by the conditions. It is a terrible state of things, but now the light is there. They *see*, it, It is not simply that it is there; it is seen. It is rising up, and I think the *us* would begin to take form because of this. They brought the paralytic man to the house where the Lord was. They were appropriating the light, so that the *us* would really be a remnant.
R.W.S. Would the Lord's acts and deportment cause these various names to be understood in some little way by the people there?
J.T. You can see how previous instruction serves us as to the great Personage who had come in. John the evangelist says, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth" (@John 1: 14). How they would begin to spell out the glories of Christ! He began to further manifest His glory in chapter 2, and His disciples believed on Him. They begin to see that the glory was there and emanated from Him. It was in the Person. So that on our side contemplation is the great thing. Thus the disciples began to see the glory indicated in those titles in Isaiah 9.
H.H. The glory is mentioned five times in @John 13: 31, 32, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately".
J.T. That indicates the place glory has in John's gospel. As we place ourselves alongside of John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, we begin to see how these glories are absorbed and appreciated. John must have loved Him, because he was so intent in observation, he was in the bosom of Jesus. It is the idea of receptiveness, so that John is in it, and therefore, you can see how the glory shone before his eyes.
{261}
L.E.S. Why is the first name, Wonderful, linked with the birth of Samson? Manoah and his wife looked on as the angel did "wondrously".
J.T. I suppose the suggestion would be over against the Philistine domination which Israel were under at that time. It is a spiritual matter: Christ apprehended as doing wondrously. I suppose it would be in pointing to the deliverance of our souls from Philistine domination.
C.A.M. Do you think it is because of the great idea of nazariteship in that chapter?
J.T. The maternal thought is stressed in the chapter. It was greater than the paternal. The angel comes to Manoah's *wife;* her name is not given; his name is. That is, he is the responsible person, but the angel comes to the wife in both instances; and Manoah patronises the angel, asking him for his name, so that they might honour him when his word came to pass. "And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, How is it that thou askest after my name, seeing it is wonderful?" (@Judges 13: 18). I think it brings out the subjective conditions amongst us, that if these are there, even though the male side is defective, which is very often the case in local meetings; -- if the maternal state is there God will honour it. The subjective side comes out when the male side is defective, and perhaps the persons are away for a moment. You get remarkable movements of the Spirit of God in the younger men and that, I think, is what is in mind in Judges 13, because it is a Philistine domination; and we have to begin at the bottom. The Philistine element is sometimes seen in the *leading brother*, and it is by giving scope to the subjective condition that this is overcome. The Holy Spirit begins to move, and then you may look for wonderful things. It was so with Samson; the Spirit of God began to move him when the time came for it,
{262}
(verse 25). The Holy Spirit beginning to work through Samson was the beginning of the Philistine overthrow. The Spirit began to move Samson in his local setting.
A.N.W. The footnote in regard to the word "move" in @Judges 13: 25 would amplify what you are saying. It is a word that expresses 'powerful emotion'.
A.P.T. I was going to ask if the responsible element was at a low ebb at Corinth, and the feminine element more prominent.
J.T. Quite so. It brings out two persons, the house of Chloe and the house of Stephanas. These houses seemingly save the situation. The house of Chloe informed Paul about the divisions there, showing that they were concerned about the local state. That is the idea of the maternal side, and then the house of Stephanas is commended as having devoted themselves to the saints for service. It seems to me that the two houses represent the saving element in a situation like that, because the Philistine power had dominance in the parties that existed.
L.E.S. I was wondering if the spirit of judgment does not come forward in circumstances like that. Our chapter in Isaiah says, "to establish it, and to uphold it with judgment and with righteousness". It suggests the tribe from which Samson came -- Dan, meaning 'judge'.
C.A.M. As to a local company when difficulty arises, when true judgment is administered, does deliverance take place?
J.T. That is what I was thinking.
Ques. Would the first epistle to the Corinthians correspond to "the government shall be upon his shoulder", making way for the unfolding of these names?
{263}
J.T. Quite so. The first letter is "the Lord's commandment" and anyone who is spiritual would recognise it. We should look for the wonderfulness of Christ witnessed in the gospels, taking in the import of types according to His own exposition. "And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" (@Luke 24: 27). It is what we see as we go through the gospels, each one giving his own view of Christ, so that the wonderfulness of Christ dawns on the soul. "Wonderful" here is a noun, not an adjective. "Wonderful" is a name of Christ; the next name is "Counsellor". He presents Himself as ready to give counsel to Laodicea.
C.A.M. When this light as to Christ comes into our souls, there is a living response. This is expressed in the *name called* here. The answer to God is equal to the revelation of God.
J.T. Yes, we come into all the ministry involved in these names. We come into association with Christ. These names indicate what Christ will be to His people in a coming dispensation. We, of course, apprehend them too, as we find them in Him.
R.W.S. What was your point about Laodicea and Counsellor?
J.T. The Lord presents Himself as Counsellor. "I counsel thee to buy ..." (@Revelation 3: 18). It is a time of buying. People are ready to pay for things that are not of much value, as we get in @2 Kings 6: paying high prices for things that are of very little value. The Lord says, "I counsel thee to buy". He is ready to sell. His grace is seen in this. He is ready to sell, that is, He can tell the Laodiceans where to buy what they needed. He has it Himself.
A.A.T. "I counsel thee", is that to the individual or to the assembly?
J.T. It is the assembly; "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten;" but it is the general attitude
{264}
of grace on His side. That is His attitude, because He is still on His *Father's* throne. We want to be sure that we rightly represent Christ in dealing with the brethren at the present time. He has the knowledge of what everyone needs. He is ready to sell, and you are buying -- that is, you are paying for other things, showing that you want to buy.
Rem. It is important in local difficulties that the brethren should turn to the Lord first for counsel before asking others.
J.T. Just so. If we come to the care meeting with that in view, things become solved, and I think His address to the last assembly is most suggestive in that way. In spite of the bad state there, He has taken up this attitude of Counsellor.
A.A.T. Would @Matthew 18: 20 fit in, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". Asking counsel of Him, as being in the midst?
J.T. That whole section of the chapter is for instruction as to what we should do under certain circumstances. We often arrive at difficulties and we might say, we do not know what to do. That chapter shows us that there is a way out in the recognition of the assembly. Matthew shows that if you recognise the assembly there is a way out; even in remnant times. There is a way of settling every matter conclusively. "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18: 19, 20).
A.P.T. Our brother referred to prayer. Isaiah says of Hezekiah that he took the letter to the house of God, then prayed; and the word through the prophet was in connection with his prayer.
{265}
B. Would you say that Job's education is helpful for us? He obscures God's wisdom and then later he says, "Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge?" (@Job 42: 3).
J.T. Quite so. It is a fine conclusion to reach. We are told before the final working out of a solution in the book of Job, that the words of Job are ended. That is a good point to reach. One may say so much that he obscures counsel. Elihu brings in the solution; he is a man who can let others speak until they finish, and yet would retain all that he had in mind. He was like a new flask ready to burst, and when the time came, he was able to speak as an interpreter, one among a thousand. Jehovah comes in as he is finished, and Job puts his hand upon his mouth, and then later he questions as to himself, "Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge?" Then we have the final solution.
J.T.Jr. In @Acts 15 the brethren take counsel with one another, and the final judgment is reached in the light of Scripture. Christ thus comes in as Counsellor.
J.T. Peter and James serve as vessels to bring the matter to a conclusion, and what has often been remarked and is very important in these difficult matters, is to promote a good, healthy state of things among the brethren, before you bring forward the matter at issue. That is, to bring in the positive things of God. Paul and Barnabas told about all the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the gentiles before they came to the final issue, and Peter gets up and says what is just right, and then James sums up the thing for the saints. So that it would seem that we must go into the matter with the Holy Spirit in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion.
C. In @Jeremiah 23: 22 Jehovah speaks of prophets in that regard. He says, "But if they
{266}
had stood in my council, and had caused my people to hear my words, then would they have turned them from their evil way and from the wickedness of their doings".
H.H. Men like Hushai and Joseph gave good counsel. Hushai's counsel was supported against keen-minded men like Ahithophel, whose counsel against David he would defeat.
J.T. Quite so. The books of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs enlarge on all that we are speaking of. It is a question of wisdom. "In the multitude of counsellors there is safety" (@Proverbs 11: 14) -- a good scripture for a care meeting.
F.H.L. Would you think that Solomon acted in wisdom when he brought in the sword, that the son might live?
J.T. Quite so. That brings up a point of importance. Solomon, according to Kings, which you quote, came from Gibeon to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of God. Then these two women are brought to him for judgment. He asked for wisdom and the test came at once. God afforded him an opportunity to show what wisdom He had given him. In Chronicles he came back from Gibeon and started to buy horses. According to Kings he stands before the ark, a type of Christ in His lowliness: the wisdom of God and the power of God. Standing before the ark, you get wisdom. You see the thing operating; as a matter comes up, it is solved. He solved the matter and it was a wonder in Israel.
S.McC. In @1 Kings 3: 7 Solomon says, "I am but a little child".
J.T. That was as *before God*.
J.T.Jr. Rehoboam failed in that. He would have the old men give counsel and then the young men; the counsel of the latter was taken.
{267}
J.T. Hence disaster. Certainly the older brothers ought to have their place in regard to counsel. They have *experience*.
C.DeB. Was all this lacking in Corinth when the apostle had to say, "Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?"
J.T. Just so. He would bring out the latent wisdom in the assembly because the least esteemed is to judge over certain matters. Latently the wisdom is in the assembly.
The next title of Christ in the passage before us is "Mighty God", which is a question of power. John brings that out, quoting the Lord as saying, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (@John 2: 19). Not that God will raise it up, but that "I will raise it up". And then "Father of Eternity" would be what He was amongst the disciples; the *Father of the age*, already taking His place among them, addressing them as children. It is the exercise of parental authority and consideration for the saints. It is what He will be in the millennium, the Father of the age. Finally, "Prince of Peace". Then it is that "of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with judgment and with righteousness, from henceforth even for ever". That is, it is Christ in relation to Israel. It is the throne of David still. He establishes it.
Rem. I think there is a good deal of confusion in the minds of brethren as to what the term Father of Eternity means; as you remarked, it refers to what He was among them. The idea is seen in Joseph (@Genesis 45: 8), and in Eliakim (@Isaiah 22: 21).
J.T. Pointing to what Christ will be in the millennium. He will be a Father to it in the practical sense of the word, not exactly as head of a
{268}
family, but in the exercise of parental authority and care among the people in that day.
A.B.P. "Come out from the midst of them ... and I will be to you for a Father" (@2 Corinthians 6: 17, 18). Does that link on with the thought suggested?
J.T. That is what God offers to us as a separate people. It is *God:* "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".
J.T.Jr. Is the fatherhood seen in Christ in Isaiah 9 seen in measure in the apostles? They were fathers.
J.T. Quite so. Christ will exercise fatherly care in the millennial day. Some connect it with what He was eternally in deity, which is not the teaching at all. It is what He was here as Man; how He was known among His own, and how He will be known in the future.
W.B-w. Is it a different thought from what we get in John's gospel, "my Father and your Father"?
J.T. That is the *family* relationship. This may be illustrated in a designation often used as to George Washington, that he was the father of his country. He is viewed as having exercised fatherly care over the whole country.
C.A.M. The word *name* seems to make that clear. It refers to time.
J.T. Quite so. These are names by which people have come to speak of Him; what they find Him to be.
H.H. A name refers to renown.
J.T. That is the idea. A man acquires a name because of what he is. Sometimes, of course, names are given prophetically; others arise from external circumstances, adding nothing to the persons; others have no significance save to designate persons. As indicating distinction in persons, *name* signifies renown.
{269}
A.B.P. Do we see fatherhood in Christ in the end of John, "Children, have ye anything to eat?" (@John 21: 5)?
J.T. Quite so. Several times He uses that term; and He calls a woman "daughter" (@Matthew 9: 22).
Now in regard to Isaiah 10, we have another view of the remnant and that is in verse 20. "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob shall no more again rely upon him that smote them; but they shall rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. The remnant shall return". That is Shear-jashub as the margin shows -- "The remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them shall return: the consumption determined shall overflow in righteousness. For a consumption, and one determined, will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, accomplish in the midst of all the land". That is, there will be a removal of the dross. The word "consumption" alludes to that, but there will be a remnant. God has that in mind. It is a question of quality.
A.A.T. To what time does the expression "that day" refer?
J.T. The period of divine solutions and completions, I think. It is constantly in the prophets. You are directed forward, especially in Daniel, to the end of days.
H.H. The word "determined" is important, not simply what is allowed.
J.T. That is important. We often say, *The Lord is allowing it*, but it may be truer to say that God is doing it, and it makes it more solemn. "Determined" in verse 22 has a note in the New Translation -- A technical expression for the judgments preceding Messiah's reign.
{270}
J.T.Jr. What you say as to God acting judicially is confirmed in the charge given to the Assyrian. In @Isaiah 10: 6, God says, "Against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge".
J.T. Just so. That is a very solemn matter. In the case of David's numbering the people, Satan moved him to do it, according to @1 Chronicles 21, but God moved him, according to @2 Samuel 24. This is the most solemn side of it. That is what is happening now. Not only is God *allowing* what is transpiring, it may be that God is doing it for some purpose. It may be that we have to find this out. He has something to achieve through it in His people. I am only suggesting that it is well for us to look the matter in the face as to what God is doing, which is the most solemn side of the matter.
A.B. In verse 20 allusion is made to "such as are escaped of the house of Jacob". It would suggest those who have feelingly escaped the Assyrian's attack.
J.T. The process of severe discipline has been endured, and there is no more reliance on the Assyrian, but on Jehovah -- the true remnant character.
The final word is in chapter 11, and refers to where they come *from* in their recovery. "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to acquire the remnant of his people which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea". That is where they come from in their recovery.
J.T.Jr. It is remarkable that Assyria is mentioned first in regard of the remnant. God brings the remnant out of that first.
J.T. The Assyrian is the great power that is always against God's people while God owns them. The Assyrian therefore is the public rod of God in
{271}
His judgment of His people, and He delivers them from Assyria first. The remnant come through terrible discipline, which the Assyrian here suggests, and now they have come back from his land.
Ques. Would Naomi be an expression of that, returning from the land of Moab?
J.T. Yes. Returning from the fields of Moab. She *came back*. Her name Naomi, which signifies pleasantness, she wanted changed to 'Mara', which means bitterness. She *accepted* the governmental dealings of God with her -- the true way to blessing in such circumstances.
A.P.T. Why is it that there are those among us who come under God's hand, but are not recovered?
J.T. Well, of course, that is a solemn thing. Here God is acquiring them a *second* time. "The Lord shall set his hand again the second time to acquire the remnant of his people". That is, He knows where they are. The second time suggests excess of grace; God is acting sovereignty in a shepherdly way, gathering His people from the four corners of the earth.
A.A.T. What about the first time?
J.T. The first was the deliverance out of Egypt. The second, the great movement of God to bring out a nation for Himself, is seen here.
G.A.T. What is the difference between the remnant and the outcast?
J.T. That they were outcasts was one feature of their position. This is seen strikingly today. The Jews are treated thus by some nations. It is a feature of the position they are in, but God will gather them. The remnant is what is left, but secured for God, from the whole nation which had become reprobate.
R.W.S. Would you say a word on how they come back? The enemy has ceased and they fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines.
{272}
J.T. That refers to the state they are in as gathered. The passage says, "And the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the troublers of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not trouble Ephraim: but they shall fly upon the shoulder of the Philistines towards the west; together shall they spoil the sons of the east; they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon shall obey them" (@Isaiah 11: 13, 14). It would be that the condition among themselves is right according to God. Envy has ceased. Love is prevailing. They are victorious in conflict. Then Jehovah acts further for them (verses 15, 16), "And Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind will he shake his hand over the river, and will smite it into seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people which will be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day when he went up out of the land of Egypt". A highway from Assyria is a beautiful thought. They are at liberty to go up. They can go in a dignified way.
H.B. Would it be right to connect the revival of the truth of the Supper with the banner being lifted up?
J.T. Quite so. You can see how Christ will bring all this about. The early part of our chapter presents Christ as effecting full deliverance. "There shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall be fruitful". Finality of blessing is reached.
{273}
THE REMNANT (4)
@Isaiah 37: 1 - 23, 30 - 32; @Isaiah 38: 9 - 20; @Isaiah 46: 3, 4
J.T. What is to be considered now mainly, this being the last reading on our subject, is the relation to it of prayer -- a distinct feature of what is before us. This great attack by Assyria is permitted of God and He had in mind to bring out what existed for Himself in Jerusalem. There can be no doubt that, in the application of these passages to the present time, God, by the ordering or permitting of great pressure, would bring out what exists of Himself in His people; this is to be seen in *the way we go through the pressure*. The Lord as here with His own, in the last movement up to Jerusalem, was facing supreme pressure; it was heavy on His spirit, and the apostles were amazed as they realised it. He would have them go through with Him even to Gethsemane, where He would have them according to His desires.
Now in this sense Hezekiah represents what was in Jerusalem. God knew what was there, and would bring it out; God delighted to see it come out. There is therefore a great incentive to us at this present time to go through things, not ignoring them. The Lord would have us go through them feelingly, and He is with us in the pressure. He exhorts us to take our share in suffering as good soldiers of Jesus Christ; not that we have any part in the physical conflict. Our conflict is "not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" (@Ephesians 6: 12). We are to take unto ourselves the whole armour of God, and go through the conflict. It is continuous, and, at times it becomes accentuated as certain governmental conditions affect us
{274}
in it. Government is, so to speak, a department of God, but entirely distinct from the spiritual economy which is in the hands of the Lord Jesus, in which the Spirit is the power; yet these bear on each other.
In Hezekiah we see what was of God in Jerusalem, and how he met the enemy's attack. He represents what may come out as the saints endure, and go on in the truth. His father was very different, as we have seen already, even refusing to receive a sign from God; a very poor example of kingship; failing entirely in it. Nevertheless the spirit of prophecy leads on to a wonderful exhibition of the Spirit of Christ in his son. This ought to encourage us to go on, for God will act for us, in due course, beyond our expectations, if we are exercised. Hezekiah has a great place in the Scripture; he has something like ten chapters devoted to him by the Spirit of God. The object surely is to call attention to what pleased God in those dark days. He is said to have followed the example of his father David, and indeed, it is said there was no one like him in the kingdom of David, before him, or after him; so that he seems to rise to a peculiar type of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, he becomes a model, and the Spirit of God would engage us with him, that we might learn the lesson of how to meet pressure; and see how the remnant characteristics come out in him; he refers to the remnant several times.
L.E.S. Do you refer to the spirit of the Lord Jesus in Luke as praying constantly in view of the pressure?
J.T. That is a good example; something like ten times He is seen in that attitude.
C.A.M. Would you say that at the end of each dispensation there is that which corresponds to the close of the Lord's own life here in the intensified pressures that came upon Him?
{275}
J.T. I suppose that is right. Hezekiah is remarkable; he is enlarged on by the Spirit of God, portrayed in an extensive way before us by three different witnesses or writers.
Ques. There is a section in the book of Proverbs which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed. Would that fit in?
J.T. It does indeed. The reference is in Proverbs 25, and it brings out certain features that we ought to have before us. "There are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing. The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner: take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness" (@Proverbs 25: 1 - 5). There are many other proverbs of great value in this section of the book. It would show the industry of king Hezekiah, that his men caused what was of God to be available to His people.
W.B-w. What is the difference in the form of opposition against Ahaz in chapter 7 and this opposition against Hezekiah?
J.T. The opposition against Ahaz was a confederacy between Syria and Ephraim, a very repugnant thing to the spiritual mind. Ahaz was wholly unfit to meet that; he refused to ask a sign, refused to let God into the matter.
W.B-w. "Ahaz said, I will not ask". Hezekiah was a different man; he *would* ask.
J.T. Quite so. That is what is in mind now, that we might have this subject of prayer before us in view of the attack.
W.B-w. Sennacherib's attack is more public opposition; it comes with great force.
{276}
J.T. Yes; irresistible humanly, which Hezekiah admits.
J.W.D. Would you be free to pray that the outward pressure should be removed, or that what is of God should be sustained in the outward pressure, if God saw fit to allow it to continue? I am thinking of the present situation.
J.T. I should think both; both would be legitimate subjects of prayer, subject to God's will.
The first thing, I think, is *how* we go through the pressure; and how God will make use of it for us. It is a question of how we go through it; whether we seek to shirk it, minimise it, or ignore it altogether. Do we face it as a possible ordering of God to bring out what there is of Himself? The work of God is to stand. We have had much light, enjoyed much ministry in meetings like this, but what is the result, the actual product? God would bring that out; so that one would be free to pray for the enlargement that enters into the pressure, and also for relief, if it please God. Hezekiah obtained both the enlargement and the relief. The tidings of the attack of Rabshakeh caused Hezekiah to rend his garments and cover himself with sackcloth. He did not at first go to the Lord directly; he sent a message to Isaiah, the messengers themselves being covered with sackcloth, asking Isaiah, among other things, to "lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left" (@Isaiah 37: 4). He gets an immediate answer, though brief. Isaiah answers, "Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land" (verses 6, 7). That is the immediate answer to the first request for a prayer. Then the Assyrian sends another message to Hezekiah
{277}
(verse 10); and in verse 14 we are told that "Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah. And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sittest between the cherubim, thou, the Same", (that title "the Same" is not in the authorised version; it is an abiding name of God) "thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth. Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God". And then, having gone over what the Assyrians would do, he says, "And now, Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, thou only" (verse 20).
Now, we see clearly here that the pressure has its own effect. Hezekiah does not pray in the first instance; he asks the prophet to pray, which he did; and Isaiah gives an immediate answer, which would bring immediate relief for his spirit, and assurance as to God's ways in the matter. The second message by the letter of the king of Assyria brings out enlargement in Hezekiah. He has moved on in his soul, and been enlarged under pressure, for he now enters, himself, into the house of God and he lays the matter before Jehovah. Indeed, he speaks and acts almost as his father David did after Nathan's message came to him. He went in and spoke to God. That indicates great increase in spirituality. That is what is before us. The pressure continuing results in enlargement, if we face it. So that we advance from sackcloth; there is no sackcloth as he enters the house of Jehovah the second time (verse 14); we advance from that in the service of God. Thus
{278}
our prayer, and our speaking to God, is on a higher level; that is what God is aiming at.
In chapter 38 we see how the king is made sick. It is an individual pressure. The first pressure is national; the second is individual, and God is with him and restores him, and now we have an addition. That is, we have enlargement; first of all in the man himself, and then addition through him to the service of God. That is what is in mind. The relief comes, but the pressure first, *that we might get the gain of it*.
R.W.S. Does the allusion to children coming to the birth and no strength to bring forth allude to a state among the people of God, as a result of which there is no gain from the pressure?
J.T. The children coming to the birth would mean that though we have received impressions of Christ from the ministry, they have not been brought forth; they have not been brought out into individuality; not seen in a practical way. We may have much light and conceptions of Christ, but there is no power for *results*.
Ques. You alluded a little while back to two features of our subject; one connected with the government of God, and the other with the Spirit. If we pray in connection with either should we not be *with* God in relation to His moral government, as well as in relation to His work in the souls of His people?
J.T. I would certainly say so. There is a place for both; government is of God, as we know from Romans 13, and other scriptures. It has a sword, which is to be recognised: "for it bears not the sword in vain". It is subservient to the testimony. The four monarchies were ordained of God in view of the coming in of Christ, and the bringing in of the assembly. We are enjoined to be subject to it; and pray for those in authority, to honour the king.
{279}
Obviously it is to support what is *right;* government is to support what is right, and therefore you pray for it; pray for the support of those who are *doing right*, whatever the results: that is one thing. God can use armies and navies and the like, and we leave that to Him; it is His matter. The Lord Jesus intimated plainly that christianity takes us out of that; but at the same time it is of God, so far, in a governmental way, and subservient to the assembly and ministry. Then there is *our* struggle, as Paul speaks of it; "our struggle is ... against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" (@Ephesians 6: 12). As to this we are told to pray always: "praying at all seasons".
A.N.W. While bowing to the government which Pilate represented, the Lord told him directly that *he* was sinning; saying, "He that has delivered me up to thee has the greater sin", but Pilate himself was sinning in what he was doing.
J.T. He was sinning, and yet abstractly he had a right judgment; had he been left to himself he would have discharged the Lord. He said, "I find no guilt in this man" (@Luke 23: 4). This shows that government viewed abstractly is of God, but the political influence, the influence of the people, induced him to scourge the Lord, and finally deliver Him to be crucified.
S.McC. A great difficulty in our prayers would be to rightly distinguish between what is national, and what is connected with the support of right.
J.T. That is the real practical difficulty. We are apt to be national; thinking of our own government, as we call it; whereas the four monarchies convey a *universal* thought of God, coming down to us. He is hiding Himself from the house of Israel: the throne of God leaving Jerusalem. These four monarchies come in and run right down; they are the four
{280}
spirits of the heavens; they stand before the Lord of all the earth; they are there for a divine purpose, (@Zechariah 6). We pray for them from that point of view, not because we belong to any nation, for we are heavenly. The Lord says, "My kingdom is not of this world" (@John 18: 36). It is another thing altogether, and places us on a peculiar and elevated plane. Many christians do not understand it, but the Lord supports those who are in it.
J.W.D. In what sense would Paul exhort the brethren to pray for kings?
J.T. In the sense of representing government abstractly.
J.W.D. Could we not pray for every government in this world in the way that Paul enjoins; "prayers ... be made for all men; for kings and all that are in dignity"? (@1 Timothy 2: 1, 2).
J.T. Quite so; I would pray for every government in the world in that abstract sense. Take a man like Napoleon; his code of laws for France was good. I would pray for a king or governor in relation to the sphere given him, with a view to good government in it, that is what Scripture means, but if he went to conquer and destroy ruthlessly without provocation, I would not pray for him. I would pray that God would restrict him. You agree with that, do you not?
J.W.D. I certainly do. I was thinking of Daniel, how he had to be extraordinarily strengthened to be with God in connection with God's government (@Daniel 10). We, as thus helped, can take on these things.
J.T. Quite so. These things are most important to understand so that we might be discriminative and know how to pray.
H.H. Paul says in @1 Timothy 2: 2, "that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity;" that is, the testimony is in view.
{281}
J.T. Take a man that is devastating the world; I cannot pray for help for him in that.
A.P.T. How do you regard @Acts 12: 5, "Peter therefore was kept in the prison but unceasing prayer was made by the assembly to God concerning him"? I was thinking of Herod's activities at the moment.
J.T. The Lord did not recognise the Herod of Luke 23, spoken of in chapter 3 as tetrarch of Galilee. The Lord did not speak to him, nor answer him; He called him a fox in chapter 13. The Herod you are speaking about is another, but a characteristic Herod; he killed James the brother of John with a sword. He is a characteristic politician. When he saw that what he did pleased the Jews, he took Peter also and put him into prison. That is the sort of thing; there is no moral quality in politics at all, I mean politics in the ordinary sense of the word; that which appeals to the people for their support. The ultimate end of all that is that Herod is eaten of worms; he comes into the types of the man of sin; he accepted the adulation of the crowd that deified him, and he is eaten of worms. That is how the government of God deals with that sort of thing.
A.B.P. The thief on the cross could distinguish between right and wrong government. He said, "This man has done nothing amiss", and as to himself he says, "*we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done", this at the hands of the same government.
J.T. Yes; as God works with a man He may secure results at once. It came about very quickly, for he joined the other thief in reviling the Lord, according to another gospel, but he comes to discriminate between himself and his fellow-thief, and the Righteous One. Government had failed in the
{282}
Lord's case. That is what we are faced with; you cannot rely on government; and yet you are thankful for it, praying that it may do what is right.
Ques. Would the book of Revelation help us in relation to God's moral government, giving us the viewpoint of the throne? There we see discrimination as to what God could support on moral lines and what He would rebuke.
J.T. So you get in Revelation the silence in heaven for about half an hour (@chapter 8: 1). What does that silence mean? There is something going on that heaven can neither approve nor disapprove; as, for instance, Constantine's acceptance of christianity. God would not *openly* rebuke that. It is a remarkable thing that the empire of the world received christianity; but God could not approve it. That is the position when government takes on christianity. Take Pilate, he presented Christ to the people. "Behold the man!" he says; he was calling attention to Jesus, and says, "I find no fault whatever in him" (@John 18: 38). But then he scourged Jesus and presented Him to the people with a crown of thorns that the soldiers had put on His head. There is nothing to approve in that; that is what government may do for you. What did Constantine do? He took on christianity. At one time, although assuming to be orthodox, he favoured the Arian party, who denied our Lord's deity; and he persecuted Athanasius who stood for the truth. Constantine was baptised when he was about to die. He was Pontifex Maximus (High Priest) of the heathen religion of the empire during his reign, yet assumed the same office in christianity. What can you make of all that? That is government. You cannot trust it in the things of God; but it is government, and you must recognise it as abstractly of God, and pray for it accordingly.
{283}
C.F.N. True kingship was set out by David in saying, "The ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God" (@2 Samuel 23: 3).
J.T. That is what God would help us on now, and if we look at Hezekiah we shall see how, in facing things as they are today in the world, we become enlarged. He emerges from fear and sackcloth, both of which were right in their place, to sonship. After the second message from the Assyrian he does not put on sackcloth; he goes in the liberty of sonship, and speaks to God in terms suitable to the house of Jehovah. That is what we should see.
J.W.D. Do you think that the liberty of the assembly is in danger? Perhaps there is a moral or spiritual defect that needs to be rectified. Is the first attitude sackcloth?
J.T. Quite so. Why is all this happening? Sackcloth is the first thing, and Hezekiah is covered with it; he also rends his garments; one's whole state and circumstances are challenged.
I hope the brethren will not miss this point in Hezekiah -- that is, increase under pressure -- advance in the soul through pressure, and then the pressure is removed. It is removed in regard of the king of Assyria, and in regard of the sickness as well, in Hezekiah's case.
A.A.T. I suppose David had the same exercise, "In pressure thou hast enlarged me" (@Psalm 4: 1).
J.T. Quite so. That is not as the authorised version reads. It will be well for the brethren to read the New Translation for that point.
H.H. @Isaiah 37: 7 reads, "Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land". The prayers of the saints can divert something that the enemy threatens to do.
{284}
J.T. Quite so. The answer is immediate, as you will notice. Some of us were speaking about it; it is immediate aid in pressure; *first aid*, you might call it; so that the whole position is eased, but then the second message of the king of Assyria renews the pressure; and in meeting that Hezekiah shows he has gained in his soul.
H.H. It brings us closer to God in our exercises and prayers, and we gain intelligence as to how to present a great need to God.
J.T. Quite so. The second answer, in verse 22, introduces the daughter of Zion and Jerusalem. "The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee". She is not simply a child, but "a daughter of Jerusalem", that is a developed product. It is she that meets the opposition. It is what is brought forth in that character. Now we have a product in Zion and Jerusalem, and it is *she* that speaks to the Assyrian. You cannot overcome her; she represents great principles of God maintained in power. According to the note, she conveys the idea of being unconquered. It is not what we have in the way of teaching or ministry, but what comes out of it. The whole principles of Zion and Jerusalem are maintained in those who are formed by the truth in the power of the Spirit.
F.H.L. Do you think it would be right to say that Hezekiah holds the same position as the poor wise man?
J.T. Yes, he knew what to do; he is growing in the pressure, and advancing.
H.B. Do you think the virgin-daughter has taken character from God as in Psalm 2: 2, where it says, "He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision"?
{285}
J.T. Just so; the daughter of Zion laughs here; she derides the Assyrian. The work of God is in keeping with God Himself.
A.B.P. This word does not seem to be a composition that is prepared by the saints, but rather what is contained in the word of Jehovah. Is that the outcome of the prayers of His people?
J.T. Quite so. God brings in this daughter. He knew what had been developed there; the true nature of it was evidenced in Hezekiah's speaking to Him. What a man he was! It is beautiful what he says about God. He went up to the house of Jehovah and spread the letter before Jehovah, "And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sittest between the cherubim, thou, the Same, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth. Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God". I have no doubt that is what God noticed; what was in that man's soul; and that is the thing, what is in our souls, what we are bringing forth.
L.E.S. Is the idea of the cherubim to support the government of Hezekiah?
J.T. Yes. It is important to see the difference between the seraphim and the cherubim. The seraphim are more priestly, and refer to what is due to God in holiness; this is seen in chapter 6. Hezekiah speaks of God sitting between the cherubim, that is government; it is the power to enforce His will on earth.
F.S.C. Does Jabez represent one that is enlarged under pressure? His mother refers to her sorrow according to @1 Chronicles 4: 9. "Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, Oh that thou wouldest richly bless me, and enlarge my border, and that thy
{286}
hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me!"
J.T. Yes. God brought about what he asked. I think that is the point for us today -- this matter of prayer. How are we meeting these matters? Do we pray discriminatively? What do we say to God, and how do we address Him? As to the virgin-daughter of Zion and the daughter of Jerusalem, it is entirely like God to meet this aggressive and boastful enemy in scorn and derision.
J.W.D. Would you connect Philadelphia with this idea of the virgin-daughter?
J.T. I think she does represent it in the history of the assembly. The Lord has nothing to say against her, and much for her. He says, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, *I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth" (@Revelation. 3: 9, 10). And He says earlier, "I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power" (verse 8). There is power to bring forth whatever conceptions we have received from the ministry of the Lord; let us bring them forth. That is what Philadelphia had, "a little power".
H.H. The evil being especially against God, we may expect prayer to prevail. The saints are intelligent as to what is for God and support it.
J.T. Exactly. What has Satan in mind in all this commotion? What is Satan aiming at? He is the enemy of the saints, of what God has on earth at the present time; he would interfere and stop
{287}
their services. What Hezekiah says is apropos to what God has here. We pray in relation to that.
S.W.P. The beloved apostle in writing to the Thessalonians says, "Pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified" (@2 Thessalonians 3: 1).
C.A.M. Does this history throw light on present ministry and the way prophetic ministry has been emphasised? Hezekiah resorted to the prophet, and it had its effect upon him, it paved the way for the right use of the names of divine Persons, and the knowledge of God. The liberty he had in speaking to God shows how very much advance he had made in his soul.
J.T. Do you not think the Lord has helped us on those lines -- as to addressing God -- how He is known in the economy into which He has come? I think Hezekiah is seen in the full light of the position which he occupies. "Thou, the Same, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth" (verse 16).
A.N.W. I wondered in that way, whether the first address to God is more exalted than the second? There is more of "I" in the second.
J.T. It is personal need in chapter 38. The exercise nevertheless resulted in an addition to the service of God, which perhaps should be kept in mind, because God would have things added all the time. If we are not adding something, we are not going forward. Adding would indicate we are going forward. That is the point in chapter 38; but the evidence of life was to be a sign to Hezekiah in chapter 37: 30 "And this shall be the sign unto thee: there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof". The idea of life operating in an agricultural sense is to be observed. It springs of itself
{288}
in the first and second year, and then the third year we have the sowing and reaping, planting vineyards and eating the fruit thereof. It is the power of life operating, firstly without control; and then operating under control, the latter seen in the sowing and reaping. We sow for a certain crop; we want a certain crop; and the crop is what is according to Christ. I believe God would help in that way in the recognition of life. The earth brings forth of itself, but there must be the control of it, and the sowing to obtain what is needed. That brings in wisdom and calculation as to what suits God.
H.H. You get that in chapter 28: 29 -- the different kinds of grain, wheat and barley and cummin; "This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts; he is wonderful in counsel, great in wisdom". It is a yield for God.
A.B.P. Does verse 20 suggest a certain feature of the testimony as the result of the pressure? "And now, Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, thou only".
J.T. Quite so; you are referring to chapter 37: 20.
A.P.T. How does God view the head of a warring nation setting aside a certain day for prayer?
J.T. The prayer of the righteous man availeth much. Is there priestly power in the effort? Still, we are to be thankful for any recognition of God.
J.W.D. In regard to this idea of control, would you bring in the truth of sonship as an instance? We used to speak of eternal sonship in Christ and there was a certain amount of enjoyment connected with the idea, but now that the truth is understood according to Scripture, there is control, and the fruit is much more abundant.
J.T. Exactly. We are sowing the crop for God now. "Sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards
{289}
and eat the fruit thereof". If we sow for a crop, we must bring in right doctrine. The creed was not right doctrine, yet it was accepted, and God went on with us. Brethren did not knowingly put forward any heretical thoughts as to it, but still the matter was not under control; now it is, and I believe there is a crop. The brethren know what they are saying, and how to speak to God more accurately in the service; they see more clearly that sonship in Christ implies His manhood, also the place that the Son has from God's side, and from our side.
C.A.M. The fact that the Lord allowed that to go on for so many generations only emphasises the fruit of the truth now.
J.T. It does. The same applies to other things. The Lord's supper was beclouded and is so still in christendom. Whereas He has rescued it and restored it to its place in the assembly. Sowing and reaping, that is to say, skilled agriculture, brings forth a suitable crop. The farmer wants a crop, and sows accordingly; he takes care of it, so that he gets his crop. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward; for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that escape: the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this" (chapter 37: 31, 32).
C.DeB. Would you say a word on the verse, "And I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake"? (chapter 37: 35).
J.T. All is linked on with David throughout here. It is a question of the purpose of God in regard to His earthly people. David represents that. You will see it in the other prophets, too; it is all for David's sake; and of course, that is Christ. That is what God has in mind. Everything is in view of Christ.
{290}
S.W.P. How do you understand the "zeal of Jehovah of hosts"?
J.T. That is important. God is zealous. We pray and He listens, but His own zeal enters into what He does. You would not say that what relates to David originated in your own heart. When you come to counsel, all must be for God's heart; and He carries it out with zeal.
J.T.Jr. "Taking root downward" -- is that a continual process?
J.T. It is a law governing life in a tree or vegetable. Taking root downward secures the sap which supports the thing. It is rooted and grounded -- Colossians and Ephesians. Rooted means that you are assuring the full supply of sap; and on the other hand, as "grounded" you are steady; you are not carried away by every wind of doctrine.
J.T.Jr. Are we not as in individual prayer tested as to roots? What we really have in our souls is the power by which we can speak to God privately and publicly. So that when we get into the presence of God we are able to speak to Him, and He can take account of us both individually and collectively.
J.T. That is right. We receive truth mentally; the mind is the way the truth is received, but how far down does it go? You must allow it to permeate the whole being; that is the idea of it. You are built up as a man. You are drawing from the source of sap, and you are not carried away by every wind of doctrine.
C.F.N. Is Hezekiah himself the expression of what the remnant would be?
J.T. I think he represents that; the Spirit of Christ is in such an enlarged measure in one man, that the Spirit of God holds it before us in about ten chapters, that we might, in poring over them,
{291}
absorb the idea of the remnant; how it is worked out in one person.
L.E.S. The link would be with the first half of Isaiah, with chapter 6: 13; "But a tenth part shall still be therein, and it shall return and be eaten; as the terebinth and as the oak whose trunk remaineth after the felling: the holy seed shall be the trunk thereof".
J.T. That is the idea; the holy seed represents the *quality*. It is a remarkable thing that it is called the "holy seed". It corresponds wholly with God; it is quality carried through.
Ques. Would verse 33 encourage us to think that God would protect the meetings? He has before Him this area in which the root is going downward and the fruit upward, and because of that, He says certain things of the Assyrians.
J.T. "Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it" (@chapter 37: 33). That is very comforting. What happened to the Assyrian is often mentioned. God says in verse 35: "And I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake". And then we are told what happened to the Assyrian army and what happened to the king himself.
R.W.S. Is the point in verse 33, which our brother read, that this assurance was given after the process, the exercise indicated in the "sign", had been gone through?
J.T. Yes. It is well worth defending.
R.W.S. I wondered that if this point was reached in the hearts of the saints, then God would give us assurance that He will maintain it.
Rem. The word "therefore" would imply that.
C.A.M. I was wondering whether Daniel's exercises would correspond. The fact that his prayers
{292}
were towards Jerusalem (he would have gone through much in the depths of his soul) would indicate that God gave him to feel there was an immense power operating in the favour of His people.
J.T. I am sure that is so. Think of what delight he must have afforded heaven as he kneeled and prayed three times a day; his windows being open towards Jerusalem! When he heard of the opposition, he prayed and gave thanks as before.
S.McC. The section you have referred to, @Isaiah 38: 9, says, "The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness". What would you say about that over against his *speaking*?
J.T. It is left on record. It is a permanent addition to the service; it is to be read afterwards. It is the culmination of this section; we have addition; not only increase in the person himself, but addition to the actual service of God, which is to be handed down. He turns around to others and says, "We will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah". He includes others. "Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; and thou hast recovered me, and made me to live. Behold, instead of peace, I had bitterness upon bitterness; but thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction; for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. For not Sheol shall praise thee, nor death celebrate thee; they that go down into the pit do not hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth" (verses 16 - 19). That is another thing that is to remain with us, "thy truth". As *living* people, we praise God, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee;" so that there is an addition here to the service of God handed down through the following generations.
{293}
J.V.S. In @2 Chronicles 20, in connection with Jehoshaphat, we see that there was praise to Jehovah *before* the battle was won.
J.T. Yes. The idea of addition is important. We get it here, and we have it in Habakkuk peculiarly. He says, I have come to this -- although there are no cattle in the stalls, and the vine does not give its fruit, "Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation. Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds¬ feet, And he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments" (@Habakkuk 3: 18, 19). That is another addition; that is the principle of these prophets; not only that they become enlarged themselves, but they add to what is for the saints to continue the service of God.
A.P.T. Is Psalm 22 the great model of this? It is to the chief Musician, and then at the end there is a seed born -- the fruit and addition resulting from the pressure.
J.T. Quite so. "A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it" (@Psalm 22: 30, 31).
{294}
ENDINGS OF THE GOSPELS (1)
Matthew 28: 1 - 20
J.T. The thought for these readings is to take up the endings of the four gospels; Matthew speaking of *authority*, Mark of *faith*, Luke of *grace* and John of *spirituality*. The leading thought in Matthew is delegated authority; the authority of God in Christ, and then by the Spirit in the assembly. We have kingship stressed in this gospel. Christ is presented from the outset as the Son of David, and David is called "the king". David's kingship is thus stressed; and even such as Herod is called the king several times; however unfaithfully he ruled, he was called king. We have also the *Great King* mentioned in this gospel, and on the holy mount "his face shone as the sun". Other like expressions are to be found in Matthew, for Christ is seen exercising kingship or authority by the Spirit; also delegating it to the assembly, according to chapter 18. It is thought that this final chapter will serve to show how authority is also in Christ risen and exalted. His ascension is not spoken of here, but He *commands* the disciples. The angel is seen descending out of heaven and rolling away the stone and sitting on it. The authority of heaven is thus in evidence at the sepulchre -- for the moment vested in this angel, who instructs the disciples as to the resurrection of Christ. The ascension is omitted, for it is a question, in this gospel, of authority based on moral grounds, rather than what is conferred. The latter, however, is stated in chapter 28: 18, but not as in @Acts 2: 33 -- He "having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God ..." "All power ... in heaven and upon earth" is given to Him in a personal sense. The angel says, "I have told you" (verse 7), as if the authority is imperative. And finally the Lord says, "All power has been
{295}
given me in heaven and upon earth". And He says further, "Behold, *I* am with you all the days;" hence our position here this afternoon. We are entitled to regard that the Lord is with us as moving in obedience and in the light of the commandments.
L.E.S. Is your thought that the position occupied by the assembly according to Matthew is to be held in authority and power here, so that there is an answer to the chaotic conditions that are all around?
J.T. Yes; the conditions are certainly chaotic, although God is mercifully maintaining government. In some instances it is in the hands of men who are misusing it, but still God is maintaining government. The feature of the great image of @Daniel 2 in the last days is the iron and clay, which do not mix, and God is concerned that in the assembly, in the few who are walking in the light of it, there should be a testimony to government and order. Matthew, I think, is intended to teach us and enlighten us as to this, and to show that the Lord is with us, and with us always, until the end.
R.R.T. Is this authority represented in the angel, the authority out of heaven -- in contrast to the authority that Pilate assumed, and which the Jews recognised? The previous chapter says, "Pilate commanded the body to be given up" at the request of Joseph; and the Jews say, "Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured;" there was certain authority with Pilate.
J.T. Pilate's authority was in favour of Christ to a point. He acceded to Joseph's wish, he commanded that the body be given to him, and Joseph having got the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own tomb which he had hewn out of a rock. Pilate acted, you may say, in favour of Christ, but later against Him. The chief priests and Pharisees desired "that the sepulchre be secured until the third day, lest his disciples should
{296}
come and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first. And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch; go, secure it as well as ye know how". He acceded to their wish, as he had acceded to their wish in putting the Lord to death. Hence, government today may be against christianity, or it may be for it. Here it is for it, and we are thankful, and pray on, but where it is directed against Christ and the truth, if we pray at all for the persons involved, it is that they may be undeceived and turned away from their course. The angel in Matthew 28 represents the authority of heaven as over against authority misused. In reality Pilate is giving way to the cry of the Jews, and surrendering his authority. He had handed the body over to a man who was quite equal to the trust, who wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a new tomb. But Pilate having given this matter over to Joseph, afterwards put it in the hands of the Jews, saying to them, "Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how". It is a good illustration of government today, how uncertain it is, especially as to the things of God.
R.R.T. Even with Pilate there is delegated authority, is there not? The Lord said, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above" (@John 19: 11).
J.T. Authority was there, and the Lord recognised it, even as against Himself. It was not given to Pilate to be used against Christ, but the fact that he was in the place of authority is owned by the Lord. Abstractly Pilate was right, for he would have released the Lord; as uninfluenced by the Jews he would have set Him free, but through the influence of the Jews he handed Him over to be crucified. He surrendered his trust, yet he did not lose the authority, and the Lord owned that he had it.
{297}
R.T.M. The earthquake and the angel of the Lord descending, make it evident that power was in the angel; it was in his look. Would that be reassuring to us, showing that heaven's authority remains?
J.T. Well, it ought to be. The stone had been sealed by the direction of Pilate, but the angel coming down and acting as is presented here, poured contempt upon that seal. "And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it". It would mean that the earthquake and the angel are linked together.
R.B. Would you tell us why this message is given to the women, and not the disciples?
J.T. Well, they were in the way of it. They are honoured as showing affection for the Lord. As our affections are right, we go in the right direction; although we may be unintelligent in what we are doing, we come into the privilege and honour. They are not like the apostles, formally appointed, but they are in the way, and governed by right affections. It is thus that the Lord comes in; a word comes in to assure us, and we get a message. The women got a message along with the word, "Behold, I have told you" (verse 7). That word is to convey authority. In a meeting like this, as we are rightly governed by light and affection, a word comes in; there is authority, and you are confirmed in the position.
R.R.T. The word to the women, "Go quickly", would indicate authority.
J.T. It would. Authority is stressed in "Behold, I have told you". It conveys to them that it is the Lord's business and requires haste. Another principle that comes in here is: "If any one speak -- as oracles of God" (@1 Peter 4: 11). Thus we are to be sure that what we say is right.
{298}
J.L.F. It is a question, is it not, who the speaker represents?
J.T. That is the point here, that he has credentials. The circumstances show that he is accredited from heaven; the earthquake, and the rolling away of the stone, his face like lightning, all show that he has credentials. The remark, "Behold, I have told you", is based on that. It would seem as if the presence of the angel, and the earthquake, run together; the earthquake denoting dynamic power, and the angel authoritative power. It is representation accompanied by actual power in the earthquake; the power that operated. The angel is representative, and the earthquake, the testimony to the direct power of God, was with him. When they prayed in Jerusalem the place was shaken (@Acts 4: 31). That was direct power, but it was in their favour, it was not against them.
M.D.F. Moses, great as he was, could not change anything divinely spoken. It must be as the *Lord commanded* Moses.
J.T. Thus he represented fully the authority of God.
G.C. Would you say that the angel had control of the whole situation here?
J.T. Everything about him accredited him. The earthquake was actual power, what you might call dynamic power, but he had authority also, which is another matter. He had power in the sense of authority, but it was not only that, there was actual power with it.
G.C. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
J.T. Exactly. Sitting upon it is a challenge implying, Who can question what I have done? Those who had sealed the stone, what could they do? They are simply powerless. The soldiers are representatives of the chief priests, but they were as dead men.
{299}
W.G.H. The word of the angel would be a living voice *speaking*, and the earthquake supported that, would you say?
J.T. I think the authority is the first thing and then power to support it. Peter declared that Jesus is made both Lord and Christ; that is authority, and the Spirit is the power to support that authority in *operating* here.
L.E.S. Referring to the first verse, do you think that in the expression "the next day after sabbath", there is a suggestion of something additional coming forward?
J.T. Yes; it is more that in Matthew than in John, Matthew does not stress what is wholly new in this connection; John does, and he says, "the first day of the week" twice in chapter 20. In Matthew 28 it is "the next day after sabbath", in the New Translation. The link is with the sabbath.
R.R.T. It says that the women came to look at the sepulchre, and what they saw suggested the authority of heaven vested in this angel.
J.T. Yes, that is the thought exactly, and we should get that into our souls now. It is what replaces the authority that christians, from the outset, have suffered from; beginning with Christ Himself, there has been suffering from the authorities. Pilate used authority against Christ, but the fact that he acted against Christ did not abrogate the authority. The vacillating character of the four monarchies, of which the last is now running its course, is replaced *morally* by authority as seen in Christ and the assembly. The authority seen in the four monarchies will be replaced actually presently, but it is displaced now morally by what the angel represents, the authority that is now vested in Christ, presently to come out publicly, but now known in the assembly. It is continuous. This new thing is brought in, and spoken of as the kingdom
{300}
of heaven in Matthew, but in the other gospels and the epistles the kingdom of God.
R.R.T. The misuse of authority by Pilate is a solemn warning to us. The Lord gave to His bondmen "the authority", and we are reminded of the seriousness of the misuse of it.
J.T. Yes. It is seen, alas, in the history of the assembly. The authority delegated to the bondmen is one thing, and authority delegated to the four monarchies is another thing; the latter continues, untrustworthy as it is. It may be for Christ or against Christ, as seen in Pilate. The authority delegated to the bondmen was wholly for Christ -- for the support of His testimony. Rome arrogates it to herself, but there it has morally ceased. No one who knows the Lord will submit to it, but authority among those of the assembly, who maintain it on moral grounds in the power of the Holy Spirit, will be owned; and those who know the Lord will also submit to the powers that be. This situation will go on to the end. In view of this, in the address to Thyatira, the Lord says, "But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come. And he that overcomes, and he that keeps unto the end my works, to him will I give authority over the nations" (@Revelation 2: 24 - 26). That is how the matter stands in christendom, that Thyatira has arrogated authority in religious matters on the earth, but our chapter shows that you cannot divorce authority according to God from the keeping of the Lord's commandments. As keeping the commandments of the Lord we come into the power of the Spirit, and not otherwise; we cannot assume to have it otherwise. A very important lesson for us to learn is that delegated authority set up at the beginning has ceased
{301}
to exist in the public body. We come into this authority only as separated, as a remnant, and as loving the Lord, and keeping His commandments.
C.T.K. Is the basis of this delegated authority seen in attachment to Christ? The angel recognised this and said, "ye seek Jesus".
J.T. Well, these women were morally in keeping with the angel. Although they were ignorant, their affections were right and the angel knew. He says to the women, "Fear not *ye*, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come see the place where the Lord lay". He was taking account of them as they were; he knew, and they were morally in keeping with himself. I am sure that is the position today, that there are those who, as keeping His commandments are morally in accord with the authority vested in Christ. Hence the word here is, "Behold, I have told you". They were to receive a message, a direct message from him who represented God.
Then the next thing is, will they fulfil it? We are marked off as brethren of Christ as we do the will of God (@Mark 3: 34, 35). So that we read of these women in verse 8 of our chapter, "And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word". They fulfilled the commission, they carried the message quickly. We are not told that Mary ran quickly in John 20, because it is the spiritual side, but here it is authority; the matter must be done well and quickly. Here the King's business required haste.
G.C. We are really put in touch with heaven, are we not? The passage says, "for an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven", and then we get his clothing spoken of, his countenance, and so on.
J.T. He descends, he is in liberty himself, he is *moving in liberty;* and his word is not that he had
{302}
been told to tell them, but, "Behold, I have told you". It is immediate authority expressed.
L.E.S. Would a rebellious attitude on our part in assembly matters be a challenge to authority?
J.T. Quite so, that enters into the teaching of the chapter. The bearing of the chapter is on public testimony. In the truth relative to the assembly, which is in chapters 16 to 18, we find that any one disregarding the assembly has constituted himself unfit for fellowship. He is regarded as a heathen man and a publican, and is in an altogether outside position, showing that the authority is the same whether in the angel, or in the assembly. It is the authority of heaven. Anyone who disregards the authority comes under the ban of heaven as well as the assembly. Whatever is bound on earth is bound in heaven. It is terrible to be under the ban of heaven, and it is reflected in the assembly.
J.A.W. The women had the message and they carried it as directed, and then the Lord comes in and supports them in it. He confirms it. Is there not a suggestion there for us in regard to assembly procedure? We receive impressions as to the Lord, and then He comes in to confirm them.
J.T. That is what is very beautiful here, for the angel had said, "I have told you", and those to whom they are taking the message are called "disciples". "And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage. Then Jesus says to them, Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren". He changes the word from "disciples" to "brethren", which is very beautiful. This light comes to persons who are moving under authority already, so that whether the authority is in the angel, or the assembly, the Lord comes in as we are moving under it, and confirms us. We have elevated language used here; He
{303}
says, "my brethren", which, as I said, is very beautiful. This word from the Lord places all on higher ground.
J.A.W. Would the thought of association come in there?
J.T. We sit down together as His disciples, but elevation is the principle in the assembly, and so we advance in assembly service to the ground of Christ's brethren. The message through Mary in John 20 governs this.
J.A.T. What do we understand by going quickly?
J.T. The service of God is never optional; we are under orders, and the orders are to be carried out promptly.
W.F. These women recognised who had the authority here. How do we recognise authority in the assembly?
J.T. You are to do so, that is clear enough; they recognised it. They were fearful, but "great joy" was With the fear, and they moved exactly as the angel had told them. He said, "go quickly". Today it is a question of being able to discern where divine authority is. We shall be beclouded if we are having any wrong feelings about those whom God is using. He uses men to carry out His will on the principle of moral qualification. We are to discern that, and if not, we are at great fault and disadvantage.
L.E.S. Would you help us as to the procedure where the authority is challenged?
J.T. Well, if a brother refuses to listen to the assembly, he has said in effect, I will do as I please, disregarding the conscience of the brethren. If he does that, he is challenging the authority of the assembly, he thus comes under the ban of heaven as well as that of the assembly. The right principle is to proceed against such an attitude as that; do
{304}
not let it drag along, and as we proceed against it, more evil will in all likelihood develop, and divine power will be with the saints to deal with it according to God.
P.B. Are authority and moral qualifications suggested in, "his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow"? These features should be found amongst us and indicate what is authoritative.
J.T. That is right, so that if we are to proceed against a person who disregards authority, we must have these features -- the appearance -- our looks, and our clothes, our immediate circumstances; it is not simply because we are in fellowship, that we have authority.
F.C.B. Would the lightning suggest speed? It is said of the living creatures in @Ezekiel 1: 14, "And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning".
J.T. Just so. That description in Ezekiel is very helpful upon this point of authority.
C.S.P. Would the ark suggest authority? It is the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth.
J.T. Quite so. It is said to be the strength and glory of God (@Psalm 78). Dagon fell before it. When carried into the camp of Israel, it gave them no power at all; the Philistines overcame them. This makes clear what we are saying, that there must be the accompanying moral qualities in those who represent divine authority. As remarked, these are suggested in the look like lightning that the angel had, and his clothes white as snow. Israel brought the ark into the camp and it did not do anything for them, because their state was not right. In the exercise of authority, an outwardly right position, age, and so on, are not sufficient; there must be a corresponding moral condition.
{305}
J.A.W. Is that same thought suggested in the beginning of Revelation, where the Lord presents Himself to John?
J.T. Yes. The Lord's eyes were as a flame of fire; He was clothed in judicial garb, and His feet were like brass. When we are dealing with evil we must have these accompanying things, otherwise authority will fall to the ground.
L.E.S. Do you think that is why the Lord often delays settlement of a matter amongst us, so that these features may be developed?
J.T. I think that is so. We are apt to use the assembly as a mere tool to carry out our own wills, and we discredit the assembly in that way. If we have these moral features, the assembly is ennobled, the idea of it is there in power.
C.S.P. Do we get the state suggested in Joseph, in that he hewed a tomb out of a rock, which was suitable to Christ? This would suggest a right state in his soul, an appreciation of what was due to Christ?
J.T. Yes; over against @Isaiah 53, Joseph's act is very important. "Men appointed his grave with the wicked", probably a hole in the ground, a most disrespectful thing. They would put the Lord into that grave with the wicked, but Joseph had a different thing in mind. Hence, Jesus "was with the rich in his death". God lifted the burial of Christ to its proper level; the new tomb hewn out of a rock, and the linen provided for this. Joseph, having got the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb. He serves well here. It is the only item of service we get from Joseph as far as Scripture goes, but it is a good part. It elevates the position of Christ in His death.
W.G.H. Would you say that authority is not now official, so that it must necessarily lie in the power of the Spirit?
{306}
J.T. Yes. The authority itself is a commission given, -- "given to his bondmen the authority" (@Mark 13: 34), but the Spirit is the actual power that supports it.
W.G.H. The authority could not be maintained if we were not governed by the Spirit, He having His place.
J.T. Just so; how could it be unless we had the Spirit? What would be the position of any nation without a police force, an army and a navy? It would fall to the ground, for they are the dynamic things, so to speak, in relation to government; that is the idea of the Spirit.
J.A.W. So, the place being shaken in answer to prayer, in @Acts 4: 31, "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness".
J.T. Quite so. There it was. The shaking was in their favour, for God was acting for them, but the Holy Spirit was in them, furnishing power.
R.R.T. These women moved in response to authority. It was with fear, but nevertheless with joy. If we are prepared to move in response to authority, the Lord will come in as He did here.
J.T. That is what is so encouraging in our days. Our meetings are not blocked by the authorities. We may be very feeble in standing, but the Lord comes in and we proceed, so that there is not only authority, but His own presence with us. It is not merely a question of a word to do this or that, but the Lord in meeting the women says to them, "Hail". He greeted them with respect. It is very beautiful, I think, how the Lord comes in personally. The angel does not do that, because he could not have the same personal link with the women which the Lord had. Jesus is a Man, and has personal links with them on that line, and greets them. "And they coming up took him by the feet, and did
{307}
him homage". He did not thrust them away, He permitted it, for He had a personal link with them. In John He says, "Touch me not", because it is the spiritual side; here it is more the kingdom. They hold Him by the feet, an action which would detain Him, but He does not object. Then He says, "Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me". It is not only giving a message; a personal link is involved, and that enters into our part with Him in the assembly, which is the home of divine feelings and affections, where the Lord is at liberty with His people, and they with Him. After the exchange of affectionate preliminaries, He takes the women on for service. The angel had said, "go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead". But Jesus says, "bring word", which is a more dignified expression, and no doubt signifies the conveyance of the thoughts of the mind; that is the thing they are entrusted with, the message, but it is for them to communicate it in their own way. "Bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me".
G.C. The angel's object really was to adjust them, and afterwards, of course, the Lord was with His own. There were to be happy relations between Him and them.
J.T. That is right. You can see how all this enters into our own position; the personal link that the Lord would have with us. One always feels in these meetings, not only that the Lord should help us, but that He should *come in* -- "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us" (@Acts 1: 21). Are we denying Him His right? He has joy in the service as well as we. It is the personal side that is so very beautiful; the use of the expression "bring word to my brethren", implying personal confidence.
{308}
R.R.T. The result was movement amongst the brethren.
J.T. That is the next thing, and it is on the positive side. Verses 11 to 15, however, are most solemn, showing Satan coming in to set this aside. That must be watched. "And as they went, behold, some of the watch went into the city, and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place. And having assembled with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, saying, Say that his disciples coming by night stole him while we were sleeping. And if this should come to the hearing of the governor, *we* will persuade him, and save *you* from all anxiety. And they took the money and did as they had been taught. And this report is current among the Jews until this day". Here we have another authority -- the authority of darkness, and they take the ground that they can influence the one in authority. The history of the church, the public body, is indicated in this. A certain institution has that influence with the ruling powers, power to *persuade* them against what is right. The lie "is current among the Jews until this day". This is a terrible thing to contend with; that this *authority of darkness* continues on, and maintains certain lies, making them current. Christians need to see to it that they are delivered from this authority of darkness and translated into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love (@Colossian 1: 13).
J.A.W. Is there a suggestion here that the enemy is seeking with every bit of his power to set aside the power of the present ministry?
J.T. Well that is it, the full-blown thing is in the Romish system; that is in mind here. The new thing; the new authority and service connected with it, is now operative, and Satan intervenes to make it ineffective. That is the position, and it is going
{309}
on day and night; it is our business to keep in the true light, and not listen to the lie.
L.E.S. It is the treachery of Judas carried over, really, to the end that Satan might overthrow the position of the testimony and all its current movements.
J.T. Yes. The lying opposition here began in the chief priests having assembled with the elders and having taken counsel. Their weapon is money. That is a very solemn thing. It was the weapon, too, in Judas¬ case, showing the nefarious use made of money in the things of God. How easily we can influence people by money!
R.R.T. The Lord Himself was beyond the power of Satan in a sense, as a Man here, but it seems that Satan is using his power against Christ's disciples, and bringing in disrepute in regard to them.
J.T. Yes, it is the power of darkness. It is not the sword here used against the saints, but the lie and how it is sustained. It "is current among the Jews until this day".
J.L.F. Why is it that in this gospel the Lord's appearing amongst His own is apparently so formal, as compared with Luke and John?
J.T. Because authority requires dignity and reserve. It is the King, so that it is said, "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted. And Jesus coming up spoke to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth" (verses 16 - 18). He does not say, "it is I myself", as in Luke, nor does He come and stand in the midst, as in John. The dignity of the King is in mind -- His authority -- a very important matter entering into our care meetings and all judicial matters. We are to act in the dignity that the service requires. So He goes on to say, "All power has been
{310}
given me in heaven and upon earth. Go, therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". It is a remarkable command; they are to *make* disciples. That is the idea of the public system, to make people what is needed. This result requires great moral power.
J.A.W. You spoke of the use of money in an evil way. How can that evil operate among the saints today in the way of annulling the present ministry?
J.T. Well, you may give a brother a little money, in order to obtain something through him; not truly to support him in the service, but that you want to get something back; that is the idea, and thus it may be found amongst us. If you want return for it, then you have a personal object in view, and it is darkening; you are influencing the brother for a purpose of your own. It may result in good for others, but still, it is for *your* interest or advantage.
C.T.K. Is that seen in relation to matters of care among us, when a brother seeks to influence others privately in order to gain support?
J.T. Yes; when you sit down in the meeting you may have certain brothers with you in some matter. It is the principle of human politics to a very great extent. That is not of God.
J.A.W. This would mean that matters coming up in care meetings should not be discussed with groups of brothers beforehand.
J.T. That is what our brother means. It is better to have your thought, and sit down and tell it out to the brethren, and trust to the Lord to use it if it is worth using, instead of getting someone to agree with you before you speak. Do as Nehemiah says, "I consulted with myself" (@Nehemiah 5: 7).
{311}
P.B. What would be the import of the word, "the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them"? Would that be where His mind and authority in the assembly could be understood?
J.T. The mountain would suggest power. There are seven of them in Matthew and this is the last one; each one representing some feature of the testimony, and here it is clearly a question of their commission; the Lord is asserting His authority. "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", therefore He is sending out His disciples. He has a right to do it. The mountain means that there is power behind what He is doing; the order was perhaps one of the greatest ever given, it was to "make disciples of all the nations", not only of persons. That would change everything existing among the nations today, and it will be so when the time for it comes.
R.R.T. Is the Lord referring to a special time in saying, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth"? When was He given that power?
J.T. As risen. The full thought of this is in @Acts 2: 33, 36. Peter says, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God", and "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ". His position is on high, but Matthew does not give us that, he deals with the Galilean position. It is really the remnant extending on to the last days, when the nations will be made disciples, but it bears on christianity -- for the principle of making comes into christianity; each one is made something. God has made you something, and He has given you a commission to make others like yourself. That is the principle of it. Of course, all are to be made like Christ.
R.R.T. It is after He had died and risen that all power in heaven and on earth is given to Him.
{312}
J.T. Well, that is how the truth is presented. You do not limit His power when He was here as Man, but this is the full position consequent upon redemption. God has made Him both Lord and Christ. "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (@Acts 2: 33). This passage confirms the statement that all power has been given Him in heaven and upon earth; but it is the Galilean position here. In Luke it is *Jerusalem*, but Galilee implies that Jerusalem is ignored. The Lord taking up a position in Galilee is judicial, meaning that Jerusalem is under reproach in His mind, and therefore it is the remnant, and not the full thought of the assembly. It is the saints viewed in that way, the Galilean position; Christ not absent, nor ascended, but with them all the days until the completion of the age.
P.B. In regard to the remnant making disciples of all the nations, why is it associated here with baptising them to the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That would go on then, too, of course; it is christianity, but it is from that point of view. This gospel contemplates the testimony on the earthly line as well as the heavenly in the assembly. This is the Jewish side of the position running on to the end. It is not exclusive, but also comes into our position here. We use this formula, but it will be used by and by, too. The millennium is set up in the light of the revelation of God -- the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
R.T.M. Why is the power connected merely with the disciples here?
J.T. They are not called apostles, but disciples; there were eleven, a broken number, and then there are some not sure, doubting; so it is a weak position
{313}
from that point of view, but the Lord does not stop. He says, "make disciples of all the nations". In the exercise of the power He had He would be with them.
J.A.T. They did Him homage, but some doubted.
J.T. They did, it shows it was a weak position on their side, but not on Christ's side. We are in a weak position, but the Lord is not weak. He remains what He is. It is worthy of special note that when the disciples saw Him they worshipped Him.
C.S.P. There is power to carry on in spite of the opposition, including the lie that was given out by Satan?
J.T. Yes. "When they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted. And Jesus coming up spoke to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth". He ignores the brokenness and weakness in the disciples, and stresses the power He had; *all power* in heaven and upon earth. He was not thinking of the weakness of the vessels He has, but of the power that is usable and what it can effect.
W.G.H. Would this indicate that His presence will be with us as subject to His authority?
J.T. Quite so, as under His orders, that is what this chapter means -- whether the women or the disciples; and the Lord is with us also on that line. It is a certainty that you will find Him with you on that line.
L.E.S. So that earth is not divorced from heaven, but it is held in relation to heaven.
J.T. Quite so. This last mountain means that it is still the time of resourcefulness. As we see in Horeb, a mountain denotes resourcefulness. The disciples are there exactly as He directed, so that everything is going by commandment, although some doubted. The general position is marked by
{314}
authority, and the disciples know it. The Lord indicates the possibilities that flow out from such a position.
R.R.T. Do you feel that this is a line of teaching that is needed amongst us today?
J.T. It never was more needed than today. Here we are in an immense city where man's will is rampant, keeping the world going. This chapter is to support us in our position, all power is available; broken though we be and some of us doubting. The Lord does not say a word about it, but goes on and says, I have all power, and you go and make disciples.
R.R.T. He said also, "teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you". We need to be taught in relation to the observance of the Lord's authority amongst us.
J.T. Yes, taught in an authoritative way; not, that I think this, and you think that, but that what is presented is the truth of God, Scripture being the basis of it. The temple of God is available, the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, so that one may speak "as oracles of God".
C.S.P. Do we get this illustrated in the Philippian jailer? I was thinking of the apparent weakness of the position. Paul and Silas being cast into the inner prison, but they are giving God His place, praying and singing praises at midnight, and then the earthquake, and the foundations of the prison being shaken. There is power available for them in their weakness.
J.T. Quite so, a very good connection.
A.D.S. In regard to the baptismal formula in @Matthew 28; in @Acts 19 they were baptised "to the name of the Lord Jesus". Is that additional to Matthew, or is this sufficient by itself?
J.T. We are always wise and safe in going by what the apostles did and what they taught. The
{315}
gospels are only understood as we understand the epistles, so that you would follow their way. You never get this formula in their ministry, but that does not set it aside. In relation to Paul's ministry, the twelve men at Ephesus were baptised "to the name of the Lord Jesus" (@Acts 19: 5), and Peter in @Acts 2: 38, directed the converts to be baptised "in the name of Jesus Christ;" so that you have latitude, but one apostle does not set aside another. Either of the forms used would suffice, and this formula furnished by the Lord Himself is certainly in force. The gospels go wider than christianity, and the form in Matthew 28 will be used, I believe, by those of the Jewish remnant who will evangelise the nations in the last days.
P.B. "Behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age". Does that suggest that there will be no lack of power and authority in this service?
J.T. Well, it shows that we can go on day and night. We do not need to restrict ourselves to holidays, or the Lord's day. The Lord says, "I am with you all the days;" whenever we have a meeting He is with us. He does not restrict us, but the teaching must be according to what He has enjoined (verse 20).
J.A.W. Referring back to the baptismal formula, do you think it is right and proper to add to what is here, "and in the name of the Lord Jesus"?
J.T. I do, because it stresses the authority of Christ and His protection over the one baptised; he is placed under authority. Matthew 28 is more than that, it is the full revelation of God, but in addition to that, you have the support and authority of Christ, the personal link. "In the name of the Lord" (@Acts 10: 48), stresses His authority. It also suggests a personal link with Christ, and that you are under His care and protection.
{316}
G.G. What is the difference between all power in heaven and earth (@Matthew 28), and over all flesh (@John 17)?
J.T. The context would show that all flesh here is humanity. He has authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to as many as the Father has given Him. Eternal life is available to everybody, but the Lord gives it to all whom the Father has given Him. Everyone will not have eternal life. "As many as were ordained to eternal life" (@Acts 13: 48). The Lord has universal scope. He has authority over all flesh, He rules over the dead and living, so that His authority is universal. Here He has all power in heaven and upon earth.
P.B. Does it involve the secular side of things, "upon earth"?
J.T. In its *full* application it does involve it, but I think it is now confined to the testimony of God and all that is involved in it -- the salvation of men through the gospel, the calling out and care of the assembly, and so on. Presently He will rule over the nations, but the government of the world is now in the Father's hand (@Acts 1: 7).
C.S.P. Would the principle of this apply today in the gospel, making disciples of all nations?
J.T. It does, not simply preaching the gospel as in Mark, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" (@Mark 16: 15). That is man viewed as a creation, but here it is the nations, so I think it runs on to a later dispensation, but the idea of *making* disciples applies today, a very important side of our position. You make a disciple, your influence affects him, not only that you preach the truth, but you influence him, so that he is formed according to the truth. It can only be done in the power of the Spirit. Paul and Barnabas did it (@Acts 14: 21).
C.S.P. It would imply power in service.
{317}
J.T. It would. You would desire to make him like what you are as *a disciple*, because the persons who are doing the work should exemplify what they teach. Hence the importance of everything in us and about us being in accord with the truth, "Altogether that which I also say to you" (@John 8: 25).
{318}
ENDINGS OF THE GOSPELS (2)
@Mark 16: 1 - 20
J.T. No doubt all know that the object of these four meetings, as the Lord may order them, is to reach an apprehension of spirituality. Matthew, as we had previously, teaches and exemplifies authority; requiring obedience, without which there can be no progress at all in the truth. Obedience to divinely accredited authority is seen in the angel; the Lord Himself being the full expression of this authority; it is also delegated to the assembly by Him. Authority in the assembly requires, not only subjection to the Lord personally, but also to the saints as of the assembly, as over against independency. It is obedience of faith. Matthew and Mark link together in that way; combined, they present obedience of faith. The gospel is for the obedience of faith, @Romans 1: 5.
Mark has in mind levitical service, and so instead of bringing forward royalty, or the genealogy of Christ, he brings forward the testimony of Isaiah covering John the baptist's ministry. "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God" (@Mark 1: 1). He introduces his treatise to us in this way. Mark shows how the Lord went up into a mountain and called whom He Himself would, and then appointed the twelve; they were to be *with* Him that He might send them forth to preach. The service requires our being with the Lord, not only being subject to Him, but being with Him. All this bears on our chapter which stresses faith; unbelief shutting us out of everything; the chapter shows how the Lord rebukes unbelief. We see clearly by the New Translation that the idea of embalming is in the minds of the disciples, which rather indicates unbelief; the Lord needed no embalming, for He was to rise the third day.
{319}
L.E.S. Is it on the basis of the principle of the preaching of "faith to faith"?
J.T. That is the thought in Romans. That is, the preacher is to have faith, as Paul sets out in @2 Corinthians @4: 13, quoting Psalm 116, "I have believed, therefore have I spoken". No preaching is warrantable save what is in faith; that is *true* faith. Faith in the hearers is also essential if there is to be any result from the preaching, for we are told that faith is "by a report, but the report by God's word". So that faith in the preacher is needed as well as faith in the hearer, if there are to be results in the testimony. There is no possibility of pleasing God without faith, we are told. So that Paul's example is very concise -- "I have believed, therefore have I spoken". It is a principle from the Old Testament.
P.R. What would be the thought in the spirit of faith? "And having the same spirit of faith" (@2 Corinthians 4: 13).
J.T. The use of the word "spirit" there is cognate generally with all other uses of it. It is not the spirit of a person, but the spirit of faith. It is the spirit that marks all that is done in service, the same spirit of faith. So the ministers are to have the spirit of faith in their service. The spirit of a thing is subtle, but it permeates; you can tell it in a man like Stephen, for instance, he was full of faith and the Holy Spirit.
R.R.T. What is said here regarding the women would indicate a lack of faith on their part, for they brought spices to embalm Him, and there were questions in their mind as to who was to roll away the stone.
J.T. That is how the matter stands. "Very early on the first day of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen. And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre? And when they
{320}
looked, they see that the stone has been rolled away, for it was very great". Their minds are evidently on natural lines, taking no notice of what the Lord had said, that He should rise the third day. That indicates that they were wanting in faith; they were not carrying forward His words.
L.E.S. Do you think this matter of faith would elevate the service of preaching?
J.T. Yes, I think the lesson largely for us this morning is as to whether we are *believing* in what we present to men. Do we really believe all the things ourselves? It is on the principle of faith to faith. The question is whether I really believe the gospel, or rather, do I really believe what I am saying myself. Otherwise, I am not likely to rightly impress the hearers, although I may impress them in a doctrinal way. Their minds can take in doctrine, but faith is a subtle thing that is only understood by those who have it. Therefore, it is on the principle of faith to faith. The spirit of faith is in the preacher, and if God is working in the hearers they will understand and be moved. So that we get it in the man, for instance, in Acts 14; he heard Paul speaking. The stress is on the actual thing -- the *speaking;* the actual thing was interesting to him. It says of Paul and Barnabas in the first part of that chapter, "that they ... so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed". It was the kind of speaking; and then we are told that the apostle Paul saw that the lame man had faith to be healed -- that was the position. You will be sure to find results under those circumstances. Paul says with a loud voice, to the lame man, "Rise up straight upon thy feet; and he sprang up and walked". He heard it, there was immediate response to the word of the apostle; *he* believed and the *man* believed.
{321}
J.L.F. The service these women sought to render was a formal matter, and had no relation to the word that Jesus had spoken.
J.T. It would illuminate nobody. The sun had risen, it was clearly daylight and all that follows implies that there was light; light was shining. They left the scene in "trembling and excessive amazement".
J.L.F. The word given them for the moment would really be the word of faith that they could take hold of.
J.T. Exactly. John says that Jesus "manifested his glory;" and his disciples believed on Him. You may be a disciple and not be up to the mark as to what is available. They had been disciples, but clearly not *fully* so.
L.E.S. Would this help us as to the selection of those who are to preach?
J.T. That is important; many I think have the idea that gift is not necessary. In some meetings, one has known of the preaching being taken in order by all the brothers, not because they were gifted men, but because they were brothers. The selection of a preacher should be, because he has ability, also that he has faith; that he can preach on the principle of faith. The dispensation of God is said to be in faith, (@1 Timothy 1: 4). How can a man represent the dispensation unless his service is in faith?
C.S.P. The ways of God could not be apprehended without it. "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11: 3).
J.T. Paul speaks of "the word of faith which we preach", and he tells us what it was. He brings it down to a small compass, saying, "if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from
{322}
among the dead, thou shalt be saved" (@Romans 10: 9). It was the word of faith that he always preached, and he says, it is in your mouth and in your heart. It may be there, yet not seen in a *saving* way. It needs the confession; believing with the heart and confessing with the mouth that Jesus is Lord.
T.A. @Acts 2: 42 says, "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". Has not teaching a great place?
J.T. It has. Teaching goes with the preaching. The first convert that Paul and Barnabas had, after they were sent out by the Holy Spirit, was the deputy at Cyprus, and what struck him was the teaching. He was "amazed at the teaching of the Lord".
J.A.T. Why does the Spirit say here, "the sun having risen;" in John it is, "while it was still dark"?
J.T. The meaning here, I suppose, is that it was clear shining of the truth, the light was not obscured, but these women were not in the good of it. Paul speaks about the light that shone round about him, above the brightness of the sun; that affected him, but it was a light from heaven.
C.S.P. Why is it in @Mark 16 "the first day of the week", whereas in @Matthew 28 it is "the next day after sabbath"?
J.T. There is this difference in the passage, that Mark adds, "When the sabbath was past". He introduces, therefore, a new day. While the particular expression by itself might be rendered alike in Matthew and Mark, as the note in Matthew shows, J.N.D. evidently prefers "the first day of the week" here; and this agrees with Mark's addition, that the sabbath was *past*. Matthew's expression retains the link with the sabbath. We are getting on to the new position. Clear light is shining, for Mark says, "the sun having risen". "The true light
{323}
already shines". The sabbath in itself would not convey anything to them. Here it is, "the sabbath being now past". You begin with that, there is a definite end reached. Then these women came, and we are told it was "very early on the first day of the week". It is a new day and the sun is up, so that the position is clear. It is a sorrowful thing, if the position is clear and yet some of us are in darkness. A person may say, I do not see, and yet what is in mind is perfectly clear; he does not seem to have any shame that he does not see it. Those who have eyes to see, can see it; there is clear shining. It is an unbelieving state of soul that is dealt with here, and yet these are estimable women -- Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome.
J.B. They are anticipating difficulties before they arrive at them.
J.T. That is right. So that in all matters we have to wait until we come to the facts to get the clear view. Get to the place; it is always unsafe to judge at a distance.
R.R.T. It should have been a testimony to them to see the stone rolled away.
J.T. Exactly. Matthew stresses who did it, and that he sat on it. He is the only one who tells that, because it is a question of authority; here they are saying to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone? but "when they looked, they see that the stone has been rolled away", it *had been done*. And entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man seated on the right side clothed in a white robe. That is what they all saw. If there is a matter that must be clearly seen, we must get to the spot where it is. That is a principle entering into local responsibility.
J.B. Why is it that the earthquake is in Matthew and not in Mark?
{324}
J.T. In Matthew it governs, in measure, the whole position; it is a question of divine power. The angel is seen with his face like lightning, and with white garments. Here there is a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe. It is another view. So that in spiritual ministry every man that stands up to speak has his own line, he does not introduce novelties, but there is variety in ministry. What does this young man mean? It is that ministry requires youthful energy and purity. He is sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe. That is one point in true ministry, that it is the *power of God*. "The right" indicates this.
J.B. It is remarkable that the right hand is so prominent in the works of God.
J.T. Quite so -- God's right hand. That is what it says here. We are told in verse 19 that Christ "sat at the right hand of God;" that is where He *is*.
F.C.B. In chapter 12 the scribes are said to love to walk about in long robes, but they are not said to be white.
J.T. This young man is the contrast to mere official position; here it is a white robe on a young man. Purity is the thought. "Keep thyself pure", the apostle says.
J.L.F. In Matthew it is "clothing", but in Mark "robe". Would the robe give more of an official thought?
J.T. Clothing is covering or surrounding circumstances; the idea of a robe is, perhaps, more official. The scribes wore long robes as already noted. The Spirit of God does not use a leading word save to convey something definite. Mark was used of God to bring out this side, because he had failed on this point, he had allowed natural feelings to sway him; he had lost his way for a while.
R.R.T. In Matthew the angel is seen rolling away the stone and sitting on it, and here this young man
{325}
is sitting. Would it indicate that the thing had been done and finished?
J.T. Yes, it is a sequential position. Sitting on the stone would convey assured authority. Sitting inside the sepulchre, and sitting on the right, would imply condition and readiness for services.
C.S.P. Is sitting a proper attitude for a levite, as waiting thoughtfully and restfully?
J.T. I think it is. He cannot always be active. If we are always active we will lose power and freshness. Sitting would denote deliberation. The Lord "sat at the right hand of God", and yet He is operating all the time.
C.S.P. Moses sat by the well.
J.T. Exactly. Naturally he was a very energetic man; as he saw the Egyptian smiting one of his brethren he slew him; he saw two Hebrews quarrelling, and he would put them right. Now in Midian he is sitting; the well by which he sat being typical of the Spirit. He was thus recognising another power than that which had governed him previously.
R.R.T. Would sitting suggest availability? There was a time that Mark was not available.
J.T. Well, that is right I think, in a way, but sitting, as we are considering it, implies deliberation and consequent balance. I think a standing attitude is more that I am ready for service. In deliberation the enquiry will be, What shall I do next? There is a lot to do, but I want to be very careful in what I am doing, I must weigh considerations entering into it.
L.E.S. It is suggestive in Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus.
J.T. Just so. She was in a learning attitude. As to standing, you find in the endings of the gospels that the Lord Himself is standing as risen from among the dead. He is standing "in the midst", in relation to the great divine economy. He sat on the
{326}
right hand of God, and the effect is that the disciples going forth, preached everywhere. That is, all service flows out of an administrative position taken up. So that in the economy we have to be deliberative, and that should enter into every feature of service. Where is the open door? What shall I do, or say? What are the conditions in a given place? So Paul says, "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2). He came to a conclusion as to what to say.
G.H.G. The Lord sat at Sychar's well -- "sat just as he was at the fountain" (@John 4: 6).
F.C.B. Would not the sitting here be the working out of @Psalm 110: 1? "Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool of they feet".
J.T. Yes. He is there until a certain time arrives.
P.R. Is the contrast to this seen in chapter 14, the young man who had a linen cloth about his body, but fled naked?
J.T. This is the contrast, I would say. The man in chapter 14 "fled from them naked". He was in a mixed condition of mind, he was fearful, and poorly clothed, only a linen cloth cast about his naked body; it was not complete covering, there was nothing dignified about it. Very often the case with young men is that they are in a mixed state of mind, and in a crisis they are not equal to the position, and they flee on account of opposition. This young man is fully clothed; it is a white *robe* and he is sitting where the power is, at the right hand. I believe this is suggestive of Mark as recovered. The other is Mark as leaving the work (@Acts 15: 38).
P.R. This young man would represent those thoroughly in the work?
J.T. That is the suggestion. Timothy and Titus should be read, in connection with him, because they contemplate young men in service.
{327}
T.A. Is Christ presented as the Sun in the expression -- "the sun having risen"?
J.T. It is "on the first day of the week;" the sun had actually come up, meaning that there was clear light, clear shining. It might be suggestive of Christ in the sense of light. Matthew presents the sun in the sense of rule: the sun symbolises light and rule. It was not the mid-day sun here, but still it is over the horizon, it is shining.
R.B. The whole company seems to be affected by the spirit of unbelief in contrast to the beautiful setting that Matthew gives us.
J.T. Well, that is the point that is before us, that we might learn the lesson of judging unbelief, because we are so given to it. We hardly realise that at times we are not governed by faith in what we are doing. This chapter is intended to rebuke that. The best qualities of the disciples are in these women, and yet this is the state they are in. Thus I have to watch that my service is carried on in faith.
R.R.T. This would indicate that light in itself is not sufficient. There must be faith.
J.T. That is the thought. The sun had risen, and yet, in spite of that, this was their state. Am I then, immune? The "trembling and excessive amazement" bring out the state of confusion their minds were in. "Trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid". What good are they now? What good is anyone who is afraid to say anything, who is trembling with excessive amazement? He is rendered useless, and yet these are estimable persons. They are overlooking what the Lord had said about rising from the dead the third day. They did not have faith as to that.
{328}
J.B. Do we not lose a great deal by this kind of attitude of trembling for fear, even as to asking questions? In asking we get help.
J.T. Yes, at first they were amazed and alarmed, and now it is trembling and excessive amazement, so their state gets worse; the young man had said to them, "Be not alarmed". That is the word; there is nothing to be alarmed about; Jesus had been there. The young man says "Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they had put him". Matthew says, "Come see the place where the Lord lay", because it is authority. Here it is, "He is risen, he is not here" -- he was putting them right in their souls. They were dark and confused; the young man is putting them right, but they are not amenable to his adjustment. They get worse. That is often the case amongst us; good brothers are often baffled, they do not see things clearly, whereas the thing is as clear as noonday to those with good eyes. There is some influence at work in these women that is out of keeping with their general history. Why is it? They are overlooking what the Lord had said, allowing their natural minds to rule them instead of intelligent faith.
R.T.M. Should it concern us that we might be very active, yet not in faith, and on the other hand, be inactive and yet not in faith? The women here were active, the disciples were inactive, and yet there was a lack of faith on both sides.
J.T. Yes, it is unbelief right through until the Lord Himself comes in as seen in verses 9 - 18. The commission given to the disciples, (verse 15), would indicate that they had become adjusted. He says, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved". It is not he that *has* believed and *has been* baptised; it is present active faith. Such an one would be
{329}
saved. It is not mere historical faith and baptism. That is not the point here, but active faith. Baptism is an active thing in its bearing, not that I have been baptised, but I am baptised.
R.R.T. Would what the young man said to the women here be like an appeal to faith, "behold the place where they had put him"? Faith in them taking that in, would bring them to the fact of resurrection.
J.T. It ought to have dawned on them. Why did they not recall the Lord's words? You often find in dealing with brethren that a given thing is as clear as possible, but there is some influence that hinders one seeing it. Has the Lord not said something to govern this position? Why am I not then governed by the Scripture, by what the Lord says? "They went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid". They are just useless for the moment, whereas Matthew shows that they went and did as they were told. This is another view.
J.L.F. Would you say that the young man in Mark is serving; whereas in Matthew the angel is representative of authority?
J.T. That is the thought, exactly. In Matthew all the marks of authority are present, whereas here the young man is ready to serve them; he is pure, and, I may say, reliable. You can see it; he is not an inexperienced young man; he has a representative bearing; he is under orders, and is the one to speak to.
R.R.T. Why is there this reference to Peter, "go, tell his disciples and Peter"?
J.T. Peter calls Mark his son, as if he had been especially acquainted with him; his father spiritually. In Mark's mother's house, the prayer meeting was being held as Peter was released from prison,
{330}
and the account given is not too good as to those praying, because they were in unbelief; they did not believe it was Peter. Mark would have all that in his mind, I think, when he wrote. He would recall Peter's history, and there would be significance in recalling the message to the disciples *and Peter*. Luke relates that at the first gathering at Jerusalem after the Lord rose, those present were saying that He had appeared to Simon. These references in Mark and Luke denote grace; but Matthew 10 says "first Simon, who was called Peter". He had the first place among the apostles, but why has he second place here? Well, clearly he has to suffer reproach for his failure. So that if I get under a cloud in that way by my conduct, my wisdom is to accept it, but the Lord has not lost sight of me. It is in the light of his failure that the young man mentions Peter.
M.D.F. The variations in the different gospels are very helpful.
J.T. Yes, very helpful; it shows what the ministry is, how the vessels have different viewpoints, yet all perfect. There were twelve apostles, and each one of them would give you some distinctive view of Christ. If Peter stood up in a ministry meeting to speak, and Barnabas stood up after him, each would have his own point of view. There is variety in the service of God.
P.B. Would Elihu represent the young man sitting at the right? He waits until Job and his friends had finished speaking, which might represent the sitting idea. Then when he comes in, he speaks on behalf of God.
J.T. Yes. Being young, Elihu waited until they finished. He makes a point of that; they all were older than he, so the Lord waited in His ministry until John was cast into prison.
{331}
W.G.H. Mark presents service on its highest level; unbelief would drag it down.
J.T. Yes, the young man is the idea of it. He is not active, he is sitting, but he is sitting in a right position, where power is, just as Moses sat at the well. Many are very active, thinking they have to keep in the front. The one who relies on the Spirit has power.
A.D.S. The angel in Matthew says, "Come see the place where the Lord lay;" but the young man in Mark says, "Behold the place where they had put him".
J.T. Matthew uses the word "Lord", -- a title of authority, -- and speaks of where the Lord lay, not where He was put. That Person lay in death, the Lord of glory lay in death. In Mark the Lord is amenable to the act of another; they put Him there and He accepted it; as we see in the types, Jehovah showed Moses wood, and Moses cast it into the water. That is, the wood is amenable to the action of another; showing how the Lord humbled Himself, and became subject to the action of another. That is the teaching here, I think, as to ministry, that however gifted you may be, you must always be amenable to the action of another, the will of another. We must not be imperious, others may know better under certain circumstances.
J.L.F. What is the thought, "Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven"?
J.T. That we may go the full length of fellowship in unbelief. Very often there are partisan conditions; persons who have like views gather in a house, perhaps secretly; there is no faith in it, though such may have the *symbol* of fellowship. I met lately with a certain condition in a meeting; one of the leading thoughts advanced was that they were all of one mind, but it was a *wrong* mind. One mind
{332}
is not enough in the things of God, you want the truth; what is right. Here they were lying at table, and that symbolises fellowship, and yet they were in unbelief. So the Lord came; "Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen". They are not able to believe adequate testimony. If I cannot believe testimony I am not in the truth, I am not fit for administrative service. It is very striking to note the references to unbelief in this section. Verse 10 says, "*She* went and brought word to those that had been with him, who were grieving and weeping". Look at that, they are grieving and weeping about the Lord's death, and yet, when the truth comes to them, they do not believe it! That is a most searching matter. Then He was manifested to two of them, "and *they* went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them" -- two of them. Luke gives us a long account of these two. "Afterwards as they lay at table he ... reproached them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen". It is a serious feature of unbelief, that I am not ready for accredited testimony.
L.E.S. Would the judgment of unbelief help us in regard of matters that affect the testimony today?
J.T. I should be ready for testimony, and not be too trustful of my own judgment; if it be a local matter, I am not to judge until I get on the spot, as we have had it. I may have testimony rendered to me before I get on the spot, as Paul in Corinth; he had accredited testimony, the state of things was well known by common report, and he accepted that testimony. He did not go to Corinth to judge of the man. He said, my spirit will be with you, but then he makes this proviso -- "being such", that is, we
{333}
must be sure that all that is said about the man is true, before we execute the discipline.
R.R.T. Would you say, there is indicated here a progress in their unbelief? In the first instance Mary of Magdala brings word and they disbelieved her; then the testimony of those who went into the country they would not believe; they did not believe "those who had seen him risen".
J.T. Clearly. They were lying at table partaking of food together in that unbelief. Applying this to ordinary conditions, these men are dangerous in that state; their very reputation makes them dangerous as in that state of unbelief. Nobody but the Lord can deal with such a thing as that, but He took the matter in hand and reached a solution.
R.R.T. It shows that if we get on wrong lines as to anything, the thing may progress beyond our control.
J.T. Quite so, and it becomes so bad that the Lord alone can deal with it, and hence we must be on our faces about it. If the leading men are in a state of darkness, what can we do? It is hopeless, unless the Lord Himself takes the thing in hand, but He does. So the passage says, He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him risen. That is the finish; we must assume that they were corrected. Verse 15 says, "And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation". They must have been reached, because He would not have entrusted them with this commission unless they were corrected.
T.A. Would you say that Thomas represents the Jew? He would not believe until he put his hand in the side of Christ.
J.T. It was a most unreasonable thing for a brother to say. He was saying in effect, I cannot believe the testimony of two or more brothers, and
{334}
yet he could not but admit that they were in the ordinary sense reliable. Why should I not believe what my brethren say? You say, I cannot believe until I see -- that is utter scepticism. I must learn to believe accredited testimony.
P.B. Do we see a suggestion here of those who have at one time moved as in fellowship, but when light was presented, their grieving and weeping caused them to miss the point, and they moved away on wrong lines? I was thinking of the truth regarding eternal life and other truths that have come before us -- the truth of sonship.
J.T. Quite so. A very good illustration of what is before us. They may be feeling people, but they are really sentimental people; it is a form of unbelief -- a very difficult form to meet, but the Lord meets it, because He would not have entrusted them with this commission unless they believed. He rebukes them; He alone could do it. Verse 16 says, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned". The commission is, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation". Evidently they have been reached and recovered, or the Lord would not have commissioned them. It is to bring out His own work, because the chapter shows that the disciples as left to themselves had failed entirely. The Lord takes up the whole matter in verse 19, and adjusts them so that He can send them out. He tells them at the same time that a disbelieving person is lost; there must be belief. He stresses the idea of faith in the commission.
J.L.F. This would apply as amongst us in matters of testimony that should be accepted.
J.T. If there is not confidence in each other, to receive each other's testimony, there can be no assembly administration at all. There must be confidence enabling us to believe each other.
{335}
L.E.S. Then the testimony of a person or persons must be based on facts, is that not so? It would make us careful as to what we say to one another, not mere gossip or unconfirmed reports.
J.T. Quite so. The persons witnessing here had seen the Lord risen. They are eye-witnesses of the fact. Love will believe all things, and hope all things, and endure all things, but it is not believing untrue things.
J.L.F. What is meant by "new tongues"?
J.T. Well, that is part of the commission. "These signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well". There had been nothing like it before. These are very difficult matters, but faith overcomes them. Persons who believe can do these things -- not only commissioned persons, but persons who *believe*. It is to bring out what faith is. As in James, "the prayer of faith shall heal the sick". New tongues would mean that the testimony of the gospel should not be limited by national boundaries. In Christ's name those who believe have complete power over Satan.
H.R.H. Is it not solemn that unbelief is enumerated in Revelation 21, and has its end in the lake of fire?
J.T. Quite so, so that vengeance is taken "on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Thessalonians 1: 8). Unbelief goes with that. Obedience of faith is absent. I think it is very assuring to see that though we may not be able to cope with a situation that might arise in any locality, or generally, even as the disciples here seem to be beyond any help at all from men, yet, as we are dependent,
{336}
the Lord comes in always. At the right time He comes in, and the solution is reached, the matter is settled.
W.G.H. Faith is a basic and fundamental feature in the service of God.
J.T. Quite so. We may have the right principles and truth, but faith is necessary to make them effective. Thus we are characteristically of the dispensation, because it is "in faith" (@1 Timothy 1: 4).
J.L.F. So that faith on our side and grace on God's side, makes up the dispensation, in a way?
J.T. Quite so, and then the Lord is ever ready to come in where all is hopeless; the Lord will come in if we let Him. That is what these verses from verse 9 to the end mean.
R.R.T. Would you say a word as to the signs? The signs here do not seem to be given to induce believing; "these signs shall *follow* those that have believed". Then in the last verse, "and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". There is a thought in the signs given, not that people might believe, but that the signs should follow those who believe, and are for confirmation.
J.T. That is the point of view here, that the Lord goes with us. They preached everywhere; the Lord confirmed by signs what they were doing. The principle now is that the Lord is with us if we are moving in faith, and He never fails to come in to show that He is with us. The position is that we are on sure ground; "the firm foundation of God stands", and the Lord comes in and confirms it from time to time. If you look for it you will get it. Here it is, "the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". The signs come in after the preaching.
R.R.T. It is not that the workers are confirmed, it is that the Lord is working with them, but the *word* is confirmed.
{337}
J.T. Their word is confirmed, exactly. It is the most assuring thing in a meeting like this, that the Lord comes in, and you are sure that it is Himself; you are confirmed. Nothing will move you; you know the truth; you know in yourself that the Lord is with you.
P.B. So, in taking up the serpents they do not harm you, and the drinking of any deadly thing will not hurt you. Would that be suggestive of what Satan might bring in amongst the people of God, which can be overcome by power through faith amongst the saints?
J.T. That is just the thought, it can be overcome. You can look into the matter and it is not defiling. Take the book 'The Irrationalism of Infidelity' -- a most remarkable book -- in it, wicked things are dealt with effectively one by one. The person who handles them is not damaged by them, he exposes them, it is in the power of the Spirit through faith. You would not like to see young people take up books of bad doctrine, because they would damage them. Finally "they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well". That is a positive thing -- healing the sick.
A.D.S. Moses was told to take the serpent by the tail. Does that correspond?
J.T. That is important as showing that we are not to touch evil unless divinely necessary. The Lord was *driven* by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. It is a question of God's will, and if I have faith I am not damaged.
J.B. When Paul and his company landed in Melita, although the viper seized his hand, in result, it had the effect of establishing the people who were there (@Acts 28: 3 - 6).
J.T. Then he shook it into the fire, its power was destroyed.
{338}
ENDINGS OF THE GOSPELS (3)
@Luke 24: 30 - 52
J.T. It has already been remarked that this gospel sets out grace, particularly this chapter. Because of this, priesthood has great prominence, not so much in word, but in fact. The features of the priest run through this gospel, and are particularly seen here in the way the Lord instructs and blesses. While we have read only part of it, the thought is to look at the whole chapter.
There are two men at the tomb. "Behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment" (verse 4). The priestly service is seen in this, so as to meet the perplexity in which the women were found. That is, the women are in mind. It is said at the end of verse 4, that two men "stood by them", showing that *they* are in mind; hence, as we shall see throughout the chapter, the need of the saints is met by priestly grace. The state is not viewed as so marked by unbelief as in Mark. The work of God is seen, although it is somewhat beclouded. Verse 5 says, "And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day. And they remembered his words". That is, their case is quite hopeful. They are ready to take in instruction immediately. They remembered the Lord's word, and "returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest". Luke presents a hopeful side, and so in like circumstances we ought to look on the hopeful side, and not be too gloomy about difficulties. There is always a solution.
{339}
Then another thing that comes out, confirming what has been said, is that, although it is said, "their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale, and they disbelieved them", yet "Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre". That shows that the more hopeful side is seen here. Peter is concerned about the state of the sepulchre, and "stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened". It is hopeful when one is taking account of things that are intended to indicate the work of God. John will tell us more about this matter of the state of the sepulchre. Luke agrees more with John in this respect, as Mark agrees more with Matthew.
R.R.T. Would this incident indicate what sisters get at the meeting? I mean, that the Lord may have been speaking to His disciples in Galilee, but here the women are reminded that He spoke to *them* in Galilee; it was to the women that the men were speaking. They must have been there at the time amongst His disciples and heard what He said. It would be encouraging to sisters.
J.T. Yes. The Lord's supper seems to be instituted in the presence of brothers only, the twelve, but generally in the Lord's teaching, especially in Luke, it is seen as affecting women, so that we have them from the very beginning -- Mary, mother of the Lord, Elizabeth too, Anna, Mary of Bethany, Mary of Magdala, and others. In fact, we have several mentioned together in Luke 8; they followed the Lord and ministered to Him of their substance, so that I think this subject is helpful, as bringing sisters into what is taught. "They remembered his words", the Lord's own actual words, not simply a general thought, but His very words.
J.L.F. What the Lord had said should have been current amongst them, should it not?
{340}
J.T. You would think they would go over His words, and evidently they did, but Mark would show how shallow they were, how little impression the Lord's words made upon them. Here they are spoken of as having memories, Luke makes much of memory. The Supper according to him was for the memory.
L.E.S. Do you think in our priestly service to one another, we should discern the responsive features of the work of God, so that everything that may enter into the matter should be considered rightly?
J.T. Going over the words spoken in a meeting is important. Of course, good notes are very useful; they are supposed to give the words. It is important that they should give the words, and not merely what was thought to be meant by what was said.
R.R.T. Verse 44 says, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you". "The words", as you say.
C.S.P. They "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth".
J.T. That confirms what we are saying.
P.B. "And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment". Does that point to light shining in the temple at the present moment?
J.T. That is the principle of it. The thing comes "suddenly". It often happens in our meetings, as we are together in the light of the temple, that fresh thoughts come in. They are needed just then, and the Lord knows it, and brings them in; hence the importance of being together in the recognition of the temple. We learn in @1 Corinthians 14, that as a brother is speaking, something may be revealed to another sitting by, it is immediate, and the one speaking is to sit down, to make room for this new
{341}
thought. It is remarked that the men appeared suddenly, and it is not simply in relation to the sepulchre but the two men stood by *them*, and this is always applicable in our meetings, or in an individual sense, where need in our souls exists; especially in the Lord's service. It comes to us when we do not expect it, although we ought to expect it. Then another thing about these two men is that their garments are *shining*, not white; so that it is all in keeping with what has been said, that light comes in, but it is of heavenly character.
P.B. Is it like the shining referred to in the holy city? "Her shining was like a ... jasper stone".
J.T. Quite so. How very precious is divine illumination at a given period in service, coming in suddenly! You are made sure of it; this is implied in the two men here; it is a question of testimony. The women are adjustable, they are not as Mark presents them, full of perplexity; they bow their faces to the ground, and then, we are told, that they "returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest". They went to all; they did not confine themselves to Peter, but went to the eleven and all the rest; the assembly and those who form it, are thus kept before us; as we read in verse 33, "they found the eleven, and those with them gathered together". They are now in assembly, you might say.
J.L.F. The women here were not sent, as in Matthew.
J.T. No, what they did is presented as the outcome of their own thought, what they *should* do.
W.G.H. I suppose the Spirit would give us now an understanding of the important "words" that have already been written. The women remembered the Lord's *words* (verse 8).
J.T. Yes. It seems to me the Lord has helped us on that line -- as to *details* in Scripture. Words
{342}
denote things in detail. Earlier ministry went on the line of general principles, but the Lord has helped in calling attention to details. Striking things have come out as to the accuracy of Scripture, not only verbally, but the order in which subjects are given.
W.G.H. Luke evidently had that in mind when he said that they "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth".
J.T. Yes, he is a man of that kind, a man with a trained mind, so that he tells us that he wrote "with method". The Lord could use him for this service; he was a suitable vessel.
C.S.P. He would be like a scribe discipled into the kingdom of heaven (@Matthew 13: 52).
E.W.M. Scripture has to say a great deal about the mind.
J.T. The mind is a faculty that we have. In the history of our souls we arrive at the thought of the mind. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7: 25); then in @Romans 12: 2, "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind;" and in @Ephesians 4: 23, "and being renewed in the spirit of your mind", so that the mind has a great place. The brain is physical, but an essential of the body.
R.R.T. When we were reading in Matthew, you called attention to the fact that the angel was sitting on the stone, directing the women to go to the disciples, and when the Lord met them He told them to take the message to their brethren. Now here the *apostles* are brought in. In the first place, they "related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest", and then (verse 10), they "told these things to the apostles". Is there a significance in the apostles being brought in here?
J.T. Well, I think Luke makes much of them in view of the gospel and the assembly in its public aspect, supporting the testimony. Acts 2 gives us
{343}
the position in this sense. The apostles were prominent as the preaching went on, and then the assembly in substance is there, the idea of public gathering. Hence in that section believers or converted ones, we are told, "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". The apostles¬ authority is recognised. It is authority in grace, in the kingdom of God. "So also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 5: 21). There is the principle of reigning, and it is seen in Acts through apostolic authority. Luke gives more place to the apostles, so that he tells us that when the Lord's supper was instituted the apostles were with Him.
L.E.S. In regard to the details, would they not help us as to weighing the relative value of each item of the truth, and show how the truth is fitted together?
J.T. Well, I think that is a feature of the latter times amongst us. The Spirit is making the Scriptures speak, especially the types. The detail that the types furnish afford food for the mind, for they indicate accuracy -- not only verbal accuracy -- but spiritual accuracy. I think Luke was taken up by the Lord as a distinctive vessel; he was a professional man. He opens by saying, "Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us, as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word have delivered them to us, it has seemed good to *me* also, accurately acquainted from the origin with all things, to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed" (@Luke 1: 1 - 4). This is a remarkable opening of his first treatise; then he tells us in the Acts that Apollos
{344}
was an accurate man. "But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus. He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John" (@Acts 18: 24, 25). Then we are told that "Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly". It is remarkable that Luke brings these things in, and we cannot doubt he is a vessel fitted in this sense, as Ezra was. We should not be loose in dealing with the things of God. We should learn to be under the power of the Spirit in accuracy of mind in treating of them, and if we do not remember a thing, so that we are unable to quote it exactly, it is wise to turn to the Scripture. It is important to keep things before the saints accurately.
L.E.S. So it says in @Acts 1: 1, "concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".
J.T. "All things", I think that enters into our chapter; so that we have Peter brought in, on the principle of the work of God; he is quite hopeful from Luke's point of view. Peter having sinned, Luke tells us he wept bitterly, and now he is moved to *run* to the sepulchre. We get from this incident an inkling of the state of the sepulchre, which we shall see more fully in John; this action of Peter's finishes this part of the chapter at verse 12. We see here that the work of God causes us to be quite hopeful, although one may be cloudy; and thus that we should not be in a hurry to judge of a situation, to be gloomy about it, but look as much as possible on the bright side of the matter, to see whatever is promising.
Verses 13 to 35 show clearly that the two going to Emmaus were also affected by the truth; they
{345}
had certain things concerning the Lord in their minds, and were talking about them, but yet their backs were towards Jerusalem. They were hopeful cases and worth going after. Some persons who turn away are like this. You say it is judicial and you are not disposed to follow them up much, but these two represent hopeful cases. Their backs are towards Jerusalem, their faces were in the wrong direction, but they are sad, affected by what had happened, and were talking about it, and the Lord takes them on, and they are wonderfully recovered; immediately contributing to the public assembly. This should be a great lesson, because there are so many persons like this today, who have their faces in the wrong direction, their backs towards the divine centre, but still as you talk to them, they show right feelings about the Lord. They are not indifferent, and thus are worth going after.
A.D.S. Would you help us a little as to the distinction between the mind and the heart? We regard the mind as a thinking faculty, but the Lord said, "why do thoughts arise in your hearts?" and then in Romans the apostle Paul says, "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness". Then the two in this part of our chapter said, "Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way?"
J.T. All that brings up the question of the divine vocabulary, how the Spirit of God uses words. You cannot make the Bible a dictionary. An ordinary dictionary is a record of meanings that men have given to words, but in spite of all that the most copious dictionary may give as a meaning, you can often add to that in the use of a word, and certainly the Spirit of God has the right to put His own meaning into words. If the Spirit of God takes on a word, He adds it to His vocabulary, and it is to be understood from that point of view. So that the word "heart" is sometimes a synonym of mind,
{346}
and is more fully representative of the man, that is, his *affections* are involved. The mind, however, is properly the thinking faculty.
E.W.M. Here it is, "Was not our heart burning in us", not hearts.
J.T. The use of "heart" for the plural is another thing. In ordinary modern language you do not get it, but you get it in Scripture. "Let not your heart be troubled", it is a collective thought.
J.A.T. How do you connect the human spirit with the mind?
J.T. The spirit is the greater thought. The spirit is one of the component parts of a man, the first thing mentioned, "your whole spirit, and soul, and body;" in a sense, a man's spirit is himself. The mind is never that, it is a mere faculty. The word 'soul' is sometimes a synonym of the person. Indeed each of the three component parts of a person is used in Scripture for the person -- spirit, soul, body.
These two persons in Luke 24 are turning their faces in the wrong direction, and our chapter shows that the Lord follows them. They are hopeful, that is a thing to keep in mind, and the sequel shows that the Lord understood and moved accordingly, so that they come back to the assembly and contribute the most spiritual part at this particular time. The others were saying that the Lord was risen and had appeared to Simon, which represents grace; but they said that Jesus "was made known to them in the breaking of bread". They contribute what is spiritual.
R.R.T. Even though they were going away from Jerusalem, they evidently had some idea of the collective position, because twice they referred to it. In verse 22, "certain women from amongst us", then in verse 24, "some of those with us went to the sepulchre".
{347}
J.T. Quite so. So that they were not, as we may say, withdrawing from fellowship; that is most serious, it is apostasy in principle. They were simply going to a certain town, where they may have had material interests. These references would indicate that they had in their minds to come back in some sense to the company, but their steps are quickened as the Lord reveals Himself, and they returned the same day to Jerusalem.
R.R.T. The Lord seems to have had that very thing in mind, to stimulate them to move again towards the company.
J.T. He does not tell them to do it. They show how light acts on us in certain circumstances. He had prepared them for His appearing to them, by the exposition of Scripture; and there again Luke brings in order, as he says that, "having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". Luke here refers to order in regard to the ministry of the truth; beginning at Moses, because that is the beginning. This section does not mention the Psalms. The Lord waits until the latter part of the chapter. The *experimental* side of the truth is hardly for wandering souls. It is the presentation of Christ Himself that will affect persons going astray. These two really loved the Lord, and therefore their hearts were capable of being affected. He does not mention experience, but the "things concerning himself" from the books.
R.R.T. Going back to what we were referring to as to "words", it is to be noted here that the Lord says not all that the prophets had *written*, but all that the prophets had *spoken*. His words earlier, and now the words of the prophets.
J.T. And they were not like Nathaniel, who, when Philip said, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the
{348}
son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth", enquired "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (@John 1: 45, 46). He paid no attention to Scripture, showing he was a good way off; and yet he came to Jesus. Here they are attentive evidently to this wonderful exposition; the Scriptures were *interpreted*, and made intelligible to them.
J.A.T. The two going back to Jerusalem; would you connect that with the morning meeting in any way?
J.T. It is, we may say, the assembly in a public sense, -- "the eleven, and those with them, gathered together". The passage does not say the doors were shut, as in John. The public assembly, as seen in the Corinthian epistles, is in mind.
G.C. So you would say that these things spoken of are current in the assembly, and the Lord was securing those who belonged to it. He was going to join Himself with those who were engaged with these things.
J.T. Yes, although their faces were turned away from Jerusalem, they were occupied with these things. They were not beyond recovery. They were hopeful. That runs through the chapter. Thus He Himself stood in *their* midst -- those gathered as stated.
G.C. They had heard what the witnesses had said -- the two men that stood by in shining garments. They had heard all about these things, and were conversant with all that had taken place, and now they are gathered together. What they were saying seems to call the Lord into their company, into what they had. He joined Himself to them.
J.A.T. Would the Lord's making Himself known in the breaking of bread at Emmaus be connected with the breaking of bread in the morning meeting?
J.T. Well, it is in the house, it is a family affair, but it suited Him for the moment. It was a convenient
{349}
way of making Himself known to them, because He intended them to carry back to the company the thought of the breaking of bread, and they did. That is just what they say, "how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread".
L.E.S. You referred to the thought of Moses and the prophets. Would you say a further word as to that?
J.T. Well, there is a division of Scripture that it is needful to understand, in order that we might be cutting in a straight line the word of truth. Thus you know how to use Moses and the prophets in ministry. I think it is important at this juncture, because this chapter belongs to priestly service, involving the dispensation of grace. We are to know how to use Scripture. Philip says to the eunuch, "Dost thou then know what thou art reading?" (@Acts 8: 30). Although he did not, it was well he was reading the Scriptures. He says, "How should I then be able unless some one guide me?" The Lord interpreted the Scriptures to them, and did it in order.
G.C. Grace would adapt itself in that way to their condition, would it not, drawing near to them to help them?
J.T. That is the idea, the priesthood is here, operative in Christ. What transpired on the way led up to the breaking of bread in the house. As the two arrived in Jerusalem it was on their minds more than anything. The breaking of bread is not only truth applying to a locality; it fits in with the whole system of truth.
R.B. When it is a question of speaking as they thought to a stranger, "they said to him, The things concerning Jesus, the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people". Yet they failed to recognise the mighty thought of His resurrection.
{350}
J.T. They are further on than Nathanael. He is a case to be considered collaterally with this. He was sitting under the fig tree, and not ready for tidings that Philip brought to him, so that with such an one as that, you have to say, "Come and see". That raises the question as to *what is to be seen* in a place. These are already affected by what they heard and are talking about it, and have the Lord before them, but still wanting as to the resurrection. This was now the leading fact.
L.E.S. What does the thought of interpretation suggest? How would that work out today (verse 27)?
J.T. It is the way God has made effective the understanding of the Scriptures. It marked the revival of a hundred years ago, in meetings of this character. The brethren began with prophecy; God opening up to them the prophetic map, as they paid attention to the prophetic Scriptures; and that brought in Christ and the assembly. So that everything began to open up: Christ in heaven and the Spirit here, and all that flows out of the great facts. Scripture gradually began to have its voice, and was allowed its place. "Cutting in a straight line the word of truth", marked the Bible readings. Every scripture is inspired of God, and each has its own place, and we are to see what that place is. @Nehemiah 8 furnishes a good example of the interpretation of Scripture.
J.A.W. Would we be right in thinking that Moses gives the fundamentals, the doctrinal thought; but the prophetic ministry gives a living touch to it?
J.T. Yes, you might say that, and another thing is, that Moses represents the *rights* of God, a very important matter in our souls. The prophets represent His patience, and in them we have the opening up of His mind as to future events; the prophets themselves being examples of the truth.
{351}
P.B. "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them" (verse 29). Would that be suggestive of 2 Timothy?
J.T. It is suggestive of the present time, the word to Laodicea: "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me" (@Revelation 3: 20). He went in and supped with these two, we may say, but their supping with Him would be at Jerusalem, that is, in the assembly.
R.R.T. In connection with the Lord interpreting the Scriptures, would it be right to say the Spirit has taken on that service now, and will guide us into all truth?
J.T. Exactly, into *all* the truth. He uses this one and that one. In a meeting like this, for instance, one says one thing, another says something else, but we are all of the same mind, we are not at cross purposes, and the Spirit is here to guide us into all truth. We do not get into a blind alley; but having a clear vista of truth, it becomes greater and greater to us.
R.R.T. Their remark to one another is "he opened the scriptures to us".
J.T. Many have turned out of the way on certain issues, but with them there is no opening up of the truth, whereas where the Spirit is recognised, He guides us into all the truth.
J.A.W. Are you suggesting that there is a danger of these two going into what you call a blind alley?
J.T. They were going to Emmaus; what do you get there? He is bringing out how hopeful they are. They are not bored by what He is saying. That is what the Lord is looking for. He goes in where He is constrained to go, but it is to direct them back to His sphere of things.
{352}
L.E.S. We are not to divide the Scriptures from each other, for they are one whole, but to see how they fit in.
A.D.S. You have said that loving the truth is greater than loving the brethren. Would you help us a little on that?
J.T. I think it is greater. You cannot hold the brethren rightly and love them without the truth.
J.L.F. Luke in beginning his gospel speaks of "matters fully believed among us".
J.T. Quite so, and he wrote that Theophilus might know the certainty of the things in which he had been instructed.
E.W.M. What is the import of the word in Mark, where it says the Lord appeared unto two of them in "another form"?
J.T. It is to show that *He could do that*. Things are flexible, but infinitely right.
W.G.H. Would you help us as to the relation of the prophetic word, to the things concerning Himself?
J.T. It is interpretation of things, the things concerning Himself, that is, the Person is kept before us. "The things concerning himself" implies that He keeps Himself before us, so that our hearts are drawn into what is before Him, and that evidently is what underlies the Lord's supper. It stands in relation to the whole scope of the truth. Paul at Troas discoursed for a long time before they broke bread; no doubt to bring out the setting of the Lord's supper.
In Luke 24, they constrained Him to go in, and when the time comes, we are told, "having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them". The word "gave" there, as you will notice in the margin, is in the sense of something handed to you definitely, as a letter. Paul says, quoting the Lord, "This is my body, which is for you". It is a thing handed over to us definitely.
{353}
The exposition of Scripture that preceded, made room for this. The Lord made them feel that, This is something for you; and they understood it. Then He vanished; as much as to say, This is not a household matter. Paul says, "What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?" The assembly is in mind in the Lord's supper. It is celebrated there.
L.E.S. So that as we proceed in the truth, and the Lord develops the thought amongst us, the Supper would take on fresh lustre and glory.
J.T. Yes; see how much Genesis yields, Exodus yields, and Leviticus yields for the assembly service. The Lord's supper is the beginning of it. The books of the Old Testament enter into all this. How much we get in our meetings that touches on the service of God from the Old Testament! The assembly was in the mind of God in the writing of the Old Testament.
J.A.W. Is the suggestion in our chapter that as the light of the Supper breaks in on our consciousness, we immediately have the desire to be with the brethren?
J.T. Quite so. It is very beautiful here to see how these two return to Jerusalem and find the saints. In the breaking of bread you have a spiritual touch; so that Luke looks on to John. Matthew and Mark run together, but John is more spiritual. In Luke we see the public body, but John gives the more spiritual side, and these run together. You can see here that they are already beginning to be spiritual even at Emmaus, so that it says, "And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them. And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, and as he opened the scriptures to us? And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem". They are affected spiritually,
{354}
and they carry a spiritual contribution with them.
J.A.W. Is that why preachers so often refer to the Lord's supper, and as a result you find young people expressing a desire to break bread?
J.T. That is right. What a power the Lord's supper has with young people, as the gospel is rightly presented and received by them!
R.B. Is there any difference between these two disciples going to Emmaus and the disciples going to their own homes?
J.T. No difference; only Emmaus is further off from the divine centre.
M.D.F. Jr. These two returned to Jerusalem, like the leper returning to the Lord. They returned to the city and told them of the good things they had found.
J.A.W. It says, "And they related what had happened on the way". When a soul desires to break bread and speaks to you, do you expect him to give an intelligent expression of why he desires to break bread?
J.T. Of course you want to make allowances for youth and the like, but I think there should be in them something of the basis provided in the Lord's interpretation here. It should be in some sense behind their request, because young people are apt to say, I would like to break bread. What do they mean? Is it because someone else has done it? There should be some scriptural basis for their request. As the two returned to Jerusalem "they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together, saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon. And they related what had happened on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread". Now the next thing is the *state* of the assembly itself. They had this light, they were speaking aright of the Lord's
{355}
resurrection, but they were also relating that He had appeared to Simon, which fact testifies to grace. That is the thing first of all to say of the public assembly; it is marked by grace. They are talking about the fact that He appeared to Simon, which would be pure grace. He was not deserving of it, but still the Lord appeared to him, no doubt in view of all that would follow. Then these had the truth, the breaking of bread, and knew how the Lord makes Himself known in that. That is the public assembly marked by grace, and by the breaking of bread; the whole dispensation is in mind. In spite of all this, the state of the assembly is such, that when the Lord came in amongst them they were *not ready;* they were "confounded and being frightened, supposed that they beheld a spirit". It was a remarkable meeting all the same. Positionally it is right, and generally very hopeful, so that the Lord takes the matter in hand. According to Mark, when He found the eleven at table He reproached them, but here He says, "Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts? behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having". It is a beautiful feature in Luke that everything is hopeful, and the Lord is adjusting what is of God, and bringing it into the service. The public assembly is thus in evidence, and the Lord goes up to heaven.
W.T. What is conveyed in the word, "Handle me and see"?
J.T. That He is corporeal, not spirit.
W.T. I was wondering if it is the thought of liberty which the saints have.
J.T. Just so. We have that liberty; He encourages us, as it were, to draw near and handle Him. John says, which "our hands handled".
{356}
J.A.W. In Luke it is "my hands and my feet", and "his hands and his side" in John.
J.T. It is the more spiritual side of the truth in John. Here it is the priestly side. The hands and feet denote activities on our behalf.
J.L.F. Why is it that in this gospel the disciples are pressed with questions? At the grave they are asked, "Why seek ye the living one among the dead?" Then the Lord says, "Why are ye troubled?" and then here, "Have ye anything here to eat?"
J.T. These questions would cause exercise, and as seen in this chapter, are of a priestly character. "Have ye anything here to eat?" is to bring out what they had locally. What have you *here*, is the point, not simply what have you to eat. It is put down in that way as bearing on the local assembly. They *did* have something, and that shows how hopeful the position is, as already remarked. "And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb; and he took it and ate before them". The Lord can join in with us in a mutual way. He took part of what *they had*.
J.A.W. Would this refer to any particular meeting, or is it a general thought?
J.T. It is general, but involving the local aspect, as in @1 Corinthians 1: 2: "the assembly of God which is in Corinth ... with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours". It is thus the local, and universal, in principle at least. We cannot be independent bodies. The local feature is implied, hence the word "here". At the same time the assembly as a universal vessel of testimony is in mind.
L.E.S. Is there not a link here with @1 Corinthians 15, in regard to the appearings? "He appeared to Cephas".
J.T. Yes. I would connect Luke with 1 and 2 Corinthians, and John with Ephesians. Here in
{357}
Luke it is the priestly side, the dispensation of grace. Then the Lord sets things right in the assembly and opens their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, mentioning the Psalms. He refers to the whole of the Old Testament, and He told them to remain in Jerusalem until they should be clothed with power from on high. It is *grace;* not in Galilee, as Matthew, but in Jerusalem where the greatest sin was perpetrated. That is where the gospel begins, and it begins in men who are superior, in the power of the Spirit, to all that is in the world. Then the Lord leads them (they are leadable) to a point, and then He is taken up from them.
C.S.P. Do we not have the Lord coming to our side in each instance? That is, the two men stood by the women, and the Lord Himself drew near to the two going to Emmaus, and then He comes to them here in assembly.
J.T. Just so. They are in mind in every case, so that the Lord in this gospel has in mind what represents Him here in a public way. It is the dispensation of grace, but it is "in faith".
L.E.S. Would you say another word as to the Psalms?
J.T. We read that "he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem. And *ye* are witnesses of these things". So that He regards them now in the full position, understanding not only what Moses and the prophets
{358}
said, but the Psalms also, because we need experience to be here for God. We shall never have elders if we do not have experienced men; for the public position we need elders. Then you get public testimony. So the Lord says, "*ye* are witnesses", not My witnesses, but persons who have seen the things, and thus are capable of testifying to them.
R.B. The scripture says, "But their eyes were holden so as not to know him", and then in the breaking of bread He is made known. What does this convey?
J.T. The coming of the Lord into our midst from time to time in relation to the Supper, bears on the public position and on the testimony. It supports the "acceptable year of the Lord;" it is grace; you are affected in this sense by His presence. So that the gospel comes rightly in the evening, and should be influenced by the effect of the Lord's coming in amongst us.
J.L.F. What would you say about the Lord leading them and blessing them?
J.T. That is the final thing, He leads them out as far as Bethany; to a certain point; and then "having lifted up his hands, he blessed them". That would be a priestly attitude, He is the true Aaron; and "it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven". It is the heavenly system now, He is seen going up as blessing them, He is the true Melchisedec, "such a high priest became us". Hebrews might be fitted in here as opening up the priesthood of Christ.
J.L.F. Do you mean that the Lord might have gone further than Bethany?
J.T. Yes, it was not all the way; it was a limited position, and we have to understand that. He leads us to a certain point. In Corinth Paul determined
{359}
to go only so far in ministering the truth, as stated in @1 Corinthians 2: 2.
W.G.H. The Lord speaks of the promise of My Father. I suppose it has reference to the Spirit?
J.T. Quite so, it is the Father, it is *grace*.
P.B. You were speaking about Luke writing with method. He begins with the one priest who fulfils his priestly service before God in the order of his course, but in the last verse would you say we see the full idea of the company, fulfilling priesthood before God?
J.T. That is right; in the temple; but it is in accord with the point to which the Lord had led them, the Jewish position yet. But the passage shows they were amenable to His leadership. The whole book has a hopeful character. Zacharias and Elizabeth were of the priestly family, but then Zacharias was not right, although carrying on as though he were right, but still he is a hopeful case, and was restored after nine months. He comes back to priesthood, and he is now a spiritual priest, as @Luke 1: 64 - 79 shows. Right through Luke, things are hopeful, giving encouragement to us to go on and look after people. Even in chapter 15 of Luke the Lord *finds* the sheep. Matthew says, "if he find", it is doubtful.
W.G.H. In Luke grace is abounding, it is the supremacy of grace.
J.T. Yes, it is, although things may be cloudy, they are hopeful.
J.L.F. In regard to Bethany, would it involve the thought of family relationship?
J.T. Yes, only it is the Jewish position, where the Jewish remnant is recognised. The Lord had often gone there; a circle of love was there. The disciples were amenable to be led thus far and to stay there. The book of Acts opens up a new thought, the assembly itself, setting aside the temple.
{360}
R.R.T. Would this be the answer to the failure in connection with Emmaus, which is delineated at length here? The Lord told them to "remain in the city", and they were continually in the temple.
J.T. I think it is. Jerusalem is still the centre for God in Luke; certainly Emmaus was not; it was a poor substitute for it. People turn aside to sectarian positions, but the Lord follows them up. He leads to His supper, and it belongs to another place.
J.A.W. Do you imply that Bethany disappears, and the upper room comes into view as in the first of Acts?
J.T. That is how the truth stands; they went to the upper room instead of the temple, whereas, here in Luke 24, they go to the temple. Luke would represent the priestly and heavenly side of the position, and Mark the *quality* of the service.
{361}
ENDINGS OF THE GOSPELS (4)
@John 20: 1 - 31
L.E.S. Is all the education the Lord is giving to us in these days in view of spirituality?
J.T. Spirituality is in view, and we can understand how essential it is: "then that which is spiritual" (@1 Corinthians 15: 46), is the fixed thought of God. Of the believer's body it is said, "It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body". Our final state inwardly and outwardly may be designated by the word *spiritual*. We can see, therefore, how important it is in view of our translation to heaven, and in view, too, of the testimony while it is continued here. What was said yesterday as to Luke is peculiarly linked up with John and is important. Luke gives the external position of the assembly, its place here in the testimony. John gives it as composed of certain ones; he rather stresses the persons that compose it, having in mind that there is formation in them; intelligence resulting from formation, and that they are spiritual. John deals with the subject of spirituality more than any of the evangelists. He begins with the fundamental thought in it, namely, "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (@John 3: 6). There is something brought in by the sovereign action of God by the Spirit, that is called "spirit". It is not the spirit that God has given to each human being, as distinct from the soul and body, but a quality brought in which no unbeliever has. In keeping with that we are told expressly by the Lord Himself, that God is a Spirit and that His service is to be carried on "in spirit and truth;" He is to be worshipped in spirit and truth.
John 20 is, in a sense, the final chapter of the gospel, the closing verses show that. The next chapter
{362}
is an appendix. Luke resumes the subject in his treatise in the book of Acts, as it is called, and he says, referring to Christ, "to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days" (@Acts 1: 3). He was seen of the apostles. Luke enlarges on the forty days, the time furnished for the saints to enter into this great matter of spirituality. John gives it to us substantially in this chapter. It is a chapter that is stamped by the thought of the first day of the week, and links with @Psalm 22. The heading of the psalm says, 'According to the hind of the morning;' it is a feminine thought, agility is also conveyed. This chapter shows how it appeared in Mary first, then in Peter and John: freshness and agility mark the saints here in relation to the Lord as risen.
C.S.P. Would what you say as to spirituality have the effect of setting aside in our minds mere religion? The sabbath is not mentioned in this chapter.
J.T. Yes, christianity is a wholly new thing. The first day of the week is wholly new; it takes precedence over the seventh day for the spiritual mind; we are done with the sabbath. The first thing to be taken account of is the agility of Mary. Before the sun was up, she went to the tomb in the early morning, while it was yet dark; she sees the stone taken away from the tomb, and that is what impressed her, but inability to *investigate* is what marked her. There was readiness to carry a message to others, but inability to investigate, which is a lamentable feature of the saints at the present time; the great want of following things up. Paul says to Timothy "thou has been thoroughly acquainted with [or fully followed up] my teaching". The Bereans investigated whether the things Paul taught were so. But Mary does not go beyond the fact that the stone is taken away, deducing from that that the Lord had been taken out of the tomb, and she
{363}
knew not where they had laid Him. It is a mere deduction, not based on proper investigation, and that is why I think the Spirit of God stresses so much that Peter and John investigated. They were concerned about the *state of the sepulchre*.
R.R.T. *Seeing* is stressed here, is it not? Mary sees the stone taken away, and Peter and John see the cloths lying, but the seeing does not bear fruit until they believed. Of the disciple whom Jesus loved it is said, "he saw and believed". Believing should be the end of the seeing.
J.T. Yes. Peter and John represent the side of intelligence. They ran, and John outran Peter, but did not at first go into the sepulchre; he looked in. "And the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb, and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in. Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying, and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself". That is, Peter represents the side of inquiry or investigation, and he noted what John did not note, the position of the handkerchief. John saw the linen cloths lying, but did not investigate further, but Peter went in and saw more. It seems to me that what we have to learn is intelligence leading to investigation, culminating in faith; here faith in John. It does not say that Peter believed, but John did. So that the first lesson is, I think, investigation, the importance of looking into things. It is a sign of spirituality. Peter entered into the sepulchre and saw the handkerchief that was "folded up in a distinct place by itself". That shows that his mind was active in order to determine the truth.
L.E.S. Would it be right to say, that although this chapter is in a feminine setting, behind it is
{364}
masculine love, and the intelligence connected with it?
J.T. I think so. I think Peter and John represent that side, although Mary is the particular representative of affection; it existed too in Peter and John; but here, intelligence marked them, leading to something definite, leading to *faith*, which is characteristic of the dispensation. The Lord, however, did not manifest Himself to them at the tomb, whereas Mary's affection, although ignorant, attracted Him, and He made Himself known to her there.
R.B. Does Mary take the right attitude in reporting to the brethren her concern or exercise as to what she has found?
J.T. Well, so far, but then why did she make such a deduction? "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him". That is a mere deduction, not faith at all, nor is there any reference to the state of the sepulchre; all she saw was the stone removed. How did she know the Lord was not there? It is the way things are reported; and reports of meetings like this are often carried in this way and misrepresented. Why not go the whole way and report what was actually said?
R.R.T. She also made a wrong deduction in supposing the Lord to be the gardener.
J.T. Just so. Why did it not occur to her that it *might* be Himself, seeing that He had said, He should be raised on the third day?
C.S.P. Would that be a principle to govern us in assembly matters, to investigate fully before speaking?
J.T. I think that is right. "Abundantly declared the thing as it is" (@Job 26: 3). Mary only saw the stone rolled away, she did not abundantly declare the thing as it was. She made deductions that were false. There was no warrant for them at all.
{365}
C.S.P. John reaches it in the epistle when he says, "that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled" (@1 John 1: 1), so that he could declare the thing fully.
J.T. Quite so. "That which we have seen and heard we report to you" (@1 John 1: 3). This chapter is intended to help us as to that. John said, "It is the Lord" (@John 21: 7). He had the power of discernment more than Peter. It is of him that it is said, "he saw and believed". Discernment in the assembly is most important; it is a spiritual matter. Of course, it is a physical matter too, we must be together in assembly physically, but the Lord comes in spiritually, and that is to be discerned. The bearing of the truth on the assembly, is to raise the question whether we can judge and discern spirituality.
W.G.H. Christendom is really saying, We know not where they have laid Him. That is the position of the public body, they do not know where Christ is at the present time.
J.T. Yes. Mary spoke in a natural way; talking about the Lord's body and where it was laid, and she would take it away, and so on. She was not dealing with things spiritually; and yet she was a most estimable person, showing the most genuine affection for Christ. Luke links with John in what we are speaking of; he also introduces the thought of the state of the tomb, showing that Peter looked into it, and went away wondering. Luke also speaks of the appearance to the two going to Emmaus; the Lord manifesting Himself to them in the breaking of bread is a wholly spiritual thought, and it was brought forward by the two and contributed to the assembly. It is a contribution that remains and is carried down to us. Luke gives us that side.
{366}
C.T.K. The saints might be hindered through lack of investigation, by standing outside and mourning in regard to a condition, but it requires stooping down and entering into it to obtain the f acts.
J.T. Yes, and investigation here brings out the word *cloths*, not clothes; that is, separate pieces of material, not one wrapping; evidently as they had been on the Lord's body. There was no struggle at all in the resurrection. The spiritual is entirely unaffected by the natural; and again, the doors being shut the Lord came in. As to the position of the cloths, the thought is, I think, that they were as on the Lord before He arose. He came out without deranging them, save "the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself". Some hand had done that out of respect, or reverence, for Christ.
J.B. Would it speak of the order in which the Lord left the tomb? All was in perfect order, and Peter saw that.
J.T. Yes, He left the cloths, I should say, as they were on His body, piece by piece according to the way that Joseph of Arimathaea had wrapped Him. What does all that mean? If He were taken away as Mary said, those who took Him away would not leave the cloths like that. If anybody had stolen Him, they would probably have taken the cloths as well. That is, spiritual investigation is well rewarded. Mary's information was misleading; her next message, directly sent to the disciples by the Lord, is not misleading. It is directly from His own lips.
R.R.T. While there is spiritual investigation which is right and necessary, there is also at times investigation because of unbelief. I was thinking
{367}
of Thomas, he wanted to investigate because he did not believe.
J.T. That brings out that he could not accept testimony. A man is not fit for the assembly if he cannot accept accredited testimony. He is very emphatic about it. He says to the disciples, "Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe;" as much as to say, he did not trust anybody on this point. That is a very wrong attitude in any of us; it means we have no confidence in the brethren.
R.R.T. He would not accept their testimony.
J.T. What is the use of talking about loving the brethren if I do not believe them? Perhaps a dozen of them say they are witnesses of a thing, and I do not believe them. In what state is a man like that?
J.B. Would this be a specific appearance to confirm what the brethren had seen and reported, because Thomas was there the second time?
J.T. Yes, he is there the second time insisting that he must put his finger into the print of the nails. All the others believed, but he did not. A man who does not receive accredited testimony is not right, and is unfit for the assembly.
T.D. Is it your thought that the linen cloths being there, and the napkin folded in a place by itself, would indicate the Lord's triumph, that He left everything in perfect order?
J.T. Yes, He left the thing as it was. I do not think the position of the handkerchief indicated something done by Him, but by someone else showing respect for Him. Headship is another element that enters into this. It is calling attention to the Lord's headship; to what was on His head.
P.B. "Folded" suggests order.
J.T. A respectful hand did it, it belonged to the Lord.
{368}
G.C. Would you say that, as bringing in the thought of headship, we are getting now what is flowing from Himself?
J.T. Yes, making room for it and calling attention to it. Then Mary sees the angels, as we are told, one at the head and one at the feet, -- "As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb, and beholds two angels sitting in white garments, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain". That is respect. The angels are calling attention to Him, with the respect due to the One who lay there, "where the body of Jesus had lain". The positions of the head and the feet are noted.
R.B. It speaks of John seeing and believing What was it that he saw and believed?
J.T. He believed the Lord was risen. The word 'believe' by itself, without the object of it, would be faith in a general or characteristic way. It is a great feature in John.
M.D.F. Do you think that heaven waited patiently for the moment when the Scriptures would be fulfilled, and that He might be raised from the dead? He lay in the grave, and when the days were accomplished, heaven was ready.
J.T. That is an additional thought to what we get here. In @Romans 6:4 it is "raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father". It is not the power there, but the *glory*, showing the Father's affections were expressed in it. Here it is, "he must rise from among the dead" (verse 9).
G.C. Referring to the angels, one at the head and one at the feet; what is in that for us?
J.T. It is to call attention to the One who had lain there. The reference to the napkin was to call attention to His head; now the angels call attention to Him; to His head and to His feet. The walk of a divine Person here is suggested.
{369}
L.E.S. Would you say a word more as to investigation?
J.T. It is a general thought as to divine things; the Scriptures invite investigation. Search is the same kind of thought. The spies were sent to search the land, to discover what was there, the state of the land. They did, and brought back the evidence. So "the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (@1 Corinthians 2: 10). So here, if a true investigation had been made, the fact would have been established that the Lord had not been taken away, but had raised Himself. "Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (@John 2: 19). He spoke of the temple of His body. Mary was setting that aside by her deduction. So that investigation is most important. It is not simply what we have in a reading like this, but everyone in his soul going over the thing, comparing what is said with Scripture.
J.A.W. Are you suggesting that each meeting we go to should be a fresh incentive to read the Scriptures for ourselves?
J.T. That is the thought. We are enjoined to do it, to search as for hidden treasure, also to confirm and enlarge on what is ministered.
T.D. Investigation marked the Bereans.
J.T. Yes. They searched the Scriptures daily. They wanted to be sure. So with Lydia, "whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul" (@Acts 16: 14); not simply to believe, but to *attend* to the things spoken by Paul. We have the means of determining the truth, the Holy Spirit guiding us into it. So that Paul says to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2: 7). Thus we never need to be puzzled. Things said may not be clear, but as you wait on the Lord the truth will dawn on you. Another thing is that certain truth
{370}
ministered may have a special application, and when you are in the circumstances to which it applies it becomes quite clear.
J.A.W. It says here, "for they had not yet known the scripture". The inference would be that they would not be assured until they knew the scripture.
J.T. The indication is that whatever faith there was resulted from what was seen in the tomb, not from what Scripture states.
A.D.S. While it is only said of John that he believed, earlier in this gospel we read that the Lord said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" and "When therefore he was raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken" (@John 2: 22). There they all are accredited with believing.
J.T. John only is mentioned here. I would assume that Peter was linked in the thing with John; but John entered the tomb the second time, and it is said, he believed. The passage in John 2 is particularly helpful, because it shows that Christ's resurrection leads to belief of the Scripture. They "believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken". The Scriptures are put before what Jesus said. A great point is to show that the Scriptures are valid, that they are inspired of God. "The scripture cannot be broken;" John alone quotes that from the Lord's words. And the Lord says of Moses, "But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?" (@John 5: 47). He accredits the Scriptures, and especially Moses, as over against the modernists.
W.G.H. Would you say that the opposition today is largely against what is spiritual, and God is giving fresh light on the Scriptures, hence the need for investigation?
{371}
J.T. Well, quite so, and that is what is going on. The Lord is calling attention to things in detail. You get *word* and *words*. In @John 17: 6 - 8 the Lord says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee; for the words which thou has given me I have given them, and they have received them". The first is general, the second involves detail.
E.W.M. The truth of Christ's sonship which has been before us recently, has certainly stood the test of investigation. Personally, it has opened up the Scriptures to me.
J.T. The more you investigate it, the more assured you are of it.
T.A. John 20: 4 says, "And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb". Now Peter is known generally as very active, but he was not ahead of John here, and then later, John entered in, and "saw and believed".
J.T. Peter investigated first. It is said that "the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb, and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in". He took a view from without. "Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying, and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself". He saw more than John; but John afterwards entered, and saw and believed.
The next thing is, that the disciples, we are told, went to their own homes; that is not too good, but we must not overlook that they believed; at least, John believed. Then Mary "stood at the

tomb weeping without. As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb, and beholds two angels sitting in white garments, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain". She is met by angels, which would indicate somewhat of a distance, and lower intelligence and information, not requiring investigation, because there are two angels. They are called angels and not men here, which I think bears out what we are saying about the chapter, that the trend is spiritual. Angels are spirits. God is a Spirit, and angels are said to be spirits. It would appear as if the angels are to convey the need of spirituality and dignity, in relation to the One who lay there; the position He was in, where His head was, and where His feet were. One angel was at the head, and the other at the feet, where His body had lain. Mary saw that, and then they say to her, "Woman, why dost thou weep?" This is not the time of weeping; that is another principle in the assembly. There is a time for everything, but when we come to the Lord's supper it is a time of the greatest enjoyment, eating and drinking. The assembly requires a free and happy state amongst us, because the presence of the Lord amongst us involves a state of joy. The disciples were glad when they saw Him. The angels say, "why dost thou weep?" and the Lord says, "why dost thou weep?" All this would eliminate that element from assembly service. It has no place there. Although Mary stooped down into the tomb, the Spirit of God does not ignore the fact that her state is not suitable. There was no occasion at all for weeping. Had she gone the full length in investigation of the truth of the position, she would have been full of joy. Mary is occupied with Christ, but she is not in a state suitable for the circumstances. Why should it be so? The facts known would make her glad, and yet she is weeping.
{373}
In answer to the angels she says, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him". She is asserting what is false, and yet we all own that she loved the Lord and that His absence was the cause of her tears. But she was in a state of unbelief.
G.C. As to spirituality, would you speak of that as a result?
J.T. The basis of it is new birth, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, answering to what God is. He is said to be a Spirit. The believer thus grows spiritually as God is presented to him and apprehended. This involves earnest investigation of the truth.
J.A.W. Her unbelief is clearly marked in verses 13 - 15. There was no spiritual going forward there.
J.T. No, there was not. She had seen the two angels, but she is still keeping the thought, "they have taken away my Lord". She had said "the Lord", but now it is "my Lord", which is to be noted, but it does not add much. Then she turned backward. That shows her confused state, because christianity is going forward, not backward. Nevertheless Jesus was there, although she did not discern Him. How touching that He should meet her backward gaze!
J.L.F. So that the position really was as the Lord says in Revelation, "I am he that liveth, and was dead". It is in contrast to what Mary was engaged with.
J.A.W. We could do a lot of weeping about the state and condition, and still be in a state of unbelief.
J.T. Yes. This is a very important instruction, because this sister was very valuable and capable of taking one of the greatest messages delivered to the saints, but capable only as she was adjusted.
{374}
J.A.T. She was in a state of unbelief, but yet she had great affection.
J.T. Clearly she had.
L.E.S. As to assembly service, would the Lord take us in hand in this way so that the service may take on spirituality?
J.T. That is the idea. Luke gives us more the adjusting side, in the chapter we had yesterday. There is no need of adjusting in *the assembly* according to John. All is in order as the Lord came and stood in the midst. It is because He had taken such pains beforehand. Why not have a difficulty settled outside of the assembly? John would suggest that.
T.D. I was going to ask a question as to the thought of rejoicing. Have you in mind that very often we may be weeping on Lord's day morning, when we ought to be rejoicing?
J.T. There is a time for everything, according to Ecclesiastes, and so in @Nehemiah 8: 12, on an important occasion, weeping was prohibited: "And all the people went their way, to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing". The assembly as in function is no place for weeping, but for joy. It should be the residence of holy joy. Here we have, "Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing there, and knew not that it was Jesus". She is not getting any help from the angels. They said "Woman, why dost thou weep?" The angels do not indicate that she should weep. She said, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him". She then sees the Lord,, and says to Him, "Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away". She is full of affection, but it is ignorant affection. There is unbelief connected with it, and she is persistent in her unbelieving thoughts. Jesus says, "Mary". You can hear the accents of the Lord in the word
{375}
"Mary". He is securing the person known by that name; disengaging her from darkness, and making her spiritual. Hence the next word is, "She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher". Now the light is dawning on her, and she needs to be *taught*. According to John, one of the great needs is teaching, the saints should be taught; and to be taught I must listen, investigate, and understand what I see and hear.
A.D.S. Would the turning round be in contrast to turning backwards?
J.T. Yes. She turns round to where she should be, for Christ is now there in His love, seeking to adjust her and use her. She is now learning. The word "Rabboni" is 'my Teacher;' I do not want anybody else. That is the import of it. So He says to her, "Touch me not". He anticipated the possibility of her further advance on the earthly line, but He would not have that, because He is leading on to the spiritual order of things. According to Matthew, the women held Him by the feet, but He forbids it here. The Lord says to her, "Touch me not", and then adds, "for I have not yet ascended to my Father". The links now must be on heavenly ground. He is coming to the message. It is a quick work here, but it is orderly, and obviously Mary is gaining. When the Lord had given her the message, "Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her". She is very orderly and comely now.
L.E.S. It would be a challenge to us as to the part we are taking in assembly service, whether it is spiritual, whether we are sensitive enough as to the particular juncture in the meeting that we have arrived at. Would this not suggest that?
J.T. This suggests that very thing. How much can take place in a short time! Light breaks in on
{376}
the soul and everything is clear now, and you know what to do, whereas a moment ago you were in the dark.
J.L.F. Would Leviticus 10 help us in regard to this weeping? Moses told them that they were not to uncover their heads, when Nadab and Abihu were carried out of the camp, lest wrath came upon them.
J.T. Yes, no natural considerations should be allowed to interfere with the service of God.
J.A.W. The Lord seemed to recognise the genuineness of this weeping.
J.T. He recognised the genuineness of it, but, in a sense, the more genuine it is, the worse it is. It is darkness. These natural sentiments are darkness.
F.C.B. After Jesus had spoken to Mary, she turning round, spoke to Him in Hebrew. Does that suggest that she is getting on to the spiritual language now?
J.T. That is just the thought, and the word accurately expresses her improved feelings. John gives the exact word she used, because he wants us to learn as she learned, and to see that this sister has the right word for this moment. She regards the Lord as not simply *a* teacher, but He is *hers*, and now she was learning quickly. The Lord says Himself, "He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed" (@Isaiah 50: 4). Every morning He got His instruction -- very touching. Mary, it seems to me, is like that. She is agile as a pupil, quick to learn.
R.T.M. Why is it that the two angels do not enlighten Mary here? In the other three gospels the young man and the angel enlighten the women as to the Lord's resurrection.
J.T. I think it is a question of her movement. She turned backward. It was instinctive. I suppose it brought out that she was capable of reaching
{377}
spirituality, for as she turned backward, she beholds Jesus standing, so that it was a right move. She now learned from Christ.
W.T. Rabboni here is greater than the name Nicodemus uses in John 3, he says "teacher;" she makes it more personal.
J.T. And the two disciples in the first chapter say, "Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?" Rabboni here has the force of 'my Teacher'.
P.B. Are you making a difference between the turning round in the 16th verse and the turning backward in the 14th verse?
J.T. The turning backward was instinctive, she could not perhaps explain it.
T.A. When the Lord said to Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended", did that intimate that Mary had then touched the Lord?
J.T. No doubt she indicated that desire, but He is not to be touched now, because He is not ascended. John is bringing out the heavenly side of the truth, it is not only Jesus in resurrection, but Jesus in heaven with the Father. That is in full keeping with what is spiritual.
L.E.S. Would you help us as to the difference between Jesus in resurrection, and Jesus in heaven?
J.T. Chapter 12 is the resurrection scene in Bethany, it is where Lazarus was *whom He had raised*. This chapter goes further than that. Some years ago certain brethren were seeking to make out that resurrection was the platform of christianity, but that is not it fully. Of course, the resurrection of Christ is foundational, but christianity is heavenly, like the sheet that came down to Peter in @Acts 10; it is heavenly, and John is enforcing that here. The Lord says "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father". The touching now
{378}
is inside, in the assembly, in relation to Christ in heaven.
L.E.S. What is the distinction between the Lord's personal condition, if we might say, in resurrection and as ascended?
J.T. I can say nothing definite, but it is His body of glory that we are going to be conformed to, not simply His body of resurrection. We are waiting to be conformed to His body of glory.
L.E.S. Christianity really involves the highest conception of the Lord as He is.
J.T. That is right, what He is *above*.
W.G.H. Ephesians would answer to this, not Colossians.
J.T. Ephesians is the full presentation of christianity. God has raised us up together and made us to sit together in the heavenlies.
P.B. In connection with Christ's body in resurrection, and His body of glory; has some change taken place in Christ in His ascended condition subsequent to resurrection?
J.T. I do not like to say much about that, but we do well to go by Scripture. John says, "what we shall be has not yet been manifested". Christ in resurrection had been manifested. He had been seen of them forty days, yet John says, "and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (@1 John 3: 2). It is what He is now. @Philippians 3: 21 says, "who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory". It is to maintain the full thought of christianity. It is a heavenly thing. Ephesians is especially intended to support this, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (@Ephesians 1: 3).
{379}
R.R.T. Does the Lord indicate in His message to Mary where He might be touched spiritually? He says, "Touch me not ... but go to my brethren", indicating where He might be touched in a spiritual sense.
J.T. Well, I think so, they could touch Him there. Mary could touch Him there in the assembly. I think He is adjusting her mind; she thought He was the gardener; her mind was on earthly things, and the Lord graciously conducted her into heavenly things. Do not touch me now, it is a heavenly matter. "But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The full thought is to be realised among the brethren, and she is to share in that.
R.R.T. The writer does not say that Mary comes bringing word to the disciples, but that Mary of Magdala comes. Is there something in that for us?
J.T. I suppose so. The person who brought the great message is to be thoroughly known; she is the one in question. It is full identification of the person that John has in mind.
L.E.S. Would the resurrection position be in relation to the testimony here publicly, and the ascension entirely what is spiritual?
J.T. And heavenly. The two things come out in @1 Corinthians 15, which is the great chapter bearing on what we have been saying -- the different appearings. "It is raised a spiritual body;" "such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones". The two things run together.
G.C. Would you say a little on the distinction between brethren and disciples?
J.T. Disciples are learners, brethren have a family link with Christ. We are brought into the family. John brings it in more definitely than any; we are lifted out of legality and judaism, and
{380}
brought into the heavenly family. Christ's Father is ours, and His God is ours.
G.C. So that we are very near to the One through whom these operations are taking place at the moment.
J.T. Just so. All this culminates in the assembly; at least, in the inner circle of the disciples, for it is where the disciples were that the Lord came, and the doors were shut for fear of the Jews. The Jewish element must be kept out, for it is most dangerous in regard to spirituality, it only brings legality. So the doors are shut, and "Jesus came and stood in the midst". *Came* indicates that is a movement beforehand. In Luke it is simply, Jesus *stood* in the midst. There is no movement beforehand. Came implies something more; it is a movement to them, as He had promised. Conditions are now ready, the Lord can now come in. It is a definite movement on His part beforehand. He came to the place and stood in the midst, not in their midst, as in Luke, but in "the midst". It is the great general position that has been reached here, the heavenly side, corresponding to Ephesians.
C.T.K. Is it the transitional point between the grief and the joy? "A little ... but your grief shall be turned to joy".
J.T. Just so, they were *glad*. It does not say so in Luke, but here they are glad. We are forced to the conclusion that John presents the abstract side; the disciples seen purely in relation to the work of God in them. It is an abstract view, there is no discrepancy at all.
W.F. John seems to press the thought of seeing the Lord, both as to Mary, the gathered disciples, and Thomas.
J.T. That is a very important matter, it enters into assembly experiences. John said to Peter, "It is the Lord". He Discerned Him.
{381}
W.G.H. What is the bearing of "I ascend" here? How would that affect us in assembly, where would that come in?
J.T. I think it comes in after we partake of the Lord's supper; we are on the ascending line. @Exodus 24 helps; the word of Jehovah to Moses is that he, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and the seventy elders should go up. Jehovah does not say they are to be on the mountain, but "Go up to Jehovah". It is the principle of going up. Applied to the assembly, we do not leave our seats, it is not a physical matter, but a spiritual matter. Moses and Joshua went up to the mountain. Moses was to "be there". That is Christ's place, He is up there actually, but we go up spiritually.
W.G.H. Would the mount of Olives answer to that?
J.T. Quite, it is a place of spirituality.
J.A.T. Why is it that the young men do not go up? They stayed at the foot of the mountain.
J.T. They were not invited to go up, but Moses, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and the seventy elders. These were representative, the whole of Israel was involved, it is a representative number.
T.A. When it says, the first day of the week, does that not have two meanings, not only the first day, the resurrection day, but the week is involved; a full period?
J.T. We are brought into the heavenly realm. Verse 19 speaks of the first day of the week, when it was evening, late in the evening, as the original means; implying that the Lord had filled out a long day. It is a day of the activity of love. He has the disciples now entirely suitable to Himself, there was no discrepancy at all. They are glad when they see the Lord, and He says twice over, "Peace be to you", as if they were acceptable, and He wishes
{382}
them to be confirmed in their present place, it is an eternal position.
C.S.P. Is that the effect of the message?
J.T. Yes, the Lord came, following on the message, as if to say they were made suitable by it. The Lord said, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". "Father" is a family word, "God" is the Supreme, the Object of worship, governing the whole position. He is God. But here it is Christ's God, and they are brought into relationship with His God. We have to stop and think what *His* God conveys. What would be the atmosphere as you are alongside of the Lord in this sense? It is as with Him we get the full thought of God. We are associated with Him in these wonderful relationships.
C.S.P. It is distinctly in manhood?
J.T. Surely. It is Christ as Man clearly. He does not say 'our Father', but "my Father". His personal distinction is maintained throughout. He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions.
E.W.M. Does that hold good today?
J.T. It always holds good; eternally so. God is Father to Him as the only-begotten Son; we are brought into sonship by adoption; it is "by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 26). As Christ speaks of His God, He is giving God the supreme place, and He is taking second place, but we are not given His place in the fullest sense. God is His Father by Himself, a very important thing. He never says our Father and our God, but "my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
C.S.P. Are we to understand that the titles Father, Son and Holy Spirit refer to incarnation?
J.T. Of course, that formula involves incarnation. It is the economy. You cannot put that into the Old Testament. "My Father worketh hitherto"
{383}
simply means that God was working hitherto -- His sabbath had been interfered with by sin.
C.S.P. It was that particular Person of the Godhead. Then as to the Holy Spirit, Scripture speaks of holy men speaking as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. The Holy Spirit was operating peculiarly. The truth of the Holy Spirit comes out before sonship. Sonship applies to Christ as here in manhood, but the Spirit was operating before that, He is a divine Person Himself.
C.S.P. I have a little difficulty as to how these terms refer to incarnation. How is it that they are used in relation to these Persons in the Old Testament?
J.T. You mean the term Father?
C.S.P. Father and Holy Spirit.
J.T. "Jehovah" was used from the very beginning, but not revealed until Moses¬ time. Here the Lord is designating who the Person was who was working -- the Father. The Lord does not say that He was known by that name in Old Testament times. He uses the word Father because He had now taken that relationship. Christ was designating the Person by that name, not implying that He had it at the outset, but that the Person was there, that God was operating.
P.B. John says, "In the beginning was the Word".
J.T. Yes; He became known in that way and the Spirit used the appellation to designate the Person.
C.S.P. As to the "My Father worketh hitherto", would it mean that the Old Testament period was marked by the Father's activities?
J.T. The Father, that is God, had worked from the time sin came in. He made clothes for Adam and Eve, and there was continual work from that time onwards, and the Lord now says, "I work".
{384}
A.D.S. He was not known as Father until the Lord was here in manhood.
J.T. No; except in a sort of extended way. "For thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, Jehovah, art our Father" (@Isaiah 63: 16). It is only as Christ became Man that the true meaning of Father comes to light.
L.E.S. It is a personal touch that He gives to the relationship in which He is.
A.D.S. In what the Lord says to the overcomer in Philadelphia, does He speak of God in the same sense in which He is spoken of here: He says, "him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God ... and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God" (@Revelation 3: 12).
J.T. In the same sense exactly. It is to the overcomer in Philadelphia, it is *that* overcomer; we are to understand that the Lord implies that he would value such a promise.
R.R.T. Just to complete that verse you referred to, "my Father worketh hitherto and I work", when did the Son's work begin? Would it involve His work in creation?
J.T. He alluded to Himself as a Man here; "I work". The remark is occasioned by the question of the sabbath, which came in after the work of creation. The Father's work extended back, but I think the Lord spoke about the present in regard of Himself. Work in regard of creation goes on; but I think the Lord had in mind what moral conditions occasioned. The Father had been working, and He was now working on that line.
T.A. Is the Father presented when the order came by Moses to Pharaoh, "Let my son go, that he may serve me"?
{385}
J.T. That is a national thought as to Israel, and really flows out of Christ's sonship, only anticipatively.
Now the time is gone, but we should just remark on the Lord's word to the disciples, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you. And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit". He brings them into the full spiritual position, and then sends them out, having full confidence in them. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". Going on to Thomas, it is very humbling to see a man so self assertive as to say what implies, I do not believe anybody. The most reliable men in the universe were there, and he would not believe them. It is a strong negative, *I will in no wise believe*. It is a very searching matter, that I must be so assured for myself, that I must put my finger in the nail prints; it is as though others could not do that and tell the truth about it. So the Lord says to Thomas, "Bring thy finger here and see my hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side; and be not unbelieving, but believing". Christianity is on the basis of testimony. Faith accepts true testimony; we believe what has been testified to by accredited witnesses.
W.G.H. That is the distinct witness of the apostles. "*We* are his witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also" (@Acts 5: 32).
J.T. It is the testimony of men here, as Peter says later, We are witnesses. As a true believer, and having faith, I can accept testimony; if I cannot accept true testimony I am unfit for the assembly.
{386}
1. RELATIONS IN WHICH GOD IS KNOWN - GOD KNOWN IN CREATION
@Acts 17: 23 - 28; @Acts 14: 14 - 17
J.T. The subject to be considered in these readings is God in the relations in which He is known. I thought these passages would suffice at this time. The subject, of course, runs through the Scriptures. God's management of the creation, and how He is known in it, are of prime importance and affect us every moment. Viewed as of the creation we are, with others, subjects of God's care, "For in him we live and move, and exist" (@Acts 17: 28). Looking at this part of our subject we should be affected by God's nearness to us every moment. The ungodly are beneficiaries, but we, understanding it, worship God. As in youth, we are enjoined to remember our Creator. In Paul's address at Athens, the circumstances called forth this subject, and in Paul's preaching through the great area of Europe, the Spirit of God used him to call attention to this part of the truth, "in him we live and move and exist". As christians we know His nearness on other grounds, that is, in redemption, and the Spirit of God dwells in us; God is thus near to us, and in us by His Spirit, but even as creatures, our very breath is from Him, and this is true of all men.
J.S. What you say involves the animal creation.
J.T. Quite so, and the vegetable creation as well. I thought we might review all. The Lord says, "The earth bears fruit of itself, first the blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come" (@Mark 4: 28, 29). Paul says as to a seed put in the earth, "God gives to it
{387}
a body as he has pleased" (@1 Corinthians 15: 38); it is not simply that the earth yields of itself, but God comes into it.
J.S. So in His mercy God provides that which sustains life.
J.T. Yes, whether it be the earth itself, or the animals; all are in subjection to man, and usable, too. God is behind them all; and this enters into our thanksgivings for food. It affects us every moment of our lives, and is accentuated as we go on to redemption, and our heavenly calling. It is well to get hold of this fundamental principle.
E.P. Does it introduce the thought of simplicity in our relations with God? Cain brought in something cultivated.
J.T. Abel brought in what was living, but offered through death. God accepted that. Of course, what Cain brought would be acceptable if accompanied with the recognition of sin, or by a suitable offering. Leviticus 2 provides for this. Cain ignored this side of the truth, as many do now. You get no blood out of the soil, but you do from an animal. God had constituted them thus.
J.S. What would you say in respect of the seed? It is the principle of death and resurrection. "What *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die".
J.T. That is what is said in @1 Corinthians 15: 36. It is to enforce the truth of resurrection. The figure is striking. The Spirit of God says, "God gives to it a body as he has pleased" (verse 38). It has to do with the actual fruit of the earth. That ought to affect us in the use of these cereals, or vegetables. We are dealing now with literal food. God gives the seed a body; we put it into the ground, and He gives it the form in which it comes up. God has had to do with the very thing I am eating: it is not simply what the earth brings forth, God has had to do with it.
{388}
A.B. Would @Psalm 19: 1 bear upon our subject, "the expanse sheweth the work of his hands"?
J.T. Quite so. There the Spirit of God runs into the figurative side. David speaks in that psalm about the heavens; Solomon speaks of the vegetable and animal kingdoms; all enters into our subject. David and Solomon were used of God to enlarge on the physical world in a figurative sense. Still there is the actual, literal side. It is encouraging to know God has to do with everything we use.
A.N.W. The earth did not bring forth the herb without the word of God.
J.T. Paul's remark shows that God has to do with every seed. Thus what we get of material things comes to us through God's hand.
J.S. This fact overthrows evolution.
J.T. Yes; it begins with God. The egg was not made first, but the bird that produced it. Evolution leaves God out. He began with the thing in which life was. The thing which is to be propagated is already there by divine *creation*.
H.H. God being Creator, His rights are established in creation in relation to everything.
J.T. Quite so. There will be a final adjustment of everything; so that the very elements themselves will be dissolved. All that is very solemn. In the meantime we are using these things; every man and woman in the world is too, but christians give thanks for them. Our worship in the service of God includes this matter. God is Creator, and has to do with what He created, operating it throughout. He operates even to the root in the ground. We should take that in. Thus we understand that He is not far from any one of us.
W.B-w. The serpent sought to displace the knowledge of God. He said to Adam and Eve, Ye shall be as gods.
{389}
J.T. Yes, the allusion was to what God had said about a certain tree, that tree involved the knowledge of good and evil. Satan suggested that God was keeping back something that was good, therefore beclouding their souls. It was a question of eating what a particular tree produced. So that the enemy attacked, at this point, the matter of food. The first thing that was injected into man's mind was that God was holding back something good, which was not so. He was guarding man; there was the tree of life, and God did not deny that to Adam.
H.H. Paul writes to Timothy, "every creature of God is good ... it is sanctified by God's word and freely addressing him" (@1 Timothy 4: 4, 5).
J.T. Yes. Every creature of God is good, inclusive of marriage and family relationships. The thought that God should come down to the earth itself, giving the seed sown a body, is remarkable. He takes man out of the ground too, to work out things beyond anything the earth itself suggests, but the link with the ground is there.
J.B. God used the vegetable creation to show Jonah what He had in mind in connection with the city. In the last chapter of Jonah, He prepared a gourd.
J.T. Yes. The gourd came up in the night and perished in a night. In Nineveh, besides men and women, there were little children and cattle which God took account of. Jonah was reminded of that. He went outside of the city and the sun beat down upon him. Why did he go outside? God followed him and the gourd comes up and then perished. All this has to do with God's rights in creation.
J.B. The same divine name used in @Jonah 4: 6 is used in the second chapter of Genesis, "Jehovah Elohim".
J.T. It is the plural word. It conveys the full idea of God seen in creation. God calls attention
{390}
to inanimate creation to help His servant. Jonah should not have been in this position; he should have been inside the city. God caused this gourd to come up in a night; God was able to destroy it too, showing how He operates in His creation. He creates evil, the thing that destroyed that gourd was also God's creation. Clean and unclean creatures alike went into the ark. Unclean creatures are not wicked, but something that God *can* use -- under certain circumstances.
A.P.T. Job was lacking in the knowledge of God in His creative rights.
J.T. God begins with him in the highest part of creation. He begins with the sons of God and the stars. He Himself speaks to Job. He comes down to the creatures, the lower creatures included.
H.B. With regard to these thoughts in our service Godward, would the last part of @Revelation 4 fit in, "for thy will they were, and they have been created"?
J.T. Quite so.
S.McC. Would what you are drawing attention to in this foundational setting, be of special help to those of us who are younger? Great unrest marks us sometimes in regard of material things, because there is not the right knowledge of God in relation to creation.
J.T. See how distorted it becomes as it is sought to be acquired without God! We are to accept what comes from the creation with thanksgivings. If it is used for commerce it makes way for money, and money in human affairs has greatly accentuated the idea of lust. "The love of money is the [or a] root of every evil" (@1 Timothy 6: 10). It is not the only root, but wealth has become so conveniently concrete that you can hold a large amount in your hand. It is not like a cartload of hay. A silver or
{391}
gold coin is something very concrete, and valuable in human affairs, being a medium of commerce.
A.N.W. It is the *love* of money.
J.T. The thing is so very powerful. It was not mentioned in creation. Gold was mentioned as early as the second chapter of Genesis, but not as a medium of commerce. Now it has become an occasion of lust, because of what can be obtained by it. Lust inquires, What can I get for that? That is where the evil has been accentuated, especially in commerce.
S.McC. Paul says, "we labour and suffer reproach, because we hope in a living God, who is preserver of all men" (@1 Timothy 4: 10). Is that a reference to creation?
J.T. Yes; God is a "faithful Creator" (@1 Peter 4: 19). Young people are enjoined to remember their Creator (@Ecclesiastes 12: 1). Let the thought get into our beings in the days of our youth.
H.H. *Creator* is in the plural in that passage.
J.T. Elohim in @Genesis 1: 1 is in the plural also. It is Deity in relation to creation. That is what is in mind now in what we are speaking of.
E.P. Do you think the commercial side hardens the heart? The thought of God as Creator should make our hearts tender.
J.T. Yes. As to those greedy of gain, "it taketh away the life of its possessors" (@Proverbs 1: 19). Then as to commerce, "Bad! bad! saith the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth" (@Proverbs 20: 14). These passages show the evil influence of buying and selling -- where those engaged in it do not maintain righteousness.
E.. God speaks to Job about the goats bringing forth: "Dost thou number the months that they fulfil?" (@Job 39: 2). As though God watches over them.
{392}
J.T. All these things are very touching, they should soften our hearts. It is not the lawgiver, but God's beneficence in creation.
W.B-w. Unconverted persons are called upon to know about the Creator objectively.
J.T. The creation is a universal testimony to all, including the heathen. @Psalm 19 has been cited. "Their line is gone out through all the earth". It is an actual testimony every moment to every living person on the earth.
A.N.W. I think your reference to the hen comes home to everyone of us. Philosophy teaches us to look for the egg. The egg is the fruit of the hen, and the hen is the fruit of God's creative operations.
J.T. God made what He intended to propagate. The hen is made and it produces the egg. He makes the thing, and propagates it by generation. Evolution is positively false. The principle in creation, of which we are speaking, enters in christianity; what God produces through the testimony is already there. It is Christ, the great divine standard. The whole thing is there first; then what is to be produced in ourselves. The divine mind is there first -- in infinite perfection in Christ. Thus John's first epistle starts with "That which was from the beginning".
H.H. Christ comes in to hold us in right relation to God. The link with God is to be maintained.
J.T. Yes. This helps us in our gospel preaching; we do not preach to people exactly as ungodly; that they are ungodly is, of course, true, but they are creatures of God, God's offspring in a sense, and we have a link with them as God has in that way. In Mark the word is "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" (@Mark 16: 15). The world morally is evil, and against us, but the creation abstractly is of God. We recognise that in men we speak to and preach to.
{393}
A.R. Is that set out in the sheet from heaven, full of creatures? (@Acts 10: 11).
J.T. That is the thought. "What God has cleansed;" they represent believers. Although you preach to men as God's creation, they cannot come into fellowship as such. We recognise they have a link with God as His creatures, but coming into fellowship involves redemption.
A.R. "I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee: Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (@Job 42: 5, 6).
J.T. He saw God in what He was saying. Take the war horse, God says in effect, Job have you considered him, how "he smelleth the battle afar off?" (@Job 39: 25). That is what marks him, that is the fulness of the war horse. We have a thing or creature basically, and then the fulness of it. The basic side of the creation is in Genesis 1, and the fulness in Genesis 2. That affected Job. It is not simply that the things were there, seen and read about, but God operating in them brings them to your notice as a testimony to Him. That is the idea, "now mine eye seeth thee". This very remarkable result is the outcome of God saying this and that about His creatures.
A.R. This is the knowledge of God in creation, preached about in such a way as to bring about repentance. That is the testimony always present among the heathen and everywhere.
J.T. It is in itself a testimony. A very important matter to keep in mind in the gospel.
C.H.H. In @Psalm 148 there is response relative to God in the whole creation. God not only created it, but there is response to Him.
E.P. God calls Job's attention to these animals moving in their orbit and Job was not doing that.
{394}
J.T. Quite so. They move generally according to their instincts. Man does not because he is perverted.
A.P.T. The young ravens cry to God for their food (@Psalm 147: 9).
J.T. All creatures look to God. It is a divine statement. The book of Job is in a way the textbook of creation, having no allusion to the law of Moses. It is a book by itself; whereas the Pentateuch is the text-book of the law.
J.B. The haul of fishes, (@Luke 5), helped Peter.
J.T. The Lord knew where the fishes were. In @Matthew 17: 27 the Lord tells Peter to take the first fish that comes up, and he would find one piece of money in its mouth. The Lord recognises that piece of money, it was what was needed. "Give it to them for me and thee", He says.
S.McC. Would what you have been suggesting be of great help to our brethren in Europe in the pressure they are going through, and we with them of course -- the understanding of how God is so near and operating on these lines?
J.T. I thought it would come out in that way. God usually helps us in these meetings, according to what is current among His people. God's relations to the creation in these matters have to be taken into account.
S.P. This age is marked by the use of what is material, outside of the knowledge of God; what man has been able to fabricate out of what is given by God.
J.T. The material is misused, because the man using it has got out of hand. He is lawless. The man of sin will honour "the god of fortresses". Still the actual material is God's creature, and the christian knows how to regard it. If Satan uses it against God's people He follows it up; and even on the battlefield men can count on God.
{395}
A.N.W. The sparrow does not fall to the ground without the knowledge of the Father.
J.T. That is comforting. The cry of a man on the battlefield is heard. The Lord says, "How much better then is a man than a sheep!" (@Matthew 12: 12). God never withdraws His eye from His people. He is looking at them all the time. Even as to the unconverted, He has rights in them. Any lawlessness perpetrated on the race, God resents. He may use it to scourge, but He watches all, and at a certain time He deals with the evil.
S.McC. That is an important matter in connection with the race. While we have been taken out of the world morally it is a great matter to have a sympathetic link with the creation.
J.T. I do not think in our prayers we should ever forget our fellow men. Christians are to be sympathetic. We have a link with men as creatures, and our prayers should be for them. Our prayers should include them. God is the "preserver of all men, specially of those that believe" (@1 Timothy 4: 10). If we are with God we shall include all men in our thoughts and prayers.
A.N.W. "For in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring" (@Acts 17: 28). He says "we live", including the congregation with himself.
Rem. In @1 Timothy 2 we are told to pray for all men. God would have all men to be saved.
J.T. Yes; not kings first, but all men. "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus" (@1 Timothy 2: 5). That is redemption, but He is the Mediator between God and men. God desires that all men should be saved; that is, men, women and children.
J.S. Going back to the question of seed, do you think there is progression in God's word to Noah, as to seed-time, and harvest -- the agricultural year?
{396}
J.T. Quite so. God introduces that in relation to the covenant that He made after the flood with men. The first covenant was with Adam, which he transgressed, now God makes another with Noah (@Genesis 9),with which we may connect @Genesis 8: 22. We see this running on to this very moment. It is an additional thought to creation. It is a covenant. Very comforting, too, for when the Lord comes out and puts His right foot on the sea and the left on the earth He bears the sign of that covenant, @Revelation 10.
W.B-w. "Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him" (@Genesis 5: 24). What was his impression about God?
J.T. He would not have any more than what was available; creation afforded him much. The line is Adam, Seth, and others. Cain is left out. It is the life line, and Enoch is "the seventh from Adam". Whatever light or instruction there had been from Adam onward, Enoch got the benefit of it through exercise. We are getting the benefit of exercise come down during the last one hundred years. And so, I believe, all that preceded him culminated in Enoch, the seventh from Adam. His name implies that he was disciplined or instructed, and hence, we can understand that he gathered up these exercises. He would ask questions about Adam and Eve and all who preceded him. That is a very important thing for the young people now. Do they ask questions about the exercises connected with the testimony? "The seventh" suggests the full result of the education of that period. Whatever had come from God, as well as what existed in the creation objectively, was developed through exercise and prayer on the part of others and particularly with Enoch, because he walked with God three hundred years (@Genesis 5: 23). We may be sure God said things to him, leading to an increased knowledge of Himself. If
{397}
we, and especially young people, are to have increased knowledge of God, we have to go back to earlier exercises and follow them up, as Paul says to Timothy, "*thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct ..." (@2 Timothy 3: 10).
J.S. Job is outstanding as a man who had accumulated knowledge.
J.T. He was an early subject of the work of God, and a hopeful case. Jehovah Himself definitely took him in hand. Elihu does not finish. God *finishes* His work. At the end Job is, as it were, a *finished* product. He has come through severe discipline, the loss of his children, the chidings of his wife; and then he listens to his friends and Elihu. God takes him on. It is God who finishes; this is a principle, so that Job is seen as a priest at the end of the book.
J.S. He now has a single eye.
J.T. He is a contributor to the service of God. He is made a priest. God blesses his friends through him, then he has another family, the second family. The first is set aside and the second established. God is to be known in His creation, that is the great result in the book of Job. It is not simply that the creation exists, but God calls attention to it, and His operations in it. It is a most touching thing. The Lord says, Look at the lilies how they *grow*. It is that God is having to do with them.
H.H. Does not Job fit in with the godly man in the first Psalm?
J.T. Yes. You can bring him into the Psalms.
Rem. God uses the creation to affect man morally on the line of recovery. The book of Isaiah is filled with such references.
J.T. Indeed, showing how the prophets took up this matter. We should expect it in the Psalms too, everything that has breath praises God.
{398}
H.H. Enoch prophesied that the Lord would come with ten thousands of His saints (@Jude 14). The power that brings God in and establishes things for Him, is a different kind of power to that which is in the world in a destructive way.
J.T. Christianity is unique, there is no other testimony like it; although each family of God will be the product of a certain testimony. The Lord Jesus will have to do with war when He comes back, and in the sense in which it was exercised by David and others. He comes out of heaven riding on a white horse, and the armies of heaven following Him. There is war, and He executes judgment in a military way. The character of *our* weapons now is mentioned by Paul. "The arms of our warfare are not fleshly" (@2 Corinthians 10: 4). What is important as to warfare now is for the saints to discriminate; "our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" (@Ephesians 6: 12). The example set by the Lord Jesus forbids His disciples taking a sword in the literal sense now, but they retain their position in the heavenly war as good soldiers of Jesus Christ (@2 Timothy 2: 3). Our weapons are not carnal, they are spiritual. We can, however, pray for those who have to take the sword (@Romans 13: 1 - 6). They belong to another department, a provisional governmental one, for the preservation of order. Therefore, although we do not belong to it, we can pray for it and pay tribute to it. I believe our prayers are the turning point of all these matters. What are monarchies ordained for? They are provisional for the maintenance of order in view of the testimony, pending the return of the Lord Jesus who will shepherd the nations with an iron rod. The position of the saints is difficult; to the natural mind it seems unreasonable. That is where
{399}
we need the special support of the Lord to maintain a right attitude with regard to it.
S.McC. So at the beginning of the Acts when the brethren were under the fire of persecution they withdrew into their own company. The appeal went up to the Lord God "who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them" (@Acts 4: 24), and then they say, "look upon their threatenings" (verse 29), appealing to God in that light.
J.T. They address Him as 'despot' (@Acts 4: 28 - 31), and request, "give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal". That is the kind of warfare; that is how the matter is met; and it is to mark our position -- we have to hold to our heavenly status before God. And yet we cannot ignore this material matter, because it belongs to God's government among the nations. The four monarchies of Daniel relate to the government of the world, but having God's testimony in view, including the assembly. He is Lord of heaven and earth and is operating with these things to make way for the testimony. Well, if any elements are contending for what is right, I am with their efforts in my prayers, because God is using them to keep ways open for His testimony; not in any national sense, but for the sake of the testimony of God universally. As we see that, we shall be on the side of God in His governmental dealings.
J.S. We should also become more acquainted with our weapons.
J.T. Yes, the weapons of our warfare; we are having part in what is wider than current international issues. God is the Lord of heaven and earth (@Matthew 11: 25). We are to be with God in what He is doing, and in prayer for those He may use, although they may not be christians. Nebuchadnezzar is called God's servant, and Cyrus; so today
{400}
certain governments are serving God; to a point we are with that. God is using them.
C.H.H. Would our spiritual armour and weapons be, "the shield of faith", "breastplate of righteousness", "sword of the Spirit" (@Ephesians 6: 14 - 17)?
J.T. That is right; the whole armour of God. Ephesians is on that wide platform. "God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all" (@Ephesians 4: 6). He is operating in us, and @Ephesians 6: 11 - 13 tells us we are to take the whole armour of God. Then we are to persevere in prayer (verse 18).
J.S. God's government being for us is evidenced in our being able to hold these meetings.
J.T. I believe the brethren are praying for the authorities more than ever. We must recognise that it is not an illegal thing for these authorities to have a sword, but it is for us. *Our* sword is the "sword of the Spirit, which is God's word" (@Ephesians 6: 17).
W.B-w. Solomon called for a sword, recognising the idea, but he used wisdom instead.
S.P. I suppose there was a sword in the hands of Aretas, @2 Corinthians 11: 32, 33: "In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up, wishing to take me; and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands".
J.T. It would be used *against* the testimony. The Jews used their skill (@Acts 9: 23), and then the brethren used their skill that Paul might escape; they did not use a literal sword, they used their prayers, and so they defeated the enemy. Paul escapes, not only through prayers, but they let him down through a window in a basket. They must have taken counsel as to the basket. "Through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands". That shows we must be simple
{401}
and practical in what we are doing, and not governed by mere legal thoughts.
A.N.W. They would have to work together mutually.
J.T. It all brings out our position, as belonging to the heavenly army of God. One thing is going through, that is the testimony of God. Other things are subservient. These four monarchies are only appointed in view of the testimony; they belong to God. In @Zechariah 6: 5 there are mentioned "the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth".
C.H.H. Are we entitled to regard all men in the light of @Proverbs 8: 31? Wisdom says, "my delights were with the sons of men". Could we regard all these men as God's creatures, and on that ground, God having delight in them?
J.T. It would be only in an abstract sense. "Sons of men" would be a figurative form of speech to convey the pleasing character of manhood as in the relation of *sonship*. I believe christians are in mind, it is the idea of sonship; not men in their present state, but men in the abstract, as according to God. Adam is the idea of man made in God's image. Christ is the Son of man. There is the idea of a primary thought developed in sonship. Certain divine thoughts must come out on the principle of generation, not only creation. Adam was made a living soul by the breath of God; he was of God. All is worked out from that.
A.P.T. Does not Paul's position in @Acts 16 show now he was affected by the two governments? God's government operating in the Roman jail to restrain evil; Paul himself is there, and God's kingdom is in operation concurrently, and God triumphs.
J.T. Paul identifies himself with all in the prison: "we are all here" (@Acts 16: 28). He takes account of them in a different way from mere criminals. The
{402}
prisoners had been *listening* to the service of God; that is credited to them. "We are all here", is very remarkable.
J.S. I suppose the apostle in that way would act as God's servant to the jailer.
J.T. The jail was turned into His temple! What a complete revolution it was! The jail was a temple for the time being where there was prayer, praise, the gospel; and there was a Bible reading in the jailer's house -- all is stated in a few verses.
Now in @Acts 14: 15 - 17 the apostle says to the people who would have offered sacrifices to him and Barnabas, "Men, why do ye these things? *We* also are men of like passions with you, preaching to you to turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them; who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go in their own ways, though indeed he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness". Paul speaks of the creation, but as directly beneficial to man. Men as such, give way to their passions. God suffered all that, "suffered all the nations to go in their own ways, though indeed he did not leave himself without witness, doing good and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness". God says, I gave you that meal. This testimony brought in here is remarkable. They were going to use the creatures of God for idolatrous purposes, to turn the service of God into idolatry. This is creation's testimony to support the gospel.
A.R. Moses speaks of idolatry. "The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to sport" (@Exodus 32: 6), and in the days of Noah we have the same thing (@Matthew 24: 38).
{403}
J.T. They enjoyed the creatures of God and left Him out. Do I give thanks to God for my dinner? It is not wrong to *enjoy* it, your heart is filled "with food and gladness;" but if I go beyond that to what is idolatrous that is another matter. Paul brings in this testimony as applying to everyone, good and bad.
E.P. In the end of @Acts 2 "they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people".
J.T. That is christianity, that is how the christian takes up the benefits of God in creation.
E.P. In @Acts 4: 32, following the threatenings, "not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own". They sold their possessions and laid the price at the apostles¬ feet.
J.T. Christians are brought constitutionally into accord with God. I may be naturally glad of a good meal, but if I say I will give another man that meal, or half of it, because he needs it as well as I, I become like God.
E.P. "The whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now" (@Romans 8: 22). The thought of *feeling* enters into that, and it works in our hearts sympathetically.
C.H.H. Peter says to the man in @Acts 3: 6, "what I have, this give I to thee".
W.G.T. While we are looking for the coming of the Lord, we should take account of the longsuffering of God at the same time.
J.T. Yes. We have to balance ourselves. We are to be like God. We should be longsuffering. We say, We would like the Lord to come, because the pressure is very great, but millions of men may be left out if He comes today. If He had come fifty years ago how many of us would have, been left out? We should consider our fellow men.
{404}
J.V. God is behind everything. "Who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go in their own ways". Then in @Acts 17: 26, 27, "having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling, that they may seek God".
J.T. That is very touching. That is, God has restricted men that they might seek Him. So the division of the race in Genesis 11 implies what are called national boundaries. He set bounds. "Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth" (@Genesis 11: 8). That might seem as though He let them go out indiscriminately to do as they liked. As you travel about the Pacific you wonder how the people got into the many islands. How did the aborigines get into Australia? God set the bounds of their habitations, He did not let them go on as they wished. God has not lost sight of men. The nations are the consequence of God having to do with men. The blessing of Abraham has arrived at the nations, but in the limitations in which God has set men. National boundaries curb aggression and tend to preserve order. They should be preserved, because they preserve order and make way for the gospel. It is remarkable how the western nations opened up for the gospel.
E.P. Do you think boundaries such as oceans and mountains would remind man that he is not up against man simply, but up against God?
J.T. Boundaries, climatic and other conditions, have tended to distinguish certain groups from each other. If all were alike, spoke the same language, and had the same pursuits, you would have more rapid development of sin, but the dividing of the nations has tended to weaken the power of Satan; government also has weakened the power of Satan. We perhaps do not think of these matters. The book of Genesis shows how God foresaw the necessity for these limitations. He had Abraham in view,
{405}
"in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed" (@Genesis 12: 3). That would change the patriarch's mind about men generally. Genesis shows how God ordered things for us so that the gospel should have free course. "That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations" (@Galatians 3: 14).
J.S. That is God's governmental control.
J.T. That has not ceased. He is dealing with current conditions today on this principle.
H.H. In @Deuteronomy 32: 8 "He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel".
{406}
2. RELATIONS IN WHICH GOD IS KNOWN - GOD KNOWN IN CHRIST
@John 14: 7 - 11; @2 Corinthians 5: 18, 19
J.T. Our subject now is God known in Christ. This morning it was God known in creation. He not only created the wonderful system of material things, but operates it; vegetable life, human life, and I suppose we may add angelic life. He operates in all, so that He not only places latent power in the soil to cause vegetable life, but He gives, we are told, to the grain of wheat a body as He has pleased (@1 Corinthians 15: 38).
S.P. You are using the word operate in a wider sense than man uses it.
J.T. It is wider, and the operation of the universe is an immense thought. God "operates all things in all" (@1 Corinthians 12: 6), referring no doubt, to His work in the ministry, but the principle also applies to the universe; coming down to the grain of wheat sown in the earth. There are two thoughts; latently there is power in the earth to produce vegetable life, but then God is actually operating. He gives it a body "as he has pleased". We are told that He caused a gourd to grow to shelter Jonah at Nineveh, and caused a worm to smite it, bringing in animal life to destroy vegetable life. So that He creates good and evil in that sense. It brings the thought of God near to us; most of us think very little of this side of the truth, how God is operating all around us and in ourselves; "in him we live and move and exist" (@Acts 17: 28). It is a present operation, and those of us who have taken it into account prove that God is near to us in a physical way; really performing miracles, although they are not obvious to most. He enables us to do what we could not do if left to ourselves.
{407}
J.S. Does God create evil for the showing forth of His power?
J.T. Yes, evil in the sense of one thing against another, like the worm destroying the gourd. They have to do with God's discipline. He uses many things in creation and in our own bodies to affect us in a disciplinary way. On the other hand He uses His creation to help us physically. If we are ill, the point is that God Himself is doing it, it is not mere nature, it is God Himself. It brings God very near to us in our everyday life, in food, clothing and shelter. We are with God and He is with us. Our subject this afternoon is to see how He was in Christ. The Lord says, "He that has seen me has seen the Father" (@John 14: 9).
C.H.H. Would the word, "ye believe on God" indicate a state that would be initial to what He is about to unfold?
J.T. Quite so. He had become the object of faith. It is *on* Him, not *in* Him; both prepositions are used. "On" is that God has become, in a general sense, the object of faith to believers. The Lord is urging us to believe on Himself, in the same sense.
A.R. There is that in creation that calls attention to God, but God has come out in a Man.
J.T. Yes. "He that has seen me has seen the Father". It is a very wonderful statement. The Lord stresses it by saying, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou has not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father?" @John 14: 9. So that in Jesus here below the Father was seen. It is now not simply what is in creation, although that stands, but there is now the revelation of God in Christ; it is what God is in love. The Lord is setting out what is *seen*. "He that has seen me". "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son,
{408}
who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him" (@John 1: 18). That is the other side of the matter. The declaration is general, but here it is what is to be seen in Jesus.
Rem. He is "the expression of his substance" (@Hebrews 1: 3). Is that to be seen?
J.T. The expression is there even if you do not see it. The point the Lord is making here in John is that he that has seen Him has seen the Father. It is what *you see*. The Lord would appeal to us as to what we have seen.
H.H. That is distinct from God being made known in the death of Christ. This is the life of Christ.
J.T. It is a question of what the Father is. There is that in the death of Christ which enters into it, but this is what the Father is here below, known in a living Person.
A.N.W. "The only-begotten Son ... hath declared". How does that differ from what may be seen?
J.T. Declaration is *by* the Son -- more active. Here it is "He that hath seen me". The declaration is active -- a bringing out. According to chapter 14 the Father was there -- to be seen in the Son; in His everyday life and ways -- what He was doing and saying; all, we may say, was the Father.
H.H. Would it refer also to unbelievers? The Lord says to the Pharisees, "they have both seen and hated both me and my Father" (@John 15: 24).
J.T. The Lord says, "seen and hated both me and my Father". This, of course, constituted them sinners. The Father and the Son were before their eyes. What a testimony!
Ques. What would be the outcome in my heart if I see Him as spoken of here?
J.T. That result was portrayed in the apostles and others; they were drawn to Him and He challenged
{409}
them (@John 6: 67 - 69). They were attracted to Him and would not leave Him. What attracted them was the Father too. Their love was begotten by the attractiveness both of the Father and the Son. It has a dual effect, what the Father is to us, and what the Son is to us. "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father". In the believer the converse is true. We believe and love the Father and the Son.
W.W. He who honours the Son, honours the Father also.
A.P.T. The Lord says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?" (@John 21: 5).
J.T. That is what the Lord Jesus was personally; that is not the Father. The Lord is father in the sense of exercising fatherly care. According to @Isaiah 9: 6 He is the "Father of Eternity". It does not mean the Father in Him, but that He Himself exercises fatherly care in the millennial age. There was fatherly affection for the disciples. It was seen in a lesser degree in Paul and John. In any elder there ought to be fatherly affections. That would not be *the* Father, but rather your own affection for the saints, for those that may be younger. So that when He says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?" that is the Lord Himself taking up a fatherly attitude towards them. At Emmaus He took the house-father's place, (see J.N.D.¬s note to @Luke 24: 30). He would always do that amongst the disciples.
A.R. Would 'Father of the age' (note in New Translation to @Isaiah 9: 6) be more what is seen publicly, whereas "the Father" in John relates to the family or what is inside?
J.T. Father is a family thought, only the Lord is bringing out here that the qualities of the Father had been brought within the range of the disciples, and were seen in Him.
{410}
A.B. Would "I will not leave you orphans" (@John 14: 18), bear upon that?
J.T. That is Christ exercising fatherly qualities. That is not the Father as we are speaking of Him here. "There is one God, the Father" (@1 Corinthians 8: 6). His qualities were seen in the Lord Jesus here below.
Ques. Is this an advance on @John 9: 35 - 38? The thought of belief comes in there and also seeing.
J.T. In John 9 it is a question of the Son. "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" Have you found Him and placed your faith in Him? Is He a definite Object for your faith? "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" He is not questioning that the Son of God should be an object of faith. He says, "Who is he?" The Lord says, "Thou hast ... seen him". The Lord would in such circumstances direct us back to incidents in which we have had to do with Him. This is needful if we are to progress in the knowledge of Himself. No incident in relation to Him is to be allowed to slip. They are all of value. Although it is not stated earlier that the man saw Him when he came back from the pool, he does not question the Lord's remark that he had seen Him. What was transpiring now must be connected with what had happened at Siloam. The man had been speaking about the Lord to the neighbours and the Jews. All this comes into the question the Lord raised with him; it would bring up the whole matter in the man's mind. He says, "I believe, Lord". The Lord gives us to accumulate our history; in our relations with Him, nothing is to be forgotten.
S.McC. "He that has seen me has seen the Father". Is that stronger than representation?
J.T. It is that the Father was actually there. Of course, God is in christians. In a sense we should always be representatives of God, but believers cannot say that one who has seen them has
{411}
seen the Father; no one but the Son could say that. It is not only that the Father was in Christ in a general sense, and in all the details of His life. The Father was in Him in a personal sense.
H.H. "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?" @John 14: 10.
J.T. The Lord goes on to say, "The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself; but the Father who abides in me, he does the works".
H.H. It is very interesting to note the word in italics in verse 11 -- "Believe *me*" -- it is emphatic.
J.T. "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father". The Father Himself was there. "In me" (verse 11), implies that He is a Person great enough for the Father to be in Him. They are equal; the passage teaches His equality with the Father and that the Father was abiding in Him.
McK. Is that seen in @John 10: 30 where the Lord says, "I and the Father are one"?
J.T. That would be more *unity*. They are not one in the sense we are speaking of now. Oneness is unity. Here they are viewed as two Persons, One in the Other; the Father actually there. There is no suggestion of what is Unitarian; that there is only one divine Person, and the Father is one phase, and the Son another phase. That is bad doctrine. There are three Persons in the Deity. "God is one" (@1 Timothy 2: 5), does not mean there is only one Being; there are three Beings, who are in infinite unity. In John 14 the Lord is saying that the Father Himself is actually here: He and I are so thoroughly alike that you see Him in Me. There are three Persons. Bad doctrine that has come down for centuries says, that there is only one Person in the Deity in three phases, The Lord says there
{412}
are two Persons here before them, Himself and the Father.
J.S. What is set forth in the Person of the Son is seen here, and then the works He is doing. Would the declaration be bound up with that?
J.T. Yes, it is. "Declaration" is a word by itself, it refers to what was *brought out*. It is something He has done. It is not only what you see, but what you hear, that enters into the declaration. There is declaration and then the revelation. The revelation is the veil removed so that you can look at what is there. Declaration is something brought out universally. I may not see it clearly, but it is there; it is a fixed thing in the power of the Spirit. God is there. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him]". The whole Deity is involved in the statement; "him" is not there in the original. It is left open. *God* is declared.
J.S. "No one has seen God at any time". It is a statement of fact.
J.T. Manifestation is what can be seen. That is what we are speaking of. "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit" (@1 Timothy 3: 16). Manifestation was corroborated, or confirmed by the Spirit; and then, "has appeared to angels, ... has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory". Seeing and manifestation go together.
J.S. "Appeared to angels" would be in manhood here.
A.R. For what reason does the Lord Jesus say, "He that has seen me has seen the Father"?
J.T. It is to bring the reality of it home to Philip's mind. They were so shallow. How unobservant we are in meetings, and how little we take in! The Lord says, "I go to prepare you a place ... and ye know the way". Did they know? "Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou goest,
{413}
and how can we know the way?" Thomas had not been taking in what was before his eyes, yet he had been with the Lord a long time. Then "Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me". Had they discerned that they had come to the Father in the Lord's movements, in what they had been seeing and hearing? The Lord goes on to say, "If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father, and henceforth ye know him and have seen him". That is, you have had Me here all these months and years and you have not been naming what you saw. Why did they not ask the Lord long before, Lord, what is this? The Lord would have told them that it was the Father they could see. Now, the Spirit of God is here, and there are things that are the proof of it. How many of us observe them?
C.A.M. The expression, 'Thy death hath brought to light the Father's heart', is contrary to this thought.
J.T. We did not think it right to include that hymn in the new book, because the Father's heart was brought to light before Christ's death, when the Father said of the Lord Jesus, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".
W.G.T. God reconciling the world through Christ required the cross.
J.T. It did. We shall come to that in considering the divine economy. The Father is another matter. It is a question of that Person and how He had an abiding place here in another Person. Who could this Person be but One equal with Himself?
H.H. Does not divine love enter into what you are saying as to the Father and the Son?
J.T. Quite so. The Lord Jesus moved in and out amongst the disciples. The Father was here -- not
{414}
simply in heaven as in Matthew, but here in Him to be seen.
A.N.W. Do you mean that as we watch the Lord, we are to distinguish between what might be called the features of the Son and what might be called the features of the Father?
J.T. There were the features of the Son, filial features in Christ. That would not be the Father, but nevertheless "He that has seen me has seen the Father".
W.B-w. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth" (@John 1: 14). Thomas and Philip did not enter into that.
J.T. Clearly not. Although that is another matter; "an only-begotten with a father", -- two in relation with one Another as distinct Persons. That, I should say, would be wholly spiritual. No one could see the Father in a literal or separate personal sense. He is a Spirit, and to see the Son *with* the Father required spiritual intuition; it is an intensely spiritual statement. "(And we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth". This is not what we have been speaking of, the Father seen *in* the Son. He is actually here, within the range of the disciples, not seen in His essential Being, but in the Son. This is what He is as seen in the qualities blended in the Person of the Son, in this way He is perfectly expressed.
S.McC. Is there something distinctive about this that does not come into the present moment, unique to the Lord's presence corporeally in the world, the Father being in Him in that way? Is there a difference now that He has gone on high?
J.T. Yes. The Lord Jesus will never be here again as He was then. What has come out remains;
{415}
the Father has been actually seen in the Son. It is not going on now, but the fact remains, and the Holy Spirit makes it good to us. We thus are to understand the qualities of the Father.
S.McC. In glory shall we see the Father in the same way as He was seen in Christ here, as referred to in the scriptures before us?
J.T. Yes, only what came out in Christ here was in a contrary scene; in heaven all is perfect. But there is no other way to see the Father save in the Son. There is infinitude, truly beyond the creature, so that we are shut up to what is in Christ, and yet we know there are three Persons.
J.W. How do you understand verse 20: "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you"?
J.T. That is a question of affections. That is, that He is in the Father's affections, and we are in His affections, and He is in our affections. We know it now because the Holy Spirit is here; the Spirit would enable us to understand these thoughts.
A.R. Looking at one Person we see three Persons.
J.T. You are always conscious that there are Three. Of course you must always keep the Deity before you. We shall come to that in the economy. The Lord is here instructing His disciples that the Father was there before their eyes.
J.R.H. I am "the truth" (verse 6); He Himself is the very thing. "He that has seen me has seen the Father".
J.T. "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me". You are conscious that He has brought you to the Father. On the other hand, He says, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" (@John 6: 44). You are conscious of having to do with three Persons.
{416}
J.R.H. Liberating and putting our spirits at rest in the presence of the Father.
J.T. Yes. We know the three Persons. We are baptised to the Name of the three Persons, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
C.H.H. What is the meaning of "fulness". "In him all the fulness ... was pleased to dwell"? @Colossians 1: 19.
J.T. It conveys the thought of the Deity, as in @Hebrews 1: 3 the word "greatness" involves Deity.
S.McC. What has the Lord in mind when He says, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?" (@John 14: 10).
J.T. The basis of all that is affection; affection operating in divine Persons. The Son in the Father and the Father in the Son. There was nothing to interfere with, or modify that; either in Him, or in the Father. It all shows the infinite perfection of the Persons, and the love in unity that is operating. We are dealing with the greatest things, all hinging on the infinite perfection and unity of divine Persons. It would be very difficult to find any correspondence in creation. However much two persons may love each other, there would be some discrepancy, so that the one person is not in the other in fulness of satisfaction, there is some discrepancy in wife or husband, but not in divine Persons. Infinite love is always there.
S.McC. You have said elsewhere the Father remains in the inscrutableness of the Deity. How does that fit in with this thought?
J.T. It would not alter it at all. He remains there in personal distinctness. Divine Persons are always Themselves; the Son in manhood is Himself, the Father in Deity is Himself; They are in each Other. There is no discrepancy. There is infinite affection operating in the two Persons. It is wonderful
{417}
that all that is within the compass of a Man, and that Man known familiarly as among the disciples here. The more you think of it the more affected you will be.
H.H. Inscrutability is referred to in @Matthew 11: 27. "No one knows the Son but the Father, nor does anyone know the Father, but the Son".
J.T. Quite so. The Son is the Revealer of the Father, but the point in John 14 is to bring out that the Father was there.
W.G.T. Does the first part of @John 14: 10 signify His equality in Deity, and the latter part His relative position as Son in subjection?
J.T. That is right; in the latter relation the Father is doing the works in Him. We ought to seek, in restfulness before divine Persons, to see something of the infiniteness of affection, and equality, and of love operating which enables us to see that They are in each Other without discrepancy at all. The Son was here as Revealer, and the Father was seen there, so that He says, "He that has seen me has seen the Father".
E.P. Divine Persons have affection between Themselves.
J.T. The three Persons love each Other. Surely that is a cardinal truth, and They are equal. Any One of the Persons is equal to the Other, viewed abstractly, and in their operations all is in infinite love.
John 13 to 17 would all enter into the moments before His death, and He prolongs what He has to say, because He wants them to know the Father. The Father is uppermost in His mind, and He is bringing the disciples into the knowledge of the Father. We have to apprehend what the Father is. He is there in that Person, the One sitting down at table and eating with the disciples.
{418}
W.B-w. Would that explain the word operating that you use? I have to understand Him operatively.
J.T. That is the thought. We are to let into our souls the sense of the equality of divine Persons abstractly; the perfection, and infinite love there, as between Themselves; then we shall see how the Son becomes Mediator. The operations are in the Son. John says, "without him not one thing received being". The same thing remains now, the Son is doing things. The Son is the great Operator, but still the Father is brought into what the Son is doing. He says, "the Father who abides in me, he does the works".
W.B-w. "The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself" (verse 10). Is that operative?
J.T. Yes; the Son is operating in speaking. The Father enters into it, as I said. We are always in the presence of the three Persons.
C.H.H. In Acts He charges them by the Holy Spirit, another Person.
A.N.W. The verse quoted from Matthew indicates the Father is revealed, but the Son is not.
C.A.M. Would it be right to say of each of the divine Persons, that they dwell "in unapproachable light" (@1 Timothy 6: 16)?
J.T. Yes, in Their abstract relations. The Son is presented as inscrutable. No one knows Him, but the Father. The Father is revealed, but the fact that God is revealed according to what He is relatively, including fatherhood, does not imply that inscrutability as to Him has ceased, for no one has seen Him, nor can see Him.
S.McC. In @Ephesians 4: 6 "one God and Father of all, who is over all ... and in us all". How is He in us?
{419}
J.T. That really belongs to our next reading, God in the economy into which He has come. However, it may be remarked that the passage treats of the three Persons. "One body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling;" and then "one Lord, one faith, one baptism", another circle, a wider circle to which the lordship of Christ applies; then "one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all". It is God as we have spoken of Him this morning, that is in mind, only it is added that He is in us; in christians.
W.B-w. Would this matter under consideration give us a better understanding of divine Persons, and make us more intelligent in our worship and in our prayer meetings?
J.T. Quite so. A brother wrote to me not long since saying that in some of the meetings he attended the Lord Jesus *only* was addressed in prayer. It is quite clear to me that the Father should have prominence in all our assembly meetings, except the part relating to the Lord's supper. It is the Lord's supper, not the Spirit's or the Father's. It belongs to the Lord. He is the centre of it, but as regards prayer and all other service we should make the Father pre-eminent.
H.H. I was going to ask a question as to the thought of absoluteness. Do you connect that with God only, or would you bring in the Father as well?
J.T. Father is a relative term. All the divine names we have are, I may say, relative. It is a question whether we have any absolute terms, I mean absolute in the sense that they do not convey relations in the Deity with other persons or things.
A.N.W. Immediately we speak of God creating we think of His relation to things.
{420}
C.H.H. In the realm of relationship the Lord Himself says, "my Father is greater than I" (@John 14: 28).
J.T. That is a question of the economy again. The economy implies that one of the divine Persons remains in the form of Deity and represents it, whereas the others take the place of obedience. We are speaking now about the Father in Christ, which touches on the economy, but is not the full thought of it. What was here under human and angelic eyes in the *incarnation*, is our subject now.
"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19), touches on the economy too, but we shall benefit by just keeping to what was here in incarnation before the cross. It involved the cross, but Paul says that he received the ministry of reconciliation: "how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself". I thought we would benefit by confining our remarks to how the Father was in Christ here below, as in John 14.
S.McC. "All things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself" (@2 Corinthians 5: 18). Does that contemplate the present economy?
J.T. It does. The thought there is to stress that new creation is by the God who has reconciled us. Then we have how He was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ. It is not, God *is* in Christ but *was* in Christ, "how that God was in Christ, reconciling". I think we would profit by confining our remarks to this historic fact, how that the Father was in that Person, and in Him was reconciling the world. John 14 does not say that, but it runs into it. Paul's reference in @2 Corinthians 5: 17 is more Luke than John. Luke had Paul in mind when he wrote his gospel. We are dealing with what is historic, "how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world". In John 14 the Lord is telling the disciples that the Father is in Him, but Paul says He has "given to us
{421}
the ministry of that reconciliation: how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself". Luke would tell us that the incarnation meant that God was here reconciling the world, that is, He was here telling the universe that He was delighting in a Man, and He wanted every man to be like Him. He was providing the means of this, too -- the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
J.R.H. Would you say He was laying the great moral basis for the new creation?
J.T. Quite so. Think of this great fact. God was in Christ reconciling the world. It is the incarnation that is in mind. It all hinges on the fact of the incarnation, a Man here delightful to God and God present to bring all into that -- through redemption.
S.McC. In @Luke 7: 16 they say, "God has visited his people" and in @chapter 9: 43, after He comes down from the mount, they were "astonished at the glorious greatness of God".
J.T. That is what Luke stresses. In Luke 7, as you mentioned, we get the thing stated in beautiful detail. The point is that God was reconciling the world to Himself. The Lord was invited into the Pharisee's house, and He sat down to eat, and the woman came in. Now, if we follow I think we shall grasp what is in mind. It was a question of what kind of woman was there; and the kind of person Simon was. The Lord says, "Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee ... . There were two debtors of a certain creditor: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty; but as they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them"(@Luke 7: 40 - 42).
That is what the apostle says here, "not reckoning to them their offences" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19). God was in Christ. The woman came to see that Jesus had brought the active grace of God to her. She washed His feet with tears, wiped them with the hairs of
{422}
her head, she anointed His feet with myrrh; in principle she is reconciled. That is the divine idea. She is taking on what is in that Person at the table; what is spread out to the whole universe. God has found an outlet in Christ. He is in Him "reconciling the world to himself". We are to take on what is in Christ. God will be satisfied with nothing less. Paul says, "putting in us the word of that reconciliation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19). It is a question of getting people to value Christ, what was in Christ as Man under God's eye. God is proposing to bring the world to that. Simon was utterly out of accord with it.
J.S. @John 3: 17 agrees perfectly with that, "that the world may be saved through him".
J.T. Quite so. That is the love side, but here it is the Person, the Man under God's eye. God says, He pleases Me, I am going to bring the whole universe into that. It is an historic fact. God was in Christ to bring all that about.
Rem. "The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself; but the Father who abides in me, he does the works" (@John 14: 10), would be in line with Luke.
J.T. Quite so. When He stood up in the synagogue in Nazareth all were pleased with the words He spoke. If you were there you would like to be like Him and speak like Him. God says, that is what I want. I am in Christ to bring that about.
W.G.T. Paul too is being used to bring in reconciliation.
J.T. You do get that. Paul is speaking about his own ministry, which he was then exercising, but he speaks in the past tense as calling attention to God being in Christ reconciling the world to Himself. This refers to the Lord here in the flesh. But Paul goes on to say, "and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 18). Reconciliation
{423}
was there before, but it is now made clear by Paul's ministry.
A.H.P. It is not exactly *by* Him, but *in* Him, in the Lord personally.
J.T. You have both; in dealing with this truth there are two prepositions in the passage. "Who has reconciled us to himself *by* Jesus Christ" (verse 18), that is instrumentality, but in verse 19, it is "how that God was in Christ". That is God is in *that position* -- in Christ -- doing the reconciling Himself.
S.McC. What particularly have you in mind in stressing what is historical?
J.T. Well, it is to bring out the incarnation, with redemption in view. The nucleus of all ministry is there. What God found in a Man here, and all ministry is to bring that about in us.
A.R. I suppose Mary represents it, she was sitting at the feet of the Lord Jesus listening to His word (@Luke 10: 39). Then we have the man sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right mind (@Luke 8: 35).
J.T. Yes; they would illustrate what we are speaking of. Luke 7 is most important because of the non-imputation of trespasses. Simon's sins were not imputed, "he forgave both of them" (@Luke 7: 42). Then you would say, they are both forgiven, but are they? We must have *state* as well as objective truth. The woman represents the state. Who comes into the benefit of that? Only those in whom God wrought. That is, we *must* have faith.
J.S. The Lord compelled Simon to make a statement of fact against himself.
J.T. The final word is faith. The difference in regard of what we are saying between an unconverted man and myself is, that he has not faith, but I have, therefore forgiveness is mine, but not his. You must have faith for forgiveness. God would
{424}
say, I have nothing in mind for you but Christ. This is My Son, I want you to be like Him. But this necessitated His death, hence it is said, "we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son" (@Romans 5: 10).
W.B-w. The passage, "God was in Christ, reconciling" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19), is said to refer to His life, before His death.
J.T. You must have His death for the ministry, but historically *God* was there doing this thing. That is the basic thought, what *God* was doing then. Let us make all we can of the incarnation, of the three and a half years of testimony before the cross. Paul is telling the Corinthians, This is the ministry I have carried on amongst you and others. How God *was* in Christ reconciling the world, not how God *is*. As already said, there could not be reconciliation without Christ's death. Paul was fitted of God to bring it out in its fulness, but the truth of reconciliation was included in the ministry of Christ.
J.W. "Jesus the Nazaraean, a man borne witness to by God to you by works of power and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him in your midst" (@Acts 2: 22). That is a reference to the years of His ministry.
J.T. Luke shows that Paul's ministry was confirmed basically in Christ in His ministry here.
J.R.H. Paul says "putting in us the word of that reconciliation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19). What does he mean?
J.T. You have two things there; the ministry of reconciliation and the *word* of it. The word of reconciliation, opens it up to you. You do not get it fully in the gospels. The gospels confirm the opening up of the truth in Paul's ministry. The "word" refers to what Paul *said* and how he said it. This is seen in the epistle to the Romans especially, but also in 2 Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians. Paul has about twenty salutations in his letter to the
{425}
Romans. Why does he salute so many people there? He would show the kind of people God is pleased with.
W.B-w. He speaks of reconciliation in @Romans 11: 15, -- the world's reconciliation. Does Paul use the word reconciliation in a different sense there?
J.T. It is applied to the world there only in a provisional way. God is not condemning them *now*, not charging them with offences. That is the idea of reconciliation, and that is the attitude of God toward the world now. The world in a gentile sense is in mind. The world is not yet under judgment. God's attitude toward it is grace.
J.W. There was a movement from Jerusalem to Antioch. The disciples were first called christians at Antioch.
J.T. The word *christians* gives the idea that God was making headway there. They are like Christ. The word is oracular. It is God's mind that they should be *called* that. The crowd had been listening for a whole year to Paul and Barnabas in the assembly, @Acts 11: 26.
{426}
3. RELATIONS IN WHICH GOD IS KNOWN - GOD KNOWN IN THE ECONOMY INTO WHICH HE HAS COME IN CHRIST
@Matthew 28: 18 - 20; @John 3: 35, 36; @John 4: 10 - 30; @John 20: 19 - 23
J.T. The object in view in having these four scriptures read is to bring out certain features of this sub-division of our general subject; the first having to do with the economy formally, "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". It is connected with *authority*, the Lord saying, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", and "teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you". Then in John, the subject is connected with *love*, the Father's love for the Son. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35). In John 20, the subject is linked up with *ascension*, God known in the economy in *family* relationships. The Lord had sent the message to the disciples as to these relationships, saying, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17). He sent this message to His disciples as His *brethren*.
Our first reading had God known in creation as a subject, which enabled us to cover a wide field, which has, I believe, a very practical bearing. God known in Christ, and God known in the economy into which He has come, do not abrogate what He is in creation; this stands, and it enters into our physical life here below. We considered God in Christ from John 14 and 2 Corinthians 5, which bring out the wonderful ministry of Christ, the three and a half years. Daniel's prayer in chapter 9 of his book, moved heaven so that the angel Gabriel came to him and told him that he was "greatly beloved", and also to tell him that seventy weeks were determined
{427}
upon his people, upon his city, to make an end of sin and bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to anoint the holy of holies. Those seventy weeks were divided into seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, making sixty-nine weeks, "unto Messiah, the Prince;" leaving one week to follow, but after the sixty-nine weeks the Messiah should be cut off and have nothing. Into the first half of this week enters Christ's wonderful ministry. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself;" the most wonderful three and a half years in the history of all time, when Jesus was under God's eye here in manhood; God was in Him reconciling the world unto Himself. There must be a standard for God, and Christ as Man was the standard, all to be brought into correspondence with Him. Paul alludes to that three and a half years of Christ's ministry in saying that he had received the ministry of reconciliation, and the word of it too, "how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19). The doctrine of it comes out in Paul's ministry and the results of it too, as we see in the many salutations that Paul sent in his letters; how many were brought into correspondence with Christ through his gospel.
The present part of our subject is God in the economy which He has set up, involving the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The believer is brought into this as we see in John 4, and in John 20 the disciples are linked up with Christ in ascension in this economy.
W.G.T. Will you amplify the word *economy*.
J.T. It alludes to God's administration in His house. The word carries that force. In English it is any administrative system. It carries an administrative thought. We are baptised "to the name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". Baptism introduces us into the realm of divine revelation,
{428}
the revelation of three Persons in the Godhead, two of Them subservient to the Father. The first thing is to see how divine Persons have come into this economy before we come into it.
W.G.T. Would the scene at the Jordan refer to the economy, the Spirit descending upon Christ as a dove, and the Father expressing His love?
J.T. Yes. John's baptism opened up the way for the introduction of Christ, and attention was called to Him. Heaven was not opened to Him as He was born, nor at twelve years of age, although expressly referred to then, but as He identified Himself with the movement Godward at Jordan; heaven then recognised Him and said, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Luke 3: 22). That is, heaven acknowledged Christ, who had been here for thirty years, as the Father's Son. We know it is the Father's voice by the fact that it said, "*Thou* art my beloved Son". It does not say that the Father said that, but no other voice could have said it but the Father's. Hence, we have the one Person of the Trinity owned from heaven, not only as the Son, but as One in whom delight had been found, alluding to what He was as Man here in private life for thirty years. That introduces the Son, and the Holy Spirit comes upon Him. We have thus the three Persons of the Trinity in evidence there. It is not to bring out the conditions of absolute Deity, but that God had come into this economy in relation to a movement there in John's baptism in which the Lord Jesus took part; heaven owned Him as there, and the Holy Spirit came upon Him. So we have manifested the three Persons of the Deity, but henceforth in active service in grace; that is the position, and then came the three and a half years of ministry, then the death and resurrection as seen in this chapter, @Matthew 28. Resurrection is found in this chapter in a very striking way. We have also here, as already said, the
{429}
baptismal formula -- "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". That is christianity; the economy into which we come as brought under authority. Authority is what Christ enjoins in this passage.
J.S. Is that in keeping with @1 Corinthians 10:2? "And all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea".
J.T. That is the same thought; only that economy was, properly, set up at Sinai.
W.B-w. When Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins" (@Acts 2: 38), did not that open the door for each one to come into the economy? Were Peter, James, John and the other apostles in the economy before Peter preached?
J.T. I would say they were. They had been appointed and sent. Christ sent them out to preach. We shall see later that the economy in which they were is that of John 20, inclusive of the other features. There it is related to the ascension of Christ. He ascended to the Father, and left His disciples here below. Having the status of His brethren, He sends them as His Father had sent Him. It has a bearing on these last days. He commits authority to them, either to remit, or retain sins, which I think would fit in with our own times, when christians need so much forgiveness. All man's religious institutions involve sin, there is lawlessness attached to every human religious organisation, so that christians coming out of them require forgiveness. The Lord commits authority to His disciples, to remit, or retain sins. It is not the same as the ministry of reconciliation to the world, it is more limited. We can see the general need of forgiveness in regard of man's will working in the profession of christianity. Where there is organised disregard of
{430}
His commandments there can be no just claim to love for Him (@John 14: 21).
H.H. Would the Spirit of Christ bear on what you are saying?
J.T. Yes. "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" (@John 20: 22). It is intimacy and love all through John. What we are speaking of now is a love matter. It is specially so now as the saints¬ relation to Christ is that of brethren, and to God, that of sons. "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17).
H.H. I would like to draw attention to the footnote to @Colossians 1: 25 in the New Translation. 'Or', economy, 'as' administration 'in @1 Corinthians 9: 17; @Ephesians 1: 10; @Ephesians 3: 2, 9;' dispensation, '@1 Timothy 1: 4; and' stewardship, '@Luke 16: 2 - 4'. So that we are not using a word that is outside the range of Scripture.
J.T. The word 'economy' is right as in the connection we have used it. It began as Christ was owned from heaven as the Son, by the Father letting everyone know He had found delight in that Person. Then the Holy Spirit comes upon Him, not as it comes on christians, but as a dove, descending in a *bodily* form. The Spirit was given without measure to that Person. Hence the operations are in "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".
S.McC. How would the formula used by Paul, in @Acts 19: 5, stand in relation to the one the Lord introduces in Matthew 28? It is "baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus".
J.T. We may add the words used by Peter in @Acts 2: 38, "in the name of Jesus Christ;" and in Acts 10: 48, "in the name of the Lord;" then in Acts 19, "they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus".
{431}
We have three prepositions used. In chapter 2, it implies that Jesus Christ is the object, and that faith and confidence is in Him. In chapter 10 it is a preposition of power, I am baptised in a name that carries power with it, and I am covered as it were. Whereas in chapter 19 and in Matthew 28, it is a preposition of movement, that is, I am baptised towards something, to the name "of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".
This matter of the preposition, I think we ought to bear in mind, because in Matthew 28 the Lord is telling the disciples to *make* disciples; a very remarkable feature that runs through Matthew; for christianity carries authority with it, not only the authority of commission, but power to effect things. So that the Lord says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations". Christ *was* what God intended men to become, and the apostles were themselves to be what the nations were to become, that is, *disciples*. In preaching the gospel or serving the saints, I must be the thing I intend them to be. If I have taken on the character of Christ, I want them to take on the character of Christ. So Paul says, "Be my imitators, even as I also am of Christ" (@1 Corinthians 11: 1). He was what he intended them to be. We can see at once that christendom is not that, it is not a reproduction of Christ, or the apostles; it is spurious. So the word *make* here is to be noticed. With what power He invested the apostles, so that they should make disciples of all nations!
A.P.T. Do Acts 8, 9 and 10 show the working out of the economy? Chapter 8 is the eunuch, the African; chapter 9 is Saul, the Jew; chapter 10 is Cornelius, the gentile -- Shem, Ham and Japheth.
J.T. If you put those three men together, the eunuch sent on his way rejoicing, Saul possessing the Holy Spirit in chapter 9, and then Cornelius,
{432}
you have the idea that is in the divine mind, of bringing men into accord with Christ; making them disciples.
A.B. God is referred to in Job as Maker. Throughout Matthew's gospel, the Lord is making, and at the end of it He commits to the disciples the service of making.
J.T. Yes. The idea of *creation* is prominent in Genesis 1, and the idea of *making* in Genesis 2. Adam is created in Genesis 1, but made in Genesis 2. God "formed" him and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, having ornamentation and correspondence generally with Himself in mind. Matthew carries down that thought. The Lord said to Peter, "I will make you fishers of men" (@Matthew 4: 19). When you come to the last chapter, making is still in mind. The order is given to them, "make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".
S.McC. In connection with the formula, would you baptise now "to the name of the Lord Jesus"?
J.T. Yes, I would, because Christ is a divine Person representing God, and it would hold. I would recognise any baptism to that name, either, *to* it or *in* it. Matthew 28 is the primary formula of baptism. It is *to;* when you come up out of the water you move in that direction. You never recognise any other name. That shuts out all else.
T.U. How does teaching fit in with making disciples?
J.T. Baptised believers certainly need teaching. When Paul and Barnabas came to the island of Cyprus, they met the deputy of the island, a Roman officer, and he was "amazed at the teaching of the Lord" (@Acts 13: 12). He was "an intelligent man", like the young man we were speaking of last night, who came into David's system and gave David an account of the raid of the Amalekites. Bar-jesus
{433}
endeavoured to turn the deputy away from the faith. "But Saul, who also is Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixing his eyes upon him, said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness; wilt thou not cease perverting the right paths of the Lord? And now behold, the Lord's hand is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness" (@Acts 13: 9 - 11). When the deputy saw that he was amazed, not at the miracle, but at the teaching of the Lord. He had never heard such teaching. These two men, Paul and Barnabas, carried on the ministry the Lord had in mind for the gentiles. The twelve did not.
Ques. Apollos came in for the teaching as the result of coming under the notice of Aquila and Priscilla.
J.T. He was partially instructed in christianity, but only knew the baptism of John. Aquila and Priscilla saw him and saw that he had power; they "took him to them and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly". That is the idea, so that he became a confirmed christian.
E.P. Do you think that these formulas referred to in the Acts, "in the name of Jesus Christ", "in the name of the Lord", and then "to the name of the Lord Jesus", lead up to the great thought of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit?
J.T. Yes. The thought is that we are not only introduced into the benefits of the economy, but we are made disciples, and as such we are used in the furtherance of what God is doing. That is why I thought we should read John 4, because the woman of Samaria became, not only a beneficiary of the economy, a recipient of living water, but a vital part of the system. She goes to the men and says, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done". She was effective and they came to the
{434}
Lord. The striking point in her case is, she left her water pot, she left what she was using in a physical sense. She went back into the city without her water pot, meaning that she herself was a vessel in this new system.
A.N.W. Is there any objection to combining the two formulas?
J.T. I do not think there is any. I usually do. I am free to baptise a believer in the name of the Lord Jesus. That brings in power; also "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;" introducing the person into all that wonderful light.
J.S. It is a command here to *go* and to *make*.
J.T. The whole chapter is marked by that feature of the truth. The angel who sat on the stone had a countenance as lightning; he was against evil authoritatively and effectively. He had come down from heaven and rolled away the stone and sat upon it, he was exercising authority. Then when he sent the women to the disciples with the message, he says, "Behold, I have told you;" the point is authority. So here the Lord confirms what the angel said, and told the women to go to His brethren and tell them to go to Galilee and there they were to see Him. It is authority and dignity, the disciples went and they saw Him, and He said these things to them, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth". The whole position in Matthew is marked by authority.
J.S. In the transfiguration "his face shone as the sun".
J.T. That is the thought. There are seven mountains, on each of which the Lord was, in Matthew -- as it were, round about Jerusalem. They seem to denote power for the enforcement of the truth, so that on the one in @Matthew 5 the Lord said, "Ye
{435}
have heard that it has been said ... But I say unto you". Authority is enforced right through.
S.P. It is introduced to offset the use of authority by the scribes and Pharisees. The Lord says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye compass the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when he is become such, ye make him twofold more the son of hell than yourselves" (@Matthew 23: 15).
J.T. That is over against what we are speaking of.
A.B. Is fulness in view here, the names of three Persons being used? In your reference to the footnote, you were calling attention to the preposition used, *It directs the mind to the point to be reached*.
J.T. Baptism is to the glorious names, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Baptism is introductory to what is set out in them, but teaching is necessary to build the convert up in christianity.
E.P. Is there a suggestion of it in Moses leading the flock to the back side of the desert and bringing them to the mount of God in the very outset?
J.T. Yes. He was not told to do it, but you can see the line he was on. The mountain of God represented what God would establish, a system in which there would be provision (@Genesis 22: 14). What an economy it is! What light! The Greek preposition used in @Matthew 28: 19, implies that you are to move in that direction. Christendom has retrograded from it.
J.W. In @Ephesians 4: 4 - 6, first there is one body, one Spirit and one hope of your calling; then, one Lord, one faith, one baptism; thirdly, one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all. In Matthew 28, it is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
J.T. It is the *Name* of the three Persons in Matthew. Ephesians 4 has three concentric circles, which is another way of looking at the truth. The first stands in relation to the Spirit: "one body and one Spirit,
{436}
as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling;" the next is the authority of Christ: "one Lord, one faith, one baptism;" finally, "one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all". The last is the universal thought.
M.O. Would all that be connected with the teaching in Matthew 28?
J.T. It would as regards the Persons of the Godhead. But the twelve did not carry out this commission, and it is a question even if Paul did. Paul went to the gentiles, however. The first convert that he and Barnabas got as they were sent out was "amazed at the teaching of the Lord". It was said of the Lord, "for he taught them as having authority, and not as their scribes" (@Matthew 7: 29).
W.B. It is an important thing to be *made* something.
J.T. It is most important as seen in Scripture, because so-called servants today are made in universities; some are converted, but it is not necessary to be converted to be a clergyman. They are made in the sense of human making, but not in the sense that the Lord said, "make disciples of all the nations". If these men are not made after Christ, how can the congregation be made after Christ? Water rises only to its own level.
A.R. When Peter and John said to the lame man, (@Acts 3: 4), "Look on us", they were directing him to look at the finished product under the eye of heaven.
J.T. That confirms what we are saying; they represented what God had effected, and the "complete soundness" (verse 16), corresponded to them.
W.B-w. "If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me" (@Luke 9: 23). Would that be the beginning of making?
J.T. Yes. Matthew makes much of a disciple, even speaking of the *name* of one. I mention it because
{437}
it is applicable to what we are saying -- a person made a disciple. "And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward" (@Matthew 10: 42). That passage gives us the idea of the moral value of a disciple; he has a name, and something may be given in that name.
C.A.M. Do you think the preposition "in" in @John 1: 18 would give a key to this whole matter -- "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father"? It is a question of being in the place of love.
J.T. Yes; the Lord *came into* the place as the preposition indicates (see note in New Translation, last edition). He is *in*, "the bosom of the Father", corresponding to what was said at the Jordan. "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Luke 3: 22). That is, He has come into this position as Man. Moral worth runs through the whole of Matthew's gospel, so that the making means that I am brought into relation with God on moral lines.
A.H.P. Is the Lord's service to the woman here in John 4 and to the woman in chapter 20 to bring us into the understanding and enjoyment of the economy as it is set up?
J.T. Yes. I thought it was wise to read those passages in John 3 and 4, because the second shows how the believer is not only benefited himself by believing, but made a part of the system of administration which God has set up. The foundation is that the "Father loves the Son". Those who do not obey the Son are altogether out of it, hence the passage says, "He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him" (@John 3: 36). That is a most solemn thing. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be
{438}
in his hand". Why should I not be subject to Him? The Jewish position is alluded to in verse 36 -- "wrath has come upon them to the uttermost" (@1 Thessalonians 2: 16); it is because they are not subject to the Son.
S.McC. Is it not instructive to note the difference in the two words for love employed in John? "The Father loves", here in chapter 3: 35, means the settled disposition of the Father; whereas in @John 5: 20 it is more love of friendship.
J.T. There is no recalling of that love, therefore, why not come into it? Why not be subject to the Son? I think the Jewish position is indicated in verse 36; under wrath in not being subject to Him. Chapter 4 brings out that a Samaritan is subject, and is brought into the light of the Lord as Christ; and when the time comes she leaves her water pot, and goes away into the city, and tells the men in it about Christ, and they come to Him; showing that she is an effective servant in the system. That is the divine idea for each of us, not only to be beneficiaries of the system, but to be in it actively, taking part in the administration.
A.N.W. Why is it when we view the economy in John, it seems to centre so much in two Persons, the Father and Son?
J.T. It is formally so stated; but the Spirit is contemplated also. In chapter 4 the Spirit is in mind in the living water that the believer obtains, and this is enlarged in chapter 7; "He that believes on me ... out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive". So that the Spirit is the gift, not exactly presented as having part actively in the administration, as we get elsewhere, but He is the greatest possible gift that can be given *to* us. Christ is given *for* us, the Spirit is given to us as living water, so that there can be springing up.
{439}
Thus the three Persons are in evidence, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (@John 4: 10).
A.P.T. What is the Father's activity in this administration of love?
J.T. It is a name of grace, it is a family name too, but He is not called "your Father" in this gospel until chapter 20. When we come to chapter 20, we not only have administration in grace, but heavenly and family relationships. That makes the present time the most exalted, as connected with ascension.
T.U. "They went out of the city" as a result of her service "and came to him" (@John 4: 30). Is that the end in view in connection with the economy?
J.T. Yes. It is the most helpful passage to bring out that the believer himself is not only a beneficiary of the economy, but made part of it. She is effective in it, she is resultful, and she is very intelligent, because she leaves her water pot. Why should the Holy Spirit record that save to show that she understood that she herself was a vessel? As she faces the men, see how different she is. She had had five husbands, now she is talking about another Man altogether. "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" His work is effective, she is an example of it.
A.N.W. She serves quite unofficially; she had no commission.
J.T. That is characteristic of John -- persons who are unofficial are doing the work. "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do with thy might" (@Ecclesiastes 9: 10). In Matthew it is, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth", but in John, the Father "has given all things to be in his hand". All *things*, and that of course opens up the door to the
{440}
detail of divine things, and the woman is having to do with some of them.
C.A.M. The living water of John 4 does not take us off the earth; but in view of the ascension in chapter 20 there is *breathing*, that is required for ascension.
J.T. Yes, also the mission connected with the heavenly calling (@John 20: 21 - 22). When we come to this chapter, we are in the presence of christianity in its heavenly relationship. Of course Matthew is christianity, Mark is christianity, Luke is christianity, each in its own outlook. When we come to John 20, heavenly relationships are in view. God has brought out these relationships in the days in which we are. The most striking feature of the recovery is the heavenly position; we are to finish with that. So the economy itself is seen in this, that a woman -- an unofficial person -- brings a message to the disciples, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17). As the woman of chapter 4 went to the men of the city, so Mary comes to the disciples; the woman in chapter 4 was evangelical, she was not sent, she went to them. Mary was *sent* to His disciples; she "comes bringing word" to them; she does not assume to teach. Although she knew more than they did, she tells them that she had seen the Lord, and that the Lord said these things to her. It is in keeping with a woman's place. The Lord comes in after that, the doors being shut where the disciples were. They shut the doors for fear of the Jews; this should be taken spiritually; that is, as implying that the message was so precious that it must be guarded from Judaism. "Jesus came and stood in the midst". He had thought of them before He came. Luke says, "he himself stood in their midst;" John says, He "came and stood in the midst". They were glad when they
{441}
saw Him. It really reminds us of the revival in our own time, precious ministry having come in unofficially. As soon as light was received, the early brethren shut the doors against evil, against the Jews; they will corrupt us if we let them in; the doors were shut against them. The *fellowship* was made much of, the Lord's supper, the fellowship of Christ's death: the bread the fellowship of His body, the cup the fellowship of His blood. That is exclusivism, a word used against the brethren at that time, an important word corresponding with the "wall" of the heavenly city. If the doors are shut, we have a circle of fellowship, a wall all around us; we can come into this precious ministry as to the heavenly calling. "The disciples rejoiced". What we are going on with today through grace is according to the same precious light; the incoming of Christ through the Lord's supper. John says He "came and stood in the midst". He knows what is there, and He comes because of the quality of the brethren, and finds them as He expects. John does not report that the disciples were speaking together, as Luke does; but he says they were glad when they saw the Lord. They were ready for Him. And then He says, "Peace be to you" a second time, as if to confirm them in that. It is important to be confirmed in what has been given in these last days, bringing out our heavenly calling, and constituting us fit to administer forgiveness to our brethren, of whom there are thousands in the human organisations around, in false positions. The disciples are constituted great enough by the Lord to have authority to remit all these sins. To any repenting person the doors are wide open. In @Revelation 22: 14 we have, "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and that they should go in by the gates into the city". There is full liberty to come in.
{442}
A.R. The Lord says to Philadelphia, "I have set before thee an opened door" (@Revelation 3: 8), the work is going on all the time.
H.B. Would the first day of the week suggest peculiar freshness in the ministry in the last days?
J.T. That is important. Our chapter mentions this day twice, and it is late in the evening when it is last mentioned, showing the Lord lengthens the day out. John 20 is the first day of the week characteristically, it was lengthened out, so He came in late in the evening. That is where we are, and the Lord is coming in amongst us.
C.A.M. It says in Joshua, "And there was no day like that before it or after it".
J.T. That is @Joshua 10, when Joshua commanded the sun to stand still. It is a question at the moment whether the Lord is coming immediately, or going on for a few years more. If He is going on further the day is lengthened out as in Joshua's time. But our steady attitude, corresponding with that of the Spirit, is expressed in "Come" and "Come, Lord Jesus".
H.H. What sins are these in @John 20: 23?
J.T. They would include all, of course, but I believe ecclesiastical sins are specially in mind; such as are involved in human religious associations.
E.C. This is the first time in this gospel the Lord addresses them as brethren.
J.T. And it is John's way of putting that truth. Each of the evangelists recognises the disciples as His brethren. This is the most exalted heavenly relation.
{443}
4. RELATIONS IN WHICH GOD IS KNOWN - GOD KNOWN IN THE ASSEMBLY
@Ephesians 2: 14 - 22; @2 Chronicles 3: 10 - 14; @1 Corinthians 14: 23 - 33
J.T. The order in which our great subject comes before us is, first, God in creation; secondly, God in Christ personally as a Man here; and then God in the economy which He has set up, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, to which His people and servants are committed. During the present meeting how God is known in the assembly in its provisional state here on earth will be considered. This afternoon, God willing, it will be God in the assembly too, only in its eternal or final relations.
It is thought we should begin with Ephesians, because the epistle contemplates the calling of God on high; the greatness of the saints in sonship, and that we are raised up together, and made to sit down together in the heavenlies, and as such, constituting the assembly. The assembly is formed therefore of heavenly persons and is a heavenly institution here on earth, so that verse 22 says, "in whom *ye* also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". That is, the gentiles as such are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit. Ephesians gives us the assembly as a heavenly vessel; according to the record in Acts 10 the vessel came down, and was taken up *finally*. It is down here provisionally as a vessel; the sheet being knit at the four corners indicating its universal bearing. The passage in 2 Chronicles 3 shows in type the holiest of all, in which God was symbolised in the cherubim and the ark. The cherubim were looking "toward the house;" that is, they looked *outward*. God, as it were, looking out to see man returning to Him. According to Luke 15 the father of the prodigal is looking out for the son returning. Then in 1 Corinthians it is the
{444}
same feature, only it is God there in a prophetic way, convicting; working in the assembly through the prophets.
A.R. I suppose your references to Acts 10, 2 Chronicles and Luke 15, have in view the incoming of the gentiles.
J.T. It is the gentiles who are in view, as in @Ephesians 2: 22, "*ye* also", the apostle says, "are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". There are hardly any Jews in it now. The assembly is almost altogether formed of gentiles, but still a habitation of God.
H.H. What would be the link between Luke 15 and Ephesians 2?
J.T. Luke's house would be Paul's assembly. He does not speak of the assembly formally, but refers to "the house". When the elder brother came up to the house there was music and dancing in it, occasioned by the return of the prodigal, but he would not go in. It was there, however, and others had gone in, and would go in, but he would *not* go in. The Jew would not go in. On the other hand, John would exclude the Jew by shutting the doors against him; that is, the Jew characteristically. The Jewish element has come into the religious formations of Christendom.
S.P. Would the house in Luke be the outcome of what we had yesterday in @Matthew 28: 19 -- "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations"?
J.T. Yes, it would be that, because Matthew has the assembly in this provisional sense in mind. He is the only evangelist who mentions it formally as set up here in an authoritative way. He quotes the Lord as alluding to it in chapter 16 as "my assembly". In chapter 18 discipline is connected with it. If one does not listen to the assembly he is to be treated "as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer" (@Matthew 18: 17).
{445}
A.N.W. Why does the body seem to require both Jew and gentile? Both seem to be emphasised in connection with the body, while as to the habitation, the emphasis is on "*ye*" the gentiles.
J.T. The Spirit of God prophetically intimated that as time went on the assembly generally would be formed of gentiles. At the beginning it was Jew and gentile, according to our passage: "that he might form the two in himself into one new man" (@Ephesians 2: 15), a great triumph of God in a moral sense. The middle wall was broken down. In subsequent history the Jew drops out. Paul at Rome formally states "this salvation of God has been sent to the nations". He turned away from the Jews as they had turned away from him. He quotes @Isaiah 6, and then says, "Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; they also will hear it" (@Acts 28: 28), as if they were *judicially* set aside. Henceforth it would be a gentile matter.
A.R. Bring forth the best robe; it is for one son, not for two.
J.T. Yes, the heavenly side of the truth is in mind, Paul's assembly. Luke would have that in mind, the prodigal is arrayed in the best robe.
A.N.W. The emphatic "*ye*" in @Ephesians 2: 22, cannot be put into chapter 3: 21 in connection with "the assembly in Christ Jesus".
J.T. No, that is the eternal relations of the assembly, the complete whole, historically and numerically, as in its eternal place and function. The "*ye*" is stressed in chapter 2, because the gentile is in mind, showing the idea of the habitation of God runs on, even though there are no Jews.
H.H. Does the prodigal in Luke 15 suggest the point reached down here?
J.T. Yes, it a provisional state of things. The house is not formally stated at first, but it is when the music and dancing are proceeding, showing that
{446}
a happy state of things was there. I suppose the elder brother would fit in with the end of Acts; Paul says, "we turn to the nations" (@Acts 13: 46). The Jew would not receive the truth; he would not go in. The Lord begins after that to give parables like the rich man and Lazarus.
W.B-w. The Jew nationally was shut out. Is that the idea of the elder brother?
J.T. Yes. As men, as having part in the human race, they are objects of the gospel, but it is no longer to "the Jew first", it is to the gentiles according to Acts 28, as we have seen.
J.S. The seven assemblies are said to be in the province of Asia, outside of judaism altogether. Although there were many assemblies in Judaea, they are not mentioned.
Rem. Although the Jew is shut out, this does not affect the truth of the reconciliation of the world.
J.T. Not at all. Of course, they came in in great numbers under Peter's ministry and that of the other eleven apostles. Paul, in his ministry amongst the gentiles, made a point of speaking to the Jews first, and many of course, were converted, but the time came when they were formally rejected -- at Rome, Acts 28. He says, "wrath has come upon them to the uttermost" (@1 Thessalonians 2: 16). That would correspond to John 3: 36"he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him". That is the Jews¬ position. Our verse in the end of Ephesians 2 shows that the gentiles by themselves continue the idea of habitation of God in the Spirit.
A.N.W. What did the Father mean in @Luke 15: 31, "All that is mine is thine".
J.T. That involves the Jews¬ place in the ways o God; they came into the heirship of the world through Abraham. Paul speaks in @Romans 9: 4, 5, of what belonged to them. The Lord recognises them
{447}
as His brethren in @Matthew 25: 40, saying to the nations, "Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me". That will be His Jewish brethren, known as doing the will of God, showing they had first place with Him. The nations are blessed through them. I suppose that will be the millennial position.
J.B. Do you think the Jewish mind kept the Galatians from enjoying sonship?
J.T. That accentuates what we are saying as to shutting out the Jew in his natural characteristics. Paul says, "I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion" (@Galatians 5: 12). That is the Jewish element. Paul says, to the Thessalonians, they are against all men, they persecuted us and cast us out and wrath has come upon them to the uttermost (@1 Thessalonians 2: 15, 16). That is their present position. We may get one or two in, but on the ground of being men, not on the ground of being Jews. They have no priority now at all.
W.G.T. The Syrophenician woman represented the moral state that will exist among the gentiles, seen as sheep in Matthew 25.
J.T. She first took Jewish ground; thus she was not owned by the Lord, she was a Canaanite. She says, Son of David have mercy on me. He did not even answer her. She must take her true place, according to the Lord's remarks (@Matthew 15: 26, 27). That was because the Jew had priority then, but they have not now. The gentiles have been in view for many centuries. The Jews have hardly any part in the testimony.
A.N.W. In John 4, the Lord particularly says to the woman of Samaria, "salvation is of the Jews", when did that cease?
J.T. That remark was to put the Samaritan in her place. She was a Samaritan; the Samaritans claimed equality with the Jews. They assumed Jacob
{448}
was their father. It was a false position. The Lord's remarks adjusted the woman. What we are speaking of now hinged on their final rejection of the gospel through Paul. He says, in @1 Thessalonians 2: 14 - 16, "For *ye*, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; for *ye* also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also *they* of the Jews, who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have driven us out by persecution, and do not please God, and are against all men, forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be saved, that they may fill up their sins always: but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost". I think that is the word. That happened when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. The Lord alluded to it: "for these are days of avenging that all the things that are written may be accomplished". That is vengeance on the Jews, and then it goes on to say, "Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the nations until the times of the nations be fulfilled" (@Luke 21: 24). That is running on now, and they have no priority; there is hardly any representation of them in the assembly. There are some of course, but generally it is the gentile who is forming the habitation of God now.
J.S. Do you think the Jew failed to accept his position nationally as set among the nations?
J.T. Really it is a question of hatred to Christ, going beyond Jewish territory in persecuting the gentiles, even forbidding the gospel to be preached to them. Well, that was a sin against the Holy Spirit you may say. Wrath thus comes on them. It is Paul's ministry that was refused really so that he turns to the gentiles, that is how the matter stands.
H.H. Would the Canaanitish woman of @Matthew 15: 22, of whom we have spoken, be in good time for the structure Christ was building?
{449}
J.T. Just so. Matthew follows up the Syrophenician case. She came in on the ground of *humility*, taking the place of a dog, the gentile's place. The Lord stresses that the Jew still had priority, and she comes in on the ground of taking a dog's place. Then chapter 16 brings in Caesarea Philippi, a sort of allusion to the gentile world. That was where the Lord spoke about His assembly.
J.R.H. Evidently they had the priority when the epistle to the Romans was written, "to the Jew first".
J.T. Yes, but the epistle to the Thessalonians contemplates the governmental change.
C.H.H. Does not @Romans 10: 12 contemplate that too? "For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich towards all that call upon him".
J.T. Quite so. Romans 9, 10, 11 set out Israel's position as having rejected the gospel. Israel is set aside, the gentiles taking its place provisionally.
E.P. Does @Ephesians 2: 15 suggest that the formation of unity takes place under great difficulties? I was thinking especially of the thought of enmity: "having annulled the enmity ... that he might form the two in himself into one new man".
J.T. The enmity was great. The pride of the Jew in his religious place with God outwardly was so great that God intended to show His triumph in breaking that down -- in a man like Saul of Tarsus, for instance, an arrogant despiser of the gentiles. Peter too saying, "I have never eaten anything common or unclean" -- the triumph of God in breaking all that down, I think was in mind. It is stated here, "For *he* is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of enclosure, having annulled the enmity in his flesh" (@Ephesians 2: 14, 15). The Lord's death on the cross is in mind. Verses 15, 16, 17, "having annulled the enmity in his flesh, the law of commandments in
{450}
ordinances, that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace; and might reconcile both in one body to God by the cross, having by it slain the enmity; and, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh". The breaking down of the enmity, the formation of one new man, and unity in the one body. This is the basis of the testimony going out to the gentiles. It is said the Lord preached to the gentiles first, "coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and ... to those who were nigh".
E.P. Would the price paid for the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite fit in at all, having in mind the house of God?
J.T. It is remarkable, that it is the threshing floor of a *Jebusite*. Ornan was ready to offer the threshing floor, oxen and implements to David for use in the building of the house; this is to be credited to him. David would not offer to God what cost him nothing; that was David's point of view, but it did not set aside the liberality of the Jebusite. Really he was coming into position for the house.
H.H. It was a worthy contribution of a gentile touched by the testimony in that day.
J.T. He, and his four sons, are thoroughly with David. It is very suggestive, a family actually operating in what is good, not leaving their father, but working with him in the threshing floor.
H.H. I suppose we are on the threshing floor now. The wheat is to be saved and the chaff to be dismissed. That goes on with us as of the assembly down here.
J.T. Yes. The relation of the threshing floor to the house is very suggestive. It is a question of separating the wheat from the chaff. Matthew takes
{451}
it up, "and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor". We have it in Gideon too. We have it when Jacob was buried. When we die, great separation is effected.
S.P. Would you say something on the force of "form the two in himself into one new man" (@Ephesians 2: 15)?
J.T. It is an important word. In @Ephesians 4: 24, the new man is said to be "created in truthful righteousness and holiness;" the body is in mind. Making the two into one "in himself", would speak of a more personal touch; each one is invaluable. You can see how the Lord took up Paul and expended great care on him, to form him. The new man is also renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who created him. Saul of Tarsus, an austere, proud, arrogant man, received great attention from the Lord; he was cared for and personally entertained by the brethren before he went out to preach. The first chapter of Genesis is creation, but the second is formation. God formed Adam in an ornamental way; how much more so the assembly; the new man involves this. That He might form or create (chapter 2: 15 is the same in the Greek as chapter 4: 24) the two into one new man, and that "in himself;" the personal touch is in that. The passage runs on to "making peace" and reconciling both in one body. The body is formed too (see @Psalm 139: 14 - 16).
S.P. Is the suggestion to be seen in Paul's personal word to each saint at the end of Romans, calling them by name?
J.T. What enters into that, as we were remarking earlier, is the idea of reconciliation. "God ... reconciling the world to himself". The idea of reconciliation underlies all these salutations. Paul, as he contemplated the Romans, must have known a good many of them. There are about twenty "salutes" in
{452}
the chapter. All whom he saluted would be pleasing to God, as they were pleasing to him.
A.R. In 2 Chronicles there is the preparation of the material under Hiram, king of Tyre, then the putting together in chapter 3.
J.T. Typical of assembly material and formation. Exodus from chapter 25 has that in mind right through; what the material was basically, and then what it was as formed by Bezaleel. Everything is *made*. We get a good illustration of this idea of formation in the end of Matthew. The women came to the tomb with the spices. They saw the angel, who represented authority; but they were full of dark thoughts; he says to them, "Fear not *ye* ... . Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you" (@Matthew 28: 5 - 7). That is authority. They went quickly to the disciples, and *as they were going*, the Lord met them and says, "Hail!" He salutes them. They were moving in obedience. The Lord honours us as moving in subjection to Him. That is how formation takes place. Instead of calling them "disciples", He says, "go, bring word to my brethren", (@Matthew 28: 10). The women were themselves to fit into that, because formation must enter into our place amongst the brethren.
J.R.H. @Isaiah 43: 1 -- "But now thus saith Jehovah, that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine".
J.T. In that passage we have creation, agreeing with @Genesis 1: 1, and formation, agreeing with @Genesis 2: 7.
T.U. Is Peter coming into this, as learning by the sheet let down? The Jew formed in assembly
{453}
thought, as you are suggesting, and the bringing in of the gentile in Cornelius.
J.T. Yes. Paul is particularly a good representation of a Jew transformed; and he uses the word in @Romans 12: 2, "be transformed by the renewing of your mind". "We all ... with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image" (@2 Corinthians 3: 18). It is a *metamorphosis;* implying a substantial change in the formation. When God said, "make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them" (@Exodus 25), there was not only basic material specified, but men qualified to do the work. The thought of basic material corresponds with Genesis 1, and formation with Genesis 2. Bezaleel and Aholiab did the making.
McK. At Antioch we have a picture of what you have in mind. "Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work" (@Acts 13: 1, 2). Divine formation was found with these men.
J.T. The assembly there is presented as the work of Paul and Barnabas. They taught in the assembly for a whole year. The formation went on in all the four seasons of the year -- all circumstances. Now we have the finished product in Acts 13. From that point we have Paul and Barnabas sent out, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". They were to go out from the heart of the gentile assembly and they return to it after their first missionary journey.
J.S. Antioch was the first assembly functioning outside of the Jewish economy.
J.T. Yes -- functioning. It was a finished product, the product of the work of these two men in the assembly. It is said they taught "in the assembly",
{454}
a large crowd. You have to distinguish the two thoughts: a large crowd, and the assembly. The idea of "crowd" disappeared, and the assembly stood out. Now the Spirit of God can address that company. "Separate me now". It is a perfect state of things in the gentile setting.
A.P.T. Does this provisional system require holiness? In @2 Chronicles 3: 10 the word says, "in the house of the most holy place". Not only an actual place, but what it is characteristically is emphasised -- *holy of holies*. It is the house of that.
J.T. Yes. The passage read was suggested because of the position of the cherubim as different from Exodus. Exodus is the habitation for the wilderness; it has not the gospel in mind; there was no incoming in Exodus. The cherubim looked down on the mercy seat. It spoke of God in His infinite majesty looking down on the sacrifice of Christ as the basis for everything. That is Exodus. When we come to the temple in Chronicles, it is a fixed heavenly thing (@2 Chronicles 6: 2). The cherubim were looking *out*. The Authorised Version says they looked inward, but the New Translation says, "their faces were toward the house" (@2 Chronicles 3: 13). They looked toward the outer house, to suggest that God is looking for men to come in, like the father of the prodigal. Kings is more the heavenly, assembly side. There is no veil in Kings, but there is in Chronicles, which would refer more to the earthly side in the future, but the gospel side now, for God is now in the assembly as seen in Paul's ministry, looking out on men.
S.McC. In regard of God in the assembly by the Spirit, how does this thought link with what we have had previously as to God here in Christ?
J.T. It is a question of finishing, and of divine skill. As in the assembly, God is known in His abode, in which He is in touch, or can be in touch
{455}
with men. Of course this was true in Christ, for He was in the Pharisee's house -- an unconverted man. God was there in Christ reconciling, but that was preliminary. Paul's ministry was the great thought in mind. The three and a half years of the Lord's life were preliminary. The testimony in the full thought of God needed the assembly. The Lord did not have the assembly when He was down here, He sent out the twelve. In Acts 2 they are all together in one place, and the Spirit comes in the form of cloven tongues as of fire, and sat on each one of the hundred and twenty persons there; each would have something distinctive by the Spirit. The Spirit sat on each in the form of cloven tongues of fire. Each one is to be representative of this great matter. God is there in relation to man. He is there provisionally to get at men. When we come to Cornelius, Peter is not just equal to this service, to go out to the gentiles. God makes him equal, and suitable, to preach to Cornelius through the great sheet which came down. That is the idea of the assembly. It is the vast bearing of the thing. God is in it in a universal way, in order to get at men. We are working with men, every day we get at them. It is God in the assembly, so as we see in Corinth, the unconverted man comes in and finds God there in the midst.
S.McC. In Christ it was more on the principle of compression. What we have now is far more extended and expanded.
J.T. It is still Christ, of course, but "Christ in you" -- extended through the gospel. As here in the flesh, Christ deliberately came into small circumstances, so that God Himself in a Person equal to Himself, was near to men in grace. The assembly is not divine, but it is God's habitation. Christ Himself was equal to the Father. He was in outwardly compressed circumstances. Weary with His journey He
{456}
sat at the well and asked a drink of water from a woman. But He said, "If thou knewest ... who it is ... thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (@John 4: 10). The Lord Jesus was equal to the Father. He says, "I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened until it shall have been accomplished" (@Luke 12: 50). He is not straitened now, hence He also says, "He that believes on me ... shall do greater [works] than these, because I go to the Father" (@John 14: 12).
J.B. Referring again to @2 Chronicles 3, in the last few verses of the last chapter of Acts, would the cherubim be seen looking out? The passage speaks of Paul being two whole years in his own hired lodging, preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom unhinderedly.
J.T. Quite so. He is a prisoner, in the very heart of the gentile world, but he is more expanded, more enlarged than ever. That shows what is in mind. We have this very Ephesian epistle from that prison-house.
S.McC. Is it not interesting that we have the heavenly side in 1 Kings? In 2 Chronicles the verses given to ornamentation are only about half of what are given in the Kings.
J.T. Yes. In Kings it is a question of heavenly grandeur and expanse; houses are mentioned that are not in Chronicles at all. When God is proceeding in regard to men, it is not a question so much of grandeur, as of getting at their souls. In Chronicles it is the official position on earth, with the veil and the altar. Man is relieved, he has come to understand God in removing the distance between Himself and man. Israel's millennial position is in view. Solomon went to Gibeon to "God's tent of meeting
{457}
which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness" (@2 Chronicles 1: 3).
C.A.M. Referring to our scripture in Ephesians, "the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord" (@Ephesians 2: 21).
J.T. I thought the idea there refers rather to the millennium. It runs into the idea of "a holy temple in the Lord". It is more than that now. I suppose the bearing of this reference to the temple is that when the millennial day is inaugurated, there will be no dark counsels such as there are in the nations now. Everything will be divinely clear. What the Lord is doing will be understood, because in the temple things are explained -- it is "in the Lord". In Corinthians the saints are said to be "temple of God". It is what we are now, because of the Holy Spirit being in us. Everything is explainable now and explained too, because of the Holy Spirit; not only is He down here, He is in the saints as the temple of God.
J.S. The millennium would be finality in respect of government.
J.T. Yes. In the millennial day everything will be *clear*. The assembly will come down from God, her shining "as a crystal-like jasper stone;" and the river "bright as crystal, going out of the throne of God".
A.R. @Ephesians 2: 21 is the millennium; verse 22 is the present moment.
J.T. Verse 22 is more limited, it is provisional in view of the fact that the Jews are not much in evidence now. It applies to the present time.
A.N.W. What would be the prime reason for God occupying this habitation now?
J.T. To be near to men in family affection. His habitation in the eternal state of things too will be the assembly. In verse 21 the building is not viewed as completed, it is "growing to" a temple. In verse
{458}
21 the assembly composed of Jew and gentile is in view. It is the great general thought, but increasing to "a holy temple in the Lord". The gentiles at Ephesus were built in too, to be now already a habitation of God by the presence of the Spirit, but the word "ye" goes beyond Ephesus, it comes down to the time when there are only gentiles.
J.S. We have Christ, a Man, in heaven, and God on earth.
J.T. That is the idea, God is here by the Spirit, by the power of the Spirit, so that He sat on each of those together at Pentecost.
W.B-w. God is seen dwelling in the Corinthians according to the passage read (@1 Corinthians 14).
J.T. Yes. I thought we might see how this comes down to the ministry meeting. The chapter shows how the operations are carried on, and that God is concerned that they may be carried on in an orderly way; because it is a question of Himself, He is the God of order.
E.P. Is there a suggestion in a "simple person" coming in, that there is something attractive about it? As "he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing" (@Luke 15: 25).
J.T. The whole chapter suggests that the assembly should be ornamented in a spiritual sense. Paul says, If I am singing a hymn, "I will sing with the spirit" (@1 Corinthians 14: 15). I want my spirit to be in it, not merely the words, "but I will sing also with the understanding". I am singing right words. The order of the assembly includes the dress we wear and the way we sit. Some sit as though they were just waiting for a train; that is not right. We ought to be reverential in the assembly. If we speak, we should not speak with slang words, but with right words, having a spiritual setting; words the Holy Spirit would indite. Many other things enter into this matter. God is concerned about the vessel
{459}
through which the testimony goes out to men. What is there before their eyes? That is what they are to be brought into, and they must be formed accordingly.
A.H.P. Do you think the prominence of the Holy Spirit in the finishing touches of His work is important?
J.T. Yes. What we are saying now is most important. God is a God of order, Corinthians is stressing order. It is God's assembly. He has set the gifts in it; all the vessels, the servants, adorn it. He is concerned that what goes out to men should be ornamental. Luke presents the Lord at Nazareth in His service as attractive: how He spoke; how He stood to read the Scriptures, "having rolled up the book, when he had delivered it up to the attendant, he sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him" (@Luke 4: 20). The Spirit records this as showing that the ministry is to be enhanced in the minister. That is the reason why order in the assembly is stressed in 1 Corinthians; it is what is down here.
J.W.D. That is what affected the queen of Sheba as to Solomon.
J.T. What she saw, the deportment of his servants, and the order of service of his attendants, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah. "For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints" (verse 33). Then the apostle refers to women, how they are to act, and other things. In fact, he begins in chapter 11 about this matter of order. God wants things according to Himself. In verse 26 we have, "What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be
{460}
done to edification". That is to be the minister's motive; everything is for edification.
S.P. You are distinguishing between certain ministry and the prophetic word. In a meeting there might be a lack of what is prophetic.
J.T. Quite so. This chapter stresses prophecy. It is a thing we ought to be concerned about -- the prophetic word; but then, if I have not that, have I a psalm? That is the first thing Paul mentioned; "each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation".
S.P. What is in mind in a psalm?
J.T. Experience based on the truth. There are five books of Psalms, and five books in the Pentateuch. The books of Moses would represent the truth divinely presented; a psalm is experience based on this.
C.A.M. Would you say that Jonah, although a prophet, in chapter 2 composes a psalm? Chapter 2 is in poetical rhythm.
J.T. God made him a psalmist before he preached to Nineveh.
N.B. The chapter contemplates that only two, or at the most three, should speak. Would each one bringing something distinctive promote disorder?
J.T. I do not think so. An effort by a second speaker to *merely* follow what the first speaker said is not necessary. If something he has is needed, it will serve the saints although it may not be on the same lines as that which preceded it. You do not come expressly to speak. You have something, but this does not mean that you must use it.
S.McC. Is it out of place to visit a neighbouring locality to get the gain of what comes out in their ministry meeting? The ministry meeting according to @1 Corinthians 14 is local, and it has been suggested that we should leave it to those who are local.
{461}
J.T. We are apt to run into error there. You would bring in congregationalism if you follow that too far. The local assembly can never abrogate the general fellowship, especially in regard of the exercise of gift. "God has set certain in the assembly", that is, the *whole* assembly, not simply what is local; thus the whole assembly must enter into this matter. You could not rightly exclude any gift from your ministry meeting. However, wisdom in those visiting would say, We ought to let the local brethren have liberty here. But to state that there should not be visitors would be congregationalism.
A.N.W. Are you making the whole assembly in verse 26 universal rather than local?
J.T. No, I do not mean that. I am mentioning chapter 12, "God has set certain in the assembly", that is the gifts, including the apostles; to exclude any of those from any local meeting would be congregationalism. Congregationalism means each church is separate, is independent. Some would say, Paul really means the local meeting at Corinth, but if Paul was there, must he sit silent? Still, in view of the specially local *character* of the meeting, wisdom in a visitor would make room for resident brothers of ability.
A.P.T. Agabus always seems to prophesy outside of his own locality.
J.T. We never hear of him prophesying in Jerusalem. Gift is set in the assembly and is of universal bearing.
A.P.T. All are not prophets. I would like to ask as to "let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge" (@1 Corinthians 14: 29).
J.T. That would imply that all the saints are not prophets. The idea of localising gift is not scriptural; and to assume that gift from another quarter cannot serve at any opportunity is not right.
{462}
Gift is always universal, it is in the assembly and available everywhere.
A.R. If a brother has gift in a locality and holds strictly to what is local, what would be the effect?
J.T. He is likely to take on the character of a local clergyman. That is what they were doing in Corinth. The same thing happened at Plymouth; the gifts or men of ability became localised, failing to make room for others.
N.B. How would you connect each one coming with something, and yet all are not prophets?
J.T. Prophets are in mind in this instruction. What one has is his own. It is a question of when you use it. You add to the wealth of the occasion, by what you have, even if you do not speak. The wealth is there. You have it; so far it is yours, but it belongs to the assembly too, and you can express it as you have opportunity.
J.S. There was great wealth at Troas in the "many lights in the upper room where we were assembled" (@Acts 20: 8).
W.B. Would it require gift to have a psalm? How would a person express a psalm?
J.T. There are psalms called *Maschil*, meaning teaching psalms. You have gone through the thing yourself, you are able to give it out in the form of a psalm. It constitutes something that a hearer can take into his mind easily. Poetry helps your mind, so that you can remember more easily what you hear. "In all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God" (@Colossians 3: 16).
T.U. Would the idea of having something, and certain ones being prophets, include the sisters?
J.T. I think not. It is gift exercised in the assembly that is in mind here. The sisters do not speak there. Morally the psalm comes first. I think the psalm put first is suggestive that you are
{463}
an experienced man. I suppose the five books of the Psalms represent the experience of God's people, but put into such a form that it may be useful to others. We have the sweet psalmist, one very attractive in what he is giving out.
A.P.T. @Psalm 45 indicates great affection for Christ in the composer.
J.T. God honours the Psalms in a striking manner in Hebrews. He selects from the Psalms what builds up truth as to the glories of Christ. In honouring the Psalms God honours those who wrote them.
{464}
5. RELATIONS IN WHICH GOD IS KNOWN - GOD KNOWN IN THE ASSEMBLY IN RELATION TO THE MILLENNIUM AND ETERNITY
@Revelation 21: 22 - 27; @Revelation 21: 2 - 5; @1 Corinthians 15: 24 - 28; @Ephesians 3: 20, 21
J.T. In these scriptures as taken together, I think we shall see finality, as to this great subject; really the greatest things, as to what has been before us. We saw this morning that God is in the assembly provisionally, carrying on the testimony of the gospel, taking out from among the nations a people for His name -- those who form the assembly.
What we should see now is, firstly that He is also in the assembly in relation to the millennium. John saw "the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God". The glory of God enlightens it and the lamp thereof is the Lamb. This is in view of testimony in the millennium. Then the beginning of Revelation 21 shows that God is in it eternally, for there it is a question of the new Jerusalem and new creation; it is said, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God" (@Revelation 21: 1 - 3). This is not in the same sense in which He is here in the assembly now; He is not "with men" in the assembly now, He is here to secure them by the gospel. In the eternal state of things, He is with men as His people, they shall be His people, "God himself shall be with them, their God".
{465}
Then our passage in 1 Corinthians shows the result is "that God may be all in all". The passage in Ephesians shows that He will be glorified in the assembly for ever: "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages" (@Ephesians 3: 21).
H.H. Would you say a word as to the second verse of Revelation 21, the relation of the holy city, new Jerusalem, to eternity?
J.T. She does not come down for testimony there, but "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". She is alluded to as "the tabernacle of God;" that would be final; and added to it, as in @1 Corinthians 15: 28, God will ultimately be "all in all".
A.R. Does the city in @Revelation 21: 11 represent formation in a supreme way? The light is not conferred, it is what she is in the way of formation; "Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone".
J.T. That is what she is as coming into the millennial state of things. Then it is said, "And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb. And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb" (@Revelation 21: 22, 23).
S.McC. What had you in mind when you referred to the thought of testimony? It has been generally thought that the time of testimony would be past and the time of display come.
J.T. I think the millennial period will be a period of testimony too, as to what God can do in actual flesh and blood conditions in which we are. It will be the same earth, the nations, Israel, all set up in blessing here, not perfectly, because there is the possibility of death, we are told in the prophets; and moreover, after the millennial day, there will be
{466}
another attack of the enemy, according to chapter 20; so it is an imperfect state of things, though nearly perfect. God shows what He can do in setting up such a state of things, in spite of conditions that exist in the material universe. The eternal state is not in these conditions; although @Isaiah 65: 17 shows that new creation is, in *principle*, in the millennium. Jehovah says there, "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth", but in detail the prophet refers to the change in Jerusalem; the great change that would come over that city. It says, "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and will joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thenceforth an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not completed his days; for the youth shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof: they shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them. And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah" (@Isaiah 65: 17 - 25). We should keep that passage before
{467}
us in relation to @Revelation 21: 9 and on. They refer to the millennial state of things, but imperfect, death possible and the curse too, and the serpent there, though Satan is bound; and yet all held, so that the divine rule dominates. "For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea" (@Isaiah 11: 9). God is there, evidently in the holy city as it comes down from Him having His glory, and He, with the Lamb, is the light of it and the temple of it.
J.W.D. Is that a physical reference, or is it testimony coming down out of heaven?
J.T. I think it is testimony. It is characteristic, she comes down, she is in the liberty of sonship, she is not *sent* down; Satan and others fall down. She *comes* down; it calls attention to the liberty in which the assembly is set up in sonship.
J.W.D. The assembly will dwell in heaven in the millennial age, is that right? This is the sphere of her testimony.
J.T. The city comes down; it does not say to earth, but within the range of the nations, for they bring their glory to it.
A.N.W. Is the movement of verse 10 identical with that in verse 2?
J.T. Verse 10 reads, "And he carried me away in the Spirit, and set me on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God". She is seen as the bride, the Lamb's wife. In verse 2 she is seen as the new Jerusalem, prepared as a bride adorned for her *husband*. It has in mind finality. I would say they are two movements.
C.A.M. They would be one thousand years apart.
J.T. I should say so. The city is the same in both connections, only the features respectively suitable to each are seen. In a certain sense the eternal
{468}
state of things and the millennial state of things run together. The assembly, already gone up to be with the Lord in her translation, enters on new creation in finality at once. The assembly will have a place with Christ at once. Coming down into the millennial order of things, we are already in the state of perfection, but @Revelation 21: 1 - 8 is consecutive to the remainder of the chapter.
H.H. Is new creation connected with the city?
J.T. *New* Jerusalem implies new creation, but this is not seen in verse 10, although we know it is new creation, because Scripture says, "if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 17). In the second section of the chapter the city comes down from heaven having the glory of God; it is the Lamb's wife, but obviously with characteristics that belong to the millennial state of things, not the eternal state. The characteristics stated, have relation to the millennium; "having the glory of God. Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone; having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel". All these are characteristics that relate to the millennial state of things in testimony. We do not get these names, nor do we get the foundations in verses 2 to 5.
W.B-w. Are we to understand the first five verses refer to the eternal condition?
J.T. That is what I thought, and therefore they come in properly in relation to @1 Corinthians 15: 28; God all in all; whereas the second part of our chapter, beginning with verse 9, relates to the assembly still in a provisional relation -- in testimony in the millennium. Chapter 20 is the foundation of the whole subject, including the great white throne of judgment, and the first eight verses of chapter 21 are added to complete the subject as to the eternal
{469}
state of blessing. That is, it is new creation, and the assembly is seen coming down in glory "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". This is how she is to be known, and at the same time, as the tabernacle of God, finishing the subject taken up in chapter 20.
W.B-w. He goes back to millennial conditions in verse 9.
J.T. Yes; and the description continues on to end of the 5th verse of chapter 22.
S.McC. If, as you suggest, finality is entered upon immediately at translation, how does the thought of the kingdom publicly in the day of display fit in with that, and our place, answering to reproach and suffering here?
J.T. That will come in at the millennial day. There is a lot of detail attached to it scattered throughout the epistles and the gospels. We do not have it all here in Revelation. When Christ comes out to reign, we come out to reign with Him, and when He sits on His own throne, we shall be with Him. It would take much more time than we have now to cover all. It is a wonderful field to look into -- the details of how we come out with Christ -- it is all included in this thought of the city. This city is an immense thing, the greatest thing, outside of divine Persons. It is a cube. "And he that spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall. And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed -- twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height of it are equal" (verses 15, 16). It needs mathematics to get at that. Think of the vastness of the measurement given! Twelve thousand stadia, and the length, breadth and height are equal; it is a cube, and all composed of persons. Think of that! It has to be taken in spiritually. What
{470}
is stated in the chapter is to bring out the vastness and general greatness of the city; there is nothing in the whole universe equal to it outside of divine Persons.
A.B. Does @2 Corinthians 4: 6 refer to it? "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".
J.T. Just so. The city is imbued with that, invested with the glory; every one of us adding his quota to it.
J.W.D. The names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are there. I wondered whether the functioning of the heavenly city is something like the functioning of the organism now.
J.T. It is the assembly as at Pentecost that is in mind here; that is, it is in that connection, standing in a Jewish connection, showing God is carrying forward His thoughts into millennial days on these lines. Paul is not mentioned. The general effect of his work would be inward and upward, and would correspond with verse 2. His ministry specially included the mystery which is the inner and more spiritual feature.
Ques. Is that the city that Abraham looked for?
J.T. Yes, "of which God is the artificer and constructor" (@Hebrews 11: 10).
H.H. Is the idea of a city ability for administration?
J.T. I should say that is the idea of it, running right through; the magnitude of it, and the qualities in the material and the liberty in which it is, are stressed here; it is not sent down, it *comes* down from God out of heaven.
H.H. All that enters into the present moment, for administration is so important we need to have a right regard for it now.
{471}
J.T. I think the Lord is helping us as to it now in the care meetings.
A.R. All the assembly enjoys is coming down in effect here.
J.T. It is God's masterpiece, both in quality and proportions. It is a cube -- it is substantial. It is not in the order of the truth in the Old Testament, but it is made to fit into it, because it is the assembly as at Pentecost; that is what the twelve foundations imply, and they are presented in precious stones; it is the excellence of the city even in the foundations that is in mind.
J.S.T. I wondered if we could get help in regard of the temple being mentioned, "for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb" (verse 22).
J.T. It is to bring out how real is the divine Presence. God and the Lamb are the temple of it. Usually a city has a temple; even in heathen countries. Here there is none. "And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb;" which would mean that they are available *immediately*, not in a shrine; that God is there in great simplicity and availability, so that you could go to Him any time to get understanding and light about things.
J.S.T. Why is this name used, Lord God Almighty?
J.T. Well, it is linked with the Old Testament, going back to Genesis, that is, what God was to Abraham, He is now in the millennial day. He is available now.
W.W. Does that correspond with @Isaiah 65: 24? "And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear".
J.T. He is available, ready for you any time you go there.
{472}
E.P. Do you mean that God uses these accessories, because He has to on our account. He will do without them when He can.
J.T. Yes. Conditions inside do not require a veil. God is there to be inquired of immediately at any time.
J.R.H. Mr. Darby's hymn: 
<blockquote>'And radiant hosts for ever share The unveiled mystery'. (`74:7)</blockquote>
C.A.M. That this city is heavenly, coming out of heaven, does not change the fact that there will be an earthly system of glory as in Ezekiel. The two things are not the same, are they?
J.T. No, Ezekiel is another matter. We will be in close touch with the earthly city, no doubt. There will be close relations I am sure, because you have the names of the twelve tribes on the gates here; and they are also on the city gates in Ezekiel; and the testimony in Ezekiel is Jehovah Shammah, "Jehovah is there", and so He is here.
S.McC. How will the kings of the earth bring their glory to it?
J.T. That is another thing. We have to wait and see how they come. The Lord will adjust the whole position; and when He sits on the throne of His glory, He will regulate the nations. Some go away into everlasting punishment because of their treatment of the Jews, viewed as His brethren; others will go into everlasting life -- the saved nations (@Matthew 25: 46). That is what we have in @Isaiah 65: 22, "for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people". It brings the idea of everlasting life down to these conditions; the life of a tree. So that the Lord, who sits upon the throne of His glory, sets these nations who are saved in motion, they are in liberty, they go into everlasting life. They have liberty in it, and in that liberty they go to the heavenly city; and shall bring their glory to it. There
{473}
will be contact, yet Scripture does not say the city is on the earth.
C.A.M. Matthew speaks of the city of the great king, and after the Lord's resurrection, the holy city.
J.T. They will be brought very near together, so that these nations go away into eternal life. The character of eternal life that will be enjoyed in the millennium is indicated in Isaiah 65. The life of a tree is only a suggestion of what this great longevity in blessing will be. From the standpoint of christianity, there is no end to the life they will have, because those in whom God will have wrought will merge after the millennium into the eternal state of things. The queen of Sheba, the Lord says, "shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than Solomon is here" (@Matthew 12: 42). She brought her glory to Jerusalem. She brought her glory to the great king in Jerusalem. That suggests the nations brought into millennial blessing and eternal life. It will work out in this way, that the saints of the assembly will be dispersed throughout the universe, one will be over five, another over ten cities. As belonging to this heavenly system, we are accessible to the nations, to anyone. Conditions will be very simple, very free, but very blessed. There will be great latitude of love and intelligence too, because the city grows to a holy temple in the Lord.
A.P.T. There is no passport system and only one street.
J.T. There is only one street, one grade of society, no slums, no sewage. All is perfection.
J.S. You alluded to the queen of Sheba.
J.T. I suppose she came from the south of Arabia. I sometimes think that the Lord must have been thinking of Australia and New Zealand, because He calls the region from which she came the *south*.
{474}
C.A.M. I was thinking that the south was exemplified in early church history. The eunuch comes up from the south.
J.T. He was also from the south. A brother was asking, What became of him? We do not hear of the eunuch again. We can leave that. "He went on his way rejoicing". The Spirit of God leaves it to us to determine what *such* a man would do. We may be assured he would tell his mistress, the queen -- he would go back into his old position with holy joy, and thus be a testimony.
A.P.T. The final attack of Satan comes up against the holy city.
J.T. It is the earthly city he attacks. "And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city" (@Revelation 20: 9) -- meaning there is no modifying of the opposition. Earlier when he attacks the remnant of Israel, the earth interfered and swallowed up the river he sent out (@Revelation 12: 16). Here he comes up on the *breadth* of the earth, he has right of way everywhere. It is a very solemn and humbling thing that there will be such conditions on earth after the millennial glory. "A fire came down from God out of the heaven and devoured them" (@Revelation 20: 9). The attack is on the city, "the camp of the saints and the beloved city". It is the earthly city we have in Ezekiel.
A.R. Will the whole earth be affected by Christ in the millennium?
J.T. I should think so. 'From Greenland's icy mountains, From India's coral strand'.
It is well to bear in mind that the Roman earth is sometimes alluded to as the earth, but I think this is the whole earth.
A.R. What about the everlasting gospel?
J.T. That comes in earlier, (chapter 14). It is an angelic ministry. The heathen countries will be
{475}
evangelised quickly, it will not take two thousand years.
J.W.D. Do you understand the Lord will be personally known during the millennium, or will He remain in heaven?
J.T. I should say He is in the city. "For the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb" (@Revelation 21: 22).
J.W.D. Sitting on the throne of His glory, I was wondering if that is in the heavenly city.
J.T. I think that precedes what we are dealing with here. Matthew presents that testimony, "then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory, and all the nations shall be gathered before him" (@Matthew 25: 31). It is a judicial throne, discriminating between the saved nations and the unsaved nations. It is really a question of how the Jews, the Lord's brethren, who serve Him, have been treated; the nations who have ill-treated them will go into everlasting punishment.
W.B-w. Do you connect this session with the last half week of @Daniel 9: 27?
J.T. Yes.
H.H. It will not be Christ by the Spirit, but Himself in His own body.
J.T. I think so. We cannot set that aside. "Every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him" (@Revelation 1: 7); that is *Himself*, I should say. "For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man" (@Matthew 24: 27). There can be no question about it, it is He.
A.N.W. How will the nations walk in the light of it? Is that administratively?
J.T. I should say the light coming out administratively. There will be, as I was saying, great detail, subdivisions of all this. The saints will be divided up to rule over cities, some over ten, and some over
{476}
five. The gospels show there is a great deal of detail in the working out of the divine thoughts in that day. Here it is presented in one great subject in the heavenly city. It is a solid cube of persons. What an immensity of persons all to be disposed of under Christ! In regard of the garden of Gethsemane He disposed of those He had. In that day He will dispose of them in wisdom so that the universe is ruled. I apprehend the saints in heaven will be available to the saints below. Not that we are earthly or on the earth, but the Lord has been here, and we are like Him. We shall be available in some sense to God's earthly people.
S.McC. That will be on the line of the visitations we have in the Old Testament, coming in contact with the saints on earth.
J.T. You can see how heavenly visitations come in in the Old Testament. We are told, "when the sons of God had come in to the daughters of men" (@Genesis 6: 4). That was evil. But then we have the angels coming down, three persons coming to Abraham, heavenly visitants; and many other instances. We have in these instances the idea of how we may serve in the future, how active the saints of the assembly are going to be. What intelligence we shall have, and how we shall influence all below. The Lord says to the apostles, "ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (@Matthew 19: 28). They will be in holy liberty and intelligence; the whole universe really will be replete with life and liberty of communication.
E.McK. @Zechariah 14: 20 says: "In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness unto Jehovah". The very animals themselves belong to Jehovah.
A.R. If one of the saints rules over five cities, what will his influence be in relation to Jerusalem and Palestine?
{477}
J.T. Ezekiel would show that Jerusalem below will reflect Jerusalem above. @Isaiah 65: 18, 19 says, "I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice over Jerusalem". Both the heavenly and earthly cities being called *Jerusalem* intimates the special link between them. The one hundred and forty-four thousand upon mount Zion (@Revelation 14) learn the song sung in heaven. The singing is "before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders", showing additional evidence that the earthly Jerusalem is immediately linked with Jerusalem above. Our part, as the heavenly city, in exercising influence over Israel and the nations, develops out of our present experience in administrative matters in the assembly.
E.P. Would the solidity of this cube and its immensity be in line with the principle, "Altogether that which I also say to you" (@John 8: 25).
J.T. There is no discrepancy at all in the city, its composition is so systematically and perfectly according to Christ. It is wonderful. There is nothing at all like it in the whole universe, a solid cube of persons. We have to take it in spiritually; how are we to be together in this way? We are to be amenable to divine measurement. Measurement has a great place in our scripture; each of us is to begin with the idea of his measure, otherwise we will not fit in with this great city.
C.H.H. The truth comes to us objectively and we are to take it in.
J.T. Yes; this is a cube. The length of the temple was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty (@2 Chronicles 3: 3). The length is greater than the breadth. I suppose the *length* of Solomon's temple is the divine measure that God has in His mind in His house, but the breadth is not as great, nor the height; that is, it is not equal to the heavenly city. The heavenly city corresponds to the divine measure in every way,
{478}
it is a cube, so that the work of God in us is equal to His thought for us. That is what is meant, the counsels of God must be completed to the letter; to the smallest measurement. In the Old Testament, in Solomon's temple, the length was greater than the breadth or the height, so that we have not perfection there.
C.H.H. In connection with the house in Ezra it speaks of the height and breadth, but no length (@Ezra 6: 3).
J.T. There is some doubt as to those dimensions, no length being given. If the text is accurate the work of God in the returned remnant is stressed rather than the divine thought of the house, which is in mind in the length of Solomon's temple.
J.W.D. Is what is indicated here our exclusive service in the millennium, or will the assembly function Godward as well?
J.T. What we have here is toward Israel and the nations, what has come into testimony from God; but what is toward God would be more the result of Paul's work, he sets up the service of God, and that will go on eternally.
W.W. I do not understand "a hundred and forty-four cubits, a man's measure, that is, the angel's" (@Revelation 21: 17).
J.T. It is a *finite* measure.
A.P.T. Are the saints the governors elect; already elected, but not in office?
J.T. Just so. "The elect of God". "But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified" (@Romans 8: 30).
We have been dealing with the millennial state of things and how God is to be known there; it is a wonderful subject and we have hardly touched it; but we must now go on to the eternal state in the
{479}
beginning of the chapter. After the final judgment spoken of in chapter 20, I suppose the millennial saints will all merge into the eternal state of things. They do not go into the eternal state in flesh and blood, they do not continue in that, that is another thing made very clear, but they do go in. Eternity is the final thought. There will be many families all set in relation to the Father. Every family in heaven and on earth is named by Him. The first part of our chapter here contemplates the assembly coming down in that relation; it is new creation, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more" (@Revelation 21: 1). We see how God is near in the tabernacle, and how He serves His people. It says, "And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall not exist any more, nor grief, nor cry, nor distress shall exist any more, for the former things have passed away ... And he says to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And he said to me, It is done" (@Revelation 21: 4 - 6). The note says, Perhaps 'They are fulfilled'. The whole matter as to new creation is finished.
A.R. Does what is masculine and feminine go into eternity? He says, "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (verse 2). Then he goes on to say, "the tabernacle of Go is with men".
J.T. The masculine and feminine go through in Christ and the assembly, all else is *men*.
A.R. Are we in relation to Christ in the feminine sense, and in relation to God, as men?
J.T. Yes; the feminine thought will be in the assembly. There will be no 'men and women' as far as I see. The Lord says, "they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection
{480}
from among the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage; for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection" (@Luke 20: 35, 36).
C.A.M. New creation really takes us beyond that.
J.T. Yes, it does. That is what I understand. It is a question of men. Of course, the word 'men' will include all the saints. It is a question of the order of being that God has special pleasure in, and with whom He will dwell. The idea of male and female is retained in Christ and the assembly.
W.G.T. It speaks of the marriage of the Lamb.
J.T. That is recorded in @Revelation 19: 7 - 9. "Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. And he says to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb". That, I should say, is before all this, it is as Christ takes us to be with Himself. It is the "Lamb" and the bearing of it is millennial, but of course the marriage relation remains, and this enters into chapter 21: 2.
A.P-f. "I saw a new heaven and a new earth". Is that the eternal state?
J.T. That is right, "a new heaven and a new earth".
A.P-f. Does it include both heavenly saints and earthly saints?
J.T. It is the final sphere, where all the families of God are eternally. The original thought of God as to heaven and earth remains, only all will be *new*.
A.R. In the service of God we go beyond what is feminine and touch what is masculine in *sonship*, do we not?
{481}
J.T. Yes, although the marital relation between Christ and the assembly does not cease. There is the masculine and feminine side in the early part of the service. Song of Songs makes room for that. We must have the marriage idea, the bridegroom and the bride.
C.H.H. You spoke of three circles. Will the assembly still be in the inner circle? Will God tabernacle in the assembly?
J.T. I suppose the assembly will always retain its own peculiar place. It belongs inside -- that family having the first place with God. Paul and John converge in this. There is no veil in the heavenly city, there is no distance at all between God and us. There is no other family that has that place.
E.P. Does that come out in what John says, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth"? In connection with the millennial setting, an angel showed him the city. Chapter 21: 1 is to bring out the inward side.
J.T. Yes. It is not a question of *showing* in the beginning of the chapter, the thing is there to the spiritual eye. John was capable of seeing the new Jerusalem. He sees it without his attention being called to it; but the assembly in relation to the millennium is *shown*.
S.McC. It is wonderful -- "God himself shall be with them".
J.T. That is beautiful. "God himself shall be with them", and then, "their God". You are reminded of, "the Father himself has affection for you" (@John 16: 27). The word *Himself* brings in the Person, that is not representation, it is Himself, so that we are near to God. The mediatorial side is not stressed, we are directly with God, and He with us. "God himself shall be with them, their God. And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes;" and then "the former things have passed away ... Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write, for
{482}
these words are true and faithful. And he said to me, It is done" (@Revelation 21: 4 - 6). "It is done" -- new creation is complete. Then we have a further thought in verse 7, a word for us now in the light of this eternal glory. "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". The *overcomer* will be regarded as a son. It is the only time we get John using the word *son* as applied to the saints. It is very striking; the relation is on *moral* ground here. In Galatians it is "by faith in Christ Jesus", the Spirit of adoption making it good.
J.W.D. What do you understand is the link between the tabernacle of God and His people? "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men". Did I understand you to say that the tabernacle of God is the assembly? What link is there between the assembly and men in the eternal state?
J.T. I suppose the idea is that you view yourself as of the assembly, but a man nevertheless.
J.W.D. I thought that the men were connected with the new earth?
J.T. That will be so, but the idea goes wider than the assembly, it will take in all the families of God, but the assembly, although composed of men, is the tabernacle of God. I would not like to give up the idea that you are a man, and I am a man. We meet each other in the city and we speak to each other as individuals.
'Thy saints, O Lord with Thee In glory met'.
We shall love one another, there is only one Spirit, there will be no social gradations, we are all free together.
W.G.T. "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" (@John 1: 14). Is that the same thought?
J.T. That statement is to bring out the reality of Christ's manhood. He was available to Simon the
{483}
Pharisee, but He was contemplated by His disciples as an Only-begotten with a Father. Here we have God dwelling with men. Sonship in the chapter is connected with overcoming (verse 7); this is in keeping with the book of Revelation. Those forming the assembly are all sons according to Paul's doctrine, and they have the Spirit of God's Son, and this will give character to the tabernacle in which God will dwell. Divine affection will pervade the whole position; the love of Christ for the assembly, and the love of the assembly for Christ will be there, and the Father's love pervading all. Everything will radiate these affections -- the Father's for Christ and all the sons, and Christ's affections for the bride, the assembly, and they will never grow dim, they will always be fresh and new.
E.McK. The thought of the tabernacle as seen in @Exodus 40: 34, would appear here; "the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle".
J.T. The allusion would be to that. It is a tabernacle, only not in wilderness conditions. It is *with men*. Look at what the tabernacle is, she radiates bridal affections; Christ loves her supremely and she loves Him!
W.B-w. The bride is for her husband, and in the tabernacle, which is another view of her, God is with men. Is there order in the chapter in that way?
J.T. Yes. The whole position shows what blessing lies before us.
H.H. Do you include administration in relation to what is eternal?
J.T. I think so. We shall not always be sitting down!
H.H. I mean administration is apparently connected with the city. Do you regard the city as going through eternity?
{484}
J.T. Yes, only it takes the form of a tabernacle. "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God". That is what I see here. The need is for us to sit down and say, What does this mean? The city implies order, influence, administration. If you get a meal in a saint's house, he is administering something to you, it is the administration of love. We shall not be sitting down looking at each other all the time, we shall be active. Heaven is aglow with delight when a sinner repents, for instance; we have inklings of what is there, the great activity of love.
E.McK. Abraham supplied a meal for the three heavenly visitors, which shows how love in the saints responds to God.
J.R.H. "I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou has loved me" (@John 17: 23).
J.T. That is a very blessed state of things, that kind of love in us, and the Father's love for the Son is in us too; abundance of love, and the relations in holy liberty.
J.S. There could be no weariness if it is a question of bridal affection. It is all most precious.
J.T. Affection will be prevailing in all its variations. The bride's affection for Christ, Christ's affection for her, God's affection for His Son and sons, and Christ's affection for His brethren. Think of the currents of love! The Spirit active in all -- the Father, the Son and the saints. Even now the Holy Spirit helps us, opens the heavenly door, so that we can realise it all a little.
S.McC. To what extent will the sufferings of Christ engage us in these conditions?
J.T. They will certainly engage us in the millennial day. They are more prominent at the threshold;
{485}
the sufferings of Christ are represented in the altar. The altar was at the threshold of the house, in the court. The question is whether we need that inside, whether we need any incentive to love Christ beyond His own Person.
S.McC. It has been said that He ever bears the marks of His passion.
J.T. There is much that is needed to be understood in this respect. The atoning sacrifice of Christ, the blood of which was placed on the mercy-seat, is the basis of everything in the service of God; this should always be before us; but there is much instruction in the Scriptures covering what Christ is in *Himself*. In the Song of Songs for instance, there is nothing about His sufferings on the cross, and yet much about His love for His spouse and hers for Him.
Then, the first type we have of Christ and the assembly is Adam and Eve in @Genesis 2. This was before sin came into the world, and hence the idea of suffering was not there. It was *sleep*. It was a figure of Christ's death, but not in the sense of suffering. The assembly in type there is not contemplated as having had, in its members, a sinful history. Another fact to be mentioned is, that Luke and John do not record the forsaking of Christ by God, which clearly implies a modification of His sufferings as recorded by Matthew and Mark. There can be no doubt that the more we are with divine Persons, in holy intelligence and liberty, the more we love and worship Them, because of *what They are in Themselves*, rather than because of what They have done. This will enter particularly into our eternal conditions.
S.McC. Do you think in any way the death of Christ will be before our hearts in eternal conditions?
J.T. We cannot say it is out of place. I think what the Holy Spirit would stress is the Person of
{486}
Christ in eternal relations. You do not need anything more. Still the Lord says, "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again" (@John 10: 17). It is a question whether that side of the truth is not for public testimony. The sufferings of Christ in love enhance His Person, but when you are with Him I think His Person fills you. We have to make room in our minds for a condition to which no sinful history can be attached. New creation involves this. The assembly's real history in this sense *begins with Christ in death*.
J.W.D. Eve being taken from Adam's side, would that not enter into our constitution?
J.T. It does. We can hardly think of Ishshah speaking to Ish of his "deep sleep" as suffering for her, but it is true that Christ loved the assembly and gave Himself for it. The assembly, however, did not exist, save in purpose, until He had given Himself and the Holy Spirit came. Man said, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman [Ishshah], because this was taken out of Man [Ish]" (@Genesis 2: 23). There is no previous history of Ishshah. The love that existed between them would be because of what they were in themselves. This is a feature of the truth and that is generally what comes out in Song of Songs. But in no sense am I overlooking Christ's precious death.
A.N.W. There is no suggestion of suffering in that view of Christ and the assembly, it is before any thought of sin. Sin is out of sight, it is a question of the Person of Christ and of the assembly.
A.P.T. You love Him for what He is, not only for what He has done.
J.T. In the Song of Songs the spouse says nothing about her lover's wounds. I am only seeking to promote exercise and inquiry as to how the truth stands; whether the sufferings of Christ stand more
{487}
in relation to us in our imperfect state here than to our perfect state in eternity.
W.B-w. On the mount of Transfiguration they spoke of His decease.
J.T. Yes. The death of Christ was before them. That entered into the testimony of the gospel. If Moses and Elias had a place in the glory, Christ must go that way.
S.McC. Mr. Darby's hymn reads:
<blockquote>'And spotless in that heavenly light <br>Of all Thy sufferings talk'. (`270:2)</blockquote>
J.T. That would be in public relations I suppose. I am far from minimising His sufferings, but I think we ought to make more of the *Person* of Christ, and be more absorbed with Him.
A.P.T. The Lord says to one, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? ... and he did him homage" (@John 9: 35 - 38). It was a question of the Lord's Person.
J.T. "The Jews therefore said to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am" (@John 8: 57, 58). We have to understand *who* the Person is. "In his shadow have I rapture and sit down" one says (@Song of Songs 2: 3).
{488}
IDENTIFICATION OF THE SAINTS
@Revelation 7: 13 - 17; @Song of Songs 3: 6; @Song of Songs 8: 5; @Genesis 48: 8, 9
J.T. These scriptures raise questions as to the saints -- as to who they are. Inquiries are made as to them in different relations. Who are they? They, therefore, suggest that we are to be known from whence we come, and where we go; first, as redeemed, and then as coming out of the wilderness in a collective sense, and finally, as to our family relations -- sonship. I thought that an inquiry into these scriptures would help us as to our calling and destiny and our present characteristics. The first question in Revelation is raised by an elder with a saint as to who certain saints are. The passage introduces the thought of eldership, showing that an elder is concerned that the saints should be known according to what they are as of God. It is not a question of inquiry as to all nominal professors, but as to those who are genuine. Elders are much needed, for the saints need care, shepherding; and this elder, one of the twenty-four representing the thought fully, is concerned that others shall know who the saints are. The inquiry should lift us out of mere religious settings, mere religious positions, if we are in them, and enable us to take our places according to God. So that the answer is, in the first case: "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb".
Ques. Does this give us a very elementary thought in regard of the saints?
J.T. Well, the most elementary thought would be new birth, but as to our public position this would be elementary, that is, we have washed our robes. This is not only an historical fact, but
{489}
has a moral significance; they have *done* it: they have done it themselves.
Ques. Is it a reference back to the fact that they had palm branches in their hands?
J.T. Quite so. The earlier account is by the prophet John himself, "I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb". That is a formal statement by John; the white robes and the palm branches indicate their moral state; the palm branches alluding to victory.
Ques. Would you say how you understand the thought of washing our robes in the blood?
J.T. The blood of Christ has cleansing power: it cleanses us from all sin (@1 John 1: 7). As I said, it is not merely an historical statement -- it *is* historical -- but it has a moral bearing. "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb". The tense would show that the thing is done, it is completed. In the first chapter the Lamb, the Lord Himself, does it for us, He "has washed us from our sins in his blood". The last chapter of the book speaks of those who wash their robes, without mentioning the blood, they wash them, they do it, but here the blood is used by this great multitude. It is said in chapter 7 that "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed". The word *come* is characteristic showing that they are of that class -- *the comers out* of the great tribulation. They have not succumbed. They are continuously characterised as having come out of it: they are not overwhelmed in it. The washing is mentioned as in keeping with all this.
{490}
They have not had recourse to ordinary methods, religious methods, but "have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb". They are intelligent persons. They come out of the great tribulation; others doubtless have succumbed to it, but these have come out, and intelligently use the testimony of the death of Christ.
Ques. Would you regard them as having overcome the world in that sense?
J.T. Whatever the great tribulation involves, there would be tremendous pressure to divert them, but they come out of it.
P.T.F. What is the difference between being washed from our sins in His blood, which He has done, and these saints washing their robes in His blood?
J.T. Believers happily ascribe their redemption to Christ, the washing of course having its own force, and primarily He does it; but in this case, I think the stress is on their intelligent use of the testimony of the death of Christ, because the use of the blood is a question of accepting the testimony to the death of Christ. There is the Spirit, the water and the blood -- "they that bear witness are three". The Spirit is the witness, and the water, and the blood. "It is the Spirit that beareth witness", and in our case He brings to bear upon us the testimony of the death of Christ which is the water and the blood; the cleansing by the blood of Christ being judicial, and the water being moral, dealing with our *state;* so that it is an intelligent appropriation of the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, for cleansing. I think it denotes an advance on chapter 1, in the understanding of these persons, although chapter 1 covers this as to the value of the blood. The believer readily ascribes praise to Christ for everything, only the Spirit would stress what we do in intelligence, as feeling the need of the blood.
{491}
Ques. Paul writes to Titus saying, "according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit". That is what is done for us, then it says, "I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works". Is that the doing it for ourselves?
J.T. Well, the good works would be a witness to the reality of our faith. Washing our robes in the blood is an intelligent appropriation of the death of Christ for cleansing.
R.G. Is it in view of service? They served God, the passage says.
J.T. Well, the elder goes on to tell us that. So that we get a true account of such believers, at any time. "Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them". "Before the throne" would indicate an intelligent apprehension of the throne. The elder is calling attention to intelligence in these believers; this great multitude that no one could number. So that it seems from this account, as if we might learn the need for definiteness about us; an intelligent use of the testimony of the death of Christ. As they go on to the throne these believers are intelligent, they are not affected by national feeling or politics, they are standing before the throne of God and they serve Him day and night in His temple.
J.S.E. Is that why it is said of their robes that they "have made them white;" they go the whole way, and are clear in themselves of every element that would stand in the way of their serving God?
J.T. I think that is good. Thoroughness marked them, they had *made* them white.
J.S.E. Does it not say "have washed ... and have made them white" -- as though there are two
{492}
distinct thoughts, to emphasise the diligence with which they have gone into the matter?
J.T. Yes. It certainly is important to go the whole way in the use of the death of Christ, for our robes allude to what we are externally, it needs the application of the death of Christ to all that we are.
Ques. Is it more the *water* cleansing in the 22nd chapter? "Blessed are they that wash their robes".
J.T. Yes, and I think it is continuously characteristic of the persons; they are *the washers* of their robes. The general moral condition is in view. The blood is for the conscience.
Ques. Are you making a present application of the principles of the great tribulation?
J.T. Whatever has the character of tribulation to believers would be in mind. There is not much to be said of anyone who has not experienced tribulation. These are they *who come* out -- it is characteristic of them, not simply historical.
P.M.K. Would you connect that with what the apostle Paul says in @2 Corinthians 1: 8 - 10, "Our tribulation which happened to us in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond our power, so as to despair even of living. But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver".
J.T. That was a great experience for the apostle and those with him, but the general thought is that believers go through tribulation. @Romans 5: 3 contemplates that we do, but it works patience.
R.G. What is the thought in the expression "the blood of the Lamb"?
{493}
J.T. The Lamb is the Sufferer. This book contemplates Christ as suffering; the thought runs through the book.
Ques. Would this application of the death of Christ bring us into moral conformity with the throne, so that we should be free for the service of God?
J.T. Just so, the *throne* has a political bearing; and washing has to do with the filth of this world and ourselves, the white robes are over against all that. The throne is a political thought, it is over against all authority in this world, and we are before *that* throne, the throne of God. All other thrones, whatever they are, even if we pray for them, are subservient to this one. This book contemplates that a throne stood in the heavens, all others are tottering, but this one stands, it is the throne of God.
Ques. Would that be a continuous thought for us now?
J.T. It is the attitude of mind that you have before God. Whatever claims there may be -- and you would recognise human governments, and recognise God's hand in them -- this is the great primary and eternal thought of the throne of God. That must have the first claim. Whatever other claims there may be, this is the primary claim, it is constant.
Ques. Does the thought of *day and night* suggest the way in which God is served?
J.T. It is a statement that is found frequently in Scripture; in this connection it alludes to *continuance* -- changes that affect men generally do not interfere with it. Like Anna who was in the temple night and day; and Paul says, "our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night".
R.A.E. Would you distinguish a little more between the washing with the water and the washing
{494}
with the blood? They are both connected with the death of Christ.
J.T. They are both judicial, but the blood is particularly so because it is a question of sins, actual transgressions, actions against God. Sins are evidences of lawlessness, and God must deal with them; their existence affects the conscience, and the conscience judges them as before God. The testimony in the blood of Christ, that God has been satisfied in regard of them, satisfies the conscience. Of course, the water is also judicial but less so; it deals with our *state*. It comes in later in soul history; the believer does not discern the state he is in at the outset; he discerns his sins, for these are discerned more readily, there is forgiveness of them indeed, but there is no forgiveness for the *state;* the state is dealt with judicially -- "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh" (@Romans 8: 3). It is condemnation of our state. The second cry of our Lord on the cross related to the judgment of the state of man. The first cry, I think, was in relation to man's guilt, but the second cry in relation to man himself, as set aside judicially in Christ's dying. He had to die in order to set aside the man who had offended.
Ques. Would this scripture imply that the persons marked by these characteristics would not come under the power of the world?
J.T. That is in mind, the palms are in their hands, and it says, "he that sits upon the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them;" showing how favourable the throne is to them -- they are standing before it. The more we stand before God and His authority in Christ, the more benefits we shall prove; the throne is favourable to us. Romans 3 speaks of our sins as dealt with, Romans 6 of our state, but chapter 5 is the kingdom. It is what comes to us through Christ, and I believe the more
{495}
we recognise that, the more benefits we shall come into. "He that sits upon the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them". He is honouring them as standing before the throne. That is a great point at the present time, that we should learn to stand before the throne of God and fully recognise all He has established in Christ.
P.H.H. Are we strengthened in that as having a link with the Lamb in the midst of the throne?
J.T. Quite so. The Lamb is slain; He is all powerful, but He has suffered.
P.H.H. Would you say that the experiences of the saints in the book of Revelation are in some sense to bring us into correspondence with the Lamb, ending up with the great thought of the Lamb's wife who has made herself ready?
J.T. Quite so, it runs through the book; the Lamb is a term in this book that indicates a sufferer; the word used is a diminutive throughout. He is passive in sufferings; and we are brought into accord with that, so that we are sufferers, we are not rebels against any institution of God, we are before the throne of God, we accept the attitude of suffering.
Ques. Would Paul, in @Acts 27: 23, when he says, "God, whose I am", be like one standing before the throne?
J.T. Exactly. I think we shall get help in our souls in seeing that *this* elder, representing the great principle of eldership, is calling attention to the saints, "who are they?" he says. He is one of twenty-four, representing all experience essential to an elder; they are crowned elders, and are fully intelligent as to all that enters into the thought. He is calling attention to the saints, "who are they?" I think it is a very important matter that each should have in his soul a sense of who he is, and that others should know who he is, and what he
{496}
is; he owes it to the Lamb. The throne is favourable to him so that he is victorious in all circumstances; however much he has to suffer he never suffers as the Lamb suffered, he is victorious in all circumstances, as it says they have "palm branches in their hands". Having them in their hands is an intelligent thought, they know what they are doing. The elder says, "Therefore are they before the throne". The "therefore" shows that what is said of them is the outcome of something, as though it is due to God. In the earlier account, they are saying "Salvation to our God".
A.J.B. Does the "therefore" convey something of stability to those who stand before it? They are on firm ground knowing the reason for their being before the throne.
J.T. Quite so. It is the outcome of what they have been through: they have that right and privilege, and it is due to God that they stand there. In verse 10 it says, they "cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb". In what they are saying, they are fully on God's side. It is a very important matter that we should be on God's side; in our meetings for prayer, and in all our prayers, we are to take sides with Him. The great issue is against Him, and we are with Him, not only in the conflict, but in regard of His thoughts in the gospel, and in the assembly. God is before us and we are with Him. Then we are told, "And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and strength, to our God, to the ages of ages. Amen". All the angels are in this, but these redeemed ones are leading in the matter, they are saying, "Salvation to our God". So that the position
{497}
it contemplates is that we are with God in all He is doing.
Ques. Would Exodus 15 show how wonderfully Moses entered into that great thought -- the way the song of salvation opens up?
J.T. Just so, and Israel too. The lovers of God take this attitude, they are with God, and everything that is against Him and dishonours Him, they overcome. That is why these redeemed ones are so thoroughly on this line, and the elder thinks it worth while to raise the question as to who they are. I believe at the present time those who are faithful take sides with God, and God is not ashamed to be called their God. Like Abraham, they are His friends.
S.J.H. The passage says, He "shall spread his tabernacle over them". Would you say a word as to how that is worked out.
J.T. It is a remarkable allusion to *His* tabernacle. It would be where He dwells. It is intended for us as a protection -- He "shall spread his tabernacle over them. They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more". It is a touching allusion to His care -- how very real the idea is, *His tabernacle*.
Ques. Would the promises made to these form a basis for our prayers?
J.T. I think they would. You mean this tabernacle would be spread over us?
Rem. You mentioned the prayer meeting and being thoroughly with God in it. I was wondering if these promises would give us a basis for our prayer, that we may really prove what His promises are for those who are before the throne; not only is there protection, but "They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more, nor shall the sun at all fall on them, nor any burning heat; because the Lamb which is in the midst of the
{498}
throne shall shepherd them, and shall lead them to fountains of waters of life, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes".
J.T. I am sure it would. What is said of them here is akin to what is said in chapter 21 of those who are saved. It is very like it, showing it is the eternal conditions that are in mind. We come into that now, and I believe the point for us is that, as those who love God take up this attitude, God calls attention to them. To the assembly in Philadelphia, the Lord says, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee" (@Revelation 3: 9). That may be very abstract, but still it ought to be in our minds, that the Lord calls attention to His people as they take sides with Him, and He would make it effective for our support; He is not ashamed to call attention to those who love Him. Who are they? He loves to portray, before the eyes of others, what they are -- that they may know I have loved thee.
W.C. Is there something analogous in the book of Ruth when Ruth comes to the feet of Boaz; he said, "Who art thou? and she answered, I am Ruth, thy handmaid".
J.T. She says, "spread thy skirt [or 'wing'] over thy handmaid". It is very akin to the divine tabernacle being spread over us. There are many other instances in Scripture, but that is one of the instances of a question being asked as to who people are. When we get to heaven the *Who is who* book, so to speak, will tell who we are; just as down here God signifies His people if they are worthy of it.
Ques. John seems slow to answer, but is the question raised to stimulate the exercise with him?
J.T. I should say so. He is very respectful, he says, "My lord, *thou* knowest;" he would let the elder

tell him. This is a great matter, and he does not want to attempt to describe them; he would let the elder tell him, that is the idea; the elder knows, it is the principle of his very being, he knows the saints: he knows what they are to God, and he delights in seeing them correspond with God, it is his business to bring them into correspondence with God.
P.T.F. Would the tabernacle in all its perfection be seen on the mount?
J.T. Quite so. Peter would have "three tabernacles", but there was only one, and the cloud coming out indicated that the glory was on Christ.
J.S.E. Is it akin to the thought of the shadow of the Almighty in @Psalm 91?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. @Isaiah 4: 1, 5 seems to be in keeping, it starts with, "And seven women shall take of hold of one man in that day", as though they were recognisable, but it finishes with, "And Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and over its convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke, and the brightness of a flame of fire by night: for over all the glory shall be a covering". Do you think it is in keeping?
J.T. Yes. You see how we are cared for; it is the result of what we are as answering to God.
Now, in the Song of Songs we have a more advanced view of what we have been engaged with in Revelation 7. Here in the Song of Songs it is a permanent thought, and, therefore, would have allusion typically, either to Israel, or to the assembly; for the present purpose it would be the assembly. "Who is this, she that cometh up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant?" No one tells us here, but it is a question to have before us. There is no answer given save that the subsequent verses 7 to 11
{500}
indicate that she is related to Solomon; that is, related to Christ. He is seen immediately; for verse 7 reads, "Behold his couch, Solomon's own;" he has his own couch; he is viewed by himself, but verse 6 indicates clearly that she is in relation to him; that is, Israel, or the assembly, in relation to Christ in these circumstances. So that the Spirit immediately goes on to Solomon and he has a couch which is his own. He is not dependent on religious organisations at all, he has his own requisites, he has his own needed things; and "Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty of Israel. They all hold the sword, Experts in war; Each hath his sword upon his thigh Because of alarm in the nights". Solomon is a great personage, and he has his own couch, and he is surrounded by these persons, they are all vigilant and military experts, he is looked after; and then it says, "King Solomon made himself a palanquin". He made it himself, it is his own. That is, we are reminded of what Christ is; He is wholly independent of all religious organisations about us, He does not need them at all, He spurns them, He only regards what is His own. The palanquin, we are told, is "Of the wood of Lebanon". That is an allusion to great personal dignity; in the anti-type, to the quality of the saints. "Its pillars he made of silver, Its support of gold, Its seat of purple;" that is what he has done; it is all his own; he is seen in entire independence, as this personage comes into view. He is worthy of her, and she is worthy of him. As soon as the question is raised as to who she is, Solomon is introduced personally, as much as to say, we had better let Solomon indicate; and the subsequent chapters tell us plainly enough what he thinks about her. As soon as this question is raised as to who she is, Solomon comes into mind. It goes on to say in verse 10, "The midst thereof was paved with love By the daughters
{501}
of Jerusalem". He admits all that, but he is independent of all else; it is what is his own which engages him, but what the daughters of Jerusalem do, they do in love, and hence it goes on, "Go forth, daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart". So, in the midst of what is most delightful, the answer to the question of verse 6 is, What I have *seen;* not what is said about Solomon. She stands related to him -- therefore "go forth" and behold him. She is coming up out of the wilderness in @Song of Songs 8: 5, "Leaning upon her beloved", that is a closer, and more intimate touch. In chapter 3 she is coming up by herself, not "leaning on her beloved".
Applying it anti-typically, chapter 3: 6 describes those who recognise the Spirit collectively; we do not come up out of the wilderness in our own strength; it is not a mere religious movement, it is a movement in power -- really in the Spirit. The wilderness would mean that part of it after @Numbers 21: 17, where the Spirit is recognised, the well is recognised -- "Rise up well! sing unto it".
Ques. Would you say a word as to "perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant"?
J.T. It alludes, I think, to the *formed* condition of the assembly; the smoke would be an allusion, I suppose, to the sacrifices, but they are formed; a pillar is a formed idea; it is not scattered by the winds, but is something tangible; you can see it belongs to her. She is to be seen in this character. There is love amongst ourselves; it is not vanishing; it is a formed thing.
J.S.E. What would be the thought in the "powders of the merchant"?
{502}
J.T. I suppose they are the best to be had. The allusion to the merchant would mean that they are bought, it is the principle of sacrifice; not that the house of God is a place of merchandise, but it alludes to getting the best and paying for it. The Lord tells those in Laodicea, that He will sell them the things they need. It means that things can be acquired, the very best can be had if you want them; you value them, and you pay for them.
P.H.H. Would these features somewhat correspond to what Balaam says about the people after Numbers 21? Referring to their strength, and to their goodly tents, spread forth like valleys, like aloe trees, which Jehovah hath planted?
J.T. That would be what a man who had had his eyes opened could see. The answer to the question here in Song of Songs 3: 6 is surely that it is all in view of Solomon, it is the Spirit's work bringing us to Solomon. Every feature is evidence of the Spirit's work -- of the formative work of the Spirit. Then chapter 8 alludes to a further and more intimate thought, that is, she is "leaning on her beloved". "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved"? As Christ is known in the assembly, this applies -- leaning on Him.
Ques. Do I understand you to mean that the first is more the way we came up out of the wilderness to have a fresh experience of the love of Christ; but in chapter 8 it is more what flows from that, as leaning on Him, and having fresh experiences of His support and love?
J.T. That is it. You have liberty to do that. It is increased knowledge of Christ that affords you liberty to do that, to lean on Him. Earlier, in chapter 2: 6, it says, "His left hand is under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me;" but now we have to learn to *lean* -- and a known Christ affords
{503}
us liberty to do this: we have learned how to lean on Him, as our Beloved.
Ques. Have you in mind the breaking of bread and the subsequent assembly experiences?
J.T. Quite so. There we get the idea of what is meant, to get away from the mere figure to the reality of the thing.
R.T. Would leaning on her beloved have in view the service of God?
J.T. Well, where will He lead now? There is more than that in the assembly service, we are led out and in; it is a question of where He goes. The figure here does not go that far.
Ques. Would this bring out the beauty of the marital link and the wonderful intimacy in consequence of it?
J.T. I think it indicates intimacy; it goes on to say, "I awoke thee under the apple-tree: There thy mother brought thee forth; There she brought thee forth that bore thee;" meaning that she is brought up under the new covenant. The apple-tree, as already alluded to (chapter 2: 3), is distinguished among the trees of the wood; it refers to Christ; she is nurtured under His influence.
Ques. What is in your mind as to the new covenant?
J.T. I think it is how Israel will be nurtured by and by. The idea of the new covenant is to establish us as to divine love, lest we should be shaken or uncertain -- not sure of our ground. The reminder is that she had been brought up there. Now she has confidence, she is leaning on Him.
Rem. Here it is more the confidence begotten of love known in an intimate way, rather than the full sense of union with Christ.
J.T. Yes, it is more that here because he said, "I awoke thee under the apple-tree: There thy mother brought thee forth". The present Jewish
{504}
condition is distressing beyond measure; as the apostle says, "Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which is now, for she is in bondage with her children" (@Galatians 4: 25). They are all in bondage, the whole idea today of the earthly Jerusalem is bondage -- "the Jerusalem above ... is our mother". This principle cannot be applied to the Jews today at all, for they have taken on a terrible character; but presently they will take on a different character, because they will be brought under Christ. "But when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away" (@2 Corinthians 3: 16): what a change! The veil shall be taken away, as soon as they turn to the Lord. They have not done that yet, but this alludes to the time when they will, and be brought up under the knowledge of Christ; the mother will be no longer in bondage, but Jerusalem set free. In Galatians 4 the apostle drops the thought of the covenant in regard of us; he says, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother". Instead of applying the thought of a free woman, Sarah, as representative of the new covenant, he brings in a greater thought, namely, the heavenly Jerusalem, Jerusalem above; a very great thought, not simply in heaven, but *above*.
W.C. Is there any link between the two references to the mother -- first in chapter 3: 11, and then here in chapter 8: 5?
J.T. It is his mother in chapter 3, corresponding somewhat to Revelation 12 where she is seen as Christ's mother. In chapter 8, the mother is Jerusalem, as she will be presently, reinstated under the new covenant in liberty.
Ques. The first part of verse 5 of chapter 8 is in the present tense, and the latter is in the past. Would the latter show how the Lord would bring us to this leaning on Him; not a question as to where He will go, but she is available to Him and in His support all the time?
{505}
J.T. We are set free and have confidence; really we cannot have assembly service unless we are in the confidence which divine love inspires.
Rem. So that these two thoughts refer to us in the wilderness. In the third scripture we have sonship.
J.T. In @Genesis 48: 8 Jacob says of Joseph's sons, "Who are theses?" "Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here". Notice the word *here*. The allusion is to the gentile position, and Christ's present position as God hides His face from the house of Jacob. Christ is among the gentiles, and these *sons* are what he has there. Joseph says, "whom God has given me here". It seems to me that we may nestle under the fact that we are gentiles: it is fruit to Christ in the Egyptian world, the gentile world -- "whom God has given me here;" and Jacob, the father, brings them up to the level of the sonship, they are brought up to the level of the sonship of Reuben and Simeon. As Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine, he says earlier (verse 5). This is a further thought, and links on with what we have had as to leaning on Christ. We are now elevated to sonship, and it is not less than the full thought. Our sonship is not inferior to any, in fact it is the supreme thought, association with Christ.
Rem. The father says, "And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine". It seems to be a wonderful link in the ways of God although sonship relates to counsel.
J.T. It seems to be that: "whom God has given me here".
P.H.H. Jacob says that, before he has seen the sons, but verses 8 and 9, which we have read, are what he said when the sons are actually brought
{506}
to him. Is that the order in assembly service; following on the leaning on the Beloved, we are brought as sons into the presence of the Father?
J.T. That is all very beautiful. They are brought to him, it says, "Bring them, I pray thee, to me, that I may bless them ... And he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them". It is all very beautiful; it is the result of being elevated really, and yet they were born in Egypt. "Whom God has given me here", Joseph says. It seems to me that we are brought into this realm of supreme affection, typified here; the Father giving us the full place of sonship and embracing us: "he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them".
S.J.H. Is the order in which we reach these things the same when we enter into matters in the assembly, the feminine side first, and then the masculine?
J.T. The masculine is the greater, I think; that is sonship. God has predestinated us to sonship.
{507}
HOW EVIL IS SHUT OUT OF THE SERVICE OF GOD
@Genesis 15: 11; @Matthew 9: 23 - 26; @John 20: 19; @1 Chronicles 3: 5
These scriptures treat of evil being eliminated or shut out of the service of God. Sin is still in the world. It entered in by one man and spread down the race so that it is in the world. God began to deal with it immediately it was found there. The new man is of an order where sin is not let in; it refers to character and quality, and is inclusive of all persons who are created anew, for it is new creation, man in new creation.
He will not allow sin in but will keep it out. The Lord Jesus, coming in, became Man and dealt with sin. He was made sin, a most touching and far reaching thought, that we might become the righteousness of God, the sure way of keeping out sin.
So this principle was seen in Abraham who is called in @Galatians 3: 9 "believing Abraham". The Lord beginning to operate excludes sin. The two thoughts, authority and holiness, exclude sin.
Authority in my mind represses sin or excludes it. Holiness operates with authority in the believer; the mind is subject. It will lead us astray unless we have authority over it.
The new man is created in truthful righteousness and holiness. All this is resident in the believer and Abraham is the example of that. Believing Abraham is accounted righteous by God. Therefore I deal with him first under this heading. Young people should take this in; because I am a believer I am to be in the service of God. Abraham had been a worshipper before but now his faith is counted to him as righteousness.
God enlightens us. Abraham says, "How shall I know?" (@Genesis 15: 8). The best of us only knows in
{508}
part. So there is an immense field opened up. "How shall I know?" is a good question. You need to know. God has ordained that persons should be shown things. The eunuch did not have to wait long before he was shown (@Acts 8: 35). Children are sometimes taught what he was reading; I had to learn by heart chapter 53 of Isaiah. The man that could show was there in Philip the evangelist, and he began to expound to him the glad tidings of Jesus.
I do not have to wait long; if I seek knowledge, I get it. The eunuch is an excellent example for young believers. It is an important thing to know. The eunuch says "What hinders ... ?" Now is my opportunity. The water is there. If there is a need in my soul everything is there to fill it. Philip was there too; God put Philip there and He put the water there too. The eunuch needed Philip first and then the water. We find that as we need things spiritually they are not far away. Water was here in the desert!
Baptism is not an ordinary thing, it is not the idea of taking a bath. The way Jesus went, down into death, into the waters of Jordan was His own way. John baptised Him. Think of it: His own way! Philip baptised the eunuch; there was no standing on dignity with him; he went down into the water with him. The water was there and movement belonged to it. In christendom, baptism is full of manner and form; we should see the divine way. The Spirit of God was so pleased with this service that He caught Philip away. From then there is an ellipsis as far as we are concerned. He was found at Azotus. We are not told what happened in the intervening period. He was raptured; so the rapture will not be new to him.
The eunuch went on his way rejoicing. This indicates the state of his soul. It was a spiritual way.
In @Genesis 15: 9, God told Abraham to take certain
{509}
creatures of which He specified the ages. Abraham as a cattle owner would know the ages of his animals. He knew, and he was moving as a man of faith. The creatures were to be picked out of many, "a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old". The ages of the birds are not specified but he was to select the heifer, the she-goat and the ram, each of three years old.
He slays them but the identity of the pieces of the creatures is to be maintained. Identity goes through into resurrection. What is Satan doing about all this? He is bringing in degradation by means of unclean spirits, the birds of prey. The devil is after hindering the initial service in a believer. We might not think that there was much harm in these birds, but they are defiling. What thoughts arise in us at the beginning of a meeting? Are they from the devil? You cannot serve unless you keep them away, scare them away. "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (@James 4: 7). We must resist in faith or what we are doing will be defiled. How we are to keep away these suggestions is the first point. When the fowls came down Abraham scared them away, so we are not to be afraid to scare these things away when they come.
The next element to be dealt with is the flute-players in Matthew 9. The Lord had been sent for to raise Jairus¬ daughter. It was His own service. The service of God enters into our households. The matter in connection with Abraham was an individual one, but Jairus¬ daughter is a household matter and a collective one. The brethren are connected with it. Death can invade the believer's house. When Josiah died Jeremiah lamented for him; and it says that the singing men and women continued that lament "to this day", (@2 Chronicles 35: 25). These singing men and singing women had
{510}
lost their spirituality and that was shown in the continuance of the lament. There are, of course, true singing men and singing women. There was unbelief in this house in Matthew where the child was thought to be dead; the possibility of raising her was not thought of in that house. Those who were there considered that it was a finished matter. But Christ had been left out as to that household. Jairus brings Him in; he, the head of the house, had gone to the Lord, the Prince of life, the only One who could attend to this matter; He is the Originator of life. The flute-players being present showed that the whole thought had become degenerated. Have we faith as to our households, our children? If we have we will follow it up and scare away that which will bring in death. On the way to the house, the woman is healed of the issue of blood and the child dies. In the Lord's mind she was not dead at all. There was no evidence that the wife was not with her husband, but she did not stop the sending for the flute-players; they were a purely worldly thing that had to be put out as the scripture says. The Lord is the Prince of life and He brought in real spiritual feelings. Let us take notice; the first point is to scare away the birds, the second is to see that when the Lord comes into the house He says to this worldly element, "Withdraw". They did not go, but derided Jesus. The Lord says, "The damsel is not dead, but sleeps". Think of the mother listening to the Son of God! "The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live" (@John 5: 25).
They had hired the flute-players, but the Lord says, "Withdraw". His mind was that the child was living; they thought not and would bury her. They were put out; the house was cleared of this deadening influence, unbelief. It says that when they were put out, the Lord went in. Notice the words -- it is
{511}
the way of Christ. Now the wife sees the result of the prayers of the head of the house: "he went in and took her hand". It is the service of Christ, as was Abraham's. What is put out is stressed, their presence there is an evidence of unbelief. They must go. Their presence was a hindrance to what was in the Lord's mind. We do not know how long the journey to the house took, but the absence of the head is marked by unbelief on the part of the wife.
They were put out and that is what the home needs. Put away what damages the children. Let us look around and see if death is not brought in as a fruit of the unbelief of the wife. The word in @1 Corinthians 11: 10 speaks of authority on the woman's head. In the husband's absence the wife can be in authority. The head returns and finds evidence of unbelief. The Lord says that they must go. It is coming out; Matthew is naming what is there; the flute is a wind instrument, melodious, but it tends to banish faith.
The Lord took her hand and the maid arose. The whole position was marked by lack of faith. The maid arose -- Matthew does not enlarge on it at all. The woman just touched the hem of His garment and was healed. Now the child rose as the Lord took her hand. She rises spiritually. It brings out the wonderful character of what should be in our houses. The Lord should not have to come in for this. The father, the mother, and the little children should do it. He took her hand and she rose up.
In John 20 it is a matter of keeping out the Jews from where the disciples are gathered. The Jews are not equal to this; they are legalists. Keep them out without making much ado about it. John presents the spiritual side but Luke enlarges on the matter. John just says, 'Shut the doors of the house
{512}
wherever you are; do not admit the Jews'. The Jew is the outward man; the true Jew is in spirit; the outward man is a legalist. Brethren are often marked by legality and most of our troubles arise from it. There was not one legalist at all at the first meeting of the brethren. Christianity is a question of the spirit. There was not a trace of them. John shows that abstractly and fundamentally they were not there. "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture" (@John 10: 9). Jews are not there; they would limit you. Abstractly, fundamentally, the place is clear of that element; if it were not so the service of God would be hampered or limited.
To augment the matter, it says in Chronicles that there were four thousand doorkeepers. Wonderful position! Solomon is on the throne and we are immediately told that the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward, man by man. In Numbers it is babe by babe, but these are not babes; they are saints viewed as men. It is not the number in fellowship in a general way but one man, two men, three men. All are looking after the doors; they have to keep out all that was against what David had in mind. It was four thousand that praised the Lord on instruments of which David said, "I made ... to praise therewith". David is Christ; we are the instruments.
Every meeting of the assembly is a great occasion. Nothing must mar the full effect of what David has made. Each instrument has its own doorkeeper. "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world" (@John 17: 6). Those wonderful harps! They are not flutes but are stringed instruments. The Lord would love to take us round and show us these things which He has made. Every instrument is a doorkeeper. "Harp-singers
{513}
harping with their harps" (@Revelation 14: 2) is most remarkable. Every note is heard and each one is in unison. David says, "Which I made". You must keep right, or the Lord must stop, as a bandmaster does when the sound is not right. There are four thousand doorkeepers and those four thousand are praising Jehovah. There is no room for anything else in the temple. So you see how important it is to keep out evil. So the Lord can say that He made those for the eternal service of God.
{514}
DIVINE IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED AND THE REACTION THEREFROM
@Genesis 26: 24, 25; @Genesis 28: 10 - 22; @Joshua 5: 13 - 15; @1 Kings 3: 5 - 15
I have in mind to speak about divine impressions that are received and the reaction therefrom. A series of meetings of this character affords to God opportunities and conditions in which He can operate. They afford family conditions which He has designed and created and in which He has part. Life with God eternally is family life.
I speak now of the conditions that family life affords for divine operations, particularly in the nature of appearings. Meetings after meetings of this kind link on to what one might call glory: "From glory to glory". God is the God of glory. Stephen calls attention to Abraham, the first of the patriarchs. The God of glory appears to him, then to Isaac, later to Jacob, later to Moses, then to Joshua, and later to Solomon.
I refer to Stephen particularly. He says, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham" (@Acts 7: 2). We are not told this in Genesis but Stephen's remark throws light on the whole book of Genesis. To an eye like Stephen's the God of glory is written on this book. He is seen appearing to a man living in Mesopotamia whom He tells to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house. What is the reaction? Again He appears to Abraham and tells him that He will bless him. What is the reaction? What is the reaction of this meeting in this city and near-by towns? There is to be a reaction in all the assembly. It is for all of us. Divine impressions are intended to abide. The work of God stands; it is indestructible.
We have the advantage of these appearings, the very thing, not the example only. The Spirit of God
{515}
takes up all these things so that the right reaction of these meetings may be experienced. "All these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come" (@1 Corinthians 10: 11). The glory of God came to Abraham. What of these three days? God would have us value them aright. Everything dedicated is kept in the treasury by the storekeepers and doorkeepers so that nothing is lost.
The reaction with Abraham was that he came into the land of Canaan. The great question for us at the end of these meetings is, 'Do I come into it?' Abraham definitely came into the land and after that there was another period in which he was confirmed in what he had come into. He built an altar after the second appearing, not after the first. Things are progressive. The altar indicates a sacrifice; it is thus most touching to be reminded of the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God. Let us take it in. Have I an altar? Have I anything to put on it?
Isaac follows and he also builds an altar. He was in Beer-sheba after well digging, an important occupation. We are not fresh if we have not the use of these wells. Beer-sheba means the well of the oath and there is freshness there. God acted quickly and appeared to him the same night that he arrived in Beer-sheba. We are going to disperse tonight; the principle is camping and decamping. What is going to happen in the removal and in the travelling? The ark has a resting place. What are you carrying away from this encampment to the next? Are you scaring away the fowls, all evil, as Abraham did? Abraham is the father of all believers and God says, "I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake". The fathers are in mind but He says, "I am with thee". It is by shallowness and carelessness that we miss the
{516}
blessing but He says, "I am with thee, and will bless thee". That is His attitude. Isaac built an altar there at Beer-sheba. Often localities are blessed by God, this city or that city, so God sees to it that Jacob later comes to Beer-sheba and has to do with God there. All this sets out experience in the covenant of God; He says, "I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac". The mention of Isaac which God adds to this blessing refers typically to Christ risen from the dead. The young are apt to think of self. Do not rely on it. In @Genesis 26: 25 we are told that Isaac "built an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah". He pitched his tent and there his servants dug a well, the well of the oath. You must see that the Spirit is in you. Judge yourself. "Lean not unto thine own intelligence" (@Proverbs 3: 5). You are dead in Christ. To be calling on the name of Jehovah is to be in a happy consolidated position.
I go on to Jacob. He had an appearing but it is called a dream. God took that way with him as He did with Solomon. None the less it was a real matter; God was there. God does not dream but He may say something to us in the visions of the night, so we do well to keep our minds free. The Lord appeared above the top of the ladder and Jacob was at the bottom; angels were ascending and descending on it. In verse 16 you see that Jacob awakened out of his sleep. So he has to go back to his normal place. You have to go back to the place where there are things that may defile. Do not put yourself in the way of them; "Keep thyself pure" (@1 Timothy 5: 22). "Youthful lusts flee" (@2 Timothy 2: 22). I cannot keep from evil if I allow any form of it in my house. Jacob says, "How dreadful is this place!" But he quickly reacts towards what is right and says, "This is none other but the house of God". That is victory. So he "rose
{517}
early in the morning, and took the stone that he had made his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it. And he called the name of that place Beth-el". The final reaction is at this point, at the most important place in this scripture; it is named because of a right reaction: 'This is the house of God', and he anoints the stone; it is no longer a dreadful place. We do not have to with literal stones, but we have to deal similarly with thoughts that form us for time and eternity, that give us permanent enjoyment.
I go on to Joshua briefly. He was near Jericho, the seat of the enemy's power, and "he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies?" The use of the words 'us' and 'our enemies' indicated that Joshua was in a somewhat low condition. We quickly look around for supporters if we are in an issue. Do not support any side in a matter. This man with the drawn sword is not going to support a side. He says, "No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come". In principle we do not make the Lord's people our adversaries: I have no issue but Christ, no one else. Then it says, "Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant?" All impressions from God are to return to Him: if a reaction is right it will be toward God. God is to be enriched as a result of His gracious ministry, and thus Joshua is changed to a worshipper. This Man is Christ Himself as Captain of the army of Jehovah. He came to test them, to see where they were, whether they were thinking of God or of their own side. Now is the time for the Captain to take charge; we have to learn that everything is in His hands, and that
{518}
He is watching all the time, and is coming to take charge.
Right will stand so that when the Lord comes in, Joshua reacts in a fine way: "What saith my lord unto his servant?" The Captain of Jehovah's army answered, "Loose thy sandal from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou standest is holy". You may be clever in presenting your side but it must be on holy ground. The beautiful thing is that Joshua reacted to the truth and recognised the holiness of the Person.
Finally I would call attention to Solomon's reaction in 1 Kings 3. The account in Chronicles does not give so much credit to Solomon as this does. Here it says, "Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah". It does not say that in Chronicles; there it is: "Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen ... And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones" (@2 Chronicles 1: 14, 15). You might go back to your good business, but that is not a good reaction. God is pleased with Solomon's answer to "Ask what I shall give thee", and He says in effect, 'I will do more for you'. The reaction to this is that Solomon is so impressed that he stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and offered. He stands before the ark which typifies Christ come down in love. Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith; it is a question of the love of Christ and the operation of faith: "being rooted and founded in love" (@Ephesians 3: 17). Solomon is there and the ark of the covenant is there. As the angel said to Mary, "*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest" (@Luke 1: 32). Solomon offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, suggestive of fellowship. If we retain what we get now we shall be equal to the next occasion,
{519}
if our conduct is equal to it. Solomon is equal to it, so that when the women come to him with the child, he can tell whose it is. He stood before the ark. So it is important in all difficulties with us that none are lost and that all are saved in life.
{520}
LIMITATION
@Job 37: 10; @Genesis 22: 13; @Luke 19: 29, 30
I have in mind to speak about limitation. I began with the book of Job, a book that is intended to help saints and sinners, and amongst the things employed of God are several features of creation that are mentioned in this chapter; the verse read alludes to ice. It comes in under the head of Elihu's discourse. There had been the discourse of Job himself, and the discourses of his three friends. Job's discourse was always self-commendatory; there was not another like him, he thought, in the world. And the speeches of his friends were condemnatory of him, balancing his own eloquent speeches of self-commendation and self-praise. Then we have Elihu's speeches, calling attention to God in His works; and finally, we have Jehovah's own direct speeches or discourses to Job; the great Creator and Upholder of all things graciously spoke to call attention to some of the things He had created so as to bring one man to conviction of his own state and to show the interest of God in every one of us. He succeeded with Job, and Job wisely in the course of his experience stopped talking. It says, "The words of Job are ended;" and so room is made for the evangelist, the representative of God, to say something. He did not join in with the three friends; it would have made a fourth. He waited for all of them to finish; then he had a clear field. And that is exactly how God has set the gospel so that He has room to speak to men, shutting up every mouth. God waited long and allowed men to speak. In the days of our Lord Jesus Christ, who served on earth here as a Man, He allowed men to speak, to say anything to Him and He answered them, sometimes not saying anything. But He was ready to answer
{521}
according to the questioner. "Answer a fool according to his folly" (@Proverbs 26: 5); and again "Answer not a fool according to his folly" (verse 4). The Lord was ready to answer any questions. The day of Pentecost ushered in a clear field for God, and He had everything ready. Time never caught God behind. The day of Pentecost was a remarkable time, an appointed time that was being accomplished; and God was ready. Peter, after the Spirit came down, stood up and spoke to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the men of Judea, men of Israel. He said, "Give heed to my words" (@Acts 2: 14). That was God, and so it is that God has a clear field. He perhaps could not speak to everybody down on the street or in the rendezvous around the town, but He has a clear field here. Every one here has come in here, and this chapter from which I have read in Luke says, "But as they were listening" (verse 11). God continues on; hence it is while men are ready to listen that God continues to speak, and for the moment, He is speaking about His Son.
Now Elihu, as I said, comes in as having a clear field to speak to Job, and he uses hundreds of created things, as it were, as texts; and he uses the idea of frost. He points out that God has in the creation wonderful instruments for dealing with men. Thank God, for the present time is a time of good, not evil! And He has these great things. He has the thunder that startles you when you hear it; and not only the noise, but the flashes come, stirring up your feelings and calling you to attention. You cannot but be called to attention as the thunder roars and the lightning flashes. Elihu does not fail to call attention to these things. And then he uses remarkably the snow, for instance, in verse 6. "Fall on the earth", God said to the snow. You say, It is simply snowing. What is the 'it'? Who is doing it? God says to the snow, "Fall on the earth". It is
{522}
God that is doing it. You see, creation brings God to you; and why is it on the earth? Well, God says, I will have that to allude to later when I am talking to men and women who are sinners and who know that they are sinners. You may have sins like scarlet. That means that everybody knows they are sins. They are not hidden things. Most sins are hidden, but when they are like scarlet, it means they can be seen. The eye cannot fail to notice these scarlet sins. God says, Now I have got the snow, and I will make those sins whiter than snow. What a fine gospel word that is! What is the snow on the earth? There it is in volumes, in great capacity. I do not know how much it cost the city of New York to get rid of the snow that fell the other day. God caused it to fall, but did anybody in the city of New York think God put that snow in the parks and on the streets? Did anybody ever think that God put it there to remind him of purity, for purity is a great quality with God, and that He can make you as pure as that through the blood of Jesus. How many, do you think, in New York thought of that? They have been doing their utmost to get rid of it and perhaps rightly, too; but I am speaking of how God put it there as testimony, and He would say to the blackest sinner in the underworld of New York and on the Eastside, 'Though your sins be as scarlet, I can make them as white as this through the blood of Jesus'. Some one here may have sinned and there are others who know about it. Others have sinned and nobody knows about it but themselves, but nothing will be hidden. But the more scarlet they are, the more you will appreciate the wonderful cleansing value of the blood of Jesus.
And then he uses remarkable language in the same verse. "And to the pouring rain, even the pouring rains of his might". That is what cleanses the world. It is not the blood of Jesus. This is like
{523}
the deluge to cleanse us from filthy habits and thoughts. The blood of Jesus cleanses you from all sins, but there are roots and conditions in your soul capable of sinning and doing nothing else but sinning, and the believer finds an abundance of water that God has supplied to cleanse him from these, too -- "the pouring rain, even the pouring rains of his might". The greatest evidence of that, I suppose, was in the deluge. Sceptics are sceptics, but they talk about the deluge. They are very fond of quoting profane witnesses, but when they come to the deluge, they can find testimony to it everywhere. They cannot deny it; there is an evidence of the deluge everywhere in the human race and the greatest evidence of God's power in rain. The windows of heaven were opened, we are told, and the fountains of the great deep, too. "All the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened" (@Genesis 7: 11). It rained for forty days and there was no rain like it; the rain of His might, which cleansed the world.
And then we have remarkably here in verse 7, "He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work". That is a definite thing. God can do that. He does not have to put men in prison to do that; to tie them with ropes as Samson was tied. God brings things to bear on men when He likes, and there are terrible things coming over men. They will cry for mercy and want to die because of conditions, but here God sealeth up the hand of every man, as if every man would say, What can I do in the presence of this? Take the storm we had here last September, in the East particularly, the terrific gale that we had. Well, what will any sensible man say when things like that happen? Take an earthquake. What can anybody do? God brings things to bear on us, you see, that your hands are tied up. "He sealeth up the hand of every man" so
{524}
that every one says, Well, it must be God or nothing. What a fine conclusion that is as a man comes to that point: I can do nothing, but God can do everything! That is what Job finds out. "I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine" (@Job 42: 2). He said that after God had spoken about His own creation. Have we all come to that: that we can do nothing? You can do nothing to save yourself. Only the blood of Jesus can wash away your sins. Only the power of God can raise you from the dead. You will die in a few years. Let nobody doubt that! In a few years, old or young, you must die. How are you going to overcome that? I speak soberly to people. There is death staring you in the face. How are you going to meet it, for you will have to meet it and go into the grave. What after that? You need the power of God even if you die in your sins and go into everlasting perdition which you certainly will. Hell is a real word. Do not be fooled. It is a real word and it is chosen by the Spirit of God to portray the intensest possible judgment and suffering. Let nobody be sceptical about it. "And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment" (@Hebrews 9: 27). It comes to you individually. It is appointed unto you once to die and after this the judgment. How is all this thing going to be? These are all 'futures', I might say. That is a word much used, but they are certainly futures that will have to be met, and how are we going to meet them? We have our sins piled up and nothing done about them. There is plenty done about them by God, but there is something to be done on my part, namely, to believe. "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom *he* has sent" (@John 6: 29). That is all I have to do; to exercise faith in God. Have you been looking into this matter? Have we all looked into it? Has the
{525}
matter been settled? It is the most important matter conceivable for young people, this matter of soul salvation. And God did this so far, he has sealed up the hand of every man that all men may know His work. You see, my hands are tied up; not, as I said, with prison walls, not with ropes or chains, but with things that God brings to my attention that my mouth is stopped, my hands are tied, and I say, God must come in. Let nobody say that he has not been sealed, for if you are honest men, you are sealed. You say, I can do nothing; God has done it. Your part is to believe, you see. "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom *he* has sent". It is the work of God. Is there anybody who does not believe Him whom God has sent? Jesus says, "He that hears my word" (@John 5: 24), and you are hearing it now. It is the word of God, the word of Jesus. "He that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal". Think of that! It all corresponds with this wonderful statement of Jesus -- "and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life" -- *is passed;* not *will pass*. Marvellous statements these! Are we ready for them? It is the work of God. God seals up your hand -- every man's hand, so that you might know the work of God.
And then it goes on to say, "And the wild beast goeth into its lair, and they remain in their dens" (verse 8). That is the work of God. That means that Satan is going to use every effort and tell me that if I believe tonight, I will have to go to school tomorrow and meet difficulties I cannot overcome. I have to go to the office, and I know Satan will not let me alone. This scripture says, "the wild beast goeth into its lair, and they remain in their dens". God can bind him up on your account. Jesus said to Satan, Go away. He did not send him to any
{526}
place. He told him to get behind Him. Will God do that for me in the school tomorrow or the office? He can. It says these beasts go into their dens and remain in their places. It is God. God is acting like this for His people. I am not saying that Satan will not come to you, for he goes about like a roaring lion. God allows him to, but he can only do what he is allowed to do. God spoke to Satan about Job. "And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah" (@Job 2: 1). "And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job" (verse 3). It is as if He would say, Have you considered John So-and-so in this town? It is a similar thing. Yes, he says, I know him. He has been tempting you. You have fallen to his temptations, you see. God challenges him, and Satan says to God, You hedge that man about. Thank God that He does hedge us about; He does protect us! God says, You can do so-and-so to him. You see he could not touch Job without God's consent. It is most solemn if I am touched by the devil and God has allowed that, but if He does not want me to be touched, I shall not be touched. He protects me from the devil. The wild beasts go into their dens and stay there as far as I am concerned. Is this not comforting truth? Put out your hand tonight; do not be afraid of what will happen tomorrow. God will see to that. He looks after you. Salvation means more than just salvation from eternal judgment; it means salvation from evil at the present time.
And then we have further here: "From the chamber of the south cometh the whirlwind; and cold from the winds of the north. By the breath of God ice is given; and the breadth of the waters is straitened" (verses 9, 10).
{527}
It is by the breath of God. This is the first time you get that. You say, Well there is the north, the Arctic regions are frozen up. Well, God did that. God does that for a purpose, but it is not so much what is physical as that God so binds you up that you are straitened. You cannot turn to the north, south, east, or west. I believe everybody with whom God is working comes to that point. You cannot turn; you are bound up with the ice. It is a figure: a most solemn thing. It is circumstantial that you cannot turn to the right or to the left. There you are; in a moral sense, you are bound. God must come in to loose you, and He does. "Also with plentiful moisture he loadeth the thick clouds, his light dispels the cloud" (verse 11). He causes the rain to come, and He causes the south wind, we are told (verse 17), that is, the time of release will come. The thing is to accept what God does. He binds me up in my circumstances in a moral way. I can do nothing. I am cast about and blame this one and that one, but it is God's doing. I am bound up and straitened by the ice, by the breath of God. This is a peculiar matter, the breath of God. It was by the breath of God that Adam lived. It is a remarkable thing that. Man is distinguished in that way; made to live by the breath of God, and yet it is by the same breath that God causes this thing in me that I am bound up and I cannot move; I am frozen, as it were. I must look to God to save me because He has control of the winds, and presently my clothes become warm; but I am speaking of historical circumstances, how a person comes to the end of himself, bound up, and can do nothing. This peculiar thing that God brings to pass is His own breath. It must be of very great consequence in His mind when He does this by His own breath. It is no mere accident; He is thinking of you in it. 'I want to bind you up so that you will turn to Me
{528}
and away from yourself'. That is what this book brings out, and Job came to this. He was just tied up, and now he says to God: "I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee" (@Job 42: 5).
Think of God's going to all this trouble for one man! In the end it is complete blessing for that man. Think of what God is! He has been working with individuals in this way during all these centuries since the days of Job. He does not save everybody at once. He saves one individual after another. He goes to all these pains so that He reaches His end. Man says, It is finished. I now see thee. "I had heard of thee ... but now mine eye seeth thee: Wherefore I abhor myself". I do not abhor the cold north wind. It does not say that. I do not abhor these three friends of mine any more. He says, "I abhor myself". That is the work of God. It is a masterpiece of God to bring a man to that, but see the pains He takes to do it!
Well now, I want to show you how the Lord Jesus came into this. There would be nothing in the gospel at all if He did not. It is not a question of His being tied up circumstantially as with us poor sinners. The Lord could never be tied up circumstantially. They took Him to the brow of the hill on which the city was built to cast Him down headlong. They would have done it, no doubt, but they did not do it to Him. He could not be bound at all by circumstances. So in this remarkable passage in Genesis, we have a type of Christ in the ram held by its horns in a thicket; not held by man's hands. The passage says: "And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns" (@Genesis 22: 13).
{529}
The horns belonged to Himself, part of the Lord Himself. We get that in the type, even the horns of the brazen altar were of itself. It alludes to the power of Christ; the horns were a symbol of power. Well, why should He be caught in this thicket? The ram represents qualities in Christ. Isaac is the beloved son. It is the Person of Christ, but He carries with Him peculiarly the beautiful affections of Christ for His Father. How delightfully the gospel of John presents them to us -- the beautiful reciprocal affections between the Father and the Son. "The Father loves the Son" (@John 3: 35; @John 5: 20); and "And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world" (@1 John 4: 14). That is what we get in the early part of John, and in chapter 6 we have the beautiful reciprocal affections between the Father and the Son. It is not His Son as entirely passive. It is with Abraham. Isaac is entirely passive and entirely subject without any full thought of what was in mind; so he represents Christ just to a point, and then we come to the ram. The ram is a type of Christ, too. Isaac is a type of Christ in the affections He has, the beautiful affections seen radiating between the Father and the Son, but we need more than that for redemption; we need the ram character. We need the will of God. The will of God must rule when it comes to the settlement of the sin question, and hence the Lord Jesus in coming to this earth says, "Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will" (@Hebrews 10: 7). 'I am not going merely to love Thee as a Man down here so Thou mightest have an object for Thine affections'. No: 'Lo, I come to do thy will' which is a more serious side. If He had not gone through the judgment unmitigatedly what would happen? We would all be consigned to eternal perdition. Let there be no mistake about that! -- a most serious
{530}
thing, and let nobody trifle with it. If I reject the will of God, reject what He has done for me, there is nothing else but eternal perdition, and so the Lord Jesus says, "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will". That is what enters into the type of the ram. The ram is a progenitive thought. It is full maturity and that is what we see in the death of the Lord Jesus -- full maturity. It is the Ram in the garden of Gethsemane. It is Isaac, but He says, "Abba Father", which would be first the will of God. The will of God helps Him. He says, "Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: -- but then, not my will, but thine be done" (@Luke 22: 42). Morally it was not possible. He came to do that, and now He is telling us how abhorrent the thought of being forsaken of God is. The Father is dealing with the Son; nevertheless, He says, "Thy will be done", and He goes into death. Now that is this ram. Abraham saw him there, which is another feature of Jesus held there by the will of God, -- "by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (@Hebrews 10: 10). Think of that! We are sanctified once for all by the will of God. The same will that was exercised in the creation is exercised in my sanctification, but through the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ, "by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ". Will I accept it here tonight? What have I come in here for? Ostensibly, it is to hear the gospel. The will of God is for your salvation, it is for your sanctification; but it is through the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ, this precious Offering, which is here typified.
So it is, Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son, meaning that the ram is a continuation of the son; that it is the same person. Will you not accept this
{531}
thing? -- this wonderful evangelical proposal of God -- "by which will we have been sanctified". Most of us here are christians, sanctified by the will of God, but by the offering up of the burnt-offering. There is no need for another. It is finished. The work of salvation is complete; there is no need for another. It is available and effective eternally. Will you accept it? That is what we are here for. You have come in here to hear the gospel; be true to the mission and hear and believe. One man said, "I believe, help mine unbelief" (@Mark 9: 24). He had said, "But if thou couldst do anything, be moved with pity on us, and help us" (verse 22). Think of a man saying that to Jesus, the Creator of the universe. The Lord says, "The 'if thou couldst' is [if thou couldst] believe: all things are possible to him that believes" (verse 23). Will you not believe it; accept it on the principle of faith? There is no other way. There are those who accept christianity as I might become a Mohammedan or a Jew, but the principle of faith is the only basis on which I can be saved; without faith, there is nothing. There is everything from God, but nothing for you without faith. You say, Well, how do I get faith? Well, *we* have it; why not you? It can be got, you see; it is available. I quite admit the scripture says, that faith is not the portion of all. It was not the portion of Judas. If Judas had lived for a hundred years longer than he did, he would not have been saved. He was damned, but I am not saying that of anybody here tonight. "Faith then is by a report", which is what I am saying tonight. It comes into your ear and heart. Faith comes by hearing or report, the report by God's word. Why should you not have it? You have the report. We have it; Paul and Peter did; millions of others; why not you? There is something the matter with you. It is something in the state of your soul. The devil is hindering you.
{532}
keeping you away from it. That is all I have to say about that wonderful type.
I just want to finish with what I read in Luke 19, and that is the last type, the colt tied; not tied by frost or snow or tied by God. He is evidently tied by some human hand on the outside of the house; meaning that somebody in the house has that colt, and he has tied him there and does not want him to rove about as a young man or young woman is apt to do; you have been put by your parents under the protection of God that you should be kept in the house and not take to the streets and wicked places in the towns and cities and ruin your souls. That is what is meant. Well, that is God through some agency, maybe your father with godly thoughts. God says, I am with that man. I heard of a father the other day; in fact, he told me about it himself. His son wanted to pursue some flagrant course, and the father said, 'In the name of God, I command you not to do it'. Why should he not say that? He has the protection from God; every father and mother has. And the boy did not do it. God helped that man undoubtedly in that command, so with this colt tied here at the crossways. What is so very interesting about this particular presentation is that the colt is tied in the midst of a beautiful group of cities or surroundings. They are spiritual, of course. They were physical here; there was Bethany, the place of love where the Lord went out and spent the night. If you should say, Lord, what does Bethany mean? I believe He would tell you it is the meeting. It is a place of love. That is what I found it. It is a fine suggestion for a young man or a young woman. There is not only the time of love but a place of love; that is Bethany. There is such a thing as that on earth.
You will never find it at the picture shows; Satan is there to darken your mind. That is why you are
{533}
tied. Satan is there and why should I let my children go there? Keep them out of it. He is tied there. So as I said, the Lord would tell him that Bethany is the place of love, where the Lord's people are; where the Lord comes Himself and where He finds a reception. "I will not leave you orphans" (@John 14: 18).
If you love Me, you will make a place for Me. That is what the Lord would say about Bethany. Then you have the Mount of Olives, which is the place of ascension. That is where I am going up from in a few days, the Lord would say. He would say, I am going into Jerusalem to die there, but I am going up from the Mount of Olives, and the Holy Spirit is going to come down afterwards for you. Then there is the great city of Jerusalem, full of holy thoughts; full of divine thoughts, in the Lord's mind anyway. He wept over it. You would have loved to ask Him why He was weeping, and He would say, Think of the history of that city. He would instruct your soul as to what Jerusalem was to Him. He wept over it.
So the colt is tied in all these beautiful surroundings. Why should that not soften you? If you do not want to go and you are not going, you can think about these things, and they are bound to soften you. If you live in a house where they read the Bible in the morning, that has a softening influence. You come to the meeting where God's people are, where they talk about God and Christ. These things will help you. The colt is tied there. It is by human hands. Maybe there is somebody like that here. The Lord is saying, Now, I want you. He sends two disciples -- that means complete testimony; they represent the Lord -- and He says, I have need of you. And we are here tonight to say in the Lord's power, The Lord hath need of you wherever you are. He has need of you. You say, The world needs
{534}
me, the Government needs me for the army and navy maybe. It looks as if they may -- a terrible thing to come. I would urge young people to prepare. Get to God. The Lord has need of you, and may keep off war because of you. He does, too. He will do anything. He will call upon the mass of creation here tonight to witness for Him. The Lord hath need of you. I was just finishing the gospel preaching last week when a little boy ten years of age came up and said, 'I would like to break bread'. I said, 'Why?' He replied, 'I think the Lord needs me'. A very remarkable thing! The Lord did need him, too. The Lord would say that to you tonight. We are all here to bear witness to that fact -- the Lord has need of *you*. Do not deprive Him. Do not thwart His will. It is too serious. May God grant that you may not deny that He has need of you, for His name's sake. Amen.
{535}
DEPTHS
@Revelation 2: 24, 25; @1 Corinthians 2: 10; @Mark 4: 5, 6; @Ezekiel 47: 1 - 5
I wish to speak about depths. There are the depths of Satan, as we read, and the depths of God, depths of earth, and depths of water. I refer for a moment to the depths of Satan, but with no thoughts of occupying you at any length, or in any detail, with these depths. They are to be avoided rather than investigated. Only few can investigate the depths of Satan. The Lord Himself shrank from meeting Satan; not that He feared him, but He shrank, being holy. So that Mark tells us He was driven of the Spirit to be tempted of the devil, showing that a servant ought not to turn to evil works with any alacrity, because only few can really touch them with impunity. The Lord met the devil and bound him. There was no struggle. One angel would suffice to bind him and put him into confinement for one thousand years. So that if we are obliged to meet him, we can rely on being overcomers as christians. There are various means of overcoming the devil; one is the blood of the Lamb. He is apprehended as an accuser of the brethren, an anti-priest in heaven. He operates to darken us and cause doubts in our souls. That is a very convenient way he has of attacking us, especially the young, causing doubts. We overcome him by the blood. "They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb". And again, resist him. You do not seek him out to resist him; it is when he attacks, he seeks us out. It is not for us to seek him out; he seeks us out. Were it not that God hedges us round in His sovereign, sometimes providential, way, we should oft be overcome. We see in the book of Job how God hedges His saints around. Satan told
{536}
Jehovah that. Perhaps we do not think on this, that God watches over us. Who of us, especially the young people, could stand were it not that in our youth God protects us sovereignly, and providentially too? At times we can scarcely attribute our deliverance to our own watchfulness; something happens; God acts to preserve us. So that Satan, as I said, seeks us out and when he does, when we come into direct contact with him, flattery is apt to deceive us. That is a mode he has of getting at us and discovering our weaknesses, our proclivities and he lays his bait for us. I need not speak much of this. Doubtless, if we are honest young people, we know. And then we are told to resist him. For instance, when Peter said, "God be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee" (@Matthew 16: 22), he appealed to the Lord to think of Himself only. It is a very common thing with us to think of ourselves only. When one suggested that to the Lord He addressed him as Satan. One of the most important things is to name what comes to you in the way of attack; what the medium may be; locate it in your mind, and name it in your mind, and decide what to do. If it is a Satanic emissary, there is only one thing to do, and that is resist it. "Whom resist, stedfast in faith" (@1 Peter 5: 9), it says, and again we are told, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (@James 4: 7). He knows if you stand up against him what you are possessed of. You have what he has not. You are superior to him; for in truth, he is a conquered foe. The Lord bound him. He called him a strong man, but the Stronger than he bound him! So that we have that wherein we can overcome, something that I could not stop to define. Satan has not got it. It is what is of Christ. Every believer is of Christ; he has what is characteristically of Christ, and wherever Satan meets that he succumbs. If we stand firm the temptation will
{537}
give way and victory is ours. But I am speaking now of the depths of Satan, just to suggest that there are such things as that, depths. The word is used too in regard of leprosy. In the measurement of leprosy by the priest we have a measurement deeper than the skin. The skin is not very thick, but thin as it is, if something is deeper than it, then it has to be dealt with accordingly; it is apt to damage the whole system. If it is superficial there is something between it and the system, namely skin. Skin is protective. Badger skins were protective on the tabernacle; they were evidently superior for that purpose. But the skin is for protection, and if something is deeper, then beware! it will damage the system. It is the priest's service to locate that and name it when it is deeper. But now I am speaking of the depths of Satan, and as I said, I do not intend to stay very long, but to suggest that they are spoken of. Those who name them use the phrase, depths of Satan. They attributed the knowledge of the depths of Satan and the participation in the depths of Satan to others than themselves. That is, those who were on Jezebel's side in the Thyatira state of things. Jezebel, that is Thyatira -- we have touched on it a little -- is a phase of the assembly's public history that admits of the grossest wickedness and the most sublime goodness and truth running together, parallel with the parable in the Lord's ministry in @Matthew 13 where the wheat and the tares grow together. The tares are deceptive, because they resemble the wheat. Those that represented the tares in Thyatira falsely charged the wheat (those that were the wheat were the genuine people of God), with participation in the depths of Satan. We can readily understand that, because the Lord Himself was charged with casting out demons by the prince of demons, by Beelzebub. Such is the effrontery of opposition, such as is in Thyatira,
{538}
charging the godly with the wickedness that they themselves were perpetrating. "As they say" it says, but the Lord is speaking to the "rest" in Thyatira. "But to you I say, the rest;" that is the remnant that did not know this doctrine, the doctrine of Jezebel. He says, "as many as have not this doctrine". That is it, they had not this doctrine, and had not known the depths of Satan. The Lord had them in mind in infinite discrimination. "His eyes as a flame of fire" moving about among this assembly. He drew near to it and exposed it. He exposed Jezebel and the doctrine that she taught. He comes to a certain number called "the rest", meaning those that are left, the remnant; "But to you I say, the rest". He addresses certain ones in that phase for that is the idea in the assembly's public history. It is the great leavened mass marked by Jezebel's wicked influence and teaching, but the Lord turns, after speaking to the angel about her and her wicked conduct, to a certain few, whom He calls "the rest", those in Thyatira who had not that doctrine, and who had not known the depths of Satan, as they said, what they called the depths of Satan. They had not known them at all. They were godly people. Perhaps history scarcely records such devotedness, such godliness, such holiness as was found in those days in the Middle Ages. For that is what is alluded to -- the individual integrity of the saints that the Lord addresses here. They were individuals. At that time there was no collective position such as we, through grace, occupy; but individuals were exposed to the north winds of Satanic power in those days, with little or no protection. They had divine protection. We have some of their hymns; they are some of the sweetest we have. History too, carries down testimony to their devotedness. The Lord says, "But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the
{539}
depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come". That is their position, awaiting the great moment called the Reformation when God opened the door leading up to the present time. For God acted slowly but surely. One of the most comforting things in the history of God's testimony is the slowness of God's actions but the certainty of His goodness; the sure end He reaches.
So that these devoted people in those days are carried down in spirit to us, and God has opened up the truth to us of the assembly, not the depths of Satan surely, but deliverance from them. Let everyone here search his own heart as to whether he is among those delivered from that, the depths of Satan -- the wiles and depths by which he holds his ministers as the book of Revelation clearly shows. But He says, "Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins" (@Revelation 18: 4). That is the voice today.
And over against this we have the depths of God. Think of that! What a relief to the mind to turn away as judging it in principle at least, although not investigating these depths of Satan, but knowing they are there and keeping away from them. You know they are there, and you know where they are. That is what these addresses to the assemblies are intended to do, to teach us as to where this and that is, and where the depths of Satan are. Keep away from them. Many are drifting in that direction, but over against that drift we have this, "Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins". And then the depths of God. What an attractive thought that is! How it enters into a meeting such as this, and what we have had already today, and have very often, thank God. One rejoices in the interest that is kept up in these meetings. It is delightful to heaven to see the
{540}
brethren attending these meetings, overcoming difficulties coming and going back. How God loves to let us, dear brethren, into the thought of His depths, the depths of His love. You will understand that the phrase "the depths of God" does not refer to what God is in His intrinsic Being, His abstract Being, "Dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see" (@1 Timothy 6: 16). There is no opening for us to enter into that domain because we are creatures. At best we can only think of limited things, but still there is the thought of the domain of God in the abstract, what He is, dwelling in Himself, I may say, "in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see". But there are the depths of God that the Spirit of God reveals, searches, for that is the word. The expression is "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God". Now how does He carry on this wonderful service? He carries it on in us. I say that so that we might be touched a little bit to make room for Him, for that is what the apostle is aiming at, that the saints at Corinth might make room for the gracious activities of the Spirit. He is operating to bring out the depths of God. It is God in this wonderful economy into which He has come. It is God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These Persons are God, They are commensurate, only of course the Son and the Spirit take a lower place in the economy to carry out the behest of love, yet the Spirit is equal with God. He is the Spirit of God, you see; He is God, and hence able to investigate the depths of God. It is not the Spirit in heaven, it is the Spirit here. God has revealed them unto us by His Spirit, "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the
{541}
depths of God" (@1 Corinthians 2: 9, 10). You understand that the Spirit is speaking about Himself through Paul. He is speaking about Himself as in the economy into which God has come and that economy requires the assembly. He is here in the assembly and so in the next chapter the apostle says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?" (@1 Corinthians 3: 16). Jesus Himself was the temple of God when He was down here. Think of the greatness of the thought that we, the saints, are the temple of God. It is in that that He is operating and He is bringing out, dear brethren, whether we believe it or not, receive it or not, He is bringing out the depths of God. Think of the word 'search!' He *searches* all things, He searches every one of us. Let no one think of escaping from that. Let us invite it! Let Him search us! We spoke of that here before, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my thoughts" (@Psalm 139: 23). Let the Spirit do it, He will search all things.
But then there are the depths of God. Think of Him doing that! He makes room for Himself in our hearts. That is what He does. Time would fail me to go into the types to speak of this, but under Isaac we have the idea of room, the Spirit of God giving room, one well after another, until he arrives at Rehoboth which means room. "Jehovah has made room for us" (@Genesis 26: 22); there is plenty of room for the well to spring up. Where is room being made? In our souls, because you know we are very shallow at best, very shallow. The Holy Spirit is obliged to occupy Himself in searching us out severally that we might know ourselves and name the things that hinder us, and in naming them judge them with authority and disallow them. The Spirit says, 'I am with you every moment in that and making room for Myself;' What will He do then? He will search the depths of God, that is what is
{542}
going on. If there is room in our souls then He will search the depths of God. The Corinthians were not making room for Him and that is why He speaks to them in that way. He says I have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, only as to babes, but babes in Christ for they had the status of real christians. What can the Spirit of God do in the way of search unless you allow Him to expose you to yourself, so that you might name the things that are within hindering, and judge them in authority and disallow them. He says, I am with you in that. That is the way of growth in us.
And then the depths of God! Think of how much the Holy Spirit had to do in Paul. We get the expression among the saints of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Well, the room had to be made. As I was saying, under Isaac room had to be made. If yours is only a thimble-size measure He will fill it, but He wants to fill a man. The Corinthians were not men hence the smallness of the ministry. He says I cannot say anything more to you, "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2). The point was to make room in their souls for the development of the truth and as soon as the Spirit gets room then you will have something of the depths of God, for the basis of His operations is in love in the assembly. The Holy Spirit dwells in you, hence you are the temple, but then the temple must afford room. You know, all of you who have read the Scriptures, that the tabernacle had a compartment called the holiest. It was not so large as in the temple. The oracle in the temple under Solomon was a cube, twenty cubits in height, meaning there was great room for the expression of God in that holy place. "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?" The Holy Spirit is able to operate even while you are sitting in the ferry or train or car.
{543}
He is able even then to bring you the highest thoughts if you make room for Him. You are not occupied with things that are of no value, you are open and ready at all times for the operations of the Spirit. We may read a passage or a book that helps us. He may bring the very greatest thought to you which you have never had before. Well, He is operating always in that way. And then you see the depths of God. "For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God".
Well now, I go on to the gospel of Mark to show what I have already touched on a little, the kind of ground that is requisite for this in us. There are four kinds mentioned. I selected this one because it uses the word "depth of earth". It is in a negative sense. There was no depth of earth. That explains a great deal as to conditions that arise in the history of God's people. Young people start out fairly well in the things of God and attend the meetings. That is what is pictured in this soil called stony ground. They receive the word and seem to be glad to have it. They tell the preacher, 'I confessed the Lord tonight', and the preacher tells others about it. They are not slack about that. Well, you want to wait. One speaks with experience about this matter. The more one sees of this kind of thing, the less one is inclined to count. Paul hardly ever counts. The Spirit of God counted the early christians under the twelve to bring out that there was real depth. He gives the evidence of it: but Paul hardly ever counts his converts. Sometimes we make much of one who receives the word. We are told, "immediately it sprung up" and the Lord later says, "Who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy" (verse 16). Watch that -- people who are buoyant at the first when they profess to believe. Joy in the Holy Spirit is the thing: that is the safe thing. We read of some converts of Paul's that were full of
{544}
joy in the Holy Spirit. That joy will be sustained; but the Lord points out this bad soil; although they received the word with joy it did not last. It says, "immediately it sprung up out of the ground because it had no depth of earth; and when the sun rose it was burnt up, and because of its not having any root, it withered". I am speaking mostly for young people; not segregating them, I do not think we should. But one might do that in one's mind in speaking, because this kind of soil is likely to be found in them. Young people are imitators and follow one another, and when a test comes, something happens and then there is exposure. What is the secret of it? No depth of earth. I want everyone here who is young to think this particular verse is for you. That is depth of earth. Have you got any? Do you feel that you are making headway in your soul? Are the meetings becoming more to you than they used to be, or less? Is a little persecution at school or in the office tending to dampen your ardour and to cause you to turn back? This is the explanation -- no depth of earth. A little earth, enough to receive the word immediately with joy. Nature is capable even of that, if I am following others, if I see a certain advantage in being recognized as a christian. Nature is capable of that, but it is untrustworthy. It is depth of earth that is needed. That is to say, there is some place for a root, because that is what the Lord mentions later, "they have no root in themselves" (verse 17). It is the root that gathers up the sap out of the earth and there is growth, permanent growth. All that, I hope, is very simple, but it is most practical. If you young people are to continue in the testimony you want to see to this matter of depth, depth of earth. It is earth, notice; it is a figure. It is earth over against stone. What is the stone? Your natural heart. Because the scripture says God is going to take away the natural
{545}
stony heart and replace it with a heart of flesh, which means earth in the figure -- what is capable of being impressed and yielding fruit. Look out for this matter, dear young people. Depths; over against depths is shallowness. Shallowness shows itself, alas! amongst us, painfully so of late. Hence the need of depth of earth.
Well then, the final thought is what Ezekiel speaks of; depths of experience of divine grace. You begin with shallowness, normal shallowness; there is such a thing as that -- ankles. But my ankles are as much a part of me as my head. So that it is a question of experiencing divine grace. You have often had this river before you, I am sure. One has often heard of it, spoken of it, too. It is a wonderful type. There is no time now to enlarge on the type. It flows out from the house of God on the south side of the altar. It flows out to the east side. They are called waters; not a river yet. It is waters flowing out -- most valuable. Think of the value of water of this kind flowing out from the house of God, from beneath the threshold of the house, where love walks. Really that is the allusion, where love walks. The threshold is where God goes in; every divine movement of love. This water flows out of that. It flows out of the right side of the house, south of the altar, because in order to be effective Christ had to die. The death of the Lord Jesus Christ is most touching -- the altar; and then it goes out to the east, and the prophet is brought around the north side. He comes down the east side and there it is, it is called a river. As he approaches it there is a man with a measuring line. This is most important for everyone of us. Because one knows in oneself in the things of God that one is casual and the idea of things being optional comes into the mind, whereas this man is doing business. He is a man of measure, and he is acting on the prophet, even on the prophet.
{546}
So that it is a question of each of us, even the most spiritual, "and he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the ankles". He did it. One speaks of oneself in this, and I hope it will appeal to everyone of us in this way. It is a matter not only of what I am doing, what I am taking up in my leisure, and when I have time to look into the Scriptures and take in things; but this man with the measuring line is doing things. He would do it with everyone of us now; laying it upon us. He would do the measuring, and cause you to go through. It is experience. I want you to have this experience. It is a measured matter; it is not an optional matter. This man is in business. He wants you to go through this thing; to have experience with God. Depths of experience, that is the thing. And so he measures another thousand -- there are four different thousands -- and it is to the loins. Well now you see depths. Of course it all depends upon the height of Ezekiel, whether he was a tall man or a short man; but it makes no difference to him, the loins are the loins whether I am tall or short. In my experience it is the same whether I am a foot taller or a foot shorter. The point is I am entering deeper and deeper into the experience of the grace of God. That is the idea, christianity is the real thing. It is a matter of a holy walk, but it is the grace of God. This man with the measuring line wants you to go through this. It is not optional, it is an imperative matter that I go through these things. You say, I have not time; but it must be so, it is a divine requirement. Everything must give way to the divine requirements in my soul, nothing must interfere. You say you do not know my circumstances, but God knows them and He brings it in here. First you have the ankles, then you have the knees, and the third measurement is the loins, and then the fourth measurement is the waters
{547}
to swim in. I omitted speaking of the knees, but it is just passing over one point. The loins refer to the lower affections, the feeling side, that I have come to this experimentally in my feelings, in my deep affections. Knees refer to -- anatomy enters into this -- you know how Peter fell at Jesus¬ knees and how Elijah put his face between his knees. Think of the experience of that, the exercise, the profound exercise. "I bow my knees", says the apostle. I apprehend when it comes to the knees it includes prayer. The ankles are joints too, that is, agility in walk. The ankle bones of the man were made strong and he walked and leaped and praised God. The knees you need for leaping, but the Spirit of God stresses the knees in the matter of prayer and not only verbal prayer but real prayer, bowing your knees. How am I going to get into these things? Pray. Yes, pray, and pray again. Paul says do it all the time, night and day, whenever you are awake at night do it. Pray without ceasing, because it is so urgent that I get into the experience of the grace of God, into the depths. Then the waters to swim in, that is, the arms are used as well as the legs, it means the whole man is merged in this wonderful thing. One can give himself up wholly to this great matter. How partial we are, dear brethren, taking on a little of christianity as a side line! God abhors that, not that He will not take on any interest you have, but the man who is swimming is wholly absorbed in it. That is what I would call depth. He does not give the depth of the river, in fact he intimates that you cannot find it. It must be really infinite, because it is God. The more you get down in that river, the nearer you get to God, and so Ezekiel says, "I could not pass through". Indeed it cannot be passed over. Not simply that "I could not pass through", but nobody could. Paul could not, Peter could not, nobody could. It is the depths of God, it is infinite. It is a
{548}
question of experience. Think of this experience, think of it being open to us! It is a question of being brought, as the passage says, "And he caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the knees ... to the loins", and then "it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through". It does not say he brought him through that. I suppose he went in. I am in it entirely now; but then Ezekiel does say in the next verse "He led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river". He had gone away. If Ezekiel were telling you this, as doubtless he did tell the captives in Babylon, he would say, after all this he brought me back again. That is a very important thing for even the most spiritual of us. You come to the infinitude of the thing, then something else comes in, but the man brings me again to the same point, *to* the bank, not into it, to the bank, and I see something I never saw before. That is how we get on. It is Ezekiel who has gone these four different thousands. It is experience, and now the man brings him back again as he says, "He led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river. When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other" (verses 6, 7). I think it is a lot of brethren. He sees a lot of brethren. He saw himself before -- the prophet Ezekiel. When you return you do not think yourself the only brother. If you do, you will be misled. "And he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river. When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other".
This river is very fruitful, God never commits Himself to any one man. He committed Himself to Christ of course, but He is not to be compared with any other man; but I am speaking of creatures. There are very many trees on the one side and on
{549}
the other. You see there is growth, they are growing. Where did they grow? They grew up as I did, as Ezekiel did. God is not confined to anyone. He has plenty and they are all coming from the same source. But then, if I do not come back the second time I may go away with the idea that I am the only one that has gone through this. When the man brings him back to the river he sees the other brethren. It is a question, dear brethren, of experience in the things of God and the more we go through this the more we are ready for depths and results of depths, that is, there are growths on the banks of the river and there is the second visit to see all this, so there is continual learning and seeing what God is doing, different ones that are coming up here and there, I delight to see them if I go through this experience. It is a question of what God is and of God's love and what God can produce for His testimony. That is what I was thinking of. May God bless it to us!
{550}
THE SPEAKING OF ABEL
@Hebrews 11: 4; @Hebrews 12: 24, 25
Those of us present who knew our brother are not here in a mere formal or perfunctory way, but with moved affections; that is, love is amongst us. The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves" (@John 13: 35). This love works backward and forward and is active at the present time. Our brother is not equal to response at present here; in the language of the Lord Jesus about Lazarus, he has died. "Lazarus has died", the Lord said. Personally he is elsewhere. According to what the Lord Jesus again said to one who hung on the cross by him, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise" (@Luke 23: 43). The thief and He did not go together; the Lord Jesus went first. As the soldiers arrived at the cross, they found that the Lord Jesus had died already. The thieves had not died; so that the Lord Jesus had gone into paradise first. He had said to His Father ere dying, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit" (@Luke 23: 46). He was received by His Father. The thief went later; that is, the saved thief. The other, alas! will never go there. God forbid that that could be said of anyone here. He spoke reproachfully to Christ; there is no evidence that he ever repented; whereas the one who went to be with Jesus that day in paradise repented. He said, "... we indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this man has done nothing amiss" (verse 41). So that our brother as well as the thief is in paradise; the word is used to denote a place of blessing, or bliss; but still it is not the final destiny of the believer or of Christ either. Three days afterwards Christ Himself was raised from the dead; the thief was not;
{551}
he is yet to be raised. The Lord will come to his grave presently and call him out of it. What infinite thoughts will fill the heart of the Saviour as He approaches each tomb, so to speak, to call each saved one out of it! He will call the thief out of the tomb. He had a poor grave; it was one made for the wicked. It was intended for Jesus too, but Jesus had His grave with the rich; He was with the rich in His death. Joseph of Arimathaea provided one for Him under God; a new grave, a tomb cut out of a rock, out of which He came three days afterwards. The thief remains in it, but Jesus will visit him presently to take him out of it. But the other thief will remain there for some time longer; for it is said the rest of the dead (that is, the wicked dead) remained for one thousand years; so that the saved dead come out of their graves first, one thousand years before the others. But our Lord Jesus was the first out. It is said, "The first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming" (@1 Corinthians 15: 23). The thief is amongst those; and our brother is amongst those.
So that, as we said in our prayer, we are not here defeated, but victorious. We have no doubts at all as to where our brother has gone, nor as to his resurrection. He will come out with all the others who have died, from Abel, who was the first one to die, down to the last one ere the Lord Jesus comes for His own. Who can count the myriads whom the Lord, when He comes, shall call forth? He will quicken those of us who are alive. If He were to come now He would change us all, and raise our brother so that we would all go up together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; so to be forever with the Lord.
These are the great general facts relative to our present position here; and they are victorious facts. Everyone present should lay hold of them and enjoy them. Having said all that, I would remark on these
{552}
verses. First, the fact that Abel is said to be dead; that is, death is a real thing, even if it be a christian, a believer in Christ; it is death. So that it says, "God bearing testimony to his gifts, and by it, having died, he yet speaks" (@Hebrews 11: 4). That is, Abel is speaking, although dead. The facts are that he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous. These are the facts, and he is the first person who died. He offered unto God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain. They were brothers. Abel's offering was acceptable to God; that is, it was typically Christ. Of the first-fruits of the flock he offered to God, and God accepted his offering. This is the basis of our meeting here today, that we have been enabled, those of us who are christians -- nearly all of us are -- to offer to God a more acceptable sacrifice than others; that is, those who bring the fruit of their own work. Cain brought the fruit of the ground; he was a tiller of the ground; he offered a bloodless sacrifice to God. Many are doing that, whereas the testimony of Scripture is that without the shedding of blood there is no remission; nor is there any salvation for anyone save those who trust in the blood of Jesus. That is the acceptable sacrifice. Abel offered that; he offered it by faith, the principle of our dispensation. The principle underlying the gospel is faith. And so "Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony of being righteous". What a wonderful thing it is to obtain testimony that one is righteous before God! -- righteous through the one perfect offering of the Lord Jesus. "For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift: not on the principle of works, that no one might boast" (@Ephesians 2: 8, 9). So that no one can boast of works in this matter. Without faith in the atoning sacrifice of
{553}
Christ there is no salvation for anyone. There are many Cains, alas! who bring bloodless sacrifices, but they are not acceptable to God. We do not hear of Cain speaking after he dies, but we do hear of Abel speaking after he dies. And one brings this thought forward, because our dear brother has spoken in his lifetime, and he will speak after his death. He is speaking now; the facts relative to him have a voice; so that he being dead yet speaks; not, of course, in a vocal way, but still there is the speaking developed out of the life of our dear brother. To all present thus here now it has a present, living voice. He is dead, but his spirit has gone to be with Christ. As the Lord Jesus says, "but he is not God of the dead but of the living; for all live for him" (@Luke 20: 38). He is dead as to his body, but he is alive as to his spirit. He is with Christ on the basis of that one sacrifice which God regards as pleasing to Him, so that He has accredited him with righteousness. He has a voice for everyone here today.
Well now, to be brief I will pass on to the other scripture; because we have speaking again, only a comparison is made. We are come to many things in this passage. Believers are said to have come to some great and glorious things, all founded on the sacrifice of Christ. First we are come to the holy mount, then to the spirits of just men made perfect, and in our verses, we have come to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant. What a fact that is! We have come to Him; not that we are coming, but we *have* come. Believers have come to such a Person. He is the Mediator of the new covenant; it is in His blood. And then it is said, "... to the blood of sprinkling", Abel's blood is not that. We read of Abel's own blood, the blood of Abel; that is to say, the blood that flowed from his wounds that he received from his brother; for Cain slew him. That blood is to be required, we are told, of Jerusalem
{554}
All the blood of the righteous from Abel onwards is to be required at the hand of Jerusalem, a very solemn fact. But this is not his own blood; Abel did not approach God through his own blood; it is the blood of another, that is, of the beast that typified the Lord Jesus. It was the blood of Christ by which he drew near, by which he was accepted and accounted righteous. It says here, "to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". Abel spoke himself; but the blood of sprinkling speaks of itself. What a suggestion there is in that for everyone of us! Those of us whose sins are forgiven through it are refreshed in the very thought of it, as we are already established in the sense of acceptance with God through it.
This blood of sprinkling speaks of better things than Abel; it speaks of an atoning value; it speaks of a price paid; it speaks of forgiveness of sins; it speaks of righteousness, justification for the guiltiest sinner. It is the ground on which our brother has gone to be with the Lord; and the ground on which we will all be raised presently. It speaks better than Abel; Abel speaks wonderfully; although dead, he yet speaks. It does not say what he says. Here we have the blood speaking; "the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". So we pass on from the testimony of our brother, from the testimony of his service, from the testimony of his work amongst us, from the testimony of his love that he had for the brethren and for the Lord Jesus -- we pass on from that, although making much of it we pass on from it to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better things. Things that the saints say of their dead are wonderful, but still there are better things; and it is a point made in this book, "and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". Our brother would be the first to say, Well, say very little about me, but say all possible about Christ. So we pass
{555}
on from the saved person to the Saviour, and His blood which is of infinite value for atonement. It speaks better things than Abel.
And then the further thought is that we do not refuse Him that speaketh; that is, the Lord Jesus. There is the speaking of His blood, and there is His own speaking, and it is a most solemn thing to reject Him that speaketh. "For if those did not escape who had refused him who uttered the oracles on earth, much more we who turn away from him who does so from heaven". So that we have three speakings: we have the speaking of the saved person although dead, we have the speaking of the atoning blood of Christ, the blood of sprinkling, and then we have His own speaking authoritatively from heaven, and the warning to everyone of us is not to turn away from it. For it says, "See that ye refuse not him that speaks".
We are not here as those just seeking to get through with this little service here in a perfunctory way, in friendliness, or personal kindness, or remembrances; let no one think that. Let him think of the voice of Christ speaking to him at this present time, and the awful consequences of turning away from it. As it goes on to say, "whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once will *I* shake not only the earth, but also the heaven. But this Yet once, signifies the removing of what is shaken, as being made, that what is not shaken may remain. Wherefore let us, receiving a kingdom not to be shaken, have grace, by which let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear. For also our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12: 26 - 29). These are most solemn verses; but whilst speaking thus and warning everyone, for the warning comes to all, one is thinking of the speaking, and the thought of what comes in before these awful judgments that are spoken of here, that is, the
{556}
Lord Jesus coming from heaven. "For the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 16). If the Lord came now, our brother here would come out of that casket first before any of us would be changed. It is the great victory of God. "... for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord". This great act of power accomplished by our Saviour and Lord will take place before the judgments against which we are warned in those verses that I read.
