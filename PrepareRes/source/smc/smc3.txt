{#The Knowledge of Divine Persons and Things}
{7}
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS READING (1)
@John 1: 1 -- 14
S.McC. The knowledge of divine Persons and divine things is to be considered. It is essential that the importance of John's gospel should be apprehended by us. Mr. Raven said that it was the backbone of all the gospels, and Mr. Taylor remarked that it was the backbone of all the Scriptures, showing what an important place it had in their minds, and it is especially important as bearing on what we are about to consider together in connection with the revelation of God -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things. In the consideration of our subject together, divine personality will be before us in each of the Persons of the Deity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and particularly before us now we have the divine Personality of the Word, the Son. We need to see the place that the Person of Christ has in these holy writings. It is important that in seeking after light we should not miss the glory of the Persons about whom we seek light. They are presented in John's ministry in a manner which is calculated to touch every feature of spiritual affection begotten through the operations of God. The knowledge that we are referring to -- spiritual knowledge -- seems to run right through all John's ministry, both in the gospel and the epistles, and the Revelation. If we were to consult a concordance, it would be surprising the number of times that the word 'know' and
{8}
'knowing' comes into John's ministry; and especially is it important in view of all that is abroad in the public profession, that we should come into the knowledge that John has in mind, and, as quickened in our affections, be affected by that knowledge, and especially in view of the enriching of the service of God.
Now in the first portion we have read, the matter of knowledge is presented negatively, which is very interesting. John opens his gospel with negative references to knowledge, whereas when we come to the seventeenth chapter it is replete with references to positive features of knowledge as to the men that God has given Christ out of the world. He says in verse 10, "He" (that is Christ) "was in the world, and the world had its being through him and the world *knew him not*." Then in verse 26, "John answered them, saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do *not know*, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". Then John says in verse 30 as to the Lamb of God, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me; and I *knew him not*; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water. And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him. And I *knew him not*; but he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". This is what we should keep before us in this first reading, the negative side, throwing into relief what is in mind on the positive side in our enquiry.
J.A.P. When he says "I knew him not", is he referring to His eternal personality?
S.McC. There is no doubt he is not alluding to Him on natural lines, for John stood related to the Lord on the natural side; it seems to refer to something very definite on John's part, when he says "a man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he was before me; and I knew him not".
{9}
The moral side is in mind in the first negative suggestion, the condition of the world morally, the created sphere into which the Lord came, "the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not", it is the moral side in regard to knowledge; and then it is the religious side in the second reference, those that came out of Jerusalem -- the priests and Levites who should have known, but John says "whom ye do not know", which suggests the religious darkness marking that setting; but when we come to the Baptist, it is more an allusion to the exclusion of the natural side in the matter of this knowledge.
M.G.W. Is the acquirement of positive knowledge reached by way of our *seeing*, which is the result of the work of the Spirit in us in the way of enlightenment? I was thinking of verse 34. John says there "I have seen".
S.McC. Yes, new birth in its radical character in us brings about the ability to see things which we did not see before; and seeing is brought much before us in John's ministry, and it is important that our eyes should be open spiritually to see what comes within our range in the movements of divine Persons in this gospel.
A.P.B. Is one of the first steps in acquiring knowledge the realisation that we are without it?
S.McC. Yes, the negative side would throw that into relief -- the great need there is for the true knowledge of God which John's gospel would bring on to our view, beginning with this Person. It is important that we should get an impression as to the divine Personality that is before us here in the Son -- the Word as He is referred to. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Our affections need to be quickened in relation to the Person of Christ; John's gospel makes a lot of the Person of Christ.
J.S.E. Had you something further in your mind in alluding to these three categories: the world, and the religious circle, and what is natural?
S.McC. I think John is stressing the negative side as he opens his ministry to bring into relief what was in the assembly; the realm to which we belong. The Lord has great pleasure in referring in the 17th chapter to what
{10}
is known in that realm. He says, "They have *known* that all things that thou hast given me are of thee" verse 7, "[they] have *known* truly that I came out from thee" verse 8, and "These have *known* that thou hast sent me" verse 25 and "I have made *known* to them thy name" verse 26.
J.S.E. Is it of any interest that Peter's wife is not referred to in this gospel?
S.McC. Say what is in your mind in that regard.
J.S.E. I was thinking of your allusion to John ruling out the natural element, and I was wondering if the Spirit keeps us, in the narrative, entirely in relation to what is spiritual. I suppose most of us have in our minds ruled out the element of the world, and of the religious circle, but I wonder whether we sufficiently face this natural element. I wondered if John is a model to us in that way?
S.McC. I think he is, and he would help us to see the importance of coming under the hand of divine Persons in view of the knowledge that we are speaking about, that we have in mind, because it is quite evident that we need divine help when it comes to the matter of the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
A.J.G. In his first epistle he says "we know that we are of God and the whole world lies in the wicked one". Does that fit in with what we have before us here?
S.McC. Very good. That is an interesting passage; one was thinking of it in relation to this subject, because he immediately continues, as you will recall, in the following verse, "And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life". It bears on what we have here. John would help us to see what we stand related to, in the environment that we are in -- we know that we are of God.
E.J.H. Would you say that those negatives of John the Baptist are all the more remarkable on account of what we might speak of as the excellency of John the Baptist on the natural line?
S.McC. Yes, because John was a remarkable personality himself -- a distinguished personality, marked out by an
{11}
intervention from heaven; one who was filled with the Holy Spirit -- he was a remarkable man in that way, and yet he says in such a precise, definite way "I knew him not", showing that there is no pretension on John's part to advance any premium that he might have put on his link with Christ along natural lines.
A.W.G.T. I wondered if the fact that the Spirit of God uses two words for 'knowledge' or 'know' would help in the enquiry. One is conscious knowledge and the other is objective knowledge?
S.McC. Yes, it does help. There is what we know objectively, and there is what we know consciously. It is remarkable that in this verse, verse 9, he says "the true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man". It is not that every man has the knowledge. It is not the idea of enlightenment, as Mr. Darby points out; it is light to every man, sheds its light upon every man; that is, the bearing of it is towards all. But then we know that we need the Spirit in regard of knowledge that we are speaking of -- Christian knowledge -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
J.R.U.B. Is the basis of all this "born of God"?
S.McC. Well, we should never know divine things unless we are the subject of divine operations, and "born of God" brings on to our view a class of persons here that are distinctly marked out as having a right -- a right to take a certain place, and in the light of John's epistle it would be a class of persons who know God, because they are begotten of God.
A.H.G. Is it in your mind that in approaching the knowledge of divine Persons the first essential is the appreciation of Christ, and who He is?
S.McC. That is what is particularly in one's mind, and that we should not miss the wonderful Personality that is before us in "the Word"; in this opening section of John's gospel the very use of the appellation 'Word' reminds us that the thought of the revelation of God is a prime matter in John's mind; it is important that we should allow the Spirit of God to have His way in fastening our attention on the glory of this divine Person, of whom John the evangelist, in the Spirit's power, writes.
{12}
F.W.K. So would the negative in verse 18, "No one has seen God at any time", be important in that connection?
S.McC. Well, it would, because there is what we cannot know -- what we cannot apprehend, even in regard to what we are saying as to our subject of the knowledge of divine Persons; we are not seeking in any way to intimate that we can know all that there is to be known of divine Persons, because we cannot, and we do not. There is what we do not know, and what we do not see, and John would remind us of that to begin with -- that we have limitations.
A.M.P. When the Scripture in @1 Corinthians 2: 14 says "the natural man ... cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned", does it refer to what can be known?
S.McC. Yes, the Spirit of God is alluded to as the great instrumentality by whom God is revealing these things to us. He reveals them to us by His Spirit. "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (verse 10).
J.H. Have you in mind that the features you have named, what is moral and religious and natural, are calculated to militate against our apprehension of the presentation of the Person?
S.McC. Yes, we have to have a judgment in our souls as to this negative side if we are to come in for the knowledge par excellence which John has in mind -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
J.S.E. Would it be in keeping to ask if there is in the three outstanding titles in these verses an offset to the three spheres that you refer to?
S.McC. You mean 'the Word', and 'the Christ'; and what other one are you referring to?
J.S.E. I was thinking of the Word, and the glory of an only-begotten with a father, and then finally the Son of God.
S.McC. Yes, it is; it is important that we should see the way in which Christ is presented in this section, first as 'the Word', and then as 'the Son', the Only-begotten Son, and the glory of an only-begotten with a father -- the truth of Christ's sonship, which the religious
{13}
world does not understand at all, and then what we have coming in later in regard to 'the Christ' and 'the Lamb of God' and the 'Son of God' and 'He who baptises with the Holy Spirit'. All that is important in our apprehension of Christ over against these environments that are suggested in the negative statements that we have referred to.
J.L.F. Does it help to see that there are three more negatives that are referred to in verse 13 as to the way that the believer is born?
S.McC. Yes, it does. "*Not* of blood *nor* of flesh's will, *nor* of man's will, but of God." We are reminded thus of the impotence connected with that range of things, so that in coming into the knowledge of God as revealed in this gospel it is important that we should see how much depends on divine help.
A.W.G.T. I wondered whether that was not really the force of your calling attention to the negatives, that as we accept the negative side, it throws our thoughts and activities in the direction where what is positive can be secured. Is that what is in your mind?
S.McC. That is right, and the negative side can only rightly be understood and fully apprehended as the glory of the Person of Christ is apprehended. That is what helps us to see the negativeness of what is in these different realms or environments.
W.S.S. Does verse 14 bring before us what we may enter into?
S.McC. Well, it is an allusion to Christ's sonship. John's gospel does not treat of sonship in the saints, he would fasten our gaze spiritually on the uniqueness of Christ's sonship; but then in relation to what you say, we can see that that is the mind of God for us, because the mind of God for us as to sonship is set out in Christ in sonship in man.
W.S.S. Yes. I was thinking of the contemplation of the glory and the fulness that was there.
S.McC. Yes, how important that word 'contemplation' is in that regard. We need to allow our minds and our affections to be given over to this contemplative attitude.
{14}
J.A.P. Would you say something about verse 18 in regard to the relation between sonship and the declaration, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". His sonship would of course there be of a special character?
S.McC. Yes, only a divine Person could be referred to in this way, "the only-begotten Son." It is important to see that sonship not only hinges, as we have been taught, on Christ's humanity, but also on His eternal personality. It is an important thing to see that, because it is His eternal personality that gives a unique touch to His sonship. Only a Person who is divine could be referred to as He is in this section.
J.S.E. Do we come to the term "the only-begotten Son" by way of "the Word was God". And "the Word became flesh"? Is that right?
S.McC. Well, you mean the allusion to verse 1 to what He was in the pre-incarnate condition of Deity?
J.S.E. Yes, as you said, His essential personality.
S.McC. Yes, so that the mediatorial system is involved in what we have in verse 18 -- the position the Lord has come into; taking a place, as He has, in incarnation, "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us", and then being "in the bosom of the Father". The mediatorial economy is thus suggested to us in all its attractiveness to begin with; it comes before us officially in its operations later on.
J.S.E. I wondered if that is why we have no allusion to the Lord's nativity in this gospel, because there is a certain way in which we can be affected naturally by that, is there not?
S.McC. That is so. So it is interesting to see the whole bearing of John's gospel as standing outside of dispensation. It is not what can be limited to dispensation, although what enters into it particularly characterises and affects our dispensation, but it cannot be limited to it, because of the Persons that are referred to in the revelation of God in it.
C.H. Would not what verse 1 gives us indicate what has to be borne in mind in this enquiry, that the One
{15}
who was the Word -- known here as the Word -- the full expression of the mind of God -- was nevertheless God Himself?
S.McC. It is important that we should see this, and this verse 1 is very much on one's heart in regard to what we are considering -- the way the appellation "the Word" begins this gospel, "In the beginning was the Word". It is not that He was the Word then, but John the evangelist, in referring to His position in Deity, uses the appellation, "the Word", not that He was the Word then, but that He was known in testimony here among the saints in that way; it seems to suggest at the outset of John's gospel the way the intelligence and affections of the saints were affected by what came within their range in this Person.
C.H. And thinking of the three Persons, we can only identify Them by names They have taken?
S.McC. Yes, so that John's gospel presents to us God in the majesty of His Being, revealed in Christ; a glorious Being as He is, the supreme Object of worship, but He has come within our range in Christ, and is known in Christ, known in this Person that is referred to as "the Word", particularly alluding to His ability -- His inherent ability to make God known.
A.J.G. So that Luke's gospel speaks of "those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on *the Word*". That throws light, does it not, on the use of that expression?
S.McC. It does, showing how much they had been affected by what came out in the Person of Christ as to the knowledge of God, because "the Word" is particularly expressive in regard to the subject that is before us.
P.J.B. So would you say he is emphasising rather the truth of His personality?
S.McC. Yes, it is a Person that is before us. His eternal existence is in mind, "In the beginning was the Word", that is before anything began to be He was -- He existed. It is the greatness of the Person that is in our mind, and it says "the Word was with God". Sometimes one wonders whether the significance of that lays
{16}
hold of our minds and affections as it should. We must never forget the distinct personality who was always there; His personality is not lost sight of, we might say, reverently speaking, in conditions of abstract Deity. "The Word was with God" is a reference to His distinct eternal personality.
W.O.S. Is that what is in mind in chapter 17, verse 5, "Now glorify me, thou Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"?
S.McC. Just so. We cannot say what the relationships were then, or describe what was there, but we do know in the light of @John 1: 1 and @John 17: 5 His distinct personality; there is One God but three divine Persons, now known to us in the economy, distinguished for us in Their operations, in all the glory of the economy in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the way in which God is revealed and known.
W.S.S. In that connection would you say a word about "the fulness" in verse 16? Does that fit into what you have just been speaking of?
S.McC. Well, that is alluding to manhood.
W.S.S. Quite so. I was thinking of what has come into revelation.
S.McC. Yes, but that would not be the fulness of Deity. We are speaking of how God has come into revelation, how the Deity has come near to us in Christ, in One who has the ability to make God known, to reveal God, as conveyed in the expression "the Word". When we come to verse 16, the allusion in that section is to the glory of His manhood and to what is coming out in His position in sonship in manhood.
W.S.S. I was seeking really to bring out the difference. Would the fulness be connected with what we speak of as the economy, as distinct from what you have been saying in regard to His deity?
S.McC. Yes, I think that would be right.
W.S.S. I was thinking while we have been speaking of the beauty of the two settings: there is what has come into revelation which we contemplate, and which we take on, and there is something that is beyond that, unreachable
{17}
by us, but to be known in a certain sense as the distinct glory of the Person of whom we have been speaking.
S.McC. Yes, exactly. So that we are to keep in mind in that way the glory of the two settings -- what John refers to in a past eternity, and what he refers to as before the disciples and before our eyes in testimony in the Lord's position in sonship in manhood.
W.S.S. I wondered if it would help just to have the two thoughts set before us in that way.
S.McC. It does, because in the first part in verse 1 John is alluding to a realm into which we cannot enter, into which the creature mind cannot penetrate; it is beyond our comprehension, yet the Person who was there, eternally there, and His personality standing out distinctly, and His deity too -- it says "the Word was God" -- is the Person that is before us in the incarnation. So that in this wondrous position of manhood God is so near us, because this Person is God.
E.J.H. And would the array of titles given to the Lord in this chapter move us in the spirit of worship in regard to that which has come within our range?
S.McC. It would. The presentation of a divine Person is calculated to elicit some feature of homage from our hearts, and how wonderful it is that God should have come within our range in this way, in a Person who is referred to as "the Word", and a Person who is referred to as the "only-begotten Son". These two features of His glory are intended to help us in regard to our knowledge of God.
A.B. Would these two titles, "the Word" and "the only-begotten Son", have in mind the thought of declaration? Only one who was "the Word" could really declare God, and would the declaration involve the shining out of His love?
S.McC. Yes, the declaration does, and God is made known, declared as the word is, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him." The allusion would be back to "No one has seen God at any time", but the declaration proceeds from this setting, "the only-begotten
{18}
Son who is in the bosom of the Father", and we are reminded of the way that God, and the knowledge of God, comes within our range. It is not a question of acts of power, it is not a question merely of attributes, great as they are, but it is God, known in this way, according to what He is in His nature -- for God is love, the relationships intensifying the thought of love -- what God is in His nature.
A.J.G. Is it significant that although we do not get it in this gospel, we do learn from other gospels that immediately before the Lord entered on His public testimony He was saluted from heaven as God's beloved Son?
S.McC. Very significant, and something that in the synoptic gospels is intended to arrest us right at the outset in regard to the service of Christ as He entered upon His public ministry.
F.W.P. How is it that John says to Him "Art thou the coming One or are we to wait for another"? (@Matthew 11: 3). The Lord in replying to that seems to tell him that he ought to have known?
S.McC. Well, John the Baptist in the synoptic gospels reminds us of ourselves, our infirmity and weakness in regard to knowledge. We all know how we begin to wonder just what the truth is, and where the truth is. There might be a good deal of that among the saints, you know, at times, when difficulties arise, as to where the truth really is, and what is the truth. That is just where John was in the synoptic gospels, and the Lord graciously answers him. He says, in effect, 'Look at what is being done'. He does not tell him exactly what He was or who He was; He sends a message back as to what was happening -- the works of power and glory that were taking place, and John was confirmed.
J.S.E. Do the two allusions to backbone meet that matter?
S.McC. Well, John's ministry being the backbone of all the gospels would help us as to the person of Christ.
J.S.E. I notice that John is never referred to in this gospel as John the Baptist.
{19}
S.McC. Well, that is interesting; nor is there any record of any distinct failure on John's part. We say John the Baptist to distinguish him in John's gospel from the evangelist.
J.S.E. So it is right from the standpoint of this narrative to view him apart from the place he had in an earlier dispensation, and to take account of him in relation to these high and glorious matters that are coming before us because he is singled out in this chapter as the only man who ever saw the Spirit, and that cannot be dispensational, can it?
S.McC. No, it is not. He is unique in that way. John the Baptist is unique in many ways, and I think it all bears on the excellence of the spiritual knowledge that John the evangelist has in mind that belongs to those that are under the divine hand.
E.J.H. A man sent from God -- under the divine hand.
S.McC. He was, showing the environment he came from, under the divine hand.
F.V.W. Is there any difference between this thought of declaration and what is said in @Hebrews 1: "the expression of his substance"? Is that the same idea?
S.McC. No. I think "He has declared" is a formal service here, with a public bearing upon the whole position. It is not a reference to His public service so much in @Hebrews 1, but a reference to what He is, what He was as man. He was the expression of His substance, it was there in Him as man. But here it is a formal service that is in mind. "He hath declared." Now if we could just dwell on the titles 'the Word' and 'Son' for a moment as bearing on this matter of knowledge that we are considering; the Word particularly refers to His ability to make the whole mind of God known, not only in One who can be the instrument of that service, speaking in a reverential way, but One who in Himself *is* God, and therefore can adequately express God and the whole mind of God. Then the title "the only-begotten Son" is a peculiarly endearing reference to the place that He has in divine affections, stressing the love side. The "Word" hardly stresses the love side, it stresses the side of intelligence; but "the only-begotten Son" stresses the love side.
{20}
It is God coming near in His nature -- "God is love", and the economy is devised so that we should know and understand love, and see that in making Himself known God is drawing near in relationships intelligible to us and that are calculated to affect our souls.
A.J.G. In John's epistle it says "He that abides in love abides in God". Is that the great end that God has in mind?
S.McC. That is it. That is the great end in mind -- that we are to abide in God, and John would help us to see the importance of the love side, the important place that love has. We were seeing in the reading in the house this morning the place that faith and love have. John stresses both: the great necessity of faith, and the great necessity of understanding love.
H.F.R. It says in verse 14 that "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us". Is that so that we might take account of love? I was wondering whether the word "became" would indicate His sovereign action, that He became flesh and dwelt among us, that is in nearness to us, tabernacled among us?
S.McC. Exactly, so that John gives us the real truth of the incarnation. "The Word became flesh." That is, it was His own divine act. Luke stresses the Holy Spirit's part in the matter, but John stresses that it was His own act. "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us." And so God has come near to us -- it is God -- the Deity is drawing near to us -- in this way, to be known in these intelligible relationships which are not only to affect our minds but to affect our hearts.
E.J.H. Does that gloriously supersede the law mentioned in the previous verse?
S.McC. Yes, of course it does, because in the law, as Mr. Darby says, God did not come out, and man did not go in, but in Christ God has come out and man goes in, so it is a direct contrast.
E.J.H. And grace is mentioned first.
S.McC. Well, it is.
J.A.P. When you speak of relationships, do you refer to our relationships with the Father and the Son and the Spirit?
{21}
S.McC. I am speaking of their relationships with one another. How would we have known love had not the Father sent the Son, and had not the Son died? And then the Spirit comes into that too, in regard to what we are saying.
J.R.U.B. Is that why Mr. Darby hyphenates "only-begotten" in the New Translation?
S.McC. Well, it is a term intensifying the thought of endearment or affection. In what we are speaking of, and enquiring in relation to, in the matter of spiritual knowledge of divine Persons -- as to God, we have to be helped as to what comes out in Christ's sonship and manhood -- the excellence of what is there, it is there to help us in the knowledge of God, because God is love. How can we understand it? We cannot understand the pre-incarnate conditions of Deity, because God dwells in unapproachable light. Christ is before us here in manhood, and we can apprehend it here in these relationships intelligible to us; God is within our range in these relationships.
G.A.L. You have said nothing about verse 4. Is that not very important to our enquiry, "in him was life"? Is that one of the distinctive glories that is seen in Christ as incarnate?
S.McC. Well, it is. It is referring to what has come within our range in this Person in manhood, "the light was the life of men". I suppose the life would be the light of love. That is what it would be, a testimony to the love that was there.
C.H. Referring to this matter of love again, it is clear from Scripture that love existed between Them in those pre-incarnate days, but the form or expression of it we shall never know, but that love has been manifested, as you said, in an intelligible form in the love of a father for a son.
S.McC. Quite so. We need to see that the love in the relative is no different from the love in the absolute. It is the same love, only that we do not understand the relations of divine Persons to one another in absolute Deity; but the relationships as seen in the economy we do apprehend, the mediatorial economy, seen in the Father, the Son and the Spirit.
{22}
W.S.S. What you were saying about knowledge would refer to the relative side, would it not?
S.McC. Yes, of course; we are speaking of what is within our range. Knowledge would allude to what has come within our range, not what is without our range, so it is important to see that after the Word is mentioned in verse 1 we get all these conditions as to the world and men, the moral darkness in the world, and what is said in verse 5, "the light appeared in darkness and the darkness apprehended it not". That is to be noticed, and then we get the reference to the only-begotten with a father, a figure of speech; and then in verse 18, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". After, we get the affection side -- the love side stressed; we get this position alluded to in verse 19 onwards, where there is such darkness as to the Person of Christ.
A.P.B. Might I ask for help in relation to the question of relationship between divine Persons in the economy? Is it right to say that the relationship between the Father and the Son is outstanding?
S.McC. Well, what is to be noted is that the relations between the Father and the Son are clearly defined, that is "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". The Spirit's relations with the Father are not so defined. It is to help us to see the glory and attractiveness of the economy that one divine Person enters a position where He is an object of peculiar attractiveness not only to men but to divine Persons, to the Father and the Spirit, so that, as in verse 18, He is the peculiar Object of the Father's affections, but in verse 32 "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him". He is the peculiar Object of the Spirit's movements in that verse.
T.J.G. And does this emphasise these peculiar relationships now? Are we entitled to carry that back into the pre-incarnate state?
S.McC. These relationships that we have been just alluding to?
T.J.G. Yes, the peculiar emphasis on the intimacy between the Father and the Son as it appears in some sections of Scripture, and the Son Himself as the peculiar
{23}
object of the Father's affections and the Spirit's affections. Are we right in taking these back to the past eternity?
S.McC. Not in what we are referring to here in verse 18. We could not carry the relationships there back into these conditions that you refer to. The Lord does say in @John 17, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world", but that would allude to what was between divine Persons in that realm.
T.J.G. I just wanted to guard that; the fact that these relationships are emphasised in their peculiar setting does not give us the right to think of them as being in the past eternity?
S.McC. No, we cannot carry back what is before us in the economy in the way of relationship between divine Persons into the abstract conditions of Deity and make them descriptive of that, because they are not. They are descriptive of relationships that are linked with the revelation of God in the mediatorial economy into which He has come, where He is known in Christ.
M.P.S. Might I ask how far the last verse of chapter 17 goes -- "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them"? I have in mind your earlier reference as to the love not being different in the relative to what it is in the abstract.
S.McC. The love referred to there is the love of sonship, the love linked with sonship, the Father's love to the Son. We are to keep that clear, lest anyone should carry that back to the abstract conditions of Deity. What the Lord is alluding to there is the love between the Father and Himself; "the love with which thou hast loved me" is the love that is linked with the position of sonship in manhood into which He came and in which He was the particular object of the Father's affections.
A.R.A. Does not @Colossians 1 confirm what you are saying where it speaks of Christ as "the beginning"? He is the beginning.
S.McC. Yes, it does. That is what it says, does it not?
A.R.A. And as to all our thoughts of God, we have to begin with Christ in manhood.
S.McC. Yes, and John would help us to see, as he opens his gospel, the unique place that Christ has both
{24}
as "the Word" and as "the only-begotten Son". We shall never know God apart from Christ. God being who He is, we are wholly dependent upon Christ in relation to the way He has been made known.
G.A.L. All this stresses the great thought of the incarnation, does it not, and this is what we are really considering, "the Word become flesh". God coming into His own creation in the Person of the Son?
S.McC. It brings out and should affect us as we think of it, that God is so near to us in this way that, as it says, "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us", and then there is the reference to the relationships.
A.J.G. Would you say that there was in that way a certain intimation of what eternal conditions were going to be, for the tabernacle of God is going to be with men, is it not?
S.McC. Exactly. God will tabernacle with men. God will be with them, their God, so that we can see that the thought carries through, right into eternity.
L.T.R. Would you say a word as to the Lord's reference to Himself as "the Son of man who is in heaven" (@John 3: 13)?
S.McC. Well, it helps in this way, that it is always good for us to be reminded of the element of inscrutability in regard to the Person of Christ; that there is that about the Person of Christ which is entirely beyond us, that we do not know and we do not understand, and we just have to be humble and simply accept it, and say that we do not understand it, because our minds are finite. How He could be here and how He could be there, how can I understand it? And how could any of us explain it? We do well to be reminded in that way of the greatness of the Person, and what is inscrutable, and also of what has come within our range so that we can understand it and apprehend it, as we are privileged to do.
W.S.S. So the two things must be kept distinct. I am thinking of the economy, first of all -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit made known to us, but there is that which is outside the economy referred to in the beginning of the first chapter, to which you have been drawing our attention, which is beyond us, and yet which
{25}
throws a certain lustre on all that is known. Would that be right?
S.McC. Yes, because what gives character to the economy is the greatness of the Persons that are before us in it. God has come into the economy. We are to be reminded that in what we have here -- the Deity -- God has drawn near, and is presented in Christ, and all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him.
W.S.S. I was wondering about that word fulness as to whether it would link up with Colossians, that all the fulness dwells in Him bodily.
S.McC. @Colossians 1 relates to the fulness being pleased to dwell, a particular allusion to what we have here, and then @Colossians 2 would bear on what He is now. He is still a man, and in Him *towards us* the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.
W.S.S. So that in contemplating the Lord in the 14th verse of the 1st chapter they were contemplating the fulness, I judge?
S.McC. What chapter?
W.S.S. The 14th verse of the 1st chapter of John's gospel, where it says "we have contemplated his glory", and it goes on to say "and of his fulness we have all received" (verse 16). Is not all the fulness presented there, in the Lord?
S.McC. In verse 16? You are not linking that with the fulness of @Colossians 1, are you?
W.S.S. I am asking whether that would link with the 1st chapter of Colossians, "the fulness was pleased to dwell in him"
S.McC. Well, in @Colossians 1 it is the fulness of the Godhead, it is the Deity, but in @John 1: 16 it is not Deity.
W.C. Is not the fulness here that which links on with "full of grace and truth"? That is what we have here, is it?
S.McC. Yes, it is what came out in Him as man, in relation to His manhood.
W.C. And would that be to set us free for contemplation, because we need both grace and truth, being what we are, do we not? In view of our being set free to contemplate?
J.A.P. Do you think in the thought of the fulness of
{26}
the Godhead you have what is inscrutable, as the Lord could say "no man knoweth the Son but the Father", whereas in this fulness there is that which we can apprehend -- the fulness as presented in @John 1?
S.McC. The thought of the fulness alludes to what is coming out, and alludes to what is before us in Christ. We should keep that in mind so that @Colossians 2 -- the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily -- represents what has come within our range. The "bodily" alluding to that, it can be apprehended.
C.H. Mr. Raven said, did he not, that the fulness of a thing is not so great as the thing itself?
S.McC. No, exactly. We might allude now to the last section we read where John says "I knew him not", first in verse 31 and again in verse 33; it should help us in relation to what is within our range in the mediatorial economy that is contemplated here, to consider whether we are arriving at things on natural lines, or arriving at what is here under the divine hand, and helped by divine Persons Themselves, as John says, "and I knew him not. But he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God." The emphatic *He*, "He said to me", and then the emphatic *I*, "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". We see how John comes into the truth of the sonship of Christ here, because he comes under the hand of a divine Person and is instructed in regard to the Person of Christ.
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS READING (2)
@John 3: 7 -- 13; @John 4: 10, 19 -- 24, 46 -- 54
S.McC. The subject we are considering together is that of the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things as set out in this gospel. We considered the first part of the first chapter in the earlier reading, specially alluding to the way in which Christ is brought on to our view in
{27}
that section as "the Word", and as "the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father", all suggestive of what enters into the revelation of God as we have it according to John. Someone has said that we need to know John's God, in a certain sense, and these passages that we considered earlier bear on that -- how God has come within our range in Christ, involving such wondrous knowledge as it does, and also entering into our subject there is the thought of divine personality. We considered the Lord Jesus in the first chapter, and now He comes again before us in these scriptures that we have read with added thoughts in the interim; we have now three individuals specifically before us; what we had considered earlier bore on the general position, the light being shed on every man, and the declaration standing related to the whole public position, but now we come to the operational side in regard to individuals; we have Nicodemus and the woman of Samaria, and the nobleman -- the courtier of Galilee. The brethren will notice that the Lord says to Nicodemus, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and *knowest* not these things?" (@John 3: 10). The Lord brings up the matter of knowledge specially with a man that professedly knew the Scriptures, for the teacher of Israel would be one who supposedly and professedly had the Scriptures in his hands, and, if he did not know them, should have known them, and the Lord says "We speak that which we *know*" (@John 3: 11). The Lord is referring to a class of persons who know what they are speaking about, and He sets out the ideal Himself; and then to the woman of Samaria, the Lord says "If thou *knewest* the gift of God and who it is that says to thee" (@John 4: 10), again stressing the greatness of the Person; and then when the matter of the worship of God comes up, He says "We worship what we know" (@John 4: 22). The courtier, you remember, was an observing man; he was following up the truth, and watching what was transpiring even to the reckoning of time, and it says that he knew, "The father therefore *knew* that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him". We can see in these passages how knowledge is accumulating in regard to divine Persons and divine things. We have the Spirit and new birth in
{28}
the first, and the Lord Jesus Himself presented to us again, then the Spirit and the worship of God in the second, and then the matter of healing. Perhaps these things may yield to us as we enquire together.
It is to be noticed in the first passage that we have read that the element of inscrutability both as to the Spirit and as to the Son of man again comes out, and there is nothing we need to keep more before us than the element of inscrutability in regard to divine Persons. There is much that we do not know, but there is much that enters into our subject that we can know -- we are privileged to know, and therefore the importance of coming under the divine hand.
A.H.G. What is it you are referring to, as to inscrutability?
S.McC. I was thinking of verse 8, "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit"; then the reference to the Son of man (verse 13), "And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who *is* in heaven". The element of inscrutability is there. What one is thinking of is that it is good to be reminded, and to have constantly kept before us, our finiteness, because of the creature mind and understanding which marks us.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that that would keep us in lowliness of mind, and thus in a condition suitable for divine operations?
S.McC. That is just exactly what one is thinking of, the need for lowliness; when we come to the exalted subject of the knowledge of divine Persons, and divine things, we cannot presume to know everything -- we are reminded of our limitations.
A.Hn. Does the second verse illustrate the pretentious religious mind? He says "we know" and so on.
S.McC. It is important to see this side of Nicodemus, because he represents what is all around us, especially in a religious and pretentious way, and we have to judge it in our minds and hearts. What the Lord says takes the ground from under the feet of Nicodemus, so that he has no ground to stand on.
{29}
E.J.H. Would you say in that sense that he had to learn that he could carry nothing over whatever into the spiritual sphere?
S.McC. Yes, the Lord is teaching him as to this matter of new birth. There is nothing like new birth to take us down; if that was kept before our minds in the working out of soul history, it would have a very salutary effect; it removes all the bombast, pride and greatness of man, just that radical touch of new birth.
E.J.H. And yet introduces us into something that is infinitely great.
S.McC. Exactly, introduces something into our beings that changes us throughout. It is the introduction of something that is going to affect every part of us, affect the way we think, and what we do.
G.A.L. And gives us the capacity to begin to understand, and drink in the glory of the Son?
S.McC. Just so. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. We get a suggestion there of the affinities that are produced in this action; it is not 'that which is born of the Spirit is the Spirit', but "is spirit", partakes of that character. We are dealing now with the knowledge of divine Persons in relation to a spiritual order of things; "God is a spirit", it is said, referring to the spiritual character of things we have to do with in God as He has come within our range in this way.
P.H.H. How do you understand the three things? Those who are born anew (verse 3), and then born of water and of spirit -- are they cumulative?
S.McC. I would say they are. The one stresses the sovereign action of the Spirit in introducing into our beings that which changes us entirely; the other introduces the moral element, does it not, "born of water", the negative side, and "of spirit", the positive side. The one has to do with seeing, the other with entering. So it is cumulative in that way.
J.A.P. What does the Lord include in the thought of the earthly things which Nicodemus ought to have known about?
S.McC. Well, new birth is an earthly thing. New birth is not exactly what we might call an eternal thing. What
{30}
it produces, of course, has to do with things eternal. But new birth is something that is introduced in connection with the ways of God, and it is linked with the earthly side of the truth.
J.A.P. You are referring to the 36th of Ezekiel?
S.McC. Yes. Ezekiel brings in the matter of new birth.
P.H.H. Would that be the principle that God has operated on from the beginning -- the principle of new birth?
S.McC. That is it.
P.H.H. It did not commence with Christianity.
S.McC. No. From Adam onwards the principle of new birth applies, does it not?
C.W.O'L.M. Does the thought of the kingdom of God into which new birth introduces us become a basic matter now?
S.McC. It does. Especially would it help us to this matter of lowliness and subjection; the necessity of being humble, lowly and subject, to get the gain of the knowledge that we are considering in this gospel; the kingdom of God would have a great place in the displacement in us of what would be contrary to that.
J.P.H. Is there a particular point in the reference to the flesh? "That which is born of flesh is flesh." Is there something beside contrast in the verse? I was just wondering whether we need to discern the workings of the flesh, which might come in in some subtle way to hinder us from arriving at the full thought of God?
S.McC. The Lord is dealing with things which lie at the basis of Christianity -- what we have to learn in the very elements of things, the rudiments of things in Christian teaching, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". It may take some of us perhaps some time to arrive at it, but it is introduced into the very rudiments of Christian teaching.
J.S.E. Are we not being helped, as we go over the truth now, to arrive at what has already been established in detail and set out plainly in the Lord's own ministry?
S.McC. Yes, I am sure we are. One of the great services of the Spirit is to bring into our minds the Lord's own ministry here.
{31}
J.S.E. He covered, did He not, the whole range when He said to Nicodemus, "Do not wonder that I said to thee, It is needful that *ye* should be born anew". As though He is introducing something to Nicodemus which in its effect pertains to the whole earth.
S.McC. Yes, exactly. So that what we had earlier bore on what is set out in relation to Christ and His deity; first His place in form of God, and then His place in manhood -- Object of divine delight, bringing out the spirit of excellence in His manhood in that delightful environment referred to in verses 14 -- 17 of the first chapter. But now, we are coming to what bears upon ourselves, moral conditions with and in ourselves, and how individual persons are coming under the divine hand. Nicodemus was a subject of new birth, but was in darkness as to it. He was in darkness as to what had really transpired in his own soul.
A.Hn. In connection with the moral side. Would you say a word as to the distinction between seeing the kingdom of God and entering it?
S.McC. Well, it is one thing to see it, it is another to enter it. None of us could see anything apart from the operation of new birth. New birth brings about a total collapse. F.E.R. likened it to the effect of a pin prick to a balloon -- the whole thing collapses, and that is what happens in new birth; and then there is the thought of being born of water and of spirit which affects our ways -- our manners and deportment; it comes out initially.
E.J.H. Would you say that one of the greatest comforts of new birth is that it results in spiritual tastes, and a sphere in which they may find full scope?
S.McC. Well, it opens up the way to that. New birth does not give us much; we cannot bring much into new birth; it is the introduction of something, in a mysterious inscrutable way, into our beings which changes us throughout. We cannot build too much on it, but there is something mysteriously and inscrutably introduced which affects us radically throughout.
A.W.G.T. You would not say it goes so far as to bring in very much consciousness?
{32}
S.McC. The only consciousness it brings in is helplessness -- the consciousness of helplessness, and weakness; as F.E.R. says, all it produces is a cry, a cry of weakness, then the glad tidings comes in with light, as to the Saviour, and as to the kingdom.
A.B. Do we need the Spirit to get practical deliverance? That is the Spirit working in us, practically setting us free from the flesh, as we have in @Romans 7 and 8. So that the man says, "I delight in the law of God after the inward man". Would that be somewhat akin to "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"?
S.McC. Well, that is further on than what we have here -- I mean in progressive teaching. New birth brings about a complete collapse of the man; and later, what often happens, I suppose, is the revival of the features that have been collapsed, so that there is disturbance within; we need to know deliverance as it is set out in those chapters that you refer to, @Romans 6, 7 and 8.
E.C.L. Does new birth bring in the ability to believe what is presented? What is developing in John is the believing on this Person.
S.McC. Yes, it makes us sensitive to divine impressions -- that is what new birth brings about. For instance it says in verse 5 of chapter 1, "The light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not." Well, what brings about a change in our souls? It is the action of new birth that brings about something that renders us sensitive as to what may be presented in the glad tidings in the way of light.
G.A.L. So that the cry from Saul of Tarsus was "Who art thou, Lord?"
S.McC. That is it -- "Who art thou?" There was still the element of darkness in his soul, but light was coming in.
A.H.G. Would this prepare us for divine teaching?
S.McC. Well, yes. I think we need to understand this principle as seen in Nicodemus, and the action of new birth in regard to a person like him, because it is laying the foundation for an act of faith in relation to the teaching; running through these three passages is active faith. The Lord has in mind active faith, in which we progress
{33}
in relation to the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
A.W.G.T. In a certain sense it involves a kind of demolition before anything positive can be built in the man?
S.McC. Well, it is the collapse of the man, but there is something positive introduced. You see, it is not entirely negative; there is a positive thread introduced into the man's moral being which changes the whole texture.
W.J.B. Is it introducing something of very great potentiality?
S.McC. That is what it is: something is introduced in principle into the man's make-up, his being.
W.O.S. Is that seen in verse 8, "Thus is everyone that is born of the Spirit"?
S.McC. Yes; it says "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit". That is to be noticed, "thus is".
A.J.G. And is all this to emphasise the sovereignty of God? As it says, "The wind blows where it will". Is it not a question of our being brought back to the sovereignty of God?
S.McC. It is, and it should help us as to the divine Personality of the Spirit, in His part in this great operation; that is, making a way for us in regard to the knowledge that is within our range. We owe it to Him.
P.H.H. Does not being born of water and of the Spirit ensure that there is something pure there, as to the source?
S.McC. That is it, so that the Spirit is not only the active agent in new birth, but He is the source of the new birth.
A.R. Would it be right to say then that new birth is entirely the sovereign work of the Spirit and is apart from human agency?
S.McC. Well, it is, and we see its bearing here, its full bearing here, on the religious side, not in @John 4, but on a man like Nicodemus, an instructed man, a man who is a teacher in Israel, but the Lord says to him, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things! Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know,
{34}
and we bear witness of that which we have seen". It is striking how the Lord brings in the knowledge that was with Him, and those that are embodied in the "we" over against what marked Nicodemus, "and knowest not these things".
F.W.K. Is new birth antecedent to what we had this afternoon as to those who were born not of man's will but of God's? Would you distinguish, please?
S.McC. Well, new birth has to do with things in principle. When we come to 'born of God' we come to what partakes of the traits of the children of God; they come out in moral traits that mark them as of that generation, children of God.
A.W.G.T. That is shown in the reception of Christ, is it?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, so that you have something positive in that relation.
J.S.E. Have we to see in this discourse with Nicodemus how the Lord meets him point by point so that He can come to this matter that you referred to as inscrutability, and leaves him in the sense of his own complete ignorance of anything? Nicodemus first speaks as a patron, does he not, "We know that thou art come a teacher", and the Lord says that unless a man is born anew he cannot see the kingdom; then Nicodemus speaks from a natural and logical standpoint, referring to the womb of his mother. The Lord then brings in the matter of entry, does He not, and then finally introduces the positive thing, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". Does not Nicodemus represent a person who has some status on a certain line, and that is all laid bare, whereas in chapter 1 those who receive Christ have never had a status, have they?
S.McC. That is right; the Lord is taking this person up on the ground on which he stands as a teacher of Israel, and the Lord is stressing this matter in a peculiar way with him, as if it is to affect Nicodemus in regard to the matter of his knowledge of divine things and divine Persons.
E.J.H. Do you get three features running through these passages which you have called attention to this afternoon,
{35}
that is, what is religious in Nicodemus, and what is moral in the woman, and then the side of what is natural with the Courtier?
S.McC. Yes, all that runs through the passages that we have read together, especially stressing the Lord's hand-to-hand service, if I might reverently say so, in regard to individuals; that is, the Lord is viewed here as taking persons on in relation to the different states of soul that are expressed in these passages.
A.H.G. In that way, do we need to apprehend the Lord as Teacher? Nicodemus says "a teacher", "thou art come *a* teacher". Has that to be corrected to see the greatness of the Lord in this way as Teacher?
S.McC. Yes, that is interesting, in contrast to what the Lord said to him, "Thou art *the* teacher of Israel". The Lord does not say 'Thou art a teacher of Israel', but "Thou art *the* teacher of Israel". Nicodemus was no ordinary man; he must have been a man of good capacity as men would speak of him, and all around we see that. But the Lord takes him up and speaks very faithfully to him about this matter of new birth, which really leaves Nicodemus wondering as to where he is.
H.F.R. Three times the Lord says to him "I say unto thee". I was thinking of what you were saying as to the feature of "authority" in the economy, how the Lord comes in in such a distinct way to teach Nicodemus.
S.McC. How important that is; it is the Word that is speaking -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". The One who is anointed to unfold the whole mind of God, He is here speaking, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee", and who can speak after Him?
A.Hn. Would you say a word as to why, with such sterile material as Nicodemus seems to be, He speaks to him of love in a way that He speaks to no one else, "For God so loved" and so on?
S.McC. Well, surely it is an example set before us, as to whether we are learning; there are those that are always learning, but never seem to come to the knowledge of the truth, and Nicodemus represents that side; he is not
{36}
extricated from the associations and links in which he was held. This knowledge that the Lord introduces in His ministry and service to Nicodemus should have had an extricating effect with him.
E.J.H. Do you think that the Lord chose Nicodemus as having everything religiously, as best setting forth the necessity of new birth?
S.McC. Just so. So that we might not be inclined to say, 'Well, they are the worst', the Lord introduces it in relation to the best. Because that is where the trouble lies, it is in persons like Nicodemus, who do not feel they need help. All around we see that, and we have to judge it in our own hearts as a principle.
A.J.G. I was just wondering, as you were remarking about the Lord taking on each of these cases individually, whether we get the secret of that later on, where the Lord says, "All that the Father gives me shall come to me and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out" (@John 6: 37). So that is not each soul the subject of the Father's giving, and of the Lord's taking on and instructing, and of the Spirit's operations? Is not each soul the subject of the operations of the whole Godhead?
S.McC. Well, exactly, so that it sets in wondrous relief the blessedness of the economy from that side -- not only the love that has come into expression in what divine Persons are towards us as shown in the Father's love to the Son, and the Son laying down His life, but this matter of taking us in hand in view of our instruction in the knowledge that has come within our range in the economy. I think it is most affecting in that way.
G.A.L. So that the Spirit quickens in new birth those whom the Father has chosen in Christ from before the world's foundation. Does it not emphasise, as you were saying, the divine personality of the Spirit as well as that of the Son?
S.McC. Well, it does, and I am sure that we must not eliminate the element of responsibility from new birth in the preaching, because the Lord is speaking to Nicodemus, saying, "It is needful that ye should be born anew"; "*ye*" -- that is, the emphatic "*ye*". It is needful that *ye* should be born anew."
{37}
Ques. What is the difference between being born anew and born of water and of Spirit?
S.McC. Well, that was asked at the beginning of the reading, and reference was made to the sovereign action of the Spirit in new birth, being born anew; the other is a little bit further in the teaching as to the moral side.
Ques. A further operation of the Spirit?
S.McC. Except any be born of water and of Spirit brings in the character of the thing now.
C.H. Does that involve the teaching of death -- born of water?
S.McC. Yes, the water is the negative side; we would have that in mind -- the separative side.
E.J.B. Would you say a little more about the side of responsibility in new birth?
S.McC. Well, here it is. The Lord is saying to Nicodemus, so that Nicodemus should be arrested, "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew". He is laying it on him.
W.J.B. So that it would be right to draw attention to it in the preaching, would it not?
S.McC. Well, certainly, especially bearing on persons with religious airs and religious thinking and feelings.
T.J.G. Is the responsibility, then, to recognise the necessity for new birth, not that the person can do anything about it, but must recognise that it is an absolutely essential thing?
S.McC. Well, that is it. The Lord lays it upon him in that way; the way that it comes in, in relation to a religious man, is important. The worst thing to bring down in any of our minds is the religious element if it gets enthroned in any shape or form, as the religious and legal element did at Galatia; it is a most difficult thing to bring down. The Lord is stressing the radical side of the truth in connection with that feature.
P.H.H. I suppose the full answer to being born of water would work out in baptism, would it not?
S.McC. Well, it would; there is the link there with baptism, the moral element entering into baptism.
P.H.H. So that when the light of being born of water and of the Spirit is recognised you can understand that
{38}
the moral and responsible element must enter into the person.
S.McC. That is right.
R.C. Is the Lord laying the responsible side before him in verse 12?
S.McC. Well, that is the point too. He goes on teaching, and says, "We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness. If I have said the earthly things to you and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?" (verse 12). Now notice the Lord uses a plural pronoun 'we' in verse 11, but the personal pronoun 'I' in verse 12. He is speaking in a general way in verse 11 of a class of persons that have knowledge according to God, "We speak that which we know". But then when He comes in verse 12 to "If I have said the earthly things to you" He is alluding specifically to what He said to Nicodemus.
W.S.S. Does that put responsibility upon us, in relation to the teaching today?
S.McC. Well, it does, so the Lord says "and ye believe not". This matter of active faith in relation to the teaching is important.
W.S.S. I was thinking how we need to take home to ourselves what is said to Nicodemus, and that we may be marked by believing, as the truth is unfolded.
S.McC. Well, that is the point, I think; that is the lesson for us. Mr. Raven said, as you will recall perhaps better than I do, that if a man goes off in his later years he always wondered what stone was loose in his foundation. Well, when we have difficulty as to the truth we might well go back as to whether we have what the Lord is saying here in the teaching.
B.H. In the matter of learning and receiving the truth, do you distinguish the part played by the spirit and the mind?
S.McC. I am not sure that I follow you.
B.H. I was wondering if it was a faculty that is deeper than the thinking faculty that is there, "the things of man knows no one save the *spirit* of a man that is in him", and new birth coming in, in connection with the
{39}
spirit. I wondered if there was something to be learned besides acquiring knowledge.
S.McC. Yes. The element of new birth entering into a man affects his thinking faculties as well as affecting him throughout, so that he does not think in the way he formerly thought.
A.W.G.T. Is that not involved in being born anew -- that means, from top to bottom?
S.McC. Well, that is what the point is. It is, as the word has been used, radical; that is, it is throughout, from top to bottom.
W.J.B. The fact that we make room for the Spirit does not in any way eliminate the mind, does it? It means that we think with subject minds.
S.McC. That is it, and renewed minds, minds that have been affected by new birth.
J.A.P. Was it said that new birth is not a matter of divine sovereignty?
S.McC. Who said that?
J.A.P. I am asking whether you are saying that, suggesting that there is responsibility connected with it?
S.McC. We did not put it that way. What was said was that in stressing divine sovereignty in the act of new birth we must not eliminate entirely the side of responsibility, and that it is presented to a responsible man, and his responsibility is stressed in relation to it. "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew." That was what was said.
H.W. Does the word "ye" refer to the Jewish nation?
S.McC. It refers to the religious man, but he is taken up by John the evangelist to show us the best in a religious way.
H.W. And would you be free in the preaching of the gospel to say emphatically "Ye must be born again"?
S.McC. Most certainly I do, having religious persons in mind.
W.J.B. Mr. Taylor has, I have seen it in notes of his preaching.
S.McC. Especially if you are having to do with a religious person, built up in his religious thoughts, or a religious audience, it certainly would be quite in keeping to stress "it is needful that ye should be born anew".
{40}
A.W.G.T. That is, you are not putting the onus of being born on the person, but making room in his mind for the fact that he needs to be born anew?
S.McC. Well, that is the point.
J.P.H. Does Peter touch on it in @1 Peter 1: 24, 25? He says, "because all flesh is as grass and all its glory as the flower of grass"; then he says, "this is the word which in the glad tidings is preached to you". Does it come into the preaching?
S.McC. Yes, it is very interesting the way Peter puts it; it would involve an action which affects the intelligence. He says, "being born again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the living and abiding word of God". That should affect the intelligence of the person.
F.W.K. Would it be right to say that all men are responsible, but new birth will give men to realise their responsibility? Is it the element of new birth that would give souls some measure of light and responsibility?
S.McC. Well, new birth gives us our first initial touch, you might say, which brings into our souls our feeling of responsibility towards God.
A.J.G. Is not all this instruction to Nicodemus to prepare the way in his soul to receive the light of the cross -- the Son of man lifted up, and the gift of God in eternal life to those who believe?
S.McC. That is it, so that the Lord says as He continues, in verse 12, "if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe? And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up." How searching the teaching is now; the Lord is building up in the teaching.
G.A.L. I was wondering whether it was desirable to see that this chapter is teaching rather than preaching.
S.McC. Well, it is. It is the Lord teaching Nicodemus, but that does not eliminate the insistence on the new birth in the preaching.
G.A.L. I can understand that. I was thinking that it comes out in the setting of teaching, that is all.
S.McC. That is how it comes out in @John 3 here, but
{41}
Peter says, "this is the word which in the glad tidings is preached unto you", involving what we have here, although it is really more advanced.
W.J.B. It was really the word through Isaiah, was it not?
S.McC. You mean all flesh is as grass?
W.J.B. I mean in principle that is what is implied in @Isaiah 40.
S.McC. Peter was referring to that, no doubt, in what he is alluding to.
Ques. Did you say that Nicodemus was born again although ignorant of it?
S.McC. Yes. Nicodemus is one in whom new birth has taken place.
J.H. So that verse 21 would apply to Nicodemus in that regard?
S.McC. Yes, "he that practises the truth comes to the light". Although we cannot say much about Nicodemus, we must not build too much on him either, as to practising the truth, but nevertheless we give full credit for what is there, and the Lord is treating him now as one in whom new birth is.
J.S.E. Does the Lord in this conversation bring Nicodemus low in himself in relation to the matter of new birth and then finds pleasure in expanding the teaching to the points to which Mr. G. has referred, in the Son of man being lifted up and God so loved the world; in each of those cases He brings in the great matter of believing. Is not the earlier part of the chapter what you have rightly called the laying-low principle in order that there might be more room for these expanded things which are connected with the Lord as the Son of man and God's only-begotten Son?
S.McC. I am sure that is right, so that in regard to what we have been saying, while the Lord is teaching Nicodemus patiently in regard to the truth He is seeking to expand him in regard to the whole gospel vista; what is before us here in this section is the great vista in the gospel, and especially is it needful over against popular evangelism, which does not deal with the state of man. The Lord is bringing in what is essential to help us in
{42}
regard to the great vista of things in the gospel, "thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish but have life eternal. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal." As Mr. Darby says, the sense should be that He has loved men in view of eternal life; this is to expand our vista in the gospel, so that we preach the gospel with this kind of vista.
A.Hn. Mr. Stoney used to remark, you remember, that we change our man, but does the teaching of this chapter really help us in that and so liberate us in view of the service of God?
S.McC. Well, it does, so that we should get on to the matter of what comes in in the 4th chapter.
P.H.H. Do you mind first saying another word about inscrutability attached now to the Lord? Is it right to say that in what the Lord has said as to "the wind blows where it will" is really bringing forward the inscrutability of the Spirit? But then He says, "no one has gone up into heaven save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven". Does that prepare our minds for greatness in the person of Christ which we can never compass, making us worshipful?
S.McC. It does, and it is important to keep that in mind in regard to divine Persons; especially would it save us from limiting divine Persons, or fixing upon divine Persons any position that They may take, or limiting Them to a position that They take. We need special help as to that, that even as we think of certain things and positions that They have taken up we must always bear in mind that there is something beyond that that we cannot compass.
P.H.H. Does the very title Son of man tend to make us think perhaps that the Lord Jesus has come so near to man, to take everything up for him, that we might possibly lose sight of the greatness of the Person who has done it?
S.McC. Well, exactly, so that it is important to see how the Lord brings it in here, "No one has gone up into heaven save he who came down out of heaven, the Son
{43}
of man who is in heaven". Now some one might say, 'Well, explain that'. How can we explain it? We cannot explain it, we are just to believe it, there it is, in the Scripture. How the Lord could be there, and how He could be here, how could we explain it?
P.H.H. And yet it serves to magnify all the heavenly things which He is about to speak of.
S.McC. Yes, so that we are reminded in speaking of the Lord as man, and speaking of Him as a bondman, that we must be careful not to limit Him to that -- there is that which is beyond either of these positions.
C.M. Would you say more in regard to the inscrutability of the Holy Spirit?
S.McC. Oh, just that it says, "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit". We are reminded of the element of inscrutability in regard to divine operations; the Spirit operating in relation to new birth. We cannot explain it or give account of it -- there it is.
We must move on to chapter 4 as to this passage which brings in the Spirit in the figure of the living water, and then knowledge in that relation; and then the matter of the worship of God, as the woman brings it up and the Lord speaks to her about it; and the matter of healing; and the thought of faith -- active faith is important in all this. The Lord says to her (verse 10), "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee" -- that is, she is reminded now of the Person who is speaking to her. Again, we might say it is the Word that is speaking to her, the One in whom the full mind of God is made known, is revealed.
E.J.H. The woman says, "when he comes he will tell us all things".
S.McC. That is it, and the Lord says to her, "I who speak to thee am he" -- showing the greatness of the Person who is there.
E.C.L. Do you get the thought of responsibility being raised with the woman directly she asks, "Give me this water", which the Lord had proposed? The Lord raises these moral questions with her: "Go call thy husband,
{44}
and come here". Have these to be settled first before we can receive anything?
S.McC. Yes, they have. Showing the importance of the adjustment of moral matters, the Lord brings up the thought of the living water first; that is, He does not say, "He would have given thee the Holy Spirit"; He says, "He would have given thee living water". As we have pointed out, He is treating the woman according to her capacity, as a learner. We have to learn how in certain persons to treat them according to their capacity, and that is what we have here; but the figure in the living water suggests the Holy Spirit.
J.S.E. In a certain way, would it be safe to say the Lord exhibits more grace in His dealing with this moral wreck than He did with the religious assumption of Nicodemus? There are radical statements, are there not, in chapter 3, but are not the statements somewhat more attractive in this chapter?
S.McC. Well, they are. The patience with which He takes her on and serves her is most affecting, especially the fact that He says to such a disreputable woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou" -- the emphatic *thou* -- "thou wouldest have asked of him". A woman of social disrepute, and yet the Lord is stressing the thought of His Person -- who He is, to her.
A.H.G. Have you a word as to what is involved in drinking? In the previous incident it is a matter of believing; here it is a question of drinking?
S.McC. Well, it brings up this matter of the Spirit; in regard to the feature of knowledge of divine Persons and divine things that we are considering, this matter of the Spirit is important, because it is going to involve inward deliverance from what is morally degrading and corrupting.
A.J.G. And not only deliverance, would you say, but also satisfaction?
S.McC. That is it, so that we have the positive suggestion in living water of what would be satisfying.
E.J.H. Has it not been described as satisfaction over against gratification
{45}
S.McC. Yes, she no doubt was seeking to gratify certain desires and lusts in her way of living, but the Lord would bring her to a satisfied state of things, a region of satisfied desires, as has been said.
E.J.B. Are there two stages: one the Lord giving, and the other our drinking? The Lord gives the living water, but then it is "whosoever drinks" -- on our side.
S.McC. Yes, showing the importance of our side, so that the Spirit is in mind in this chapter, and it is an essential part of what we are considering: the necessity for the Spirit; not the necessity for new birth here, but the necessity for the Spirit, in setting us up in purified relations with God. That is the teaching here -- purified relations with divine Persons.
A.H.G. So that drinking would involve appropriation, would it?
S.McC. Well, it does.
A.H.G. And is that not sometimes where we are lacking in relation to the divine service, because there has been so little with us on the line of appropriation?
S.McC. That is it. We need to drink, we need to be on the line of desire in this way. She says, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw" -- come *here* to draw. She already has a judgment of what she has been going on with, feeble as it may be, but there it is, and "Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here." Come here. That is, He is going to bring her back after the moral issue is searched -- bring her back to this position.
A.B. Would the drinking bring in the service of the Spirit in engaging our hearts with Christ so that we learn to find satisfaction in Him? And then the further thought of the Spirit becoming a fountain in us, giving spring to our affections -- is that needed if God is to be served rightly?
S.McC. Oh, it is, because a living state of things is in mind, specially in view of the service of God, and the Spirit is introduced in that way, setting out what is living, as living water. Why should the Lord stress living water if it is not that a living state of things is in mind. And the service of God necessitates a living state of things.
{46}
C.H. And the retention of the person "such" -- "the Father seeketh *such*"; that is the persons, is it?
S.McC. Well, it is an important thing to see that -- the kind of persons -- for she says in verse 20, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship". Jesus says to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the Father". Notice how He brings in the Father now; this is an added touch in the instruction, "worship the Father". "Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth". Now the Lord is bringing in the refined side of knowledge in Christianity here. He brought it in in speaking to Nicodemus, enlarging our outlook in connection with the glad tidings -- the great gospel vista; here He is bringing it in in relation to the woman -- knowledge in connection with the refined inward side of the worship of God.
M.P.S. Is there something for our help in the woman's occupation with place -- as to the word "Come *here* and draw"; "our fathers worshipped in *this* mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the *place* where one must worship"?
S.McC. Well, I think it is important to see that the Lord is seeking to remove from our minds geographical thoughts and material ideas; there is nothing more important than that material and physical thoughts should be removed in this matter of the worship of God, because God is a spirit, not 'the Father is a spirit' -- that is not the point here. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth." That is, the worship of God is spiritual, not material.
H.F.R. Do the three Persons come in in this scripture leading up to God -- I mean, there is the Lord Himself as the giver of the living water, and then there is what the water becomes in him, and then the Father "seeketh"?
S.McC. Exactly. So we are reminded again of the full scope of the activities of the Persons of the Godhead in relation to this matter, all serving with a great end and
{47}
objective in mind. The way the Lord brings in the Father here is instructive: God before us in that relation, in the thought of the Father; God coming into a certain relationship in view of a full end that is in mind.
A.J.G. Does the fact that the Lord says "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth" show how God has in mind that we should be in wonderful affinity with Himself?
S.McC. That is it. It would bring up the need for the Holy Spirit, do you not think. How could we worship God in this spiritual way without the help of the Holy Spirit?
A.J.G. Quite so.
P.H.H. Were you going to say some more about the Father?
S.McC. Oh, I think it is important that we should see the Person that is presented to us in the Father. It is not exactly the relationship here -- it is the Person, the wonderful glory of that Person in the Godhead, that God is presented to us in that Person.
P.H.H. So graciously.
S.McC. Yes, so graciously.
E.J.H. Do we see the skill of the Lord as teacher in that He transferred her thoughts from "our fathers" to "the Father"?
S.McC. Well, He is bringing in something that she had never heard of before; she had never heard of *the* Father. It is remarkable how the Lord brings the name in without explaining anything about it. He says, "when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". Is it not a credit to the work of God in the woman? He is treating her as a subject of the work of God so that she would take in this knowledge that He is imparting as to "the Father", involving the place that Person has in the economy. God is presented to us in *the* Father.
W.S.S. And I suppose it would bring in all that is under the Father -- the many families; what is under the Father's hand, so to speak.
S.McC. The Father puts His impress on every family.
J.S.E. Is it interesting that the Lord removes from her mind first of all the two places -- this mountain and
{48}
Jerusalem; and then He removes from her mind two classes, "ye" and "we", coming to *they*, who worship the Father, "the Father seeks such as his worshippers"?
S.McC. Very good.
J.S.E. So that the Lord arrives at a point with her when He accepts the position of a Jew, but then He goes further and says, "the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers". It does seem, does it not, that He is attracting her now away from place and away from classes to bring her into the one and only setting where this matter of worshipping the Father can operate. Is that right?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, so that all the knowledge that is being imparted in the teaching is leading to this final result that the Lord has in mind in the thought of worship; first of all, worship in the special way to which He refers in verse 23, "the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship *the* Father in spirit and truth; for also *the* Father seeks such as his worshippers". That is, God as having come in in this way, in that special name by which He is known in this dispensation; but then the Lord does not leave her there, He brings in the great general thought as to God. He does not leave her without an impression as to the general thought of God -- God in His majesty and greatness involving all three Persons. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth." We approach God in a known relationship -- in the relationship in which we stand to Him in sonship, revealed as He is in the wondrous name of Father in the economy. But then, that is not the final thing -- there is the great thought as to God, Christ's God, the God who has come within our range in Christ, and who is now the great exalted object of worship. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth."
H.F.R. Are we limited to the economy, or is there any sense in which we worship God as inscrutable?
S.McC. We are always regulated by the economy, because we have only creature minds and understandings. The only way in which we have to do with absoluteness is
{49}
as alongside of Christ, hearing Him say, "My God". We get a sense of what is beyond us in that, and yet He goes on to say, "and your God". We worship God as having made Himself known -- not in conditions or environment where He is unknown to us.
C.H. But it is the same God.
S.McC. It is the same God, that is what we should see; no less than God, so that, as the teaching has very persistently drawn our attention to it, we cannot limit God to a relationship into which He comes. We have to do with Him and approach Him in a known relationship, and stand before Him in that known relationship, but the God who has come into that relationship is the God who is the Supreme Object of worship, the Supreme Object of all things.
A.J.G. The very fact that He has initiated the economy itself compels worship, does it not?
S.McC. It does. It is all directed towards that end.
W.B.H. Would you say the more we appreciate the great thought of the Father, the more ready we shall be to move on into the appreciation of this great thought of God?
S.McC. We shall never know God as God rightly if we do not appreciate the thought of the way in which He is presented in the Father.
W.M.B. Does the thought of the Father seeking bring out the peculiar grace of this dispensation?
S.McC. It does. That is the whole point in the presentation of the Father in this way; it is God known in grace, and the seeking is very affecting in that way. We think of seeking in @Luke 15, in regard to man's need, eventuating in God's pleasure of course; but the grace of it here, "seeking such" to worship, is affecting as you think of it.
J.A.P. In the New Testament you get the thought of God the Father, or God our Father, or God and Father, more than forty times; is that to stress what you have been saying, that we worship Him in a known relationship? That occurs constantly in the epistles.
S.McC. Yes. We never have to do with God outside of a known relationship. We are always in sonship. If
{50}
we think of manhood in the final stage of the service of God, it is manhood in *sonship*, always is so; but the God who has come into the relationships we have been speaking about is the God that Scripture says "for of him and through him and for him are all things. To whom be glory for ever". That is, God as God is the supreme end in the service of God -- the worship of God.
C.H. That is, we do not limit God to any name or position He has taken?
S.McC. Well, that is the point. God must be greater than any relation He enters into or upon.
A.M.P. But we may worship God as inscrutable, may we not?
S.McC. Well, in the sense of the doxologies, yes.
A.M.P. And in our hymn book we say, 'Oh, how inscrutable, yea how unsearchable' (`48:1).
S.McC. Yes, exactly. Paul in @1 Timothy 6 utters such a doxology, and there are other doxologies that bear upon that.
A.M.P. Although our relationship remains a known one, and we are sons in relation to the Father, yet we may reach out in our worship to the God who is inscrutable?
S.McC. Well, it is the God who is inscrutable that has come within our range in Christ, you see. What we have to be careful of is that we do not make the terms of the economy applicable to abstract deity and make them descriptive of the inscrutable form of God, because they are not.
N.K.M. Why is the Lord stressing not only "in spirit" but "in truth" also -- "must worship him in spirit and truth"?
S.McC. Well, it is to bring in the side of what is spiritual as opposed to what is material. And then the necessity for truth -- that involves adjustment. The truth has come in in Christ. Christ is the truth, and the Spirit is the truth. The truth has to do with the asserting of what is in another, and Christ asserts what is true in regard to God and in regard to man, so that He is said to be the truth. He is the truth objectively, as the Spirit is the
{51}
truth subjectively in the saints here according to @1 John 5: 6.
J.S.E. Is it right to say that that touch from the Lord to the woman has such force to her that she can afford to leave her water-pot? All that comes in between those points is to do with the disciples, is it not?
S.McC. Well, exactly.
J.S.E. But is it not helpful to see that the woman is affected by that very word, and she abandons all that she had held in relation to what was material and goes forward with the power of that impression in her soul?
S.McC. That is it, so that if we had been there it would have been a very active reading after verse 24; but the woman goes on and says, "I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when he comes he will tell us all things. Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am he". And that is all that we get. The Lord leaves her with that impression, and that impression remains with her -- "God is a spirit". Without opening up all that is involved, He just left it upon her mind and her spirit, "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth".
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS READING (3)
@John 6: 66 -- 71; @John 8: 31 -- 59; @John 9: 24 -- 34
S.McC. The subject that is before us is the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things, and we come now to a very solemn and sobering section of John's gospel, but a section in which knowledge shines, both in Peter and in the man of the 9th of John, and in the Lord Himself when He speaks in the 8th chapter, as in conflict with the Jews. There is the drift of unbelief in the 6th chapter, but in the midst of it and over against it we have the wonderful feature of knowledge in Peter, "*We* have believed and *known* that thou art the holy one of God". Then in the 8th chapter the Lord alludes to knowing the truth and the truth setting us free; then there is the stress on the greatness of His Person in that section -- the great I Am, as
{52}
He refers to Himself, "Before Abraham was, I am". Then the delightful setting in @John 9 of the subject of the works of God -- the blind man, and the remarkable way in which knowledge appears in him, which may yield help for us. "He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I *know*, that, being blind before, now I see." He could speak of one thing he knew, anyway, and he held to that whatever they did to encroach upon his testimony and to turn him from the truth; he held to what he did know, and the Lord comes in as he is cast out and imparts further knowledge to him. So as we begin with this section in @John 6 we should see the way the work of God is appearing among the saints, and also, especially as John would have us from beginning to end, should we keep before us the glory of the Person of Christ. It is important, I think, that the Spirit of God uses John to keep us constantly reminded of who the Person is that He is God, and nothing less than God; he begins with that, and there is a person at the end saying, "my Lord and my God". We may say that is on a lower platform, but nevertheless it is coming out of the mouth of a man who is affected by the Person who is before him, so that John the evangelist would impress our minds with the glory of the Person of Christ: that He is never anything less than God, wherever we see Him, in whatever circumstances we view Him. He is never anything less than God as to His Person.
A.P.B. Does that give a peculiar importance and lustre to all that He says and does, because it is God who is doing it and saying it?
S.McC. John would remind us in that way of the greatness of the Person who is not bounded by this dispensation but who is outside of all dispensation -- the I AM. In @John 6 He is before us in the blessedness of His manhood, as Peter says, and has often been noted. It is not only a question of revelation here, it is a question of progressive knowledge -- what Peter arrived at representing no doubt what there is in the body of the disciples, "We have believed and known, that thou art the holy one of God".
E.J.H. Is the personality of the "we" having believed
{53}
and known standing over against the unique and distinctive personality of "thou art"?
S.McC. Yes, the emphatic "we" and the emphatic "thou". John in verse 67 says "Jesus, therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away?" How much was bound up in these words. How the Lord values what there is in the twelve. And the emphatic *ye* and the emphatic *we* brings out what there was generally among them. And I think one thing that impresses one in moving around amongst the saints is what there is in the body of the saints.
A.J.G. Does this statement of Peter's involve that they have apprehended in Christ the perfect answer in manhood to all that God looks for -- "the holy one of God"?
S.McC. That is it. "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God." God is holy, and we get an answer in Christ in manhood to what God is in that way -- the holy One of God. It has been said by J.N.D. that when the Father is mentioned in John it has to do with the expression of grace, but when God is mentioned it has to do with what He is, in holiness, and man in responsibility, so that the holy One of God would be a perfect answer on the responsible side in man in Christ, to God's great thought.
A.J.G. The woman of Shunem said, "I perceive that this is *a* holy man of God that passes by us continually", but now there is *the* holy One of God.
S.McC. That is excellent -- the contrast in that way to what we have there, a holy man of God, and now *the* holy one of God. He is unique in that way.
W.B.H. Is there a suggestion of that in Proverbs, "The knowledge of *the* Holy" (@Proverbs 9: 10; and @Proverbs 30: 3)?
S.McC. Well, it is interesting how that expression comes up in Proverbs, because the knowledge of the Holy would call for holiness on our side, and I think the apprehension of the holy One of God would have a progenitive bearing on us as to holiness on our side.
P.H.H. Do you mind saying a little about the name which comes a few times earlier in the chapter, "Son of man"? It says, for instance, in verse 62, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before"; and then
{54}
earlier than that, in verse 53, "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood", and so on. Would you mind saying a little as to the bearing of that on this part of the teaching?
S.McC. Well, I think what you now refer to is very interesting, because the lines are becoming defined as to Judaism: the 6th chapter in its teaching bearing particularly on what is beyond the confines of Judaism; the Lord repeatedly referring to the world, as He says in verse 51, "the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world"; and then, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before". The title "the Son of man" refers to His universal rights, and the universal side is before us in the teaching in @John 6, and it is interesting that it precedes @John 7, where, as F.E.R. taught us, the change of dispensation comes typically on to our view. In the same way Stephen at the great transitional point in the change over stresses the Son of man; his vision is filled with the Son of man in glory.
P.H.H. Is it remarkable that in speaking to Nicodemus in chapter 3 the Lord says, as was quoted yesterday, what pertains to His Person as Son of man? "No one has gone up into heaven save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven." Is it remarkable that He should have said that to one who was the teacher of Israel?
S.McC. It is. And is it not remarkable that He says this again in verse 62 to those who were not understanding the teaching? Now this is to be noted. He says it to Nicodemus in chapter 3, and He is saying it again to those that do not understand the teaching here. They are finding it hard. They say, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" It was not even a question of who can believe it; it is a question of "who can hear it". That is, they were not prepared to give it an entrance, and the Lord says, "Does this offend you? If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" It is, as we were saying at the outset, the way that our attention is constantly focused on the greatness of this Person. That He is nothing less than God, wherever we view Him, even though He may
{55}
be in the condition of manhood before us, we are always reminded of the greatness of who He is personally.
J.S.E. Is it right that when the Lord is speaking to His enemies in this gospel He is very emphatic as to His place in the Deity, but when He has His own around Him He speaks more intimately in relation to His place in manhood?
S.McC. Well, that is interesting, especially as we shall see as we come into this section which involves conflict. The Lord is asserting His own Personality, asserting His Deity, and John's ministry bearing on the last days would impress us with that. In the church councils of old, centuries ago, there was an attempt to protect the truth by the formulation of creeds, but it led into error, and was derogatory to the glory of His Person in that they put His sonship back into eternity, into the pre-incarnate conditions of Deity.
J.S.E. Yes. Was that because there was a lack of understanding that "the natural man understands not the things of God"? Has it not always been damaging to try and adapt the truth to the mind of man naturally, whereas this gospel shows that it is impossible for the mind to take it in, so that the opening of the narrative emphasises that the writer and those with him understood and valued the deity of Christ, "the Word was God"; but the insistence on the term "I am" is invariably made by the Lord to His enemies, is it not? And is not that where our protection lies?
S.McC. It is, because the Spirit of God in superintending the writing of this gospel has in mind to protect that glorious Person who has come so low, who has entered into such a subordinate position involving relative inferiority. The Spirit of God protects the glory and greatness of His Person at every turn throughout the gospel.
A.Hn. Do you think that the speaking of the Lord in this gospel is calculated to impress our hearts with who He is? I was thinking of the remarkable passage in chapter 5, where He has been speaking to His enemies, the Jews, and they sought to kill Him "because he had said that God was his own father, making himself equal
{56}
with God". I wondered whether the ministry thus as John records has in mind to impress our hearts with the greatness of the Person of Christ.
S.McC. Well, it is important that we should see that the greatness of the Person of Christ is to be maintained; therefore care is needed lest we should advance anything that is derogatory to the Person of Christ, because we have to maintain before our hearts and in our thoughts the greatness of who He is -- not only who He was, but who He is, because He is unchanged in His Person wherever we view Him. His Person is the same.
W.M.B. Is that borne out by the 9th of Romans -- the reference to His coming in flesh and then immediately guarding it, "Who is over all, God blessed for ever"?
S.McC. Yes, it is; it is one of the great passages that guards the truth as to the Person of Christ, lest in thinking of the economy and the lowly subordinate place He has come into in the economy we should think less of Him. The Spirit of God desires to guard it in our minds, lest we should have any thought that He is any other than God.
W.J.B. And yet at the same time to hold to the genuineness of His humanity.
S.McC. John insists on that, and so it comes out in @John 8, "but ye seek to kill me, a *man* who has spoken the truth to you". And as was referred to earlier, "the holy one of God", a beautiful allusion to His manhood, especially on the priestly side -- what is due to God, because Aaron, as we have often heard, would be brought into our minds as a type of this aspect of Christ.
P.J.B. Would it be right to suggest that the disciples would speak together of Him, so that Peter, when he says "we have believed and known", was able to speak emphatically because together they had arrived at this conclusion that He was who He was?
S.McC. Yes, it is a tribute to their contemplation of the Person -- to their observation of Him -- what they had gathered up, while others were disaffected in relation to the teaching. Here were ones that were wondrously affected, so that Peter says, "We have believed and known". Not 'we have known and believed', but "we
{57}
have believed" -- the activity of faith which leads us into this knowledge -- "and known that thou art the holy one of God".
E.J.H. Would you say that in a general way the saints today line themselves up with Peter in regard to this very word?
S.McC. I would say, from practical observation that in the body of the saints there is a great desire to protect the truth as to the Person of Christ, and it is preserved, we might say, in a living way in the assembly over against the error embodied in dead creeds.
J.S.E. Confirming what you remark as to "the body of the saints", would not the fact that the apostles are not referred to as such in this narrative help us to see what is to be expected in the last days -- that the truth is held in the body of the saints affectionately by the Spirit, and that ministry must come on this line of holiness and affection in the understanding of Christ in the two ways you are suggesting?
S.McC. Well, I am sure that is so, and I think we should see the importance of it at this juncture, and then the salutary word the Lord gives over against the attractiveness of progressive knowledge in Peter. John says in verse 70, that "Jesus answered them". That is, the Lord takes up Peter's "we" and it says, "Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil". Now this is a very humbling and searching matter, and it behoves us to be lowly and sober, and searched in the presence of the truth as the Lord is bringing it forward here. We have not only progressive belief in Peter, and in the twelve in this chapter, but progressive *un*belief in those who go away into the drift of apostasy, the full result being seen in Judas.
P.H.H. In regard to the expression "believed and known", do you think that applies in general to the working of the truth amongst us? Here it is applied specifically to the Person of Christ, but would you think it also applies to the ministry of the truth and the way it is taken on and finds place in the souls of the saints?
S.McC. I am sure it does -- the importance of subjection. Mr. Stoney stressed that the great basis of
{58}
spiritual prosperity in our souls was in being subject to the truth as it comes to you. That is a great matter. I was interested the other day in the word that God gave to Ezekiel in chapter 3, verse 10. He says to Ezekiel, "Son of man, all my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears". Now we would have reversed that; we would have said, 'Hear with thine ears and receive in thy heart', but God puts the 'receiving in thy heart' first, and then 'hear with thine ears', showing the importance of the activity of faith and the subjective bearing of faith.
A.W.G.T. It is a Berean feature, I suppose.
S.McC. It is. We are inclined to treat faith wholly in an objective way, whereas we are to see the subjective bearing of faith.
G.A.L. It says in @Acts 16 of Lydia, does it not, "whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul".
S.McC. Very good, showing how the heart was the immediate subject of the operation to make way for all that was coming in through Paul's ministry -- a personal operation of the Lord. One has thought recently that we often speak of the Spirit as augmenting the service of Christ, but it is interesting to see how the Lord augments the service of the Spirit. The Spirit is the great power for understanding the truth, for understanding spiritual and divine knowledge. That is a particular feature of His glory. He is the power for apprehension and for knowledge in us. But when we come to the Pauline side, the Lord is brought into it; Paul says to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding". Not the Spirit, but the Lord will give thee understanding. And this passage in @Acts 16, the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, "whose heart the *Lord* opened" -- not the Spirit, but the Lord -- "to attend unto the things spoken by Paul".
J.S.E. Is that to keep us balanced in our minds as to the equality both of the Lord and the Spirit in an operational setting?
S.McC. Yes, exactly; and how closely they are related and linked in operations in the mediatorial economy, as in @2 Corinthians 3: 17, where it is difficult to discern
{59}
where one service finishes and the other commences, and who it is that is referred to. "Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty."
F.C.H. You have the same feature in the early part of @Acts 16, after two references to the Spirit; it is "assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them"?
S.McC. Yes. It is interesting to see how the divine Persons are operating together in relation to one another in these matters.
E.J.B. Does the Father come into it too, in verse 45, "They shall be all taught of God, everyone that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned from him"?
S.McC. There is a beautiful touch in this chapter in that way as to the Father -- as the Lord again says in verse 65, "And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father". We want to know the glory of this Person more in the economy, "the Father" -- God as known in this Person, how He is operating. The Father is God, the Spirit is God, and the Son is God -- let us never think anything different. God is One, involving three Persons, and yet there is the wondrous grace of the economy, "to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things and we for him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 6) -- God coming in in that way in a system of affections to impress our hearts with what He is. God is love.
P.H.H. I suppose you would hesitate a little, would you, to apply the word Mediator, or mediatorial, to the Father. Christ is called the Mediator, and we can see that the Spirit acts mediatorially. Would you go further than that and apply the term mediatorial to the Father?
S.McC. The Father has come within our range in the mediatorial economy; the Lord Himself in the 5th chapter says, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work", the working involving the mediatorial side, but the mediatorial position is set out in the Lord and in the Spirit, the Father remaining in the position of Godhead.
A.Hn. In that connection how far do you think @Colossians 1: 12 would go? There it is said, "giving
{60}
thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light".
S.McC. What have you in mind as to how far it would go?
A.Hn. Well, I was thinking of the question as to mediatorial operations of the Father.
S.McC. Well, it is one thing to see the Father operating and what He is operating in relation to; but, rightly speaking, while He comes within our range in the mediatorial system and in mediatorial operations, the Father is presented to us as God in the economy, "To us there is one God, the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ, *by* whom are all things and we by him", so that the mediatorial side is rightly linked with the Lord Jesus and with the Holy Spirit.
J.S.E. Do we not have to lay hold of this, that the supremacy marking the Father's place in the economy in no sense hinders His delight to serve the saints?
S.McC. No, it does not. We see how He is operating in this gospel, as we have already been referring to it, operating in affecting souls; but the mediatorial position is seen in the Lord pre-eminently, and the Spirit is acting in accord with that. We could not say the Spirit is the Mediator. Scripture says, "One Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus".
C.H. Is that not linked up with the suggestion that the Lord has lordship in a sense in a dual way; that is, He had not only lordship as in Godhead but He is made Lord officially?
S.McC. It is important that we should see the way it is referred to in @1 Corinthians 8: 6. It says, "yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him". Now while God is presented in the Father in the economy, we must not use that passage to eliminate the Lord and the Spirit from the thought of Godhead, because Their place in Godhead abstractly has always to be maintained; while They have come into a subordinate position; Their place in Godhead is always maintained in our minds abstractly, and so it says, "One God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him". Alluding to His official place, one Lord, He is the one who is made
{61}
Lord. It does not mean to say that we cannot refer to the Spirit as Lord, or the Father as Lord, because James refers to the Father as Lord, but "one Lord Jesus Christ" is an allusion to His official place in the economy.
J.S.E. And the Lord Jesus addresses the Father as Lord, does He not (@Matthew 11: 25)?
S.McC. Yes, exactly.
P.H.H. This scripture in @1 Corinthians 8 is not a full description of the economy, is it?
S.McC. Because the Spirit is not brought into it?
P.H.H. Yes. But is it Paul's full answer to the gods many and lords many in the pagan world?
S.McC. Well, it is; and I think it is important to see that while the Spirit is not formally mentioned in @1 Corinthians 8. He is involved in what is said. The fact that He is not formally mentioned does not mean to say that He is excluded; faith would understand His place in relation to the economy as stated.
W.M.B. In @Ephesians 4 we have perhaps a somewhat similar statement, and each of the three Persons is mentioned, and again the Father is spoken of as Supreme in the economy, would you say that?
S.McC. Yes, One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in us all. It is an allusion to the particular place of supremacy that the Father has in the economy; and God, the Supreme Being, to be known and worshipped, in coming within our range as He has, in such an economy, and entering into that relation, has in mind to affect our hearts and souls through that relation in regard of what He is, in all His majesty and supremacy.
J.A.P. You are speaking of how we are affected through the relation of 'Father'?
S.McC. Yes, it is a relation that God has entered upon, a name that He has taken, and the God who has entered into that relation must be greater than the relation He enters upon. We cannot limit Him to any relation that He enters upon, because He is God; He would not be God if we could.
J.S.E. Does the verse in @Ephesians 2 compress in a few words what you are saying, "For through him we
{62}
have both access by one Spirit to the Father"? Are not the prepositions 'through' and 'by' in some sense mediatorial in each case?
S.McC. Well, it is, particularly setting out the mediatorial economy that through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father.
A.W.G.T. I should like to ask whether, notwithstanding the fact that the Father is supreme in the economy, nevertheless certain things are predicated of Him that He does? He draws to Christ, and makes us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light, so in a certain sense could you say that He comes into the operational side?
S.McC. Oh yes. The Father is viewed as operating. The Father is the great supreme governor of the universe. The Lord says "I praise thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth" (@Matthew 11: 25).
F.W.K. In @1 Corinthians 12 we have the "same God who operates all things in all". Is that the same thought?
S.McC. Yes, that is God; it is God that is referred to. And it is interesting how that chapter is filled with the thought of the Spirit -- what the Spirit does, so that we are always to keep in mind the necessity for being sober, and guarded in referring to the economy, lest we should in any way attempt to put limits on divine Persons. They have come within our range as They have, and our souls adore Them in the light of Their movements, and the positions that They have taken. But we cannot limit Them to positions that They have taken, while we are governed by the light of what They are in these positions.
J.S.E. Is that emphasised in the verse in this chapter 6 as to the Son of man ascending up where He was before? Does that not show that He goes up in the right of His own Person?
S.McC. Well, it does, and it is important that the glory of each Person should be preserved with us. One has heard of a statement only yesterday, which I think needs to be guarded, because I believe it is derogatory to the Person of Christ -- that Christ is not God to us. Christ is God to us. While it says in @1 Corinthians 8, "to us there is one God, the Father", that does not mean to eliminate from our minds that Christ is God to us. Who is He God to
{63}
if He is not God to us? He is not God to the Father or God to the Spirit. When John says "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5: 20) he is alluding to what He is to the saints.
E.J.H. Would you therefore support the words that are current amongst us and have been for many years, that He never ceased to be what He was on account of what He became?
S.McC. Well, exactly, that is the truth, as stated in that letter of Mr. Raven's on the person of Christ. We all do well to go over it carefully and read it; we should be helped as to the greatness of the Person -- as to the distinctiveness of His Deity, and the distinctiveness of His humanity. It came up in the conflict that raged over the matter of whether there was the union in Him of God and Man.
G.A.L. In @Daniel 7 the Son of man is identified with the Ancient of days, is he not?
S.McC. He is -- a remarkable expression in Daniel, reminding us of the greatness of the Person. One would commend to the brethren the Scriptures in regard to this matter as to Christ's deity, that we should be careful lest we should make any remarks that would be derogatory to the greatness of His Person as to who He is, for He is always God; He never ceases to be God.
A.Hn. I think you remarked elsewhere, very helpfully, that personally He is God and His condition is man.
S.McC. Yes. I was repeating the words of Mr. Raven.
C.H. Referring to Mr. Raven again: in his lifetime brethren were saying that we could not worship the Lord Jesus because He was man, and the way he met that was by saying that He had lordship in His own right and therefore had a right to be worshipped.
S.McC. Well, that came up years ago and had to be met -- that we could not worship the Lord as man. That results from a misapprehension as to His Person. He is the same wherever we view Him, unchanged and unchangeable in His Person.
A.P.B. Is it noteworthy that both Paul and Peter allude to the Lord Jesus as "our God and Saviour" (@Titus 2: 13; @2 Peter 1: 1)?
{64}
S.McC. It is, and that is an answer to this remark that is gaining currency amongst the brethren, which is not right, that Scripture does not say the Son is God to us, because He is God to the saints.
W.S.S. So the passage in @1 Corinthians 12 says, "there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord"; and before that, "distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit", "but the same God who operates". It is *God* operating, is it not?
S.McC. Showing the assertion of deity in the Spirit. You see, while the economy is presented to us in the way in which it is in @1 Corinthians 8, that God is presented to us in the Father -- Deity is presented to us in the Father -- we must never forget the balance of the Scripture that fully asserts Deity in the Spirit and Deity in the Son.
W.S.S. I think it was Mr. Darby who pointed out the importance of what is stated in those verses in @1 Corinthians 12: the gifts of the Spirit and the Lord over the services, but the same God operating, God operating whether in the Lord or the Spirit.
S.McC. That is it. So that we are to be reminded that behind the economy and behind the Trinity in Their operations in the economy lies this great thought of the Being to be known and adored and worshipped: God -- the beginning; and God -- the supreme end of all things.
W.S.S. Do you not think what you are now saying is being held, to use your earlier expression, in the body of the saints more than it has ever been held?
S.McC. Well, it is, but doubts have been sown in some minds as to whether Mr. Taylor ever countenanced the speaking to God in the light of the three Persons. It was one of his greatest joys in recent years to speak to God in that way, embracing the three Persons; and I think it is remarkable, if one might refer to it, always keeping in mind the full value of the Scriptures and the importance of our minds being garrisoned by the Scriptures in these matters, that in 1935, on July 9th, in London, we had that unique address on the present position of the testimony, where Mr. Taylor alludes to God -- not the Father -- as the final terminus in the service. One month later, at Eastleigh, Hants, on August 9th, in a reading, the
{65}
truth was fully gone into, and I think the brethren do well to read Volume 179 carefully and prayerfully, and see how the truth is set out according to the Scriptures in that address and in that reading.
P.H.H. In relation to what was remarked about 'being', I was thinking of one of J.N.D.s footnotes to @Hebrews 1: 3: "Who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance". The footnote says, "Clearly 'substance', 'essential being', not 'person'. It is of God, not of the Father." Now is it in your mind that the greatness of the being of the one great eternal God is to permeate all that we are saying about divine Persons?
S.McC. Yes, always. Not that we can say much about it, but the blessed Spirit, the power for knowledge and apprehension, affords us in a holy and sober way a certain amount of latitude in thinking of God, so infinite in His majesty, in His Being as He is, yet coming within the range of creature mind and understanding to affect our minds and hearts in regard to Himself. We are reminded in the Scriptures that as far back as we can go "in the beginning" God was there, the great Being to whom we are alluding, involving all three Persons. Their personality distinct even there, we are never to forget that, one Being, but yet the personality of Each as revealed and distinguished in the economy is seen there -- "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", the preposition 'with' in the Greek denoting communicative associations, signifying distinct personality in those conditions. What names or forms the relationships took we cannot say -- the form of God is not revealed, but it is important that we should see that one distinct and glorious divine Being in majesty is God -- the Deity -- yet three Persons, distinct in Their personality.
A.J.G. I suppose the expression "the eternal Spirit" would help as to the separate personality of the Spirit. In the economy He takes the name, or rather in the name of God in the economy He is the Holy Spirit, because it has reference to man, but personally He is the eternal Spirit. Would that be right?
S.McC. Exactly. That helps in regard to what we have been saying as to distinct personality.
{66}
J.A.P. Would you say a word about "my Father and your Father, my God and your God", in regard to the way you are speaking now?
S.McC. Well, we are going ahead of our subject, but that passage, if we might just allude to it in passing, shows what we have been saying, what we have learned and been taught: that God, not the Father, is the ultimate in assembly service in the worship of God; it is God as God; He has entered into that wondrous relation conveyed in the name Father, so expressive of grace, that we might know Him in the majesty of His being as He is, as God.
J.A.P. And then you would include the Son and the Spirit in your thought of God?
S.McC. Yes. When we speak of God as God there is light in our minds as to all three Persons, because abstractly neither the Son nor the Spirit have left Deity.
A.J.G. Hence in that verse which was referred to, "through (Christ) we have access by one Spirit to the Father", while the access is to the Father, you are in the presence of the operations of the whole Godhead, are you not?
S.McC. That is it, and that is what we are to keep in our minds, and also that it is the same in eternal conditions. It says in @1 Corinthians 15, "then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection". We are to be reminded of what lies behind all that, what is inscrutable to us, that we cannot enter upon, but reminding us of the majesty of the Being with whom we have to do, and who is to be all in all in that scene.
F.C.H. Are these operations connected with the Father in this chapter still proceeding?
S.McC. Well, they are, and I think if we are to have the knowledge of John's God as we were referring to it we need to see the way that John the evangelist presents God as "the Father". We need to know the way that John refers to the Person of the Father, so that we may be helped in worshipping God.
P.H.H. Do you think the way that the Lord Jesus in John refers to the Father, and the writer refers to the Father from the beginning of the gospel, is to build up our minds and affections in regard of that great Person,
{67}
so that we might be set free to go to the length which is in mind in the gospel?
S.McC. Yes, I think so, because I think the great bearing of the knowledge of the Father is to help us to know God, that is, what He is in the fullest sense, in all His supremacy and majesty as the Being to be adored and worshipped.
P.H.H. And does that setting liberate us in love and restfulness so that we might be free, so to speak, to explore the divine domain as far as it is made known to us?
S.McC. That is the point exactly, all bearing on the activities of the Father and the Son and the Spirit. We have thus an economy devised by divine love in which divine affections are seen so that we should know God according to what He is -- as it is said, "God is love", and that is how we come to know Him. The Trinity always has existed in Oneness, and the economy has been devised by divine love, in order that divine affections might be known, and it is in this way that we are brought to know God, that we have come to God, the judge of all. That involves God in His supremacy.
F.C.H. Would you say a word as to verse 46, "Not that any one has seen the Father, except he who is of God, he has seen the Father"?
S.McC. Well, it alludes to what we were saying, that the Father has remained in the inscrutableness of Deity. He has not come into a form such as we see in the Lord Jesus in manhood, but the Lord revealed the Father as He says Himself. We are dependent on the Lord as to our knowledge of the Father.
A.H.G. Referring back to the way the Lord is presented in the gospel of John, would you say that all He is in His own Person is involved in the title "the Son of God"?
S.McC. Well, I would rather say in the title "the Son". "The Son of God" is what He is more as representative of God; "the Son" is the appellation that particularly alludes to His personal greatness and deity.
G.A.L. Does not chapter 5 show that the Son is both Son of God and Son of man?
{68}
S.McC. Well, exactly, so that the Person is in mind.
A.H.G. What would be the particular bearing of believing on the Son of God? That seems to be the great objective in this gospel, "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God" (@John 20: 31), and then your scripture in chapter 9 brings us to that point.
S.McC. Well, I think that is an important feature of the teaching, because in the Son of God the heart of God is brought near. In "the Word" we have the full unfolding of the mind of God; in "the Son of God" we have the heart of God brought near, because He expresses to us in a unique way divine love.
A.J.G. Does it also convey the thought of supreme dignity in manhood?
S.McC. It does. As representing God He has come in on God's side; as Son of man He has come in on man's side; but as Son of God He has come in on God's side, to make God known.
G.A.L. Does it not seem as though the title "the Christ" is the apostolic title for the Son of man? I mean, in the first of Ephesians, for instance, where all things are put under His feet, it is the Christ, is it not, and I was thinking of the scripture just quoted, "That ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God", that it compasses both glories.
S.McC. Are you alluding to the fact that we do not get the Son of man in the epistles?
G.A.L. Yes.
S.McC. It is very interesting that the Son of man is so much mentioned in the gospels and is mentioned in the Acts, and we have a reference which bears on it in Hebrews, but generally the title is not employed in the epistles. I think "the Christ" represents, as you say, something on that line, that He is the answer to every human hope, whether it be in man generally, or whether it be in Israel, in regard to the whole scope of prophecy; the Christ is the answer to every human hope in the Gentile world and in Israel.
J.S.E. Is that perhaps why Stephen is the only human being who employs the term Son of man, and he does it
{69}
at the closing down of a limited arena and at the point of opening up an unlimited arena?
S.McC. Yes, exactly. You mean in that sense the Son of man is standing linked with the widest and most extended range of things in regard of divine operations?
J.S.E. I wondered if that was why the Spirit impelled Stephen to use that term at that juncture.
S.McC. Yes, I am sure it is, because it is a transitional point. The metropolis is being transferred to heaven; it had long been here in Jerusalem, but it is being transferred to heaven, and heaven becomes the great centre of the vast extended operations involving the Gentile world where the assembly is to come peculiarly into view in Paul's ministry.
P.H.H. It is remarkable what you are saying about the term "the Christ", and what Mr. L. has raised; in the end of @Ephesians 1 the expression is used which belongs to the realm of the Son of man, does it not, "has put all things under his feet"? But I understand you to say that it is in the setting of the Christ. Is it as the Head of the assembly?
S.McC. Yes, the anointed man -- the Christ. Ephesians makes a good deal of "the Christ" -- what He is as anointed and filling out the official position. Everything is headed up in the Christ in the body of that first chapter; it says in regard to what God purposes in Himself, "for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ". That involves the same thing as the all things being put under the Son of man.
P.H.H. So later, "He wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead", and then, "He has put all things under his feet" -- so that this great sphere where everything is subordinated to the Son of man is now to be viewed relative to Christ and the assembly, and the assembly shares with Him in it?
S.McC. That is it. So that John's ministry in the epistle makes the difference between the Son of God and the Christ, that Jesus is the Christ. In his epistle he does not bring in the Son of man, but alludes to the Christ -- which is more the official title, the One who has come in as the answer to every hope both in regard of the race and also in regard to Israel.
{70}
A.W.G.T. Do you want to go on to the next scripture?
S.McC. Well, we might refer to how the man in the 9th of John comes to the knowledge of the Son of God; we are to see how knowledge comes to him. The Jews, I suppose, would rule him out, indeed they did, "They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses". And then later down, verse 34, "They answered and said to him, *Thou* hast been wholly born in sins, and *thou* teachest us?" That is, they are occupied with the man in an external way; they do not see the mystery linked with the works of God in the man, and the knowledge that he has acquired in regard to this Person that had come into his view.
A.H.G. Would you say a word as to the word of Paul in Ephesians, "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God"?
S.McC. Well, do you not think that that is a prime matter, the knowledge of the Son of God? The fact that all the ministry is directed to that end shows what a prime matter it is; it is bound up with the full-grown man and the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ.
E.J.H. Is not the work remarkable in the man's soul, in that he had never seen the Lord with his natural sight, and yet according to the perfection of the work in him all this has been built into his soul so that he is ready for the communication of the title Son of God?
S.McC. Yes, so that we are helped to see the way he arrived at knowledge, the way he was taught through different things, and it is a good example for us as we think of it. He comes under the divine hand, and what progress he makes in knowledge, as this chapter shows, apart from human resources, we might say, apart from external means, he learns well; he reaches the Son of God in his knowledge, who is the centre of another world.
C.D.L. Referring to the matter of the Son involving His personality, as you were mentioning just now, is it not striking that you have all this reference to the knowledge of the Son of God, but as to the Son, no one knows the Son?
S.McC. As to His Person, quite. It is well to keep in mind the inscrutability of the Person of Christ, that as
{71}
to His Person and His abstract place in relation to Deity we do not know. We know how the thought of revelation comes into what He is in manhood as in @Matthew 16 and @Galatians 1, but that does not in any sense negate what the Lord says, that "no one knows the Son but the Father" (@Matthew 11: 27).
J.S.E. Does that not give some emphasis to the Father making use, if I may so say, of His supreme place in the economy to guard the personality of the One who has entered into a mediatorial set of circumstances?
S.McC. It does. You are impressed with how divine Persons and Their glory are guarded. There is also the allusion to the Spirit in another relation as to anything that might be said derogatory to Him, how that is guarded; we are reminded thus of the great thought of what is cherubic in the realm of revelation, that which guards the glory of divine Persons.
J.L.F. Would you say a word about the word in @Hebrews 1: 8, "As to the Son, Thy throne, O God, is to the age of the age"?
S.McC. Well, there is another allusion to the deity of the Son. Alluding to that Person in manhood, while the Son refers to His personal greatness, it is not a name or appellation that can be carried back to describe His relations in pre-incarnate Deity; it is an appellation which bears on Him in manhood, but referring to His personal greatness in manhood.
F.C.H. In @Matthew 11 and @Luke 10 that statement by the Lord seems to be in the nature of a soliloquy or a musing, does it not? He is not speaking to the Father, and He is not speaking to His own, is He? But is it not a musing or soliloquy in regard of His own Person, how great it is?
S.McC. Yes. You notice in Scripture that certain things are said in our hearing at times which are calculated to impress us with the realm that we are in, although God has come so near, and divine Persons as distinguished in Their operations in the economy are so near us; the impression is always left on our minds as to what is beyond us.
{72}
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS READING (4)
@John 10: 1 -- 15; @John 14: 1 -- 20
S.McC. This tenth chapter, in the portion of it that we have read, brings up the knowledge that is amongst the sheep of Christ in regard to Christ Himself, the Shepherd, and also brings out the thought of His knowledge of them. What the Lord says in verse 14 is very affecting, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". It would seem that the divine standard of knowledge is with the sheep of Christ according to that verse, which should affect us; then in @John 14, the knowledge of divine Persons as it comes before us in that exalted setting: first the knowledge of the Father -- how important it is in this gospel that we should know the Father, and God as presented in the Father; then the knowledge of the Holy Spirit, as the Lord says the world does not see Him nor *know* Him, "but ye *know* Him", alluding to the disciples, "for he abides with you and shall be in you". And then His reference to the assembly day, the Spirit's day, and His own place in divine affections -- the perfect state of love that is contemplated in verse 20, "In that day ye shall *know* that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". A perfect state of love is contemplated, and the wondrous knowledge that is linked with it. I thought we should consider briefly this 10th chapter, and then give the major part of the time to the 14th chapter.
Our place as the sheep of Christ is important -- what we are as marked out in the light of John's ministry in this way: the objects of divine attention, and the peculiar glory of Christ as the Shepherd, the good Shepherd, who lays down His life for the sheep; all this accentuating the holy activities of love, in the mediatorial economy into which God has come. We shall never understand the economy if we do not understand and appreciate love. The measure of our spirituality can be taken account of by
{73}
the measure in which we are formed in love. It is not much use talking about spirituality if we are not formed in love, for the two go together, and this chapter accentuates the links in holy love between the sheep and the Shepherd, and the service of holy love on the part of the Shepherd in laying down His life for the sheep.
E.J.H. Is it on that account that the sheep never go astray -- sheep of this kind cannot stray?
S.McC. Yes, that is because John's sheep know Christ. They do not know the voice of a stranger. A remarkable statement that, in regard to John's sheep -- the sheep of Christ; it says "they know not the voice of strangers" (verse 5) but they know the Shepherd's voice.
A.Hn. Does that link up with what you were referring to this morning as to the remarkable intuition there is amongst the body of the saints? It says in verse 4, "they know his voice"; and verse 8, "the sheep did not hear them"; and then what you have referred to in verses 14 and 15.
S.McC. Yes, exactly. How all this should affect our souls as to our links in holy spiritual affinity with Christ as in the figure of the sheep! He Himself in this gospel is referred to as the Lamb of God -- a touching allusion to Christ in holy manhood here.
E.C.L. Does the reference to Mary in @John 20 illustrate what you are saying, "She supposing that it was the gardener", did not know Him, but when He said "Mary" she immediately says "Rabboni"?
S.McC. Very good -- that exactly illustrates what we have here, and it is also seen in the man in @John 9. He says in verse 36, "who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage". A true sheep of Christ, he discerns whose voice it is speaking, "he that speaks with thee is he", and he answers to it. The allusion in chapter 10 verse 3 is important, "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out." There is an abstruse allusion to the Holy Spirit in this figure -- the porter; that is, that we are to be conscious that the Spirit will make way for
{74}
Christ; He is not making way for the false shepherds, those that mount up elsewhere, thieves and robbers. It is remarkable that the Lord speaks in this way; it must have been the Pharisees and what He had to say to them in chapter 9 which drew out this plain speaking of the Lord as to those that mount up elsewhere being thieves and robbers, "but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter opens". No doubt an allusion to the holy scene recorded in the synoptic gospels where the Spirit comes upon Him as He enters upon His public ministry.
T.J.G. Is there a link between the thought of the sheep and the resolving of the question as to who Christ is? I am thinking of the reference to Solomon's porch later on in the chapter and the Lord then speaking of the sheep as hearing His voice and so on.
S.McC. Well, that is the point -- they know the shepherd. In the 23rd and 24th verses it says, "Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon. The Jews therefore surrounded him and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say so to us openly". Think of the innuendo in that; think of what they were implying, that He was secretive about matters, the aspersion they cast upon Him and His ministry, "Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense?" He was not holding their soul in suspense -- someone else was doing that, but He had taught openly in their synagogues and their temple; but they are casting this aspersion on Him, "If thou art the Christ, say so to us openly". Peter and the others in whom active faith was operative discerned who He was -- the Holy One of God, the Christ.
W.S.S. You were speaking of spiritual affinity with Christ. Would that involve our having in our measure the same thoughts and feelings in regard to the sheep as He Himself has?
S.McC. Yes, it would; that is, leadership enters into this section. That is what is in mind in what the Lord says. As we think of what happened in the 9th chapter, what a wrong lead they would give the man -- they would lead him out of the truth altogether, operating as they were, taking the place of knowing things, and seeking to lead
{75}
the man and instruct him. The Lord no doubt has all that in mind when He speaks of the thieves and robbers in this chapter and then refers to His own leadership, "he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out".
J.P.H. Would you say something as to verse 2, "he that enters by the door", then later down, "I am the door"?
S.McC. Well, I think the reference in verse 2 is to the legal way in which the Lord came in. He did not come in in any clandestine way, He came in the right and legal way; He came in by the door, and the porter opened to Him, and that would be what is in mind in verse 2, whereas in verse 9, "I am the door", is an allusion to what He was in Himself in manhood, in the great mediatorial position. There is only one way to God, and that is through Christ -- there is no other way.
C.H. The first reference stands connected with His entrance into the fold, but the second to His being a door in relation to the flock.
S.McC. That is important to notice as to the fold. There is no fold now; the idea of the fold is terminated. Divine Persons now take the place, if we might so say, of the fold, in that the hand of Christ, the Shepherd, and the hand of the Father are the confines in which the sheep are now held, and kept in the region of eternal life, and they shall never perish.
W.J.B. In referring to verse 3, "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice", etc., does that bring in the intimacy between the Lord and the sheep and also the Spirit and the sheep? It seems as though the Spirit enables us to recognise the Lord's voice.
S.McC. That is right, and it is important that we should recognise His voice. This gospel makes a good deal of the voice of Christ, and it is important that we should recognise His voice down *here*, because a sheep does not exactly allude to what we are in heaven, or in eternity -- it alludes to what we are down here in a defenceless position externally, but in a well-defended position spiritually, as in the hand of Christ, the Shepherd, and in the hand of the Father.
E.J.H. The Lord delighted to call attention to the characteristics of the sheep, and on that account He
{76}
acknowledges them with delight as divine property -- His own.
S.McC. Yes; that is, they are the subjects of the work of God, as is the blind man. It is really a carrying forward of what we have set out in principle in chapter 9: the subject of the works of God. Now we get it in a collective setting here, "there shall be one flock, one shepherd" -- the glory of the work of God in this setting.
P.H.H. Does 'the voice' open with us some exercise as to the speaker and the way that he is speaking? We have earlier the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the Son of God, and now the voice of the Shepherd. All the same Person, but not saying the same things in the same way.
S.McC. No, exactly; so the Shepherd's voice is important in this section, where Jewish opposition has been so strong, and would deflect a man -- the subject of the works of God as we have it in the 9th chapter. It is important that the Shepherd, the person who has such absolute care for the sheep -- His voice should be known and that He should be followed.
P.H.H. Does the voice raise with us the exercise as to some living expression at the time? We might be quite clear in terms as to the Person of Christ and so on, but He is speaking in a different way at different times, and different matters are involved.
S.McC. That is one of the things that is particularly on one's mind and heart in this reading -- the importance of the voice, and active love as it is seen in this chapter, because, while we may all be concerned to get the terms of the truth rightly, it is important that we should see that we have to do with living Persons. The Lord speaks in this gospel of the living Father; we have to do with living Persons, and the matter of divine affections entering into our relations with Them.
A.J.G. The voice of the shepherd is to regulate the movements of all the flock, would you say? One flock, one shepherd, and one voice, you might say, for the whole flock?
S.McC. Very good. You mean that it stresses the thought of unity in regard of the saints -- one voice. I think it is good that we should see that, because in Corinthians
{77}
Paul speaks of different voices: "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world and none of undistinguishable sound", but the great thing is the Shepherd's voice, the voice of this Person, for a divine Person is the Shepherd.
A.W.G.T. Does not that show itself in Paul's ministry? In @Acts 9: 4, note '*r*' and in chapters 22 and 26 the voice is referred to in both the genitive and the accusative; that is, it is not only the oral voice but what is before the mind. Does that help at all?
S.McC. Well, it does. It is interesting, too, how @Acts 20 is full of the spirit of @John 10, is it not? The love side, the sheep side, the flock of God -- all that is entering into @Acts 20, is it not, in relation to Paul's ministry?
A.W.G.T. It is indeed.
A.H.G. And does the voice have particular bearing in relation to a religious setting of things?
S.McC. Yes, the fold, leading them out of the fold, the fold representing an ordered religious system of things that the Lord has come into, and He calls His own sheep by name and leads them out. When He has put forth all His own He goes before them, and the sheep follow Him. All this involves the death of Christ and His burial and resurrection; it is all entering into this chapter in view of the sheep being in all the liberty and the unity of the one flock and the one Shepherd.
W.O.S. Would the Lord's remark in verse 15, "I am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father", be calculated to move us in relation to affection as you were saying?
S.McC. It would. It is a remarkable reference that we have here, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". Think of the way in which the Father knows Christ and in which He knows the Father. The Lord would not be alluding to what we might call the knowledge of Deity here so much; it is "am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". He is alluding to what is in the economy and Their relations together -- He in manhood and sonship, and the Father in that glorious relation as Father to Christ.
{78}
T.B.C. Is the voice discerned in the ministry?
S.McC. Well, it may be; the voice of Christ enters into the ministry, and has a unifying effect on the saints -- it is one voice; not half a dozen voices, but one voice, which has in mind the one flock.
A.Hn. You referred to @Acts 20. I wonder if I might ask you to say a word as to the Spirit operating in view of shepherding? Paul there seems to have that in mind, "wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers", and immediately he goes on to speak of shepherding. Would the Spirit be operating like that today?
S.McC. Well. He is. The Lord has gone on high; He is now in heaven, functioning in heaven as a man in relation to the wondrous administration that has been established and inaugurated there, and the Spirit has come, and is here, and He is augmenting the shepherd service of Christ in the way that He sets on the care for the flock as we have it in @Acts 20.
G.A.L. You could hardly have the flock, could you, apart from the Lord having gone into death and having risen and been glorified, and the Spirit being here. All that would be involved in the flock, would it not?
S.McC. It would. You could hardly have the one flock as we have it now without the Spirit, because, as we have been taught, this is the point where John's ministry touches Paul's. Paul speaks of the body, John speaks of the flock.
W.S.S. Do we not see shepherd service outstandingly in Mr. Darby's service?
S.McC. Well, certainly we do. We would do well to emulate such. One was affected recently, when over in Ireland, as one thought of that beloved servant and the way he denied himself. We talk about the servants and how they labour today, but we do not labour much compared with how they laboured in that day, and they did not have the comforts that we have. Mr. Darby denied himself so that the true principle of Nazariteship was seen in him even externally, and how he laboured in relation to the poor of the flock.
W.S.S. He laboured to bring the flock together. In @Ezekiel 34 it speaks of a cloudy and dark day, in the
{79}
chapter referring to the recovery of Israel to the mountains of Israel. I have often thought Mr. Darby's service was very much in principle bringing the flock to light in a cloudy and dark day, so to speak.
S.McC. I am sure there is something in that, because Mr. Darby's ministry is *in principle* apostolic for the days of recovery.
A.Hn. Would you say by extension the golden threads of that service have come right down to our day, as we can all say surely we have seen it in beloved J.T.?
S.McC. Well, certainly there are those that followed. Some of us were at Quemerford the other night, and thinking about F.E.R. in the room in Quemerford (not that we want to go into history, but surely it should affect us the way our leaders have gone before) how he stood up in the midst of conflict, with persons openly contesting the truth; but in love for the flock, for the sheep, J.B.S. and F.E.R. laid down their lives, and beloved J.T. who followed. Shepherding involves leadership. It is an important thing that we should see that; sometimes we speak of shepherding as if it did not involve leadership, but shepherding involves leadership, that the shepherd goes before the sheep.
W.S.S. Leading into the best pastures?
S.McC. That is it -- the best; the best for the saints, for the sheep.
A.W.G.T. Is it not important that in the Ephesians the gift of shepherding and teaching goes together, as if the Lord will not allow His sheep to be taught by anybody but by those that love them? How important that those that lead and have any moral influence at all amongst the saints, that they should lead, and that we should all be speaking the same thing and saying the same thing, so that the flock, the sheep, are not diverged in what may be said; they will not be diverged, as they are held in relation to the shepherd's voice.
J.S.E. Does this allusion to "my sheep" bear on what you were saying about the body of the saints this morning? There is a peculiar touch of responsiveness, is there not, to the voice of the Shepherd, in that the word flock here is not diminutive, as it is in @Acts 20 and in Peter's epistle,
{80}
where the word probably infers what was in a place, do you think?
S.McC. It is important what you say, and it is a great help to any who have any part in serving the saints, not that any of us can speak of much, because after all it is very little, but in any part that any may have in serving the saints it is a great comfort to think of the flock, to think of the sheep who know Christ's voice. You have an assurance that they will rally to the truth; the work of God in the saints will always rally to the truth.
M.P.S. Does the passage that has been referred to in @Ezekiel 34 show that princeliness is a feature of the Shepherd?
S.McC. Yes, it is. That is amplified in the scripture that was alluded to in @Ezekiel 34, "David a prince", and princeliness is needed, those that can go before the sheep in affection for the sheep, not to impress them with their ability to administer or their ability to speak or to serve, but to impress the sheep with this great thought of divine affection -- the love that went all the way to Calvary, measuring the depths of Calvary's woe that the sheep might be secured.
F.C.H. There is something to enjoy in the statement "on this account the Father loves me". It is not just a statement of fact, is it, but that we should have some sense of His own enjoyment of the Father's love?
S.McC. Well, it is remarkable how knowledge comes in in that way. The Lord in @John 17: 26, in speaking to the Father, desires "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". That is the divine standard of love; here it is the divine standard of knowledge. In @1 Corinthians 13, in regard to the day to come, it says, "but then I shall know according as I also have been known". That is alluding to the divine standard of knowledge that we shall arrive at eventually, but it is delightful to think of this standard of knowledge here, that the sheep know Christ, "as the Father knows me and I know the Father".
P.H.H. What is involved in this thought of life? It says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly". There is first the voice and then the
{81}
suggestion of leading and going out and finding pasture, and then He says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly".
S.McC. Do you not think it would stand over against the whole Jewish system into which moral death had entered? The Lord has come to lead the sheep into life, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly". That is peculiar to the saints of this dispensation, the peculiar touch as to life, and the enjoyment of life that the saints have in the assembly abundantly, no doubt alluding to life in its fulness.
A.H.G. Would the knowledge of divine Persons that you have been stressing enter into this matter of life?
S.McC. It does, because life according to John's gospel -- that is, life as a matter of enjoyment -- lies in the knowledge of divine Persons. This is not life potentially; this is life as a sphere, a realm of enjoyment in the knowledge of divine Persons.
W.C. Later on He says, "I give them life eternal"; that is, in connection with preservation, is it not?
S.McC. Very good. The way that He speaks in @John 17 causes our attention to be focused on those that were given to Him out of this world; while He had been given authority over all flesh. He gives to them eternal life, as you say, "that as to all thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal"; and then the chapter begins to enlarge on those that have been given to Christ, indicating the peculiar way in which we come in for life -- such a distinctive heavenly way in this dispensation. But we need to see the importance of the love side in this tenth chapter, the sacrificial side, the laying down of the life -- all this is important in the system of divine affections, because if the saints are to be cared for rightly, and to be served rightly, it can only be in the spirit of Christ and in the grace of Christ as seen in this relation.
E.J.B. Is that the reason why the word for 'know' in verses 14 and 15 is objective knowledge; it can be taken account of by what it does?
S.McC. That is it. It is there objectively before us.
W.C. Will you say something about what the wolf means? You have it here, and Paul says grievous wolves
{82}
would come in, not sparing the flock. Have we, if we seek to be shepherds, to have our eyes, as it were, on the enemy at the same time and his movements? The idea of the robber and the wolf would be how the enemy would rob God, would it not really?
S.McC. A remarkable expression, is it not? In a gospel where the truth is so glorious, and especially in this chapter where He is speaking in accents so tender in regard of the sheep and His love for them, why should He use this expression 'the wolf seizes them'? It is the ravaging side in relation to the flock, the violent side; a wolf has no conscience, it represents persons who have no conscience at all.
G.A.L. And does not the end of @Acts 5 indicate that about the time of our Lord there were such? Gamaliel refers to them.
S.McC. Yes, exactly; in the secession you mean that they led.
G.A.L. Yes, Theudas, for instance.
S.McC. Yes.
A.J.G. Have the activities of the wolf in view the scattering of the flock? He cannot hinder their being carried through eternally, but he would bring about present scattering so as to discredit the testimony to God which unity affords?
S.McC. I am sure that is very important. The figures of speech employed here as to the alien influences that operate against the sheep are instructive. First "a thief and a robber" (verse 1). How that speaks to us! It is a reference to persons in responsibility who are thinking about themselves; they are not thinking about God, or about Christ, or about the saints -- they are thinking about themselves. And then the wolf (verse 18) refers to the violent devouring element that seems to be bent on scattering the sheep, "seizes them and scatters the sheep".
A.W.G.T. I wondered whether it had not rather a peculiar bearing on us here, since you referred to the historical side a few minutes ago. There was this kind of ravaging, and persons of this sort were used for a terrible attack a hundred years ago, and it centred in this city. Is that not something which should make us careful to lay
{83}
hold of all the truth we have had brought before us, so that it may be in the body of the saints, as has been said, so that the enemy may not get in?
S.McC. Well, exactly. Think of what obtained there: there were the thief and the robber and the wolf -- the subtle specious way the enemy wrought through Newton in systematised error to steal the affections of the saints; the clerical principle in Plymouth; the displacement of the Spirit of God; the over-riding of the shepherd's influence -- all that speaks of the thief and the robber. And then what followed in the scattering of the sheep ought to help us to see the true character of Bethesda in all its terribleness.
P.H.H. Whereas I suppose what happened in the next chapter (@John 11) with Lazarus and Mary and Martha would show the Lord's detailed care for them more inwardly; it was not exactly an external attack, to bring them over to the divine side whither the Lord was leading?
S.McC. That is it.
P.H.H. Love is prominent. "He whom thou lovest". Would that follow on your mentioning of love?
S.McC. It does, because it is not the flock that comes up in the 11th chapter but the family of God figuratively speaking, in the family at Bethany; the flock represents what the saints are as the objects of Christ's love and care in that way. It does not stress so much the active side with them, or the side of personality, but in the family of God the side of personality is developed, individual personality; we do well to remember that, so that however much we have been merged through the baptism of the Spirit into the wonderful entity called the body of Christ, or merged together as the flock of Christ, we must never forget that on the side of family relationship personality is developed, each one in his own distinctiveness in his impression of God and Christ.
E.J.H. Is that borne out by the word "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus"?
S.McC. Yes, it is; that is, each one comes up for honourable reference, so that every one of us has got a part, you see -- we cannot rule anybody out in @John 11. We might
{84}
attempt to rule Martha out and the standard of knowledge she had, but the Lord is serving her, and He is bringing her in, so that they are all in their place in the 12th chapter, and all serving in relation to one another; it is not a question of what they are saying, it is what they *are* and what is being done.
T.J.G. And also in that chapter 11 do we not see the triumph of shepherd love in putting into the mouth of the enemy that the children of God should be gathered together in one that were scattered abroad?
S.McC. Well, that is a rather remarkable word of Caiaphas, and is a word to keep in mind. It comes into John's gospel; it does not come into Matthew, or Mark or Luke. It is John that gives us that word, and we certainly should think of the children of God that are scattered abroad, and of how we can be a service to them in the true shepherd spirit of Christ.
C.H. Is it not often, too, a question of one dying for the nation, when crises arise in localities?
S.McC. Well, it is, and in this matter of the saints coming to the knowledge of the truth the shepherd goes before the sheep, the sheep are not going to lead the shepherd. It is the shepherd that goes before the sheep and leads them. Leadership is important in divine things. The brethren of course will understand I am not speaking of leadership officially, I am speaking of the principle of it. Leadership is leadership; democracy is not according to God; government by the people and for the people is not according to the divine mind. The divine thought is leadership, and leadership involves that there is the going before, laying down our lives, serving the saints in the spirit and grace of Christ.
P.H.H. Is it remarkable that in the family setting in @John 11 this great thought of personality and individual lustre and glory should be alluded to?
S.McC. Well, it is indeed, because we might refer to it as a kind of a transitional point; the Lord is about to enter upon the final setting of His teaching from the 13th chapter onward, in regard to the collective position and what divine Persons are to us in the collective position, but we get this wonderful view projected before our minds
{85}
and hearts of the distinctiveness of the family of God. Each member, each individual one is mentioned, both together and severally, and what a help it would be to recognise that in our localities, do you not think?
P.H.H. Yes, indeed; and I wondered whether it did not proceed into the spiritual and eternal sphere. One reference to the saints would be, as you were saying, the body, or the assembly; but there is the other side in sonship, is there not, where every person stands, you might say, in his own glory?
S.McC. That is it, so eternity will be filled with the most wonderful persons, myriads of personalities, with distinctive impressions of Christ. We get great diversity, but unity in that diversity, in that it is a living state of things. Now in @John 14 we should see primarily this thought of the knowledge of the Father, and then the knowledge of the Spirit, and then the knowledge of Christ in the Father's affections, and we in His, and He in ours. This opens up a rich and refined realm of knowledge. The 14th chapter of John becomes more wonderful every time you read it, as to what is projected on to our view by the Lord in His service.
A.H.G. Verse 1 says, "Let not your heart be troubled". Would that be the outcome of the unifying of which you have been speaking?
S.McC. That is it. It begins with that, and it ends with that; verse 27, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it fear". "Let not your heart be troubled" is the first verse, and in between is this restful state contemplated in which the Lord serves in relation to the features of knowledge that are referred to.
C.H. Can you help us at this juncture as to the "believing also on me"? Is it now that they are to get further advance in the knowledge of this One who is leaving?
S.McC. That is it. It contemplates the Lord as going away. Heretofore He had been with them and among them, so that there was no necessity for active faith in relation to Him; but now that He has gone to heaven, as this would contemplate, the necessity for faith comes in. He says, "ye believe on God, believe also on me". That is, He is to become an object of faith to them. The Spirit is
{86}
not quite in the same way an object of faith because He is with us and in us.
A.H.G. Is it often perhaps because of the lack of this unity amongst the saints in love indicated in verse 1 that we do not get helped as we should do in relation to divine Persons?
S.McC. Do you mean it is not hearts? It is "let not your *heart* be troubled".
A.H.G. Yes.
S.McC. Yes, that is a significant reference to the way they would be bound together in affection, because @John 14 brings up the wonderful binding ties of affection between the disciples and Christ, so much so that it must have affected the Lord's heart as He said to them in verse 18, "I will not leave you orphans. I am coming to you". Why did He use that word? He is describing the absolute desolateness of their hearts at the thought of losing this One to whom in love and affection they had become so bound in companionship with Him here.
A.W.G.T. Could you say why the Father's house comes in just at this juncture?
S.McC. Well, I think the Lord is assuring their hearts just as He would assure ours that if He is going on before, He is not going on without us; we are on His heart and in His thoughts, and He has gone there before us to prepare a place for us. It brings out the singular glory of the assembly amongst the many families, and the Father's house would open upon our view a great range of things in relation to the many families, and many abodes, all of infinite nearness to God in this happy state of love, but then there is a special place for the assembly, "for I go to prepare *you* a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be".
P.H.H. Is it significant that He says "*my* Father's house"?
S.McC. It is, because it is alluding to His own relations with the Father, "in my Father's house". He does not say in *the* Father's house, but "in *my* Father's house", particularly alluding to His own relations with the Father. Have you anything in mind in relation to it?
{87}
P.H.H. I thought perhaps it magnified the service of the Lord's sonship on our behalf: the Son of God, knowing the Father as His Father, and now He is proposing to serve the saints to this end, to prepare a special place with Him in His own presence, in His Father's house?
S.McC. That is it.
J.S.E. Is not this a peculiar touch of glory with which we should be more acquainted? The Lord does not refer as much to what He is going to do for them here on earth as He does in the synoptic gospels, but here it is what He is going to do for them in another sphere altogether.
S.McC. That is it, and He especially stresses in His reference to it the holy ties and links in love that will never be broken; if the sheep represent links with the Shepherd in holy love, @John 14 brings them on to our view, if we might say, in a greater way; not in a more blessed way, for I suppose the love is the same, but in a more extended way.
N.K.M. Is this essentially future, or can it be touched and reached in the Spirit's power now?
S.McC. You mean the Father's house -- "My Father's house"?
N.K.M. Yes, and the place that the Lord has prepared?
S.McC. Well, it is specially alluding to what is future and what is linked with the day to come; but of course there is little that we cannot touch in the Spirit's power here. What we have to do with is more the house of God in its provisional aspect at the present time.
A.J.G. Would you say that in these words in this chapter the Lord is really introducing the Father to us and in a sense making Him attractive?
S.McC. He is. He is introducing Him in a state of active love. I am sure that this matter of active love in this whole environment is important in relation to our knowledge of divine Persons. Do you not think so?
A.J.G. Yes, I do. I was thinking of the way He introduces "my Father's house" as though to impress them with the sense that the Father was the One who had the house, and ordered things there, and then later He says, "my Father will love him and we will come to him", and so on.
{88}
S.McC. This chapter is remarkable in that way for the manner in which divine Persons are brought so near to us; we are made to feel that we are not far from any one of Them. We are in the realm and environment of love, and the Lord, speaking reverently, is introducing the Father gradually. He says (verse 4), "And ye know where I go, and ye know the way. Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father, and henceforth ye know him and have seen him". The Lord is stressing now His mediatorial position; the only way in which we can know the Father is in Christ, and by Christ, and through His service to us.
P.H.H. Does that provide somewhat the answer to Mr. M.'s question? The Lord does not say that He is the way to the Father's house, but the way to the Father. Is that what fills out the present time, leaving the Father's house in its own eternal glory to the future?
S.McC. It is, that is beautiful; it says of the Spirit that He is the truth, and it says of Him, as in the believer in @Romans 8, that the Spirit is life, but it never says the Spirit is the way. The way is exclusive to Christ, the mediator between God and men -- one, the man Christ Jesus.
G.A.L. There are remarkable depths as to the feelings of the blessed Lord opened in this chapter, are there not? I was thinking of verse 10, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?" and again later on, "if ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father".
S.McC. You feel that affection is accentuated in this chapter in the way that the Lord propounds questions to the disciples. It is not that He is wanting to bring out their ignorance -- that is not the point at all; He is seeking to bring them into this active operative state of love where divine Persons are known. He was in it Himself, how He lived in the Father, and how the Father was seen in Him. What a perfect state of love was there.
W.S.S. So you would say that if we are to come into it we must come into it in our affections?
{89}
S.McC. Well, we must, and it is important that we should know the Father as John presents Him; we have to note, as Mr. Darby in his letter to Mr. Stoney pointed out many years ago, the difference between Paul's presentation of the Father and John's presentation of the Father. In Paul invariably it is linked with our state and relationship, and our enjoyment of the relationship; John presents the Father as to what He is personally; His Person is presented to us in John's ministry, and we have all humbly to admit that when it comes to the Person of the Father we have a lot to learn.
A.P.B. Would you help us as to the difference between what the Lord enjoyed of the Father's company when He was here, and the thought of "going to the Father" as something additional to that?
S.McC. Well, I think it is wonderful that the Spirit helps us to see the glorious state of things in heaven and that man is there -- "Oh the sight in heaven is glorious, Man in righteousness is there". Man is there with God in that setting. It is a wonderful thing to think of it, and to take account of the glorious state of manhood in Christ in heaven, that He is there as man with the Father.
A.P.B. I have wondered whether our present knowledge of the Father personally does not depend both on Christ having gone to the Father in the way you are saying, and on the Spirit having come from the Father.
S.McC. Well, it does; that is how we come into it. Think of the ten days preceding the Spirit coming from Christ. What a scene of holy converse! Not that we would conjecture -- far be the thought -- but what holy communication and communion must have obtained in the ten days after our Lord ascended and before the Spirit descended! And then the Spirit coming and forming the assembly, and bringing into the bosom of the assembly all the refinement of the *knowledge* linked with that position, and the wealth and the warmth of the *love* linked with that position in heaven where Christ is as man with the Father.
C.W.O'L.M. Is that not involved in the statement "whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak"?
S.McC. That is it; that would be what is in mind. He brings back a report of what is there, and how it affects
{90}
your soul, the glory of the Spirit's presence -- the most wonderful thing on earth, as J.T. said recently, the Spirit's presence in the assembly, the greatest Friend that we have on earth.
W.M.B. Would you give us some help about the difference between verse 11 and verse 20? Does it show the added knowledge that comes with the Spirit, the first being a question of faith?
S.McC. In verse 11 He says, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the works sake themselves". You notice that He is referring to the operating side, where the works are coming out. He says in verse 10, "the Father who abides in me, he does the works". It is linked with the works, but when we come to verse 20 "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". It is more the inward side of love and affection; not that verse 11 does not involve love, but more the public operative side in relation to the works.
W.M.B. I wondered if the reference to "in that day" stressed the Spirit's day, the presence of the Comforter -- is that what you had in mind?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, because the last part of the verse, "and ye in me and I in you", could not be apart from the Spirit, so that "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" is possible because of the Spirit.
A.J.G. And in verse 11 "believe me", emphatic *me*, "that I am in the Father and the Father in me", does not that involve the truth as to the Person of Christ -- His part in Deity, and is not that all carried forward into verse 20 now that the Spirit has come, "ye shall know that I am in my Father", that involves the place of affection as you say, but the truth of verse 11 is all carried forward into that, is it not?
S.McC. It is. The blessedness of all that was here in holy manhood in Christ in sonship is all carried into the position on high. He laid down the condition, that is one thing that we have to keep in mind. He came into a condition which has been laid down never to be resumed again, for He has taken His life in a new condition, but
{91}
all the excellence of manhood that was there in the condition that was laid down is carried forward into the position on high.
J.S.E. Is this chapter what we might call a chapter of credits put to the body of the saints? The Lord refers to the term 'ye' invariably, and yet one or two brothers bring up their questions, and the Lord takes advantage of them to put further credits to the body of the persons who were there with Him.
S.McC. Yes, just so. He is moving in relation to the disciples in such an affectionate and appealing way, recognising what they were as given to Him of the Father, and the wonderful fruits of His own service with them; because there is a wonderful tribute to the service of Christ in the twelve, and I think it is coming out here in their questions, while there was a measure of ignorance there with them. It is not to their discredit exactly; the Lord is bringing out more through it.
G.A.L. So that the Lord is coming to the climax of His great service in this chapter. He is bringing out the fulness of the Christian position, as you say, in verse 20?
S.McC. He is. Life as we have it in @John 14 is the highest aspect of life in the gospel. He says, "yet a little while and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live. In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". I understand that to be the acme of things in Christianity.
J.S.E. And still bearing on the 'ye'.
S.McC. Still bearing on the 'ye', the dignity of the Christian company that is set out in nucleus in the twelve.
P.H.H. Tell us something about this life. Did you say it is the highest?
S.McC. Well, it is life in relation to our links with Christ in glory. It is not the appropriation of Christ down here; it is the appropriation of Christ up there. By the Spirit I am linked with Christ in glory, and as maintained in holy contact in intimacy with Him I am in life. Because He lives I live.
G.A.L. So we are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. It is "in Christ Jesus" I was thinking.
{92}
S.McC. The position of them, you mean -- yes.
A.Hn. Does the enjoyment of that depend upon verses 15 and 21, "he that loves me"? I was wondering if you would say a word about that.
S.McC. Yes, I think it is important, but I should be glad if we could have a word on the Father and the making known of the Father before we touch on that. I think it is important that we should see the matter of the Father as John presents Him, and our knowledge of the Father, because the Father is a glorious Person in John's ministry; the Lord is too, and the Spirit, but the Lord is intensifying the thought of the Father in this section of John's gospel. He wants us to know the Father; He wants us to understand the Father.
H.F.R. Is that with a view to our becoming worshippers of the Father? According to His word in the fourth chapter?
S.McC. Well, it is, and with a view to our being worshippers of God. We shall never worship God rightly unless we are fully and firmly instructed in regard to the knowledge of the Father.
E.J.B. What is going to help us in developing in the knowledge of the Father?
S.McC. Coming under the hand of Christ and the Spirit, because after all the Spirit is here to help us in the way of power to apprehend the truth.
W.S.S. Do you not think that the Spirit would help us to see in John's gospel the deep desires of the Lord that we should know the Father? It is wonderful how the feelings of Christ seem to shine out in the desire that we should know the Father.
S.McC. Well, it is, because "*the* Father" implies sonship in relation to Christ, and sonship implies an active state of love. We have in the 13th chapter, the Lord "came out from God and was going to God"; the primary thought is God and the final thought is God, but in between there is the marvellous dip in which the mediatorial economy is before us. God is seen in the Father in that relation to impress us with the love and grace of His heart; sonship too appearing in that relation to impress us with divine love. God is love, and this is the way that
{93}
we come to know God in Himself; and He desires to be known in Himself in so far as we can know Him, so that the relation of Father and the name "Father" directly bears upon our knowledge of God in this primary and final way.
F.C.H. Would you say a little as to the end of verse 28 in that connection, "if ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father, for my Father is greater than I"?
S.McC. Well, there is the grace of the economy, this wonderful system of divine affections devised by divine love that we should know God who is love; we are going to be with that God through all eternity, and we are going to be with Him as having learned Him, and having been taught in relation to Him, through this wonderful divine arrangement in the mediatorial economy, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, and the Lord is saying, "if ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father, for my Father is greater than I". That is, it is the opening up of the heavenly realm.
A.B. Would love for Christ bring in the Father's affections for that one? I was thinking particularly of verse 21, "but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father", and then again of the further thought in verse 23, "if any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him".
S.McC. I am not getting your thought; say something more, please.
A.B. I was asking whether such become known to the Father particularly; that is, those that love Christ and keep His commandments and keep His word, and whether such persons are particularly lovable to the Father?
S.McC. Well, they are; that is a great encouragement to our hearts, and especially to the younger brethren to see how they come under divine attention as loving. God delights to take account of the lovers of Christ in this way. We should finish with a word as to the Spirit. It says in verse 16, "and I will beg the Father and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him" -- the emphatic 'ye' again -- "*ye* know him, for he abides
{94}
with you and shall be in you". I am sure it is important that we should more and more know the Spirit in the way in which the Lord is alluding to Him in this section, because the only liberty we have, and the only joy we have in the realm of the knowledge of divine Persons is what is afforded us by this Person.
A.J.G. This is objective knowledge, is it "Ye know him" referring to the Spirit? This chapter really gives us an objective presentation of the Father and the Son and the Spirit, does it not?
S.McC. Very instructive.
P.H.H. If we can take account of the Spirit objectively, it certainly releases us to speak to Him.
S.McC. Yes, quite so, it does, and why should we not speak to Him? To say that we cannot speak to Him is an implication that He is not God.
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS, READING (5)
@John 17; @John 20: 17 -- 31
S.McC. It is felt that these two passages that we have read should complete our enquiry in relation to the subject that has been before us in this gospel as to the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things. The verses in @John 20 were read because they are involved in what the Lord says in verse 26 of this 17th chapter, "and I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". There are one or two references to the thought of the knowledge of divine Persons in this wonderful chapter, and it has been referred to as the greatest chapter in the apostolic section of the Scriptures. It is a chapter that is different from all the others; a certain uniqueness attaches to it in that we are not exactly in the presence of ministry in this chapter, but in the presence of the speaking of one divine Person to another. As we were saying, we are not in the presence exactly of the Lord teaching in ministry in this chapter, but we are privileged to be as it were in the presence of His speaking to the Father, one
{95}
divine Person speaking to another -- on the one hand in the light of His own equality with the Father, on the other as in the subject dependent place out of which He never took Himself as having come into it; and even in this chapter, while His equality is asserted, He takes the place of receiving things from the Father. And it is thought that we should see first what is referred to in "and this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". The knowledge of God is linked with eternal life; and then towards the end the knowledge of God is linked with the family side. Eternal life is not so much linked with the family side; eternal life is more linked with God and men. So that we should consider first what is referred to in this matter, "that they should know thee", "this is *the* eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". And then the wonderful expressed desires on the part of the Son to the Father as to unity. There are three great references to unity in this chapter: first in relation to the apostles themselves, the apostolic unity, then in relation to those that believed through their word, and then the thought of unity in glory linked with sonship. There are other things that may come in, but these are salient features that we should keep before us in what we are about to consider. The fact that we are in a priestly atmosphere here in itself has its own word for us.
J.A.P. Why do you say that, a priestly atmosphere?
S.McC. The Son is speaking to the Father; we are in a priestly realm, our minds are impregnated through His utterances with the thought of holiness as He recognises what the Father has given to Him out of the world, and expresses His holy desire that they should be kept from the evil that is in the world. The Lord is priestly in His attitude here, and the whole chapter is filled with priestly utterances in so lofty and exalted a subject as the chapter contemplates.
P.H.H. Is the thought of eternal life somewhat selective here? It says first, "thou hast given him authority over all flesh"; then, "as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal".
{96}
S.McC. Yes, it is; it is drawn attention to in regard to the position that the Lord has, as given authority over all flesh, which would look on to the millennial world and the millennial day; but our thoughts are particularly concentrated on the disciples and on those that should believe on Him through their word as particularly selected, marked out in relation to this great blessing, this wondrous blessing, not so great as sonship. Eternal life is not so great as sonship, but it is a wondrous blessing, one of the greatest blessings that we possess. We have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, and eternal life is one of them.
J.E.B. Is it to be noted that the thought of giving occurs a great number of times in this chapter, seventeen times. It is a very precious thought in connection with the Father, is it not?
S.McC. Yes. I think it is very important, because we might say, reverently speaking, in a certain way that we are in the presence of divine love unhindered here. We have the flow of divine affections that the economy was specially devised to impress our minds with -- the giving being part of that -- it is the great expression of God in His nature -- God is love, and the giving is a great expression of God in His nature in that way.
F.P.B. Does the only true God cover that?
S.McC. Yes. The Lord says, "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". It is remarkable how He refers to Himself in this way, "and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". That kind of man, that order of man, would be particularly stressed -- eternal life linked with God and man in that way.
T.J.G. Does the emphasis being on *eternal* in that verse suggest that the knowledge of "the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" is not the acquisition of a mere point of knowledge, but an eternal matter that becomes an integral part of the believer?
S.McC. Yes, the word eternal, of course, in "eternal life" should be contrasted with a scene of death, where man's life has been shortened; we know that in the early chapters of Genesis great longevity marked man's life,
{97}
but that has been shortened, and tremendous difficulties and pressures have come in through sin in relation to the shortening of man's life, and eternal life is the great answer to that, in the very scene where sin has brought in such disaster. Eternal life of course is referring to an out-of-the-world condition of things.
J.S.E. As you remarked earlier, eternal life is not so great as sonship?
S.McC. No, it is not. It is important that we should see that, wondrous as eternal life is, it is not on the same plane as sonship; sonship is the highest blessing for man. We do not reach anything higher than sonship in the way of blessing, and it is linked with the family thought, whereas eternal life is not -- it is God and men.
J.S.E. Yes. Why I asked my question is because you were emphasising eternal life coming into evidence and enjoyment where sin was, but sonship belongs to what is outside of that, does it not?
S.McC. Very good. Sonship is particularly heavenly, although eternal life as *we* have it is on the heavenly line too, in contrast to the millennial day, where it will be particularly seen in relation to the earth, and the earthly order of things. Eternal life as we have it in the assembly is on the heavenly line, but its bearing is on the condition of things here.
A.J.G. So that has it specially in view our position here in testimony? I mean, has it in view that a heavenly colour and power are given to the position in testimony?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, so that there is a testimony in life in the saints through their enjoyment of it in the sphere of life as it is contemplated in this great thought of eternal life. Eternal life underlies the whole position here. It underlies all the meetings, underlies the service of God. Properly speaking it is a land thought; it belongs to the land, but it underlies the whole position of testimony as you referred to it here.
N.K.M. Is it connected particularly with promise, and sonship with purpose?
S.McC. It is. Sonship was in the mind of God before the world was, but eternal life comes in after sin was introduced and bears upon the introduction of sin in the
{98}
world; it is on the line of promise to meet what has come in through sin in the shortening of the span of life, the pressure of death upon our spirits; eternal life is God's great provision to meet that kind of thing.
E.J.H. Is "lifting up the eyes to heaven" connected with what you are speaking of as to the influence of heaven on the whole position?
S.McC. Yes. This whole chapter is to draw us into the environment of heaven although we are still on earth. One of the things that is so affecting in this chapter is the way the Lord speaks, as if the geographical setting did not exist. He says, "and now I come to thee" -- a remarkable statement on His part as to His going to the Father. This whole section from @John 13 to this chapter is filled with the thought of His going to the Father, which of course involves the cross, and the grave and His rising again, and ascension; but the Lord speaks of it as if He would draw us into the immediate environment of it and into heaven in that way.
W.S.S. And the Lord's joy in going to the Father?
S.McC. Yes. He would draw us into His restfulness, His peace, His joy in the position that He was in; we are left with all the richness of that legacy.
P.H.H. Is the contrasting thought of eternal life somewhat confirmed in the expression "the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"? The only true God?
S.McC. Yes. It would stand against what is false, do you think? It has a relative bearing on what would be around in regard to the multiplicity of gods, "there are gods many and lords many", so that we have an economical reference here in the statement "this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". It is an economical reference; the divine arrangement is in mind, in the only true God as seen in the Father, and Jesus Christ the sent One.
P.H.H. But if I understood your earlier remark, it does not really take us into any family relationship such as is contemplated in "my Father and your Father".
S.McC. No, it does not; that is not the side of the truth that comes in in connection with eternal life, so that
{99}
eternal life is presented in the gospel to men. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have life eternal." The great thought is men, and the bringing of them into eternal life. As Mr. Darby says, "The sense would thus be that He has loved men in view of eternal life, 'so that' He has given"
F.W.K. In the epistle to Titus eternal life is connected with the knowledge of the Saviour God and becomes the subject of testimony?
S.McC. Yes, it does.
J.A.P. How do you connect what you are saying with "God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son" -- in the epistle?
S.McC. The thought in @1 John 5 is to draw our attention to the position of it, where it is positionally, and life in its entirety is positionally in the Son. The believer has it of course; as John presents the truth the saints have it, but in its entirety John presents it positionally in that exalted position; not in heaven exactly, but in the Son, a wonderful reference to the dignity and glory of its position, so that it would involve divine affections, while eternal life does not involve the family side so much as God and men, yet it involves divine affections, so that the testimony to the eternal life came out in the Lord Jesus in His living relations with the Father.
W.McK. You remarked yesterday, in regard to chapter 14 when the Lord Jesus says "because I live ye also shall live", that that was the highest thought of life. Does that connect with what you are saying now?
S.McC. There we have the thought of life in an operative way. Eternal life is not exactly life in an operative way, but points to a sphere of life that is linked with the knowledge of divine Persons. In @John 14 the verse you allude to brings life before us and conveys, as you say, the highest presentation of life in John's gospel on the operative side -- I mean operative in the sense that it affects us. We live because He lives, but eternal life is another thought.
H.A.H. Are not family conditions on our side as brethren necessary for the enjoyment of it.
{100}
S.McC. Yes. It involves a sphere -- "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity". Then, as the Psalm (@Psalm 133) goes on, "there Jehovah commanded the blessing". That is, it is linked with these conditions so that properly and rightly speaking it is a blessing that is linked with the land, the heavenly side.
H.F.R. @John 12 has often been used as an illustration of it. It is a family setting there?
S.McC. Yes. We see how the pressure of death was lifted off their spirits as they were together in relation to one another and in relation to Christ, so that movements in honouring Christ were unimpeded.
A.J.G. The family setting would give the heavenly out-of-the-world character to it, would it, but the basic character of it is the knowledge of the true God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent?
S.McC. That is it. It involves an out-of-the-world condition and relationship and being; it involves a system of relationship, and that is what gives character to it in a heavenly way.
P.H.H. Does that mean that eternal life has a kind of dual application? On the one hand it will be known outwardly in the millennium, but at the present time it is known spiritually and more inwardly in the assembly?
S.McC. That is it. No family will know eternal life and enjoy eternal life as the assembly enjoys it; that is one of the things that shows us the importance of the Spirit as He is known in this dispensation. There are blessings which other families may touch in some measure, but with them it does not reach into the exquisiteness and blessedness of what is touched in the assembly, because eternal life in the assembly is enjoyed on the upward and heavenly line.
H.L.T. Would you say another word as to the second and the third verses? In the second it is 'life eternal' and in the third 'eternal life'.
S.McC. I do not know that I can say much about it. The one is stressing the life with the adjective after it, the other the adjective is before it. The one is stressing the thing itself, but the other is stressing the character of it; "this is *the* eternal life", we are to notice that. I think
{101}
the Lord is focusing our thoughts on the uniqueness of eternal life as we are to enjoy it, so that He does not say "and *this* is eternal life". He says "and this is *the* eternal life". I think it is particularly stressing it in relation to the family; this chapter contemplates the uniqueness of eternal life as it is known in the assembly which is *the* eternal life.
A.J.G. Has it not been said that the knowledge of the only true God delivers us from idolatry and the knowledge of Jesus Christ, His sent one, delivers us from lawlessness? And can you not see, the more you think of that, how essential that is if we are to be maintained in testimony here in the presence of all that is corrupt, and on the other hand if we are to be maintained in the service of God?
S.McC. I think that is very good, and it helps us as to the importance of eternal life as bearing on our public position in testimony and as bearing on the inward position in the service of God, because it is a living state of things that we have to do with, over against the dead state of things all around. The enjoyment of eternal life bears upon that. It is very striking that the first formal reference to the economy in this gospel is @John 3 at the end, verse 28, "the Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in his hands"; and then the 4th chapter immediately brings up the living water, that is the Spirit, and eternal life, in view of two great prime matters in the dispensation evangelical testimony and the worship of God in an inward way. The Spirit and eternal life bear directly on these matters as to living conditions in them, and power in them, and the first feature of the administration of the economy brings that out.
W.S.S. And in regard of what you said about the service of God following eternal life, eternal life is brought in in the 133rd Psalm, and we have the service of God in the next psalm, have we not -- "lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless Jehovah" (@Psalm 134: 3)?
S.McC. Very good, and it is important that we should see the bearing of eternal life in relation to the service of God, because it preserves us from holding the truth merely in terms; it preserves us from mere theology, in relation
{102}
to the truth, because in the assembly we have a living state of things.
A.Hn. Does the food in chapter 6 afford substance in this great matter of life and the service of God?
S.McC. Yes, it does. It brings in what is to help us constitutionally because we need help in our constitutions, and the food would bear upon that; it contemplates on the negative side the ending of one order of things, but on the positive side the opening up of another order of things, morally and spiritually outside of the world.
P.H.H. Why does the Lord immediately go on to the request for His being glorified? It seems perhaps somewhat abrupt, but He speaks of having glorified God on the earth, and "now glorify me, thou Father", and so on, leading on to what is inscrutable. What is the setting of that in relation to what we are saying?
S.McC. I think He is coming on to what is to impress our minds and hearts in a distinctive way in regard to the glory of divine Persons. Their relations with one another, because it would seem as if in this chapter the standard is set out in the relations of divine Persons with one another. The standard as to unity, the standard as to perfect love, is set out in the relations between the Father and the Son, and the Spirit too, because the Father and the Son are one in the unity of the Spirit, and that is what is to affect the saints, because it is the presence of the Spirit that makes things real with us, especially as to this matter of unity.
J.S.E. Is this abruptness to which Mr. H. refers to impress us with the fact that, having settled the matter of eternal life, the Lord refers to something greater, is that right?
S.McC. Our minds and our attention are drawn to divine greatness and the holy unjealous relations between divine Persons in love. What a pattern is set out in the holy references of Christ here as to the Father's relations with Him and His relations with the Father! What a pattern is set out for us as to conditions among the saints! He says, "I have glorified thee on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do
{103}
it; and now glorify me, thou Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". He was co-equal, co-eternal with the Father, and His rights in equality are asserted in this gospel; but the glory that was rightly His with the Father before the world was. He would not take it without asking the Father, showing the remarkable relations that are intended to affect us; the great object of the economy is to affect us by what appears in testimony in it.
A.J.G. So that really God meets all the conditions that have come in through sin by coming into testimony Himself?
S.McC. That is it; and I think we need to see the economy from this viewpoint, that it is a divinely devised system of affections in which we are to know God. God is love -- that is His nature, love; that is absolute. God is love, but in the realm of inscrutable deity how could we know it? We could not with creature mind and understanding enter there to know it, understand it and enjoy it, but God has devised, divine love has devised in the economy a system of affections in the Father and the Son and the Spirit in which we are to know God in that economy.
P.J.B. Was eternal life essential as far as we are concerned if we were to have any understanding in relation to these wondrous relationships?
S.McC. I think eternal life is important as basic to our enjoyment of divine Persons because Christianity involves life, whether life operatively as has been referred to in @John 14, or whether life as viewed in the sphere of it, contemplated in what we are referring to as eternal life here.
F.R.H. There is a verse in John's first epistle, chapter 4, verse 9, "herein as to us has been manifested the love of God", and the note to that is interesting, "The idea of the love of God remains absolute: only it has been shown 'as respects us in this'".
S.McC. Yes, we know it relatively. One of the supreme expressions of it is that Christ has laid down His life; that is one of the most wonderful expressions of divine love relatively.
{104}
H.A.H. Is it significant that in the other reference to what was before the world the Lord in the 24th verse brings in the love between Him and the Father relative to His request that we should be with Him to behold His glory? I was thinking of the distinction between the 5th and the 24th verses -- the two references to what existed before the foundation of the world.
S.McC. Well, in the 24th verse, of course, we are brought into the beholding of the glory, but not in the 5th verse; we could never behold the glory that is contemplated there.
H.A.H. I was thinking of the significance of love being brought in in verse 24.
S.McC. Yes, "that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".
H.A.H. I thought it was very significant that such a love was brought in in relation to such a request as to ourselves.
S.McC. Yes. Well, we are impressed with this matter of love, as the chapter ends. The Lord is filling our minds with thoughts as to divine love, what is special to Himself, what we come into; and as the chapter proceeds He refers to the love "with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". That would be the thought of family love in relation to Christ in manhood -- sonship. "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" is another thought in regard to love.
I think we should be impressed with this matter of the Lord not taking Himself out of the dependent position into which He had come. There is a great lesson for us in it. While He is speaking of what we cannot enter upon, the glory of the form of God, which we know nothing about, except that unapproachable light is linked with it, and love is linked with it, and glory is linked with it, we are to be impressed with how He would not take Himself out of the dependent place even here. The enemy tried to take Him out of it, but even here He does not say, as we have perhaps often noted, "and now I glory myself". He says, "And now glorify me, thou Father, along with thyself" (that brings us back to what we have in the 1st chapter of John, verse 1, "the Word was with God"), "with
{105}
the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". It is recorded through John the evangelist that we might be impressed with it in some measure although we cannot enter upon what is involved in it, yet it is brought into our thoughts in some way to impress us with the greatness of divine Persons.
H.F.R. Are the emphatic pronouns there, the personal pronouns, very important? In the earlier verse he says, "glorify thy son", but now he says, "glorify *me*, *thou* Father".
S.McC. Yes, He has come back to what is personal. The first three verses are almost indirect in certain ways, but then as we go on from verse 4 the Lord comes to speak about Himself in His relations with the Father, and what enters into those relations seen so wondrously in the economy.
A.B. And would this move us in worship to the Son, the sense that He has a personal glory, as along with the Father -- and co-equal with Him?
S.McC. Well, it does, and it helps us to see His equality with the Father, His place in Deity. It says in verse 3, "the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"; the true God has reference to the Father. But then we have to bear in mind, even in thinking of that, that the Lord Jesus is said to be the true God too. Surely the statements do not conflict, and it is for faith, and for minds and hearts taught by the Spirit, to understand what is in mind, that we are to be impressed with the fact that not only the Father is God, but the Lord Jesus, the Son, is God, and the Spirit is God. "He is the true God and eternal life." So we are reminded of His deity in verse 5.
A.J.G. Do you think that verse 5 throws its lustre back on verse 4 -- that such an One as is speaking in verse 5 had been here in testimony as glorifying God -- glorifying the Father, not seeking His own glory, and He had completed the work? Is that to have an effect upon us as here in the position of testimony?
S.McC. Well, it is, I am sure, and it is very affecting to be in the presence of the Lord speaking to the Father in this way as to His having glorified Him on the earth --
{106}
"I have glorified thee on the earth" -- a wonderful reference. The earth, you see, refers to what is creational; the earth had been created by God, and He says "I have glorified thee on the earth", but then He brings in the moral and spiritual universe in what He says following, "I have completed the work which thou gavest me"; that is not creational exactly -- it alludes to the wonderful work linked with God coming into the mediatorial economy in the way He has done to liberate men that they might know Him in the blessedness of His being, as He desired to be known in so far as He can be known according as He has revealed Himself in Christ.
J.S.E. Is it to affect us that it is reserved to the Son, in what He says to the Father personally, to put the most glorious impress of the Father's supremacy upon the economy?
S.McC. Well, it is. I am sure we want to see the weight of the Lord's words in speaking in this way, and especially this matter as to testimony, "I have glorified thee on the earth". Why should the Lord say "on the earth"? The creational side is in mind, and *we* have to do with what is created. We know what sin has done in the theatre that comes under our eye in created things -- how sin has come in and deranged what is linked with that order of things viewed creationally here. But the Lord says, "I have glorified thee *on the earth*", and that is to bear upon us; the apprehension of it is to bear upon us as we touch and have to do with the creational side.
W.B.H. Is it in striking contrast to that word in Genesis, "and Jehovah repented that he had made man on the earth; it grieved him in his heart"?
S.McC. That is it. So we have the true God in verse 3 and true manhood in Jesus Christ, and what a contrast to what came in by the first man, "I have glorified thee on the earth".
J.H. It says in @Psalm 65 that "thou hast visited the earth, thou hast watered it; thou greatly enrichest it: the river of God is full of water".
S.McC. So it is an important thing that we should see the earth abstractly, and learn to think of it abstractly, and see what is in the divine mind in relation to it. What
{107}
a touch the Lord gives to the created side here, "I have glorified thee on the earth". The very place where idolatry had come in, where lawlessness had reared its head, the Lord said, "I have glorified thee on the earth".
W.S.S. Verse 4 would embrace the two great thoughts of creation and redemption, so much brought together in Scripture.
S.McC. Well, it does, and the "glorified thee on the earth" and the completing the work "which thou gavest me" involves redemption, and it involves the cross.
W.S.S. And it is the basis of all that is to be brought in for the glory of God.
S.McC. That is it.
A.Hn. Do you link this in your mind with what Paul says in Philippians when he is referring to the mind that was in Christ Jesus and inviting us to let it be in us?
S.McC. I think that is the bearing of it testimonially on us here, that we are to be affected by what is seen in the Lord Jesus in this wonderful divine arrangement how He glorified the Father, as He speaks of Him in this way, glorified God in the way in which He did it; we see the true relations between God and men in this Person in manhood in the economy.
E.J.H. And would you say that true manhood as patterned after Christ is seen in what the Lord Jesus says to Peter at the end of the gospel, "signifying by what death he should glorify God"?
S.McC. It shows how the thought of glorifying God is to appear in the saints even in the way they die.
Now the time is pretty well gone and we should come on to the other features of our subject. We should look at the latter part of the chapter as to the making known of the name. It says earlier, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world" (verse 6). There is a manifestation of the name which is linked with the whole testimonial position there at the beginning, but when we come to the end it is "and I have made known to them thy name and will make it known". As we have been taught, the manifestation side bears on the testimonial position, but the making known is a deeper inward thought coming into this setting in a peculiar way, and
{108}
coming into @John 20 in a peculiar way. "I have made known to them thy name and will make it known."
P.J.B. Is that the name He took in coming into the economy?
S.McC. I think it is the name of God that is involved in this. "I have made known unto them thy name" no doubt would bear on the way He had taught them in regard to the Father; He had come in the Father's name, and He says in verse 11, "I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we. When I was with them I kept them in thy name". He made known to them the Father in His service and ministry, but then He says "and will make it known", which involves @John 20, as He says to Mary, "Go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God". That is, we have something further: the completing of this making known of the name.
W.S.S. There is a passage in @Psalm 48 which seems to bear on this: "According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise."
S.McC. Well, that bears on what enters into the worship of God. Every family is formed according to the particular light in which God is made known to it, and so the assembly is formed according to the particular light that enters into our dispensation in regard to God.
J.S.E. When you spoke of "making known thy name" did you mean that the first allusion "I have made known" was economical and the second was final?
S.McC. Well, "I *have* made known to them thy name" is historical. It is alluding to the service of Christ to the disciples, "I have made known to them thy name", but then it says "and will make it known". That brings in @John 20, which is final; that is, it completes the knowledge of the Name (@John 20).
P.H.H. Involved in the message to Mary, do you mean?
S.McC. Yes, exactly. "My Father and your Father, to my God and your God."
P.H.H. There is no sense in which the Lord makes known His name to us in assembly service now, is there?
{109}
S.McC. No. @John 20 is final. The matter is complete and final in that relation.
W.J.B. So that the reference in @Hebrews 2 to "I will declare thy name unto my brethren" -- that has been done, has it?
S.McC. It bears on what the Lord did on the morning of the resurrection, the first day of the week (@John 20), it bears upon that.
J.A.P. "My Father and your Father, my God and your God." They are the same Person, are They not? I mean They are spoken of as one, and yet would there be something in the name of God that is greater and wider?
S.McC. Well, we would like to understand what you have in mind in saying it is the same Person.
J.A.P. Well, it is His Father and His God; but as to "His God", I suppose when you come to the Being of God you cannot be definitive in your mind, can you?
S.McC. I think I see what is in your mind -- that the Father is before us in @John 20, "My Father and your Father". How blessed that name is. But then there is the fuller name: God; whereas the Father particularly applies to that Person, God as seen and known in that Person as revealed -- "My Father and your Father". But then, the name of Father does not cover the Three Persons. While God is *presented* in the economy in the Father, the *name* of Father does not cover the full thought of the Deity; the Deity is *presented* in the Father, in the economy, but the name of Father does not cover the full thought of Deity; but the name of God is the appellation which covers the complete thought of Deity, the expression that the Spirit of God uses to bring to our minds the thought of the Deity, because in God it is the Deity that is in mind, it is the name and the appellation which covers the full thought of the Deity; not that we are saying that the full thought of Deity is not presented in the Father *personally* in the economy -- "to us there is one God, the Father". Deity *is* presented in the Father in the economy, but then the name Father is a name of special relationship and in itself is limited; because the God who has come into that relationship must necessarily be greater than the relationship He has come into, and "my God and your God"
{110}
involves that Being, the Supreme Being, and is the name involving all three Persons; Father. Son and Holy Spirit -- that covers the full thought as to the Deity.
J.A.P. So when you use the name "God" you do not limit it in any way, unless it is specifically referred to the Father. You have in mind that the Father is God, the Lord Jesus is God, and the Spirit is God.
S.McC. Exactly, because "God" when it is presented without qualification in the word generally would involve God, the Supreme Being -- "in the beginning God", that is, the Supreme Being, the Being to be worshipped; and what is necessary to make clear at this point is that what some are suggesting, that this thought of worshipping God as God involves a position beyond relationship, has never been suggested. It has never been in anyone's mind that worshipping God as God takes us outside of relationship; God has come into the relation of Father, that we might know Him in His nature -- what He is, because "Father" implies sonship -- involves sonship in Christ, "the Father" and "the Son". These are relations that are intended to help us as to the apprehension of the Being that has come within our range in the economy; that is referred to in that appellation "my God and your God".
J.A.P. I think that greatly helps.
W.M.B. Do you distinguish this at all from @Ephesians 1, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"? Would you distinguish the two in any way?
S.McC. Well, I would in the sense that there is a particular reference to the family side in @Ephesians 1, to the side of relationship. The family relationship is essential, and we never go outside of it in having to do with God; the family relationship was designed so that we should be in nearness to God. It is obvious that in "my Father and your Father" there is an intimacy that could not quite be in "my God and your God", because God is God, and never ceases to be any less than God -- infinite in power and in majesty; but the relationship is brought in that we might know Him in nearness, and we never go outside of that relationship.
{111}
A.C.S.P. Are we to carry into this thought of God as you are now speaking of it the distinctive glories of each of the Persons as they have come out in the economy?
S.McC. Well, the Being that we are speaking of under that appellation "my God and your God" is the Being that is known in the economy in the Father and the Son and the Spirit. They are distinguished for us in Their operations and actings in the economy. We have to keep that in mind, that it is in coming out and in Their operations and actings that They are distinguished for us; and while John says "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", it is not that He is carrying that appellation back into Deity, but he is referring to the Person who was known in testimony as the Word and to His eternal position in Deity. His eternal equality with the Father and with the Spirit too, "the Word was with God, and the Word was God".
P.H.H. Do you think it helps to understand that God coming out has expressed Himself in Father, Son and Spirit, but in the return line which the Lord is suggesting here He just says "and to my God and your God"? Does that give us liberty, therefore, just to speak to God Himself? If we go on and express the name "Father, Son and Spirit", we are returning for a moment to the coming-out side, are we, whereas is the whole thing gathered up in our liberty at the end to speak to God Himself?
S.McC. It is, but the approach is equal to the revelation, so that the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit would have its place in approach to Him.
J.S.E. Does that settle the correctness of the order of the verses in Number 8 in the hymn-book?
S.McC. I do not understand the difficulty that exists in some minds as to it. Certainly beloved Mr. Taylor never had any difficulty, he sang it heartily. And there is no difficulty that I know of in America about it, or in Australia, or New Zealand, as to that hymn. Do you know of any difficulty as to that hymn, some that are not free to sing it?
W.J.B. No, we have no difficulty at all.
P.H.H. I would not like to say that we may not refer to the Father, Son and Spirit when we are speaking to
{112}
God, but does not the Scripture encourage us at the end at the highest point of the service just to speak to God, without necessarily particularising each time by saying "Father, Son and Spirit"?
S.McC. We had it this morning. It does not necessarily mean that you always have to refer to each of the Persons, because God is God. He is that Being, and we may refer to Each of the Persons as we know Them in the economy as hymn Number 8 refers to them, that is quite in keeping; but we may refer to God as God; the Lord Jesus says "my God". He is speaking as man, and He is speaking in the mediatorial position; He says "my God and your God", but He says "my God", Christ's God. Think of the infiniteness of that Being that Christ refers to in manhood as His God, and surely we can allude to that; and then it says "your God". Well, "our God". What does that involve? Surely the Father, the Son and the Spirit are involved in that. But then it is all a question of what may be in the person's mind as he speaks. The person may be alluding to God in His supremacy, a Supreme Being to be worshipped, without formally alluding to the Father, the Son and the Spirit; but then he may allude to the Father and the Son and the Spirit, which is quite in keeping with the truth, because God is so spoken of in the Scriptures as Father, Son and Spirit. In fact I would draw the brethren's attention to J.N.D.s Synopsis on @John 17, the way he speaks of "communion with that Being, God, the Father, and the Son".
-- .H. Is that why we use the formula in Matthew in baptism, "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" -- to one Name?
S.McC. Yes, I think it is important that we should see this matter of relationship: that we should not allow the enemy to suggest in any shape or form that we get out of the place of relationship -- that there is some position that we get into in the service of God where we are beyond relationship. We never do. We are always in relationship in sonship, and we worship God in His supremacy and His majesty as in that relationship, and God, "my God and your God", is the great Name that expresses the whole thought as to the Deity, involving all three Persons,
{113}
involving that Being known in the economy in the three Persons: the Father, the Son and the Spirit.
A.J.G. Does the fact that the Lord says to the overcomer in Philadelphia, that He will write upon him the name of His God, show that the overcomer can be seen as in the good of it, do you think?
S.McC. That is it. He has in mind to put these impressions upon him so that it is apropos of our time and day that so much should be referred to in this regard, fitting in with the closing phase of things. I am sure that as we understand @John 20, "my Father and your Father", that is the relationship that God has entered upon that we might know Him in holy intimacy in relation to Him in sonship, that we are prepared for and "my God and your God", which brings into our minds the great thought of the Supreme Being who is the End, in all divine operations and in all that is in mind in the worship of Himself.
J.S.E. Is the allusion to "my God" in @John 20 the Lord's assertion of the matter as a matter by itself, made by Him who knows all that it means in fulness; but is the allusion to "My God" which has been referred to in @Revelation 3 to help us to see how attracted the Lord is to an overcomer, so that He Himself puts that impress upon such persons?
S.McC. Yes, so that it is important to see the bearing of the Lord's words in that particular setting, involving a phase of things in the particular assembly that they are addressed to -- Philadelphia.
{114}
DIVINE OPERATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY READING (1)
@Acts 2: 1 -- 4; @Acts 2: 37 -- 47; @Acts 15: 6 -- 23
S.McC. As the assembly has such a prime place in the divine mind in relation to divine operations in this dispensation, it is felt we cannot consider the subject too much, especially in view of these last days. We need to see the importance of the assembly, and how the thought of teaching and ministry appear in relation to it, all bearing on the linking of the saints together in the unity of the faith.
First, the inaugural side in @Acts 2, where the assembly is formed by the Spirit, coming as He does. There is something about the inaugural side that we should never lose sight of, as important principles are set out in regard to ministry and the truth. The Spirit is helping us to reach consciously in some way what existed at the beginning, although publicly the difference is great, because of the breakdown; there is a glory about the pristine setting in the beginning that we do not have publicly at the end. But the consideration of what is here in chapter 2 -- the coming of the Holy Spirit, the weight and authority of the speaking, and perseverance in the teaching -- are all prime features that should now engage us.
In chapter 15, where the saints are gathered together, the operation of the ministry is seen in the remarkable way in which different ones speak prophetically, thereby promoting unity amongst the brethren. There was no evidence in what they said of any divergent views, although
{115}
they were dealing with a matter the enemy intended should divert, and was diverting, the brethren; but the apostles, as gathered together with the saints, set out in a most interesting and affecting manner the way the truth was supported and maintained.
These verses in chapter 2 should impress us with the manner of the speaking. Two things enter into the authority of the ministry (peculiarly set out in the apostles) which are conveyed in the two words employed in @Acts 1 for authority and power. One word links authority with the commission given to the apostles, and the other links with ability, by the Spirit, to speak and to set out the truth. These two features of authority and power are important to notice, and they are seen in the Lord Himself in the gospels.
G.M.S. Are you referring to verse 7 of chapter 1? Does the Lord distinguish the words when He says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you"?
S.McC. We also find it in @Luke 4 in what is set out as to the ministry of the Lord Jesus Himself. Mr. Darby points out in the margin in @Acts 1 that the word for authority is "exousia" and means a right one possesses. That lies in the commission given by the Lord to the servants. The word for power is "dunamis", which involves what is dynamic, and would work out in the power of the Spirit in the ability to set out the truth.
P.L. "If any one speak -- as oracles of God; if any one minister -- as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages. Amen" (@1 Peter 4: 11). Does that link on with what you are saying?
S.McC. Yes, it does, because it impresses us with the thought of authority in speaking as to the truth. It is not just a matter of popular or careless expression, but, as divinely strengthened, of representing God.
A.P.C.L. Does the one matter lie in sovereignty and the other in making room for the Spirit?
S.McC. That is how one understands it. It is important in relation to teaching and ministry in the assembly, that
{116}
these two thoughts should be apprehended in their distinctiveness, because all around us teaching and ministry are so lowered and degraded as a result of the principle of every man doing what is right in his own eyes and saying what he thinks.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that, while the assembly does not teach, it was necessary for the assembly to be established first as the pillar and base of the truth before the teaching could proceed?
S.McC. That is it. While the assembly does not teach, it is taught, and the teaching is to promote unity. At the beginning of Acts, when they were all together, we might view them as the result of the Lord's ministry and service. They were the products of it. Verse 44, "And all that *believed* were together", would be the result of the kind of teaching and ministry of Peter and the others.
L.E.S. @Micah 3: 8 says, "But truly I am filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and with judgment and with might, to declare unto Jacob", etc.
S.McC. It is important that we should understand that principle in ministry.
L.E.S. It also says, "Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel" (@Micah 3: 1).
S.McC. There is an onus and responsibility on those who hear. In @Acts 2 the onus and responsibility are realised, and we have a reaction to the truth as it is presented. It is well to bear in mind, as we have been taught, that all truth is authoritative. In the Pentateuch the ministry of Moses is based on and characterised by revelation. It is both distinctive and authoritative -- Moses himself having a distinct commission from God. Corresponding with that, in the New Testament, we have the apostles, who set out the truth, and revelation linked with them. We do not have the apostles today, but certain features and principles are set out in the ministry and teaching of the apostles which carry through. When we come to the time of the revival, in men like Mr. Darby, Mr. Raven, Mr. Stoney, and latterly Mr. Taylor, we have the distinct evidence of men who had a *commission*, their ministry giving character to the revival. Mr. Darby's was somewhat apostolic *in principle*, giving character to
{117}
the general scope of the truth in the revival. Latterly Mr. Taylor's ministry gave character to the whole scope of the service of God. We are to realise that the truth in that relation is *authoritative*.
C.M.M. Would you please distinguish between authority and infallibility?
S.McC. The Scriptures are both authoritative and infallible. Ministry is authoritative but not infallible.
J.S.E. Is there something for us to learn in this first scripture we read, namely, that as the authority is respected, so the persons who respect it come into the gain and power of the teaching?
S.McC. That is how I understand it, and it is the clear line of demarcation between what is amongst us and what is around us. In certain parts meetings like these could not be held because of the lawless nature of men's minds and their insubordination to the authority linked with the divine presence in the assembly.
A.P.C.L. Is it interesting that, in @Acts 11: 26, when Saul is being brought forward, the same matter is set out in Antioch? "For a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd"; and, finally, the result in the disciples, "the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch". That is in a Gentile setting.
S.McC. All that shows the importance of the teaching, and what it means to the saints in the light of the assembly, especially as holding us together. If we are not held together by the truth and the teaching which has come to us in the power of the Spirit we shall become like Bethesda.
A.A. Is that suggested in verse 42, where the teaching and fellowship of the apostles seem to be interwoven, "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles"?
S.McC. The importance of that verse is that they persevered in *the* teaching; not any kind of teaching, but "*the* teaching and fellowship of *the* apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". Teaching in an authoritative way is set out in the service of the apostles.
A.A. I was thinking of the way the two are connected by the word "and": "the teaching and fellowship of the apostles". They seem to be almost interwoven.
{118}
S.McC. They are bound up together, the teaching coming first.
J.S.E. Does what you are saying give some particular richness to the setting of the supper in Luke's gospel, in that the emphasis is not on the twelve but on the apostles?
S.McC. Luke links on sympathetically with Paul's ministry and would remind us of the authoritative side of the setting of the supper. Paul says, "I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you" (@1 Corinthians 11: 23). There was definite authority in what he communicated to the Corinthians in placing the supper in its proper position in the assembly.
F.M. Throughout Acts there is no weakening of the principle of authority as Paul is introduced.
S.McC. What we have in the twelve, in the way of authority and power in ministry, is continued and seen in Paul. It is important that we should see the great place that the Holy Spirit has in the first few verses of @Acts 2, and the essential need of making room for Him.
M.A.W. Does the fact that the sound came out of heaven govern all this?
S.McC. That is important, because the authority of the truth as we are referring to it is peculiarly heavenly. The Spirit has come from heaven, and He brings a report of what is there. We are in the immediate presence of heaven, as it were, if we are in the presence of the Spirit.
J.A.C. How far does the thought of commission apply to ministry generally? Commission in apostolic ministry is clear, but is there a side of authority that enters into all forms of ministry and service? For example, "How shall they preach unless they have been sent?" (@Romans 10: 15), and then the Holy Spirit setting some as overseers over the flock.
S.McC. In greater or lesser degree it appears in all service on the principle of being sent. Service is not viewed in that way as voluntary. We are commissioned even in preaching the gospel, as *sent*. What one is alluding to in the apostles, and particularly in what is set out by Mr. Darby, Mr. Taylor and others, is distinctive commission, because their ministry is characterised by peculiar
{119}
authority, and matters universally in the assembly are affected by it. To illustrate this, the service of God has been peculiarly affected by the ministry of Mr. Taylor in recent years.
A.H. It seems from verse 41 that there is a subject state in the hearers: "those then who had *accepted* his word". Do we need to watch that in ourselves in the ministry?
S.McC. That is important. The note to the word "accepted" is interesting. It means "to receive in full", or "with satisfaction", or "as to an opinion of teaching", to accept and receive it as true.
A.R. Would that be the Berean spirit -- "Receiving the word with all readiness of mind" (@Acts 17: 11)? Sometimes trouble comes through this lack of readiness to receive the ministry as it is presented to us.
S.McC. This subject attitude of mind that has been referred to should mark us. Here it appears in relation to the gospel and those who were under the sound of it in Peter's preaching. "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised" (verse 41). "*His* word" would allude to the authority in Peter's ministry.
A.M. Would you say something more as to all ministry being authoritative and yet not infallible?
S.McC. It is very obvious and apparent to all that ministry is not infallible. No one would question that. The Scriptures are infallible. The difficulty is that some advance this thought of the ministry not being infallible in order to weaken its *authority* in the minds of the brethren. The enemy is in that.
A.M. In connection with verse 41 and what you said about "they accepted his word", would that not involve the recognition of the vessel who was speaking?
S.McC. It is Peter's word. It is the man and his commission; not an ordinary person, but a man with a distinctive commission -- "First Peter". Matthew shows that Peter has a distinctive commission, and it is *his* word. We have to discern what is distinctive, and it is to be deprecated that, in some parts, there is a tendency to cast discredit on the authority of the ministry of beloved Mr. Taylor, especially in his later years. The enemy is
{120}
in that, and it is incumbent upon every one of us to refuse it.
H.McL. Would what you have in mind be seen in @1 Samuel 3: 19 -- 21, "And all Israel ... knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah"?
S.McC. That is very good, as we are dealing with what is established in the way of distinctive and authoritative ministry which peculiarly marked Mr. Darby, Mr. Raven, Mr. Stoney and Mr. Taylor in their service. These great and honoured servants have a distinctive place in the revival and we should honour that.
P.L. Is the move you refer to in opposition to the peculiar activities of the blessed Spirit to consolidate us in the vast extent of truth unfolded which has been bequeathed to us in the ministry of the beloved brother to whom you have particularly referred? We are now called in brotherly confidence to explore and exploit the vast territory which has come to us.
S.McC. That is the position. So much has come out in the ministry of these men; how much there is that we have not yet fully entered into; and the Holy Spirit, having been drawn attention to in recent times, has a particular part in helping us to come into the whole scope of the truth. Whatever we are saying now must fit into the confines of the whole scope of the truth. It is not merely what some of us are saying here. It has to be taken account of in relation to the scope of the truth as it has come out.
A.A. Is the authoritative character of Peter's ministry illustrated in @Acts 10: 44, "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word"? The word "logos" is used. Is that a reference to the authoritative character of Peter's words?
S.McC. That is a very interesting reference to the sovereign action of the Spirit in the embracing of the Gentiles, acting as He does in relation to what Peter was saying and ministering.
L.E.S. Could the faithful men of @2 Timothy 2 be regarded as commissioned?
S.McC. Maybe, in greater or lesser degree. All service would be undertaken on that principle. The brethren
{121}
will understand what is meant by the principle of being sent -- commissioned in that sense. But there is also what is distinctive in Peter and the other apostles.
A.E.M. Have we not received authoritative ministry as to the assembly calendar? The brethren are much confused about it. You will understand it by thinking of the list of notices.
S.McC. In regard to the different meetings during the week, the verse at the end of @Acts 2 would help us in the way in which the teaching, as pursued together, should unify us in those customs in our local gatherings.
A.E.M. I raised the question in that connection, but the fact of the matter is that the brethren are not unified about it.
S.McC. The Lord has been helping us as to unification. One has noticed that there are still some places where city readings are not held, and there are other places where local readings are not held. The Lord would draw our attention to all these things in order to secure uniformity in view of our persevering in "the teaching and fellowship of the apostles in breaking of bread and prayers".
J.G.M. Is it important, as being together in one place, that what is inaugural should be maintained? In @1 Corinthians 11: 20 Paul refers to being together in one place. Has the evidence of unity to be maintained as recognising the one place?
S.McC. There is the importance of the hill of God and of the saints being together where there is more than one meeting in a city. They should be together in the light of the hill of God during the week.
P.L. In some places the meeting for ministry has taken the place of the normal weekly reading. What would you say as to that?
S.McC. I think at first the Lord helped us, in drawing attention to the truth, to begin with a gradual approach to it. We need to understand that the city reading is important, that the full month should be filled out in regard to it, and that the meeting for ministry should not be substituted for the city reading.
P.L. Nor should any other meetings in the city for reading be dropped because of the ministry meeting occurring that week, would you say?
{122}
S.McC. No, indeed. The great thing is to fill out the weekly assembly calendar in regard to meetings.
A.H. How do you distinguish between the meetings for ministry and what we speak of as the city readings?
S.McC. Many years ago it was pointed out that on Lord's Day we have the service of God; we are speaking to God in His service and we are engaged in the worship of divine Persons. On Monday we speak to Them in prayer, interceding with Them in regard to Their interests. It is fitting, therefore, that the meeting for prophetic ministry should come as soon as possible afterwards, to furnish divine Persons with an opportunity to speak to us. There is something distinctive about prophetic ministry. The meeting for prophetic ministry stands by itself, and particularly makes room for God to come in through a prophetic word. The reading involves the way we sit together in relation to one another, and particularly makes way for temple light.
C.M.M. Some of our meetings are monthly, not weekly. Would such be governed by the assembly cycle which begins on the first day of the week?
S.McC. No doubt, but it is important that the city reading should not be weakened. In some cities one has heard reference made to so much help and so much encouragement being given in the local readings, but we must see that the greatest feature in the local position in that connection is the city reading. It is not that local readings are not to be attended, but the city reading is important and should be attended.
A.J.G. In the heavenly city we find that each of the twelve gates is of one pearl, so that every gate bears exactly the same features. Is that important?
S.McC. That enters into this closing part of @Acts 2 involving unification amongst the saints in what we do. Sometimes there is difficulty with some as to having the city reading in a particular room and not having a distinctive local reading in that room, but that is making too much of that part of the city. Why should it have something more than any other part of the city, seeing it already has a reading in that place filled out according to @Acts 2 in the assembly calendar? Why should it want something additional?
{123}
A.P.C.L. What is the difference between coming together in the assembly and teaching in the assembly? Something has been said as to certain meetings not being of assembly character.
S.McC. @1 Corinthians 11 gives *the character* of the meeting in which the Lord's Supper is taken. Perhaps in ten gatherings in certain cities each gathering bears or has that character. But in @1 Corinthians 14, where we have ministry in mind, it is formally stated as *the* assembly; the definite article is before it.
H.B. Is there any principle involved in a city taking an outside room for city meetings for the convenience of the saints?
S.McC. Have you in mind that there would be no breaking of bread in that room in the city? It would depend upon the circumstances, but normally the readings would be in rooms where the breaking of bread is held. Of course, on an occasion such as this a special hall is hired to suit such a large gathering which is not really on the local calendar.
H.B. I have in mind the local city readings and meetings for ministry, and such other occasions that occur regularly.
S.McC. Why do the brethren want to have these meetings in a separate room from the breaking of bread? Why do they not have the breaking of bread there?
H.B. Because of the difficulty of travelling across the city from one side to another, and in order to save time, etc.
S.McC. I think I understand what is meant. In one city they have a large hall where there is no breaking of bread, but all the city readings are in that place, and the question would be as to the wisdom of it.
A.E.M. Would we regard all testimony as linked with the Lord's Supper?
S.McC. That is important. We should keep to the fact that everything flows out of the Lord's Supper in the week of assembly history. The Supper is the fountain head from whence all activities on the assembly calendar flow, and it would be more suitable and in keeping with the truth if the city readings were in places where the breaking of bread is held.
{124}
T.M. Would Paul's word, "And thus I ordain in all the assemblies" maintain unity in the city?
S.McC. That is it. How are you getting on in your city? Have you been helped in regard to what is on the assembly calendar?
T.M. Not quite, yet. The position is that not having these meetings in the beginning of the Acts is made an excuse for not accepting the present teaching.
S.McC. I am glad you say, 'Not quite, yet'. It means you are on the way, and the Lord will help, I am sure. There is need for help so that there may be no distinctive local customs that are different to what is generally in the assembly. It is important that we should be unified in what we do, and the Holy Spirit is helping us towards that end. This closing section of @Acts 2 stresses, "And *all that believed* were together, and had all things common". While this literally alludes to certain features distinctive to the inauguration of the dispensation, there is no doubt that a principle is in it. "All that *believed*." It is not just that all were together. In the beginning of the chapter it says, "they were all together in one place", but in verse 44 we have an added thought, "And all that *believed* were together". The ministry and the apostles teaching and doctrine have come out, and they are together now in relation to the authority of the truth in their souls.
W.H. It says, "They persevered in the apostles doctrine". Would that suggest that the difficulties we all experience in our localities are to be overcome?
S.McC. Very good. "They persevered." I am sure it is important that, in our localities, we should continually have regard to this matter of uniformity in the assembly calendar so that there are no distinctive *local* customs in any particular place.
Rem. Which is the proper night for the city reading?
S.McC. I should leave that to the wisdom of the saints. Some have thought that the mid-week was Wednesday, but that day was never implied or intended to be conveyed in using the expression "mid-week". It is well that the reading should be mid-week; not on Monday night or Saturday night, but in the week, so that the full force and strength of evil and lawlessness in the city is counteracted
{125}
in the assembly by what there is in the hill of God, and the presence of the Spirit.
A.P.C.L. So that a joint meeting on Lord's Day afternoon does not substitute for a city reading.
S.McC. It certainly does not. The meeting on Lord's Day afternoon is of a different character to the mid-week reading. The reading on Lord's Day afternoon bears on the first day of the week: the city reading, during the week, bears on conditions in the city in the presence of evil.
P.L. It is a family affair more on Lord's Day afternoon according to John's gospel, but in the week a militant matter according to Matthew.
S.McC. That is it. On Lord's Day, the first day of the week, we sit down more in the light of the inheritance and our happy relations with one another, with divine affections flowing out of the assembly service in the morning. All this governs us.
F.M. When a visiting brother comes along we drop our local Lord's Day afternoon reading and have a combined reading. What would you say about that? Would that break in on the family side that Mr. Lyon has referred to?
S.McC. Do you not all come together in Edinburgh on Lord's Day afternoon?
F.M. No, we have our local meetings.
S.McC. The Lord has been helping us as to being all together on Lord's Day afternoon in so far as we can be together. Of course in big cities, like London, Sydney, and New York, where there is a great number of meetings and the distances are large, the brethren come together in districts or in *boroughs*. How many gatherings have you in Edinburgh?
F.M. We have six. We have often spoken of having a combined reading on Lord's Day afternoon, but it has not matured.
S.McC. Detroit is a very large city and we are together every Lord's Day afternoon, many having a good way to travel, but of course there are only two gatherings. It is good to be together on Lord's Day afternoon.
F.M. We have proved that on many occasions.
Rem. Do you pursue a book or do you have subjects at the joint reading on Sunday afternoon?
{126}
S.McC. I should leave that to the discrimination and judgment of the brethren. We pursue a book; but if a brother who has some ability is visiting, room is made for him to suggest something. Generally a book is pursued and help would be given, but this does not exclude the consideration of subjects.
L.E.S. Do I understand that the ministry meeting should come early in the week rather than towards the end of the week?
S.McC. One was referring to what Mr. Taylor said many years ago as to the sequence of the meetings. In the service of God on Lord's Day morning we are serving Him and speaking to Him in His service. On Monday night we speak to Him in prayer and intercession, and opportunity should be given to Him as soon as possible to speak to us. Therefore most of the ministry meetings are on Tuesday night.
J.G.M. Might I just refer again to the matter of place. In Liverpool we take a hall, specially, in the hub of the city where all the six meetings can gather for the ministry meeting, the city reading, and the care meeting. If that were not so, probably our company would fall by about 50 per cent. Are there extenuating circumstances where we can have a measure of liberty in this matter?
S.McC. What do you mean by saying that your company would fall by 50 per cent?
J.G.M. It would be impossible for a good many to get to the meetings, as we have the river between us. In Liverpool we have merged with Birkenhead and Wallasey, and the use of outlying rooms in Liverpool would make it impossible for those on the other side to get there. Likewise we in Birkenhead would have the same difficulty as Liverpool.
S.McC. What was said earlier would apply. In New York there is a big harbour between the brethren on the one side and those on the other, which makes it impossible for them to be together on Lord's Day afternoon and get back in time for the gospel. Therefore the brethren are all together on one side of the harbour and they are also together on the other on Lord's Day. Why does that not apply where you come from? Why can they not be all
{127}
together on one side and all together on the other side of the river on Lord's Day if it is impossible for both sides to be together?
J.G.M. I would not like to say it is impossible, but it would be most inconvenient.
S.McC. The Lord would impress us on the Lord's Day, as drinking into the grace and spirit of the sacrificing love set out in the Supper, that we should be particularly marked by sacrifice ourselves. There is so much self-consideration entering into these matters that we need to be helped as to *sacrifice*. One would bear in mind that, where conditions are impossible, it would be wisdom, perhaps, to apply what we have referred to.
J.G.M. If I might detain the brethren further on this point, we have merged in Liverpool three meetings in the actual city: two in Birkenhead and one in Wallasey. If we revert to what you suggest -- a meeting on one side of the river and one on the other -- it would bring in the distinct cleavage again.
S.McC. I do not think so. We are referring to the matter of the Lord's Day afternoon and not to the city reading.
J.G.M. I was referring to the week-night meetings.
S.McC. I thought you had in mind the difficulty of getting back for the gospel on Lord's Day afternoon. Liverpool is not so big that the brethren could not get from any part of the city to a reading during the week. If I remember rightly, the Birkenhead, Wallasey and Liverpool area is smaller than a few of the areas in other parts where the brethren do get together during the week.
D.I. Does the one place refer to one hall?
S.McC. That is as I understand it.
D.I. So that all combined meetings should be in the one room.
S.McC. It is better if they can be, although on Lord's Day afternoon, as we have said, if the brethren find it impossible to be together from all the city because of the difficulty of getting back for the gospel they might find it possible to have readings in districts in the suburbs of the city.
G.R.C. In view of what you have said as to the importance of the meeting for prophetic ministry, do you think
{128}
we should regard as final the idea of having only one such meeting a month?
S.McC. I would not care to say too much about that. What has been indicated in ministry has largely given character to what we do in our gatherings, and one would not care to suggest anything beyond that.
P.L. That very character of ministry in 14th of 1st Corinthians gives peculiar place, in the thought of two or three prophets speaking, to the consideration, in mercy, of what is upon the saints as to church obligations.
S.McC. It might be something like that. The meeting for ministry is a very distinctive occasion by itself. It has a unique character of its own and there is something special about it. We have found a good deal of help in America in our three-day meetings in having meetings for ministry. While it retains its local character, there is always something distinctive about a meeting for ministry, because the mind of God comes into it and the mind of God may involve conditions that are beyond the immediate circumstances in which we are.
P.L. All I meant was that in regard to our brother's enquiry as to whether meetings for prophetic ministry should enter into the assembly calendar more frequently than once a month, I think we all feel that if we fill out with zeal and love the full assembly obligations as has been suggested in recent years, our hands are pretty full.
S.McC. Yes, I suppose that is so.
F.M. Give us some further help as to a meeting such as this devoted to ministry. How does it fit in with the assembly position in @1 Corinthians 14?
S.McC. The position in regard to meetings in a city never alters the local character of the occasion. We are here with the brethren in Edinburgh, but that does not alter the local status in the city. We come into it, extending the matter, and having our part in it as merging with the local brethren. On that principle, in America, we have carried forward the meetings for ministry in our three-day occasions.
F.M. That is a point we can be helped on, because we would have had our ministry meeting tonight in this city, but we have postponed it for a week in view of this meeting today.
{129}
S.McC. That is what the local brethren have arrived at. I certainly would have been glad to make room for it tonight. Nevertheless, there are certain circumstances in which it may not be altogether workable. In America when we have a meeting for ministry at our three-day gatherings the brethren are all together in the body of the hall; there is no special platform where those who are expected to speak sit. All sit in the body of the hall with a microphone available for anyone who may have a word from God. One difficulty in large gatherings like this, and those in London later in the month, is that those who will take part in a meeting of that character will be on the platform. Such an arrangement makes it difficult.
We should finish with a reference to @Acts 15 in regard to the diversity of ministry in a difficult position. We have what we may call the diversity of gift appearing in Peter standing up (verse 7) and much discussion taking place: "Peter standing up said to them"; then in verse 12 it says, "And all the multitude kept silence and listened to Barnabas and Paul ... "; and verse 13, "James answered, saying, Brethren, listen to me: Simon has related how God first visited to take out of the nations a people for his name. And with this *agree* the words of the prophets." There is nothing more touching in this chapter than to see the unity among the brethren in ministry. In Peter, Barnabas, Paul and James the work of God is so coordinated that the ground which the enemy would entrench upon in regard to the truth is held. Verse 22 -- "Then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the *whole* assembly, to send chosen men from among them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, Judas called Barsabas and Silas, leading men among the brethren ... " -- is a very fine example of the operation of ministry among the brethren gathered together in difficult conditions.
A.J.G. Do you think the word given by Peter illustrates the word of wisdom we read of in the 12th chapter of 1st Corinthians? For he does not refer to the scripture, but speaks of his observation of what God is doing among the Gentiles. And would James bring in the word of prophecy, referring to the Scriptures, and enforcing the matter?
{130}
S.McC. That is excellent, and it illuminates the passage as we take account of it. You will have noticed what Peter stands for. He says, "Brethren, *ye* know ... " He is drawing attention to something that is within their knowledge. But when James stands up he says, "Brethren, listen to *me* ... " He has a distinct prophetic word as to the matter on hand.
L.E.S. Would you say it is the authority of the ministry and the authority of the Scriptures brought together?
S.McC. Very good, and it is important that the Scriptures should be brought in, and that they should govern the ministry. The *standard* of the truth is not in the ministry, but in the Scriptures, and they must be brought in to establish the truth set out in the ministry.
A.H. Is it helpful to see that James brings in the Scriptures to support the ministry already given?
S.McC. Very good. He says, "And with this *agree* the words of the prophet". He is not driving a wedge between the Scriptures and the ministry. He is not saying, I go by the Scripture to the exclusion of what Peter had said in the word of wisdom. He says, "With this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written". The full weight of the Scriptures, in their infallibility, is brought in to support what had come out in Peter's word.
F.M. There is the application of what the prophets said.
S.McC. Exactly, showing how the Old Testament is drawn upon to help in a current matter. Some might have said, Well, that scripture has no bearing on this matter, but James is very emphatic. He is speaking as an oracle of God. He says, "And with this *agree* the words of the prophets; as it is written: After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which is fallen, and will rebuild its ruins, and will set it up, so that the residue of men may seek out the Lord, and all the nations on whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who does these things known from eternity" (verses 15 -- 17). It really refers to a coming day, but James brings it in to substantiate and support the word of wisdom given by Peter.
C.M.M. To what extent would you make room today for the recounting of the work of God from other parts?
{131}
S.McC. We have unique circumstances in the Acts. We do not have missionary meetings today, although we cover in our prayers, and in the letters that may be read at meetings for prayer, what God has wrought among the nations.
C.M.M. It is good to read letters in that way for the stimulation of the saints.
A.H. Is it your thought that the elders here are functioning in the assembly?
S.McC. They are in full support of the truth. It is a beautiful combination -- the apostles, and the elders, and the whole assembly. Unity is arrived at in relation to the teaching of the truth at this particular issue in the assembly.
P.L. There is no domination -- "and it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly". Are the brethren all getting at it, feeling their way, temple-wise, into the truth and consolidating it body-wise in the spirit in which they now diffuse the judgment they have reached?
S.McC. And added to that there is the reference to the Holy Spirit, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (verse 28), showing that full room was made for the Holy Spirit so that they could bring Him in to what they had arrived at.
DIVINE OPERATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY READING (2)
@Acts 15: 30 -- 41; @Acts 16: 13 -- 15; @Acts 18: 22 -- 28; @Acts 20: 17 -- 38
S.McC. We are keeping the thought of the assembly before us: not so much from the standpoint of doctrine, but rather from the standpoint of certain practical needs. It is purposed to consider further the bearing of teaching and ministry in view of the promoting of unity among the brethren, having the great thought of the assembly in mind. In this great Pauline section, which Mr. Darby, in the *Synopsis*, has alluded to as one of unprecedented and unparalleled energy in the power of the Spirit, we see in the end of chapter 15 how the Spirit of God moves in relation to Paul and the distinctiveness of his ministry, Paul being unique in regard to the Gentile world on
{132}
account of the dispensation he had, both as to the gospel and the church. Entering into the passages read, there is also diversification of help in Judas, and Silas, and Apollos, and others. We are brought into this side of the service, in so far as we can speak of any part we have in the work of the Lord, small as it may be. What is to be noted as running through all these sections is the positive line in the teaching and ministry in forming, in establishing, in confirming, and in contributing. It is very striking that throughout this section we get positive development in the building up of the truth instead of the sowing of dissension or the bringing of confusion into the minds of believers. There is a steady upward trend in the teaching and in the ministry bearing on the saints of the assembly, having in mind their building up and their unification in the truth.
We might begin at this part of the Pauline section where a wondrously flowing stream of energy is brought before us, and then see the climax of it in the great wealth and warmth of affection which marks the latter part where Paul calls over the elders of Ephesus. He has the local position in mind, that it might be held in the light of the authority of his ministry. In chapter 15 the issue as to the truth is met in a remarkable way, and is followed by an up-building ministry involving Judas and Silas, Paul and Barnabas. It says, "And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with much discourse, and *strengthened* them" (verse 32).
F.M. The delivery of the epistle seems to have brought great comfort, and support, and encouragement (verses 30 -- 1).
S.McC. "They rejoiced at the consolation." There was a consolatory touch in the letter which tended to strengthen the bonds of unity between the brethren. It is important that we should all be on the line of promoting unity among the brethren, especially those who have any part in the service.
W.H. These brothers not only had the authoritative letter to deliver to the saints, but they followed it up with a ministry that gave support and strengthening and unity.
S.McC. That is the point. The letter is not only formally delivered, but these men come into the position
{133}
to strengthen the brethren. They strengthen the truth in the minds and souls of the brethren by what they *have*.
P.L. Would you say sharing in body feelings is the spoil of the victory?
S.McC. Yes, that would enter into it. It was what they had themselves gained.
T.M. Would the words of Paul to the Corinthians -- "Let all things be done to edification" (@1 Corinthians 14: 26) and "Let all your things be done in love" -- illustrate the way Paul himself worked in his ministry?
S.McC. Just so. He says the authority he had from the Lord was not for their overthrowing; it was for their building up. While he had to be very firm with the saints in Corinth, and had to write with many tears about the unfaced issues among them, the authority he had in their midst was for their building up and not for their overthrowing.
W.W.S. In @Acts 15: 27 it says, "We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves also will tell you by word of mouth the same things". Do these two confirm what has been written by what they say in an intimate manner by word of mouth?
S.McC. That is a beautiful touch as to the confidence that the assembly in Jerusalem had in these men, Judas and Silas. "Who themselves also will tell you by word of mouth the *same* things". They do not say something different, but they follow up the truth, strengthening it by what they had to give to the brethren.
J.S.E. Is there a touch in this that would give us liberty to apply the principle of the major and minor prophets?
S.McC. The principle would be there, although in speaking of the major and minor prophets we do not suggest a disparity between their ministry. We do not have the same scope with the minor prophets as with the major prophets.
W.S.S. Would you encourage us to see that whenever the enemy attacks, the Lord clarifies the position and gives much enlargement? I was thinking of what you were saying about Judas and Silas. They not only clarify matters, but there was enlargement. Is that the normal result of dependence on the Lord?
{134}
S.McC. I am sure that is so. We shall find that when issues as to the truth are rightly faced, as in @Acts 15, there is a looking into the Scriptures which are brought forward, and the truth is brought out in an enlarging way.
P.L. And do our leaders -- "our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (verses 25 -- 6) -- emerge from the conflict in moral lustre in their devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ?
S.McC. They do, and it is a striking thing that the section before us begins with the thought of men who are prepared to give up their lives for the name, and Paul in chapter 20 says, "But I make no account of my life as dear to myself, so that I finish my course". This kind of teaching and ministry and service involves preparedness to lay down our lives. It is not a question of withholding anything, but of the greatness of what is on hand in regard to the shepherding and care of those who compose the assembly. There should be the preparedness on the part of each one of us to lay down our lives.
P.L. The conflicts in the truth from time to time, and its maintenance, afford peculiar play for the expression of devotion to Christ and to the assembly.
S.McC. It is in these matters that devotion is brought out, and I am sure that confidence is seen with these men, Barnabas and Paul. The affectionate way in which they are referred to is important in relation to their teaching and their ministry, and it is upbuilding. If the element of confidence is lost, where will we be?
A.H. In entering upon the conflict, do we need to keep what is positive in mind? In chapter 15, verse 3 the conflict is ahead, but it does not seem to obsess the minds of Barnabas and Paul. They speak of the work of God amongst the nations and cause great joy.
S.McC. We want to see positive results in the ministry of those who are going on with the truth. These men are bringing positive features of strengthening amongst the brethren. The closing section of chapter 15 leads on to the great Pauline section where we find that difficulties arise, but Paul is very firm about the matters brought forward,
{135}
because he saw what was involved in them (@Acts 15: 37 -- 41 read). We have a positive constructive line in such men as Judas, Silas and Paul as they move on in the truth.
C.M.M. Would you say that this matter of authority in the servant would be supported by verse 25, "It seemed good to us, having arrived at a common judgment, to send chosen men to you"? In verse 33 Judas and Silas are also spoken of as having been sent.
S.McC. Yes, they are not moving according to their own particular liking, but they are under charge. " ... they were let go in peace from the brethren to those who sent them."
C.M.M. In the paragraph you are alluding to, would you think something of that spirit had been lost in Mark for the moment although he seems to have been characterised by much power later on?
S.McC. It would seem as if Mark goes out of the movement in relation to the testimony of his own volition. He just deserts the position, where he was under authority in the work, with Paul and Barnabas. We speak feelingly and with respect for Barnabas, for he was a godly man and honoured in his service, but he was deflected here in regard to Mark. The Spirit of God seems to honour the firm stand which Paul takes.
W.H. Was not the test for John Mark consequent upon Paul and his company coming definitely into evidence as if the truth of the assembly was having great development under Paul, and at that particular moment Mark turned aside? Would that not have an important bearing on the fact that Paul would not take him with him?
S.McC. Just so. The deflection of Barnabas is a strong warning to us to avoid special links in our relations in the assembly. Nothing is more damaging among the brethren than special links, because they lead to a militating against the truth.
J.A.C. Would verses 35 and 36 help us to the full recognition of the word of the Lord?
S.McC. Yes, and it strengthens in our minds the idea of the authority of the word of the Lord. "And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, *teaching* and announcing the glad tidings ... of the word of the Lord." The section is
{136}
important, because it impresses our minds with the authority linked with the work in which they are engaged.
A.R. I would like to ask as to this question of authority how we would distinguish if a ministry is authoritative, as we could not say that all ministry is authoritative.
S.McC. All ministry from God is authoritative.
A.R. I was wondering whether authoritative ministry would have the definite stamp of the Spirit's word. A word by the Spirit would be authoritative, but how far are we able to discern authoritative ministry?
S.McC. That is where we are tested as to whether we can discern if authority marks a servant's ministry and is accompanied by power which is linked with his ability in making room for the Spirit. That is where the authority lies. Of course, we have what is distinctive in Paul in his apostleship. Judas and Silas are prophets and they are strengthening what is being set forward in the truth.
L.E.S. Is it significant that Timothy is brought in at the beginning of chapter 16?
S.McC. I think it is, because Timothy was a man who followed up the truth in regard to Paul's teaching. What has been referred to is important, that in ministry we are to discern authority. We are not entitled to accept it just because it is said, but, as having the Spirit, the element of priesthood among the saints would discern if what is being said is in keeping with the truth.
C.M.M. Would, "let the others judge" (@1 Corinthians 14: 30) enter into this, and praying for such servants, and committing them to the grace of God?
S.McC. Exactly. And there is the other side, as Paul says, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (@1 Corinthians 14: 37). There is what is distinctive in Paul, and his ministry carries authority.
A.H. Would it be right to say that ministry in the power of the Spirit would carry its own credentials, as in @1 Corinthians 14: 25, where it says, "he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you"?
S.McC. Where ministry is in the power of the Spirit there would be that in it which would impress the minds of the brethren. We have to keep clear and distinct what
{137}
may be given in the way of a lead, such as in the servants we have referred to, as being used of God in the great revival in the last days. There is a distinctive authority in their ministry which you could not speak of in some other ministry.
G.R.C. Is the principle of the ministry carrying its own credentials seen in @Mark 1, where it says, "They were astonished, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes" (verse 22)?
S.McC. Mark is the ministerial gospel and helps us in that way, but one thing needs to be kept clear in regard to this matter of ministry, and that is the *ability* to make room for the Spirit. Distinctive commission is another thing.
G.R.C. Is that the distinction you were making this morning between authority and power? Authority involves a commission, but a brother who has a definite commission should have power in the Spirit.
S.McC. Just so. There have been many ministers in the last fifty years, but one *distinctive* ministry throughout giving character to the service of God. We are now seeking to arrive at the fulness of that ministry; what the Lord has given through it and in it.
A.J.G. What has accredited that ministry is that it has affected the saints all over the world.
S.McC. That is the point. It bears the evidence of a distinctive commission. Although we do not have apostleship today, as in the Acts, the principle of a distinctive, authoritative commission from Christ remains in such leadership as that of Mr. Darby, Mr. Taylor, and others.
Rem. Would Paul's word to Timothy, "knowing of whom thou hast learned them" (@2 Timothy 13: 14), bear on it?
S.McC. That is very important. "Knowing of whom ... " would help the brethren as to anonymous publications. If an article is published it should bear the name of the author.
G.M.S. "He that practises the truth comes to the light that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God" (@John 3: 21).
S.McC. Some brethren may feel it is more becoming and humble to remain anonymous, but it is better to know of whom we are learning things.
{138}
Rem. Does it confirm us as to ministry to see that the brethren are taking it on?
S.McC. As our brother has just said, the way brethren have been affected universally by the ministry during the last fifty years shows its distinctiveness and how leadership is linked with it.
A.P.C.L. Are we responsible for what we make room for in our localities? It says here that "Paul thought it not well". Did he have in mind what was necessary for the moment?
S.McC. That is important. The priesthood in Numbers, as we were taught years ago, helps as to constructive criticism in regard to the ministry. We do not accept everything that is ministered in our localities without discerning whether the Lord is in it, whether the Spirit is in it, and whether it carries the distinctive word of authority.
A.H. Would verses 40 -- 1 of chapter 15 show that the saints came to a judgment of this matter?
S.McC. "Paul, having chosen Silas, went forth, committed by the brethren to the grace of God" shows that in the body of the saints there was a judgment as to what was right and as to where the Spirit was and where the Lord was in this movement.
P.L. In any issue that arises, is it not the body of the saints, in spiritual feeling and understanding, that really turns the scales?
S.McC. It shows what an important place the body of the saints has in regard to the balance of the truth, but we must not minimise the need of *leadership*. The truth requires the maintenance of leadership.
W.S.S. Referring to Timothy, after this declension where Paul had to take a stand, it would seem as if the Lord came in to strengthen the position by bringing in Timothy.
S.McC. It is striking how closely linked are the references "confirming the assemblies" (@Acts 15: 41) and "The assemblies therefore were confirmed *in the faith*" (@Acts 16: 5). The first is just, "*confirming* the assemblies"; but after Timothy is introduced, and there is the movement to maintain unity, it says, "The assemblies therefore
{139}
were confirmed in the faith"; that is the teaching, in the truth.
W.S.S. Out of every issue there is increase. We can look for increase out of every conflict.
S.McC. We would help one another if we were more faithful with one another. We should speak to each other face to face. Much damage may be done by speaking *to* one another *about* one another, instead of speaking to the persons concerned. That is where help is needed.
G.R.C. Would you say a word as to the responsibility of the assembly in connection with the truth? We usually hold that on such occasions as these the local company has a responsibility in connection with the truth. Does not "the pillar and base of the truth" bear on that?
S.McC. We were alluding to that in Glasgow, how the greatness of the assembly is referred to in a catholic way in @1 Timothy 3: 15 as, "the pillar and base of the truth". We need to understand that aspect of the assembly.
G.R.C. How would you link that with what you are saying about leadership of an apostolic character which preceded the assembly at the beginning?
S.McC. To use a simple illustration, it was strikingly seen in the way the saints universally accepted the truth of the Lord's sonship and the truth of the worship of the Holy Spirit. The same would apply to the worship of God, the saints having come to it universally. There may be difficulty in certain parts, but the difficulties seem to be more with those who teach than with the general body of the saints. It is the assembly that is the pillar and base of the truth.
G.R.C. The general body of the saints can be counted on to preserve priestly discernment.
S.McC. I think that is important.
F.M. Judas and Silas would not be saying anything different from what Paul had said, and Paul's selection of Silas seems to indicate his confidence in him to carry on the line of truth Paul was presenting.
S.McC. Silas must have impressed Paul, and, having a Grecian name, he would perhaps fit better into the work that was before Paul. Verse 4 is remarkable as promoting unity without the truth being given up or relinquished,
{140}
"And as they passed through the cities they instructed them to observe the decrees determined on by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem". This shows Paul's great desire to maintain unity in the assembly. He was not initiating an isolated line, but was moving forward with a ministry into which the Spirit of God was to come peculiarly, resulting in the unifying of the saints generally.
F.M. One difficulty we find today is that some who assume leadership are bringing forward something different from what the Spirit of God is emphasising.
S.McC. It is important that we should all say the same thing, especially when it comes to the truth, because it affects the saints, and we want to affect them rightly. One reason for reading about Lydia in relation to Paul's ministry is to show how the sisters come into this matter. We were hearing about sisters in the south who are marked by disaffection, which is a very serious matter. It is important that sisters should come into the gain of the truth and be clear about it, and that they should be under the hand of the Lord so that He can operate in view of the strengthening of the truth.
P.L. In the Philippian epistle Paul says, "Fulfil my joy, that ye may think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing" (@Philippians 2: 3). Would that not cover the sisters, Lydia and others, as well as the brothers?
S.McC. The women have a remarkable place in Philippi. It says of Lydia, after the reference to the women in verse 13, "And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard; whose heart the Lord *opened* to *attend* to the things spoken by Paul" (@Acts 16: 14). It is a remarkable reference to this woman, and it is a word to the sisters to support the truth in its distinctive character as seen in Paul.
F.M. Is that a feature Paul had to correct in Corinth as to the women?
S.McC. He seems to have a good deal to say about the order in the assembly, indicating that women are to be silent in the assemblies. What a place they have here as attending to the things spoken by Paul.
{141}
A.A. In Philippians two sisters, Euodia and Syntyche, are exhorted to be of the same mind in the Lord.
S.McC. That shows the importance of sisters. Paul's concern for them shows their importance in regard to the testimony. The exposure of the great systematised teaching of error in Plymouth was through the sisters by the notes that were taken and circulated. In this way sisters had a good deal to do with bringing to light the error that Mr. Darby exposed.
A.S. What would be involved in the expression, "attend to the things spoken by Paul"?
S.McC. It is to impress us with the need, not only to listen to the ministry, but to carry it into effect. It does not say, whose *ear* the Lord opened to *hear*, but "whose *heart* the Lord opened to *attend* to the things spoken by Paul". It is the Lord who is in the matter.
W.S.S. Would the woman being mentioned first show that in this great movement at Philippi the truth must be taken on subjectively?
S.McC. Just so, and the counter-movement in verses 16 -- 18 is subjective too in the way of evil influence.
A.J.G. The result of Lydia attending to the things spoken by Paul was very far-reaching, for it resulted in her house being opened and becoming the base of operations.
S.McC. How important it is to see that! Paul's ministry bears so much on households, and in verse 15 shows such a good result in the effectiveness of the Lord's operation in opening Lydia's heart.
Rem. Is there not a yield for God in our paying attention? "Obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams" (@1 Samuel 15: 22).
S.McC. Obedience is a great matter. We should be *obedient* to the truth. What impresses you in regard to those who, alas, sorrowfully, still have difficulty about the Spirit, is the entire lack of obedience to the truth.
V.T.S. Is it of interest that comely features in the sisters -- as to the hair and the token -- precede the Supper in @1 Corinthians 11?
S.McC. Yes, we shall see that later. It is remarkable how Paul stresses subjection in that chapter which makes
{142}
way for the introduction of the Lord's Supper. The place that our houses have enters into this great ministry of Paul in the Gentile world at Philippi. How important our houses are, and what goes on in them -- the conversations, the talk, sympathy with the truth and with the ministry. It is not only the sisters themselves but the whole constitution of the house.
E.G.J. Is it not stressed here that the authority of the Lord precedes Paul's ministry? We have to come under the authority of the Lord if we are to get the gain of Paul.
S.McC. Yes. We can see how close the Lord and the Spirit are in the realm and sphere of mediatorial operations. The Spirit is mentioned earlier in regard to certain things, but now the Lord comes right into the position, opening Lydia's heart. It is a personal and definite operation of the Lord to emphasise the importance of Paul's ministry. The Lord did not do it with Peter or the others in the same way. He has Paul in mind.
A.J.G. Is it not really a militant position? The Lord is establishing a base of operations with a view to the truth of the assembly entering the western world.
S.McC. While we would not like to put too much into it, the position in this section suggests the seductive evil influence of Thyatira as mentioned in @Revelation 3. It seems remarkable that the Lord should be operating in this way in regard to Lydia and Paul's ministry.
J.G.M. Is it not significant that Lydia is spoken of as one who worshipped God, even before her heart is opened?
S.McC. We are entitled to regard Lydia as a subject of the work of God. What can we say about the expression, "who worshipped God"? How did she do it? Where did she do it? We are just left with the statement as if to remind us of the quality in the woman. She was not an ordinary person, she was a *worshipper* of God.
The 18th chapter deals with the local position at Corinth. Paul moves from there, and it says, "And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch. And having stayed there some time, he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples"
{143}
(verses 22 -- 3). We are to be impressed with this much-needed ministry, and we should be confirmed, strengthened, and established, in relation to the teaching.
T.M. Is there a link between what God has raised up in an authoritative way and the assembly which is the vessel of the testimony?
S.McC. There is, and it is of interest that (verse 22), despite all that had happened in Jerusalem earlier in regard to Paul, he did not carry over any feeling. He says, "and having gone up and saluted the assembly". The allusion is to Jerusalem. He went down to Antioch, and comes back to the base of operations again, passing through these provinces and establishing all the disciples.
P.L. Does this salutation involve spiritual respect, as he clothes the saints at Jerusalem with the divine thoughts of this great vessel?
S.McC. Just so. It is interesting that Jerusalem and Galatia are here so closely linked together in the journeyings, and we know what important matters entered into these places, Paul having to maintain the truth of the glad tidings in withstanding Peter to the face because the truth was being undermined.
W.H. It was really a Galatian influence that was at work.
S.McC. The whole province seemingly was affected by a wrong lead in teaching, and a very humbling and sorrowful thing it was. But we know that spoil came out of it and that Peter eventually rose to the occasion.
W.S.S. Why does it refer specifically to the disciples?
S.McC. I think it would allude to the following-up and educational side of the truth.
P.L. It would be like Paul's house-to-house visitation at Ephesus.
S.McC. Just so, establishing all the disciples. We have to keep in mind that Paul was free from any special links, and it is important that we should be free from *special* links on natural lines, such as between Barnabas and John Mark. The enemy would work through special links at times to hinder the truth.
A.P.C.L. Both in chapter 15 and here the movement came from the servants themselves. Paul says to Barnabas,
{144}
"Let us return now and visit the brethren" (15: 36) and here it says, "And having stayed there some time, he went forth" (18: 23). Would you say how that might work today? Servants are generally invited to serve.
S.McC. Might I ask you if you accept every invitation you get?
A.P.C.L. Surely not.
S.McC. It is important to see that an invitation is no indication that it is the Lord's mind that we should go. We have to make room for that which came out in Apollos, who was moving in relation to the Lord yet has to be adjusted. We have to be open to adjustment, and we should discern *what* is needed and *where* certain things may be needed. It is not that Paul was not legitimately subject to Christ. In becoming all things to all men it was "not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ" (@1 Corinthians 9: 20). Paul was always under orders in that way.
A.R. Paul says, "Let us return". Evidently he had an indication from the Lord, and he moves on his own initiative. Perhaps we do not know enough of this.
S.McC. It is important that if there is work to be done it should be done. Care has to be exercised that we do not encourage free-lance movements. The principle and basis of all service is that we are sent, and I do not think that what is said of Paul here militates against that. He is moving as under the authority of the Lord.
J.S.E. Was it not a feature of the early days that the ministers moved very much on this line but as things became consolidated they began to work by way of the assembly?
S.McC. Just so. The early days had their own place. Many things then marked the movements that were quite distinctive to that period and time.
F.M. Mr. Darby's movements in pioneer work seem to have been very much directed by the Lord.
S.McC. They were. The Lord was distinctly directing him and he moved as under His authority. You cannot read his letters or ministry without realising that. The Lord, however, took issue with the free-lances and the evangelists who went about roving at will in their service. The Lord used the Glanton division to expose that,
{145}
because it led to opposition to the truth in Mr. Raven's time.
A.H. May I ask you again to say a word on *the* disciples. It is striking the way they are brought in in Acts, and I wondered if they are disciplined persons as suggested in @Matthew 13: 52, "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens".
S.McC. It involves that. It is important that we should be disciplined persons and that our minds and our energies should be disciplined so that we are not loose but under control. The more disciplined we are, the more careful we shall be in regard to our movements and in regard to the truth.
A.J.G. This would be the public character that marked the brethren, would it not, as taught by the ministry?
S.McC. Just so. That would be borne out again in verse 27, "And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the *disciples* engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those *who believed* through grace. For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ". Apollos ministry bears on the public position, especially in the maintenance of the truth as to the Christ.
W.S. Would the import and bearing of the baptism of John as known by Apollos render us peculiarly amenable to the brethren and ready for any adjustment that may be necessary as to the higher levels of the truth?
S.McC. I am sure it is important that we should be amenable to adjustment.
C.M.M. In regard to the movement of the servant, would he get his commission from the Lord? Would that not synchronise with the movements of the saints in the assembly by way of receiving and making room for such?
S.McC. I am sure it would. The Lord no doubt would go before in regard to any service in ministry.
A.E.M. I was going to ask you why Paul uses the expression "saints" and "brethren" rather than "disciples" in his epistles; for example, "to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints" (@1 Corinthians 1: 1)?
{146}
S.McC. You have something in your mind; please say more about it and help us.
A.E.M. Is not this term "disciples" connected with the kingdom? The other terms are connected with the assembly.
S.McC. Just so. What you are saying fits in with the remark as to the public side. The "way" is presented in the Acts, how Christianity was known in the public position, so that *disciples* are referred to throughout the book. The important service of Aquila and Priscilla is to be noted. It is important to note their care and skill, and lack of officialism, in the way they bring about adjustment as to the truth. Apollos would not be an easy person to speak to from one viewpoint, but the skill exercised was such that it won him completely. We get no suggestion that he demurred in any way.
C.M.M. Would he be just the kind of man to go down to Corinth? He was a man with a personality, but he had been adjusted as to the truth.
S.McC. Just so. He could help them especially in regard to Paul's ministry, for Apollos had a particular link with Paul.
C.M.M. He had great respect for Paul when he went to Corinth.
S.McC. Just so. "Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all his will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity" (@1 Corinthians 16: 12). This shows the link there was between Paul and Apollos in regard to the ministry.
P.L. You spoke of the skill needed in relation to Apollos. It says in Proverbs, "An ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, is a wise reprover upon an attentive ear" (25: 12). Do you have the wise reproof with Aquila and Priscilla and an attentive ear with Apollos? Must you have that combination if adjustment is to be assured?
S.McC. Exactly. Proverbs helps us as to that.
W.H. Is it important that they first of all took him to them? Would that be the confidence of love that would make way for adjustment?
{147}
S.McC. That is it. It is a very affecting word. "Aquila and Priscilla ... took him *to them* and *unfolded* to him the way of God more exactly." The expression "and *unfolded* to him the way of God more exactly" shows their skill in helping Apollos.
A.M. Would the service of admonition to which Paul refers, "admonishing each one of you", bear on such a service?
S.McC. It would, and this helps us in regard to all our responsibility in connection with the truth and to ministry in our localities, so that error might be checked.
H.McL. How do you distinguish between this matter of Aquila and Priscilla taking him to them and the reference to Paul withstanding Peter to the face? In Galatians it says, "I said to Peter before all" (2: 14).
S.McC. I think it was because of the leavening influence among the saints.
C.M.M. Apollos is instructed in the way of the Lord, Aquila and Priscilla bringing before him the way of God. Then in chapter 20 we read of the counsel of God, the kingdom of God, and the assembly of God.
S.McC. That is interesting. "They unfolded to him the way of God more exactly."
P.L. And that would set him on the divine highway, we may say Corinthian-wise, would it not?
S.McC. Exactly. I was thinking of what was alluded to earlier. We might refer for a moment to the difference between Apollos and Aquila and Priscilla, and Paul at Galatia. There might have been some who would have said it was a personal attack on Peter by Paul. How humbling it is that we should give way to the enemy when the truth is at stake and a stand is made, and attribute things to personal attacks. It was a question of the truth; something was affecting the saints and there was also what was the result of influence. Peter coming from James was adversely affected by influence. All that enters into the public rebuke of Peter.
A.A. His contention in regard to Alexander the coppersmith took quite a different form, "Alexander the smith did many evil things against me. The Lord will render to him according to his works" (@2 Timothy 4: 14).
{148}
S.McC. We do not have to do with that.
A.P.C.L. It says of Apollos that he spoke and taught *exactly* the things concerning Jesus. Do you think that it is on account of the lack of these basic matters that it is so difficult for us to be adjusted?
S.McC. I think there is something in what you say, because if we are right basically and foundationally adjustment will always be easy as a result of our links with God. David is an outstanding example of that. He was quickly and readily adjusted and never excused himself. We are too ready to excuse ourselves when it comes to adjustment.
M.A.W. Is it important to see that Apollos was not on true Christian ground, "knowing only the baptism of John"? Being instructed in the way of God more exactly would bring him there.
S.McC. He was not on proper Christian ground in his teaching. While the baptism of John had a foundational bearing in regard to certain things, Aquila and Priscilla discerned there was something needed; something was lacking with Apollos and they supplied it.
In chapter 20 the general bearing of the verses we read shows the greatness of the teaching and the ministry, as seen in Paul's service to the assembly and the unity it led to among the saints. Unity, affection and love come to light in the chapter.
W.S.S. Why is eldership emphasised?
S.McC. Paul was thinking about the care of things in a locality. Eldership is not a question of gift. The chapter opens with suggestions about gift but ends with references to the local position and the matter of elders. That is, those who would have a care for things in a locality such as at Ephesus.
W.S.S. That is a principle which would carry right through the dispensation.
S.McC. Just so.
T.M. Would you give us some help in regard to the matter of reception in our localities? Is there need in a place where there are two or three meetings to go into the details of things in a subdivision before going to the Care Meeting?
{149}
S.McC. How did you arrive at that? What suggested it to you?
T.M. You mentioned the care in relation to the elders and you stressed the idea of confidence.
S.McC. It is a practical matter. I do not know what is generally done here. When young people ask to break bread where one comes from they are well known in the locality. A brother may have prayer with them, or he may have heard them before. It is mentioned in the Care Meeting, and if the brethren are happy the case goes forward. The simpler we are, the better. I do not understand what you mean when you refer to sub-divisional care.
T.M. I only used the expression to clarify what one has in mind. Normally when anyone seeks to take their place, the local brethren take up the matter and the issue comes to the Care Meeting.
S.McC. We have to be careful not to allow any officialism. When you refer to taking up the matter, the matter belongs to the city. Elders are never linked with any part of the city -- they are linked with the *whole* city. In a big city the work has to be attended to to facilitate the case going forward, but the persons concerned go in by the gates *into the city*, not the subdivision.
T.M. It is a matter of confidence, would you say, "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every matter be established" (@2 Corinthians 13: 1)?
S.McC. That is how I understand it. If two or three brothers have had contact with the person and they are happy, that is all that is necessary. The assembly generally has confidence in the brethren. We must not make things too hard for the young people. We want to see them in the assembly of course rightly.
A.J.G. And then to shepherd them after they are breaking bread.
S.McC. That is the great point, and that comes out in @Acts 20. The young people have to be encouraged, and they have to be cared for after they are in.
A.P.C.L. Is there a suggestion in the word "and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers to shepherd the assembly of God"? The overseers are in the flock in this setting.
{150}
S.McC. That is very interesting -- "and to all the flock, *wherein* the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers" -- the "flock" suggesting what the saints are as the objects of care.
A.P.C.L. I thought that would enable us to know of matters as they come up and not to be surprised when persons come forward.
S.McC. Very good.
DIVINE OPERATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY READING (3)
@Matthew 5: 1 -- 12; @Matthew 13: 34 -- 52; @Matthew 18: 17 -- 20
S.McC. Our subject is the assembly. Yesterday we considered teaching and ministry in relation to it, and it is thought that today we should see how Matthew's teaching is particularly intended to educate us in view of our part administratively in the assembly. This is a remarkable gospel in its teaching on the kingdom and the assembly, and it is important that we should understand the relation of the kingdom to the assembly and of the assembly to the kingdom. This is the only gospel which makes formal reference to the assembly. It is not proposed to consider the detail of the first passage, but to cover the verses in a general way as presenting to us the way in which administration is worked out in Matthew in the operation of the law of the kingdom set out by the Lord. As has often been noticed, He not only sets it out in teaching, but is Himself the embodiment of it. In @Matthew 13 the assembly is brought before us in a choice way, and parables are introduced in regard to the truth, the whole range of things in Christendom being in mind in the parabolic ministry. The activity of man's mind in the things of God necessitates parabolic ministry; the truth being set out in that form to cast us upon divine Persons, the Spirit especially, for help in understanding the truth. There is also what is linked with the house, suggestive of the assembly side where the truth is opened out. Finally in chapter 18 there is the place the assembly has, as it were, a great
{151}
capital; it is a great extended thought giving us what is at the very centre of the kingdom of the heavens at the present time. The capital like Washington, London, or Berlin, is the capital of the realm, and the realm is the kingdom of the heavens. The expression of the administrative authority of Christ in the kingdom of the heavens is found in the assembly, the great administrative vessel, which has authority for binding and loosing.
I thought we might begin with the passage in @Matthew 5, referring particularly to discipleship. This came into the reading yesterday, and allusion was made to the difference between the disciples in the Acts and in the gospels, and the saints and the brethren as referred to in the epistles. The place the disciples had forms a large part of the teaching of Matthew's gospel, and it is important to notice the way the disciples stand related to the kingdom. Matthew makes a good deal of discipleship.
A.E.M. You are alluding to the kingdom standing in relation to the assembly.
S.McC. I think it helps us to see the power and authority which becomes a great strength and a bulwark in the operation of things in the assembly. The assembly, from one way in which the kingdom may be viewed, is within this realm where the full administrative authority of Christ, hidden in the heavens, is seen. It helps us in the working out of things in the assembly so that we should not come under the snare of the fear of man.
A.E.M. You would say that, before we can take up assembly relations rightly, we must come under the kingdom and be subdued?
S.McC. It is important to see that the full weight of Christ's administrative authority, as Man exalted in the heavens, is operating with us in a subduing way. The glad tidings brings us under His moral sway to subdue our wills completely and set aside lawlessness in us. Matthew would show us, as things are worked out in the light of the kingdom of the heavens and the assembly, how much has come in through lawlessness in the things of God. It is important to see that in @Matthew 13 lawlessness is linked with the things of God. In the parables it is covered in a religious way.
{152}
A.J.G. So that it is the leaven that eventually leavens the whole lump.
S.McC. That is the point. The great tree grows out of a small seed -- the overshadowing influence of Christendom in which the lawless mind of man finds room for exploiting itself. All that is around us, but the Lord would help us as to that which is under *His* sway in a vital way.
L.E.S. Would that show the necessity of *making* disciples as is mentioned in the end of the gospel? Would you say a word as to the bearing of that on baptism?
S.McC. I think Matthew helps us throughout in discipleship. It is introduced in the different chapters, because discipleship involves that we are not in the things of God in a haphazard way -- one day up and the next day down, one week in things and the next week out of things. Discipleship involves education, training, and discipline, so that we become reliable persons who are amenable to the teaching and to the truth, and who allow all its authority in their souls.
E.G.J. Is the normal result of the gospel that the disciples go up the mountain to come under the teaching of the Lord?
S.McC. The gospel has in mind, according to Romans, that we should be brought under the moral sway of God in Christ. It is a great matter that the truth of the glad tidings, the teaching of it, should have full scope in that relation.
A.J.G. Does this passage show that it results in men who are entirely different in character from all that obtains in man's world?
S.McC. That is what is in mind. The passage draws attention to the great legislative position, as has often been alluded to by our beloved brother, Mr. Taylor. The Lord on the mount is taking up the legislative side and setting out the *spirit* that should mark us with the result that we are *different* from others. The subjects of the kingdom are to be different from other persons.
J.S.E. Is it helpful to take account of the way the Lord, in chapter 4, authoritatively dismisses the devil before He goes up the mountain? Furthermore in chapter
{153}
16, before He raises the question as to who He is, it says, "he left" the hostile religious element. The note says that He left them *absolutely*. Would these two points help us in understanding the bearing of this legislation and administration?
S.McC. Yes, because what comes up immediately is that "he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them". The truth that is being brought out here involves this elevated side of things, and Matthew would impress us with it. This morning, at home, we were reading chapter 17, noting how Matthew gives us the mountain, the elevated side of things, and how the truth is carried forward on that level. Departure from the religious side of things leads to this elevated position where the teaching is on an elevated level.
J.S.E. Could we say that the disciples who came to Him are representative of those who are in the gain of the Lord's complete defeat of the devil?
S.McC. From this section onwards, the disciples are coming into the gain of it. He is educating them in view of the complete breaking of the power of evil. Chapters 8 and 9 have a definite part in their education showing how the power of the enemy is broken. The effect of the power and the operation of sin is dealt with in type in persons who come under the Lord's notice. There is not time to go into all that the Lord taught the disciples as they came to Him, but one particular feature is in verse 6, "Blessed they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for *they* shall be filled." Matthew would help us in the matter of righteousness. Many of us may be inclined to link righteousness only with our businesses, or our houses, or the working out of things in our responsible lives in earning our livelihood, but Matthew would fill our minds with the thought of righteousness as *he* presents it. This has been alluded to as including ecclesiastical righteousness. Righteousness linked with the assembly, brings up the matter of assembly history and involves the pursuance of the truth in relation to the assembly.
A.H. Would what you have just said be in mind in what the Lord said to John Baptist in chapter 3: 15,
{154}
"Suffer it now: for thus it becometh *us* to fulfil all righteousness"?
S.McC. Yes, it would be included in that. The Lord is identifying Himself with the brethren, the state of the remnant, and is referred to in that way by Matthew. Attention is drawn to Him as it says, "This is my beloved Son in whom I have found my delight" (3: 17) -- the One who identifies Himself with the remnant on this line of fulfilling all righteousness.
W.H. Would you say a little more as to what you have in mind in regard of ecclesiastical righteousness?
S.McC. You feel the importance of the great subject of righteousness, and the Spirit of God would help us, through the Scriptures, to see the greatness of it. There is imputed righteousness, for instance, which is drawn attention to in the gospel; righteousness acquired basically and primarily on the principle of faith. There is also the great feature of practical righteousness, that we meet our obligations righteously before God and before men. And ecclesiastical righteousness is what we are in our relations together in the truth and light of the assembly.
G.R.C. Would @2 Timothy 2 involve ecclesiastical righteousness? "Withdraw from iniquity and follow righteousness". Would that include the recognition of the Spirit's rights, the Lord's rights, and God's rights in the assembly?
S.McC. I am sure it does. @2 Timothy 2 especially stresses the ecclesiastical side of things. The great house is also alluded to here, as the place where the lawlessness of man's mind operates in the things of God. The call in @2 Timothy 2 is to those that name the name of Christ to depart from iniquity and pursue righteousness. All that bears on what we are saying.
P.L. And appears in the crown of the assembly's history as the Lamb's wife, "For the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" (@Revelation 19: 8). Mr. Darby points out that righteousness here is actual, not imputed.
S.McC. That would bear on what we are saying. The matter of assembly righteousness should be a great concern with us. Think of all that has come into assembly history since the time of the revival when Mr. Darby was
{155}
raised up! Ecclesiastical unrighteousness would be involved in the first division in relation to Bethesda, and in all the succeeding divisions, as the mind of man operated wilfully in the rejection of the truth. Ecclesiastical righteousness enters into the countering of all that, and we are to pursue it and thirst after it.
G.M.S. The crown of righteousness is mentioned in @2 Timothy 4, following upon Paul having fought the good fight and having kept the faith.
S.McC. It is interesting to see how Paul brings in that dignified thought as he contemplates the finishing of his path. "The crown of righteousness" -- what a refined and dignified thought it is!
A.C.S.P. Does Paul's word in @Ephesians 4: 24 bear on it? "Having put on the new man which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness. Wherefore, having put off falsehood, speak truth every one with his neighbour, because we are members one of another".
S.McC. I am sure it does. We shall see in the scriptures that will come before us this afternoon, how, in administration working out in the assembly, that feature of falsehood is specially taken account of, and taken issue with, by divine Persons and the saints.
J.L.F. When Saul of Tarsus was about to be baptised it was said, "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name" (@Acts 22: 16). Was that dealing with ecclesiastical unrighteousness?
S.McC. Undoubtedly that would be involved in the way he persecuted the saints. It is well that we should not only take account of ecclesiastical righteousness in a positive way, but that we should understand ecclesiastical unrighteousness negatively. How much has come into the assembly through the mind of man in Protestantism and other systems, as well as the divisions which have been referred to. The mind of man operating wilfully and speciously in the things of God would involve ecclesiastical unrighteousness.
C.A.M. Would not that great principle be connected with the top of the mountain as in @Isaiah 2? I wondered if you had in mind to stress how wonderful this principle is as having everything right from the top down.
{156}
S.McC. I am sure it is important, and I would add, not as detracting from what you have said, that it is good also to have everything right from the bottom up. A good deal of the difficulty in assembly life and history in recent years, issues from what is wrong at the bottom, either in the apprehension of imputed righteousness or in the working out of practical righteousness.
G.M.S. It says of the man in @Ezekiel 1, "And the appearance of his loins and upwards, and from the appearance of his loins and downwards, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about" (@Ezekiel 1: 27).
S.McC. Very good.
J.S.E. Would you say a word as to the title, "the Spirit of God" in relation to this matter of righteousness?
S.McC. We do well to see, in the light of Matthew's gospel, that the Spirit stands related to the whole position. Administration, as Matthew contemplates it, is not just an administration in terms of the truth, but an administration involving power in the working out of the truth, and in the presence of the Spirit of God. What do you think?
J.S.E. Our attention has been called to the Lord's word, "Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (@Matthew 3: 15). In the middle of the gospel He says, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed is the kingdom of God come upon you" (@Matthew 12: 28). I wondered if the term, "The Spirit of God", as appearing only in Matthew, is to emphasise the supremacy of God in relation to this matter of righteousness and so the Spirit is said to be the Spirit of God?
S.McC. I think that is right, the Spirit of God being a particular reference to Himself Personally. "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you" (@1 Corinthians 3: 16), is a clear reference to the greatness of the Person who is there.
P.L. "Ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@1 Corinthians 5: 4). You have spoken of peculiar administrative power in relation to the assembly.
S.McC. It is important to see that the whole weight of
{157}
the authority and power linked with the kingdom of the heavens is working out for the protection of assembly righteousness, and assembly righteousness should be understood. Even the young people should understand where they are in regard to assembly righteousness. Joseph, who comes before us in the beginning of the book, is not an old man, but comparatively young, and he is concerned as to righteousness. Whilst it is right to be concerned about righteousness in our business, assembly righteousness is also important as involving our relations together in the light of the assembly, and in regard to the truth.
T.M. Do we see that working out in @1 Samuel 25? Nabal lost nothing, and obtained the benefit of the protective side of the kingdom, but Abigail, typifying the assembly, sets out the truth as to assembly righteousness.
S.McC. That is a good illustration of how power and authority, in type in David, are working out for the protection of what is within its scope.
L.E.S. You have something else in mind as to @Matthew 1: 19, "But Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man".
S.McC. If we are to have an effective part in the administration according to Matthew, we should understand the genealogy and the reason why Joseph is brought forward. The genealogy itself has to be understood, how persons fit into it, who is in it, and who is left out. Joseph is not only mentioned in it, but the Spirit of God enlarges in detail on this kind of man.
G.M.S. Of Tamar, the first woman in the genealogy, it is said, "She is more righteous than I".
S.McC. That is remarkable. She was an intelligent woman as we know, and Judah had to admit that she was more righteous than he.
C.M.M. @Psalm 48, dealing with God's city, says, "Thy right hand is full of righteousness". Would that link with what you have in mind in Matthew?
S.McC. It would, and it bears on what we are saying as to righteousness, the kingly side being in @Psalm 48. The disciples, as following through the teaching that has preceded in Matthew, would understand the matter of the genealogy. Now the Lord brings them to the teaching, of the law of the kingdom, and how it works out.
{158}
J.S.E. Were the disciples persons who were right basically in domestic and business matters, whereas the righteousness which is now before us is connected with what you have termed assembly righteousness?
S.McC. That is it. One is particularly thinking of our relations together and the way the kingdom of the heavens is working out through the assembly. The first thing said is, "Blessed are the poor in spirit". That is a true feature of one who is among the disciples and instructed and disciplined in relation to the kingdom of the heavens.
F.M. In verse 20 it says, "For I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens". The character of the righteousness has to *surpass*.
S.McC. That is important, and includes the idea of there being a better righteousness; it is a comparative thought. Our righteousness in this way should exceed and excel the righteousness around us.
A.P.C.L. Oftentimes we regard ecclesiastical righteousness as a matter of what is positional. We may be in a right position, but perhaps overlook what comes to light both in Joseph himself and in his concern as to righteousness. Moreover, he was amenable to the word from the angel.
S.McC. Very good. That helps in regard to ecclesiastical righteousness. It involves that the assembly must be protected in view of its important and dignified position as the capital. It is the very centre of government in this great range of things, and it must be protected, not only as to moral evil and its encroachment in a defiling way, but also from the activity of the will of man in regard to the truth.
F.M. Is that how the kingdom of the heavens becomes the great bulwark of the assembly?
S.McC. Yes. It supports and strengthens all that is working out in that realm. This is clearly seen in the epistles to the Corinthians, where practical matters have to be dealt with.
J. van Z. Does @1 Kings 9: 16 -- 19 help in relation to what you have brought before us? "Solomon built
{159}
garrisons and he built stores". He built all these things to protect the assembly.
S.McC. I think it might suggest the kingdom of the heavens, in a protective way, working out in relation to the assembly.
W.S.S. It says, "Blessed they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled". I may have righteousness in a certain external way, but be lacking in fulness. The great thought is, "but they shall be *filled*".
S.McC. It is important that this side of ecclesiastical righteousness should be fully understood by us, because it involves so much. Think of what Mr. Darby had to meet in regard to ecclesiastical unrighteousness, and the great amount of labour and time he expended in countering it!
W.S.S. He hungered and thirsted after righteousness and he was filled.
S.McC. Very good. His hymns show that, as do also his doxologies in the Synopsis and the Collected Writings.
W.S.S. I had in mind that, in stressing the line of righteousness, we may be in danger of being hard. Peace makers and merciful persons are linked up with it here, are they not?
S.McC. The administration of the kingdom of the heavens has a heavenly character and is not on the legal, hard, demanding side, but rather on the supplying side. It says, "Blessed the peacemakers, for *they* shall be called sons of God". These are persons who bring right conditions into the environment where the truth is operating.
G.R.C. Is it of note that the righteous man, Joseph, has his attention drawn to the current operations of the Holy Spirit? Does righteousness involve paying attention to the current operations of the Holy Spirit, and is it in that way that we are filled?
S.McC. I am sure it does. If we refer again to Mr. Darby and think of all that he went through in his soul in combating specious error in the truth, how it brought out his love for the assembly and of assembly righteousness! We are all to be marked by the pursuit of righteousness in an ecclesiastical way.
{160}
T.M. Would you say that the law of jealousy in @Numbers 5 shows how the assembly is pronounced clean and clear in view of her protection in that way?
S.McC. Just so.
P.L. "The work of righteousness shall be peace" (@Isaiah 32: 17). Is that the idea of a conquest gained through righteousness, and the spoil resulting -- "then had the churches rest" (@Acts 9: 31)?
S.McC. That is it. The working out of assembly righteousness keeps the assembly realm clear and the saints are preserved in peace. It is a great matter that we should see the way the Lord has been helping us as to the assembly, and assembly righteousness, so that we do not allow things to encroach in the assembly realm. A brother was asking me whether scripture would warrant withdrawal from one who smokes. It certainly would. Smoking is an unholy, evil habit and persons who *persist* in it should be dealt with in view of assembly righteousness.
J.S.E. I think we are being helped to understand why Matthew alone, of all the gospels, speaks of the kingdom of the heavens and of the assembly.
S.McC. It is important that we should see that Matthew, on the one hand, brings out the beneficence of the kingdom of the heavens, and the benign influence that marks its subjects in working out the law of the kingdom. On the other hand, Matthew is severe; that is, discipleship and righteousness in Matthew involve severity and regimentation in our lives, our circumstances, and our assembly relations.
F.M. After the Lord had comedown from the mountain, "having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field" (@Matthew 13: 36). Are they concerned to understand certain features of the enemy's work?
S.McC. @Matthew 13 is a wonderful chapter for helping us as to our present position in the dispensation. An interesting expression used five or six times in Matthew, but not in any other gospel except once in Mark, is "the completion of the age". Matthew contemplates the completion of certain things. Morally, it would have an
{161}
answer in the dispensation, the Lord contemplating all that has come into assembly history and all that has come in in the working of the mind of man in lawlessness in the things of God -- all that Christendom is, especially in the religious side of lawlessness.
Rem. In @Matthew 28 the Lord says, "Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me" (verse 10). Had the Lord in mind that assembly righteousness was to be under reproach?
S.McC. I think that is a helpful reference, because it bears on the position of reproach today. Where do you see assembly righteousness? Certainly not in the high places. You have to go to Galilee where the testimony is in reproach, and there the Lord comes to us and sees and meets us, and there comes to us the wondrous light of the full name of God -- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
A.M. Do we have a good example of learning from the Lord on the mountain in @Hebrews 1? "Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness" (verse 9). The assembly setting comes in after that.
S.McC. Very good. @Hebrews 1 is a wonderful setting out of the greatness of Christ. We need to read it more, especially when things get around that would be derogatory to the Person of Christ. It has been said that scripture does not say the Son is God to us. That kind of thing has to be checked. At the beginning of @Hebrews 1, it says, "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken *to us* in the person of the Son." Note what Mr. Darby says in his explanatory note, "It is God Himself who speaks; not by another; not as the Father nor in the person of the Father, not merely by the Holy Spirit, but as Himself a divine Person, and that Person the Son." That is one chapter which presents God in relation *to us*, so that it is not in keeping with scripture to say that the scripture does not say the Son is God to us.
P.L. The scripture is full of it -- He is the only true God and eternal life: He is the Alpha and Omega: He would be to us as God in revelation.
{162}
S.McC. The greatness of the Person of Christ! How the Spirit is jealous of anything that would reflect upon all that belongs to His glory.
P.L. And if He is not God to us in that sense, have we any knowledge of Him at all as God? We shall never know Him other than God in humiliation as He was here, but now God in Manhood glorified. We shall never know Him in the inscrutability of His Person, so that if we never have His Deity as known to us in Manhood, we do not have His Deity at all.
S.McC. Just so. The parable in @Matthew 13 (verses 36 -- 43) is dealing with the work of the enemy. We can see it abroad on every hand. It is in the wrong teaching in Christendom, and how we have all to be on our guard that we do not afford an opening for that kind of thing which would detract from the truth. "The good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil, and the harvest is the completion of the age, and the harvestmen are angels. As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age." This chapter would help us to discern between the good seed and the bad seed.
G.R.C. Would the expression, "the sons of the kingdom ", provide a link with chapter 5? Does it suggest those who are formed in the features of which we have been speaking, and who are, therefore, ready for the assembly?
S.McC. Very good; that helps. It is a question of what *they are*. Matthew is special in that way. "The good seed, *these are* the sons of the kingdom." They would be persons who have come under the teaching and who are formed in the spirit and grace of the kingdom.
M.A.W. Is the thought of "the completion of the age" morally arrived at now in the assembly?
S.McC. Yes, every executive action in the assembly in dealing with evil corresponds with the completion of the age when good will be relegated to its place and evil to its place. That is really what transpires in assembly judgments.
M.A.W. When does that period actually come in? Would it be at the end of the millennium?
{163}
S.McC. Verse 43 says, "then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father". It would precede the millennium.
A.H. May I enquire as to the maintenance of right relations amongst the brethren in the assembly? Is this suggested in what is said about the man at the altar with his gift (chapter 5)?
S.McC. Matthew's teaching involves the working out of the truth with one another, and the importance of our relations being right.
R.G.D. Would the knowledge that the Lord is leaving matters to the end of the age help us to be restful? Iniquity is inclined at times to test and affect our spirits, but we can be restful in relation to it.
S.McC. That is very good. One was impressed with a remark in the ministry recently on @Revelation 7 as to God's number going through. It will go through. Every member of the assembly will be secured and that imparts restfulness to the spirit.
Rem. Does the expression "He that has ears to hear" (verse 43) come as an appeal to us to take up these exercises now?
S.McC. Yes. It suggests that we are listening to the Lord's teaching here. We are not sitting by casually, but as hearing it and affected by it.
The Lord next opens up the truth of the treasure and the pearl, which really involves Paul's ministry -- the two great features of the gospel and the assembly.
A.J.G. The parable of the seine points on to Paul's ministry because the vessels into which the good are, gathered suggest local assemblies.
S.McC. Just so. It contemplates the economy, and involves the working out of righteousness in our local assemblies. The good is put into vessels, and the worthless is cast out.
A.J.G. In maintaining this principle of discrimination and refusing what is worthless in our several localities, we recognise now features of the world to come in what is already being worked out all over the world.
S.McC. That is it. We not only have the elements of the world to come in a general way -- righteousness, peace,
{164}
and joy, enjoyed in the assembly (as Mr. Raven suggests) -- but we have also the saints sitting down together locally and working out the truth.
W.H. Is the difference that, in speaking of the extended sphere of the kingdom, both are allowed to go on together, but when we come to the capital or the assembly there is the discrimination and the refusal of the bad and the maintenance of the good?
S.McC. Very good. So it is interesting that verses 47 -- 50 do not come immediately after verse 43. We might have said, to keep the truth clear, we will put these two parables as to the treasure and the pearl last, and this one along with the others. I believe the Spirit of God is suggesting that an appreciation of true assembly values will help us in the working out of things in our localities, as brought out in Paul's ministry.
P.L. In that sense the maintenance of assembly standards will give discrimination in regard of what is foreign.
S.McC. That is it exactly. Verses 47 -- 50 show that the truth is to be worked out in the light of the treasure and the pearl, and we are not to accommodate it to extenuating circumstances in which persons may be found.
W.S.S. Does it show that the work of the gospel must be governed by the truth of the assembly?
S.McC. I am sure that is so. Do you not think that it is important that the teaching of the treasure and the pearl should have full sway in our minds in view of this discriminating feature of administration in the following verse?
A.A-s. Is the importance of what you are saying brought out when Paul calls together the elders of the assembly and the leaders and points out to them that he had gone about preaching the kingdom of God? Then he refers to the importance of feeding or shepherding the assembly of God which He has purchased with the blood of His own. That is the importance of the kingdom of God and the assembly of God.
S.McC. That would enter into it. What an impression the thought of the one pearl of great value would leave on our minds as to the assembly, enabling us to take up the disentanglement of good and evil, as in verse 47, in the
{165}
light of positive appreciation of distinctive spiritual values. The treasure is undefined, but great potential is linked with it, suggesting what the glad tidings secure. It is undefined, but we have the greatness of the potential that is there. The *one pearl* suggests the distinctive, definite value of the assembly in the light of Paul's ministry.
G.R.C. Is the value of the assembly in that way an explanation of the severity to which you alluded earlier and which seems to come out in verses 48 -- 50? Would you mind saying another word about that? I believe you used the word "regimentation" in connection with it.
S.McC. I think that discipleship and righteousness in Matthew involve regimentation, because some of us are inclined to regard independent thinking as a kind of asset. It is a great matter that we should see the importance of discipleship in Matthew and how the truth is followed through in relation to it.
G.R.C. While we deprecate regimentation, as seen in the world, do you think it has a bearing on divine things, and does not militate against the thought of spiritual variety?
S.McC. Exactly. I am thinking of it in a moral and spiritual way, not in any official way among the brethren. Do you not think that it is of some importance that our lives be regulated in the light of discipleship and righteousness according to Matthew?
G.R.C. I am sure that is right. We cannot allow any looseness on that line.
C.M.M. Would local administration be in the light of one pearl? Each one of the gates respectively was of one pearl.
S.McC. That would enter into it, the unity that marks all the gates of the city in regard to its administration.
A.J.G. Do you think the parable of the pearl is the answer to the parable of the leaven? The leaven is the man that has been set aside in the cross but is brought in and introduced in Christendom until the whole lump is leavened. Does not the beauty of the pearl suggest that the assembly has only one Man before her, that is, Christ?
S.McC. Very good. She has a distinctive apprehension and appreciation of *Him* as *He* had of *her* -- one pearl of
{166}
great value, the greatness of the man and the woman in that light over against what comes into the history of Christendom as in chapter 13.
J.S.E. Does this allusion to the one pearl in chapter 13 help us more clearly to see why the Lord says "my assembly" in chapter 16?
S.McC. I think it does. The Lord had delight in referring to it in that way. @Matthew 16 is a unique reference, especially contemplating the way the gates of hades might operate against it.
A.E.M. I think Mr. Taylor drew attention to the fact that the kingdom, in verse 44, is a current operation whereas the pearl was one operation.
S.McC. That is important. Verse 46 is in the past tense -- "and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it". It is a completed thought in that way, whereas with the treasure it says, "which a man having found has hid for the joy of it, goes and sells all whatever he has and buys that field." It would involve in that way all the current operations.
A.E.M. I would think that the current operations of the Lord are more testing for us to accept than the truth of the pearl.
S.McC. That is interesting. Say something more.
A.E.M. Many would accept the death of Christ as applying to the assembly which He loved, but they will not accept the current operations of the Spirit to bring it out.
S.McC. Very good. The Spirit enters into the great service linked with the treasure hid in the field, the field alluding particularly to the Gentile world, the assembly in that setting and how things are working out there.
J.S.E. Is the way the Lord speaks of the assembly as *His* in @Matthew 16 to be noted? He claims it as *His*, and gives the reason for edifying it, because it is His. "I will build my assembly" (@Matthew 16: 18). Does that fit in with what has been said about the pearl? We may accept the abstract truth of the pearl, but the "building" is our test.
S.McC. That is right. The pearl is a definite conception
{167}
according to the divine mind linked with purpose and counsel. The Lord is likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls. He had a definite conception before Him in His service, and He found one pearl of great value. The treasure alludes to the great extent of divine operations in relation to a specified area, a certain field. The Lord Jesus and the Spirit are both operating, the Lord on high, but the Spirit here, operating currently in regard to the treasure.
A.R. Did you connect the securing of the treasure with activities in the gospel? Is it the work of God, and God using activities in the gospel?
S.McC. Just so. Think of what Paul, in speaking of current operations, says in @Romans 15: 18, "For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for the obedience of the nations, by word and deed, in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ; and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another's foundation." That is, we are reminded of the current operations in the time of Paul, the Spirit acting mediatorially in them bringing about results in relation to the gospel. That is what the treasure suggests and it is going on now.
J.S.E. You suggested that the field represented a specified area. Would it link on with the little open book in Revelation? The specified area where all this activity has taken place is to come under particular judicial action.
S.McC. It is the same area in Revelation. The known history linked with the western world would be in mind.
J.G.M. What is involved in that he went and sold all he had and bought the pearl? What is suggested in the idea of selling?
S.McC. The allusion is to all that pertained to Him in the position into which He had come as Man. Think of the things He had! Things that pertained to Him in the position into which He came. He sold whatever He had and bought it, whereas with the treasure it is whatever He *has* and buys *that* field.
{168}
J.G.M. Would it correspond with what we get in 2 Corinthians, "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor"?
S.McC. That would enter into it.
DIVINE OPERATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY READING (4)
@Acts 5: 1 -- 14; @Revelation 21: 21 -- 27; @1 Corinthians 5: 3 -- 8
S.McC. I thought this afternoon we should consider further the administrative side in relation to the assembly. These passages have been read because of the profound impressions they leave upon us as to the dignity of the assembly, and the holiness of the realm where God dwells. No one, in reading these passages, can but be impressed with the dignity and holiness they emphasise. There is, too, the thought of transparency in a world where things are so beclouded, where sin has come in, and where the features of the lie continue right through. John's ministry especially emphasises the truth over against that, the Lord in the gospel calling attention to the peculiar character of Satan as the source of the lie. All that stresses in our minds the importance of transparency in the assembly. Transparent conditions are suggested in what is excluded from the city and by the presence of God and the Lamb being there. In @1 Corinthians 5 the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth is stressed. All that bears upon the part we have in the administrative side in the assembly. In @Acts 5 we see the way it comes into the primary setting of things in the assembly, and it is seen finally in Revelation. We have in @Acts 5 an act of discipline, or government, which is unrepeated. It is unique in its setting and is to impress us with the greatness of the presence of God in the assembly.
F.M. Are you referring to verse 4, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God"
S.McC. Just so. It is first said, "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit, and put aside for thyself a part of the price of the estate"
{169}
(verse 3). We are in the presence of a direct attack of Satan upon the economy as it is seen in relation to the assembly and the way God is viewed in it. It is rather significant that we should have such an early attack, a direct, frontal attack, by Satan on the position.
W.H. Was this attack not through a private household matter?
S.McC. Yes, it is rather humbling to see, in this man and his wife, the desire to emulate Barnabas to a certain extent, though retaining for themselves, with covetous hearts, part of the price. It shows the need for us to see carefully to our houses.
A.H. Would the word "his wife also being privy to it" (verse 2) have a practical bearing on us in these matters?
S.McC. Yes, it brings out the serious character of collusion in evil. It seems as if God is greatly displeased with this collusion in evil, especially over against what is said previously about the assembly. It says, "and the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one" (4: 32) as if the glory of the position is set out, and now the enemy moves against it through the collusion in evil with Ananias and Sapphira.
J.D. (Sen). Did not the enemy's attack in @Genesis 3 come through a man and a woman? He attacks, in the same way, the spiritual system which is established in the Acts.
S.McC. Just so. We see the same thing in operation here in the subtle way in which Satan works. Peter's word, "filled thy heart", is in great contrast to the section which brings before us persons filled with the Holy Spirit and the house being filled as we read in @Acts 2: 4. Satan attempts to counteract the position by filling their heart -- "Why has Satan filled thy heart?"
W.McK. Do you connect this action with ecclesiastical unrighteousness?
S.McC. Yes, because it is an assault on the assembly position. Satan is assailing the assembly position in all its pristine glory, marked by dignity and unity amongst the saints, as united in heart and soul. The enemy makes a direct attack on the position of the Holy Spirit who, as sent from heaven, has come into this subordinate position,
{170}
and is serving in obscurity in the economy; yet He is in a position of sovereignty and control in the assembly. The enemy moves against this in his attack on the economy in its features of grace and power seen in this section.
A.J.G. Is he not endeavouring to introduce principles of the world in covetousness and vain-glory? I was thinking that this particular attack on the assembly was not exactly the world, but the things of the world. Ananias and Sapphira endeavoured to introduce the things of the world into the assembly.
S.McC. It is very important to see that. Satan would corrupt that realm, and at the same time would assail the position divine Persons have taken in the economy. In the allusion " that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit ... Thou hast not lied to men, but to God" Peter discerns that the position of divine Persons in the economy is being assailed.
J.A.C. Is that why this man and woman were not given space for repentance?
S.McC. Yes. It is a unique case unrepeated in the history of the dispensation. It is brought forward, signally, to show us the greatness of the assembly realm and of divine Persons in it.
J.A.C. Peter was spiritually sensitive to see that it was Satan who was moving behind this man and woman.
S.McC. It is remarkable that in @Acts 10 Peter gets a word about Cornelius and the coming in of the Gentiles. Peter gets a vision, and the Spirit speaks to him giving him directions, but here Peter is acting in a discerning way. We can see how clear he is in regard to the assailing of the position.
J.S.E. Does his authority, as connected with the gift of the keys of the kingdom, show itself here?
S.McC. I think it does -- the power with which he meets it as well as the authority. The clearness of his statements, "Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit, and put aside for thyself a part of the price of the estate?", impresses us with the greatness of what is in this realm -- divine Persons are in it and people like ourselves as representing God. Peter was an apostle and in that way unique and distinct.
{171}
R.B. Do we have what is parallel in @Joshua 7 in connection with Achan and his dissembling?
S.McC. You have the principle of the world encroaching on a person there, but there is the humbling side involving Joshua and the people, and this has to be faced. God passes Joshua through humbling exercise, but in this instance Peter is in power as meeting the thing himself, being filled with the Holy Spirit.
A.J.G. Does @1 Corinthians 3: 17 link with this, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy"?
S.McC. Yes, the principle might enter here although Ananias and Sapphira were believers. In @1 Corinthians 3 it is an unbeliever that is in mind in the *full* application of the scripture. That principle of course should govern us in our concern for the realm of God.
P.L. Is Peter again realising the order given to him in @Matthew 14: 29? Is he walking on the water with Christ in great power? Allusion is made even to his shadow in verse 15 of this chapter. Do these early chapters present him thus?
S.McC. Just so. The dignity that marks Peter in the Acts is impressive -- one who made so many mistakes in the gospels. He reminds us of what enters into our own histories, yet how strong he is and what dignity marks him in the opening of the Acts!
A.P.C.L. Would what he says in chapter 5: 4, "While it remained did it not remain to thee? and sold, was it not in thine own power?", show that, before these matters come to light, there is a period in which opportunity is afforded to do what is right? Would "having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles" suggest the bringing out of things in public, and that is when discernment is called for?
S.McC. What you refer to is very interesting. "While it remained did it not remain to *thee*? and sold, was it not in thine own power? Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God." The matter is being brought out. There is an intensification of that thought in this chapter in verse 7, "And it came to pass about three hours afterwards, that
{172}
his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. And Peter answered her, Tell me if ye gave the estate for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much. And Peter said to her, Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?" Peter brings out the collusion; he discerns that something is wrong and he brings it out into expression.
Rem. Should we be marked by zeal for God? I am impressed with the words, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God".
S.McC. We are being helped to see the dignity of the assembly realm, and that it is God's realm. It is not our realm exactly; it is not our assembly; it is God's assembly. All the exercises that have arisen in recent years have borne upon this, the dignity and the holiness of the assembly as God's realm. It is divine property.
A.H. Would it help to bear in mind that it is a recovered man who is standing so definitely for God, having thoroughly judged these elements in his own heart?
S.McC. It shows what grace has done in Peter, and the power that marks him as used by the Spirit and as filled with the Spirit.
W.S. Would our knowledge of God and seeing God, as referred to in @Exodus 24: 10, "and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the form of heaven for clearness", help us to discern such features?
S.McC. Yes, that is God in His own realm; God in the scene above and what marks Him there, and those that stand related to Him in the scene below. It is God in His own realm, "there was under his feet as it were". Think of Him, as in @Acts 5, down here in the assembly and the enemy assailing the position, making a direct attack on the economy. It is to be noticed that, in John's gospel, where the Lord Jesus is referred to as the "sent one", and where His place in the economy as "sent" is stressed, the Spirit is very careful to guard His Deity. The scriptures generally are very careful to guard His Deity. And so in Acts, where the Spirit is viewed as sent from heaven and in a subordinate position in the economy, His Deity is constantly asserted.
{173}
C.M.M. Is there a lesson for the young men in this passage? They seem to know what should be done, and it would be a lifelong lesson to them. They would have to go through with it.
S.McC. Just so, and what an impression should be left on the hearts and minds of the younger men as to the greatness of this realm and how evil is dealt with in it. It is not an ordinary realm, it is a realm where divine Persons are, and not to be entrenched upon by evil.
J. Van. S. Is Peter dealing with the mystery of iniquity that has encroached on the divine realm?
S.McC. The mystery of iniquity is not so much seen here, although you might get the principle of it. The principle is beginning to operate, of course, and comes into it in different ways. Paul would say, "The mystery of lawlessness already works" (@2 Thessalonians 2: 7).
F.B.W. Would the effect of this be that these matters are carried into the household? After the apostles had been released from prison it says, "And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they ceased not teaching and announcing the glad tidings that Jesus was the Christ" (@Acts 5: 42).
S.McC. It shows the importance of our houses being kept in right relation to the things of God. What is so affecting is that, despite the enemy having found an entrance into these two, the brethren are unified (verses 11 -- 13).
A.R. When Ananias heard the word that Peter spoke, he fell down, as though God comes in to support Peter's word and He acts directly. It seems to be a remarkable action.
S.McC. It is very notable that we have two outstanding evidences of divine intervention in relation to Peter's speaking. We have that marvellous divine intervention in @Acts 10, "While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word" (verse 44). Here it does not say having *heard* these words, but "Ananias, *hearing* these words, fell down and expired." The government of God would enter into it.
P.L. Would the three hours which Sapphira was given additionally to repent be granted to her in God's ordering
{174}
circumstantially in the light of the three hours of darkness of the Lord's abandonment who alone keeps us in the path of repentance?
S.McC. That would come into our minds. It is very interesting that Peter did not go out and look for her; it says, "not knowing what had happened, came in" (@Acts 5: 7). We are to notice that the matter is dealt with in the assembly realm. Peter does not go out to Sapphira and take the matter up with her. He waits until she comes in and then brings out the matter of collusion. We are in a realm where things are being dealt with in divine power, the power of the Spirit.
W.S.S. Does this raise an issue with us as to whether, in the assembly realm, we are really living in the knowledge and love of divine Persons? We have to be sensitive as to what comes in.
S.McC. Quite so. Mr. Raven said of the lake of fire that it was a necessity of God's love. Perhaps we might not be inclined to think of it in that light. The judicial glory that appears here and the severity of the governmental act of God is a necessity of His love, because of the greatness of the realm and of His presence in it.
A.R. You pointed out that Peter does not go out to find Sapphira, but allows things to come to light. Have you something in mind to help us as to ferreting out evil?
S.McC. That is an important principle; evil is allowed to expose itself. The Lord waited on Judas and the evil eventually came out and exposed itself. We may rest assured that if any one of us, in our links with the saints in the light of the assembly, is going on with evil secretly espoused, it will come out. We are not to ferret it out; that is not our business, but we get power and help to deal with evil when it comes out.
C.M.M. When the matter of untruthfulness arises in a locality, should we not be careful to ascertain the actual facts? Peter asks the question.
S.McC. Yes, he does not level a charge at Sapphira without bringing out the facts from her own mouth.
A.H. Does this link up with what Peter says in his 1st epistle? "For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God is come; but if first from us, what
{175}
shall be the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God?" (4: 17). You were referring to things being exposed ultimately.
S.McC. Yes, that would enter into it. We are reminded of the greatness of the assembly realm in that no one can interfere with or entrench upon that realm with impunity.
W.McK. Is it not very striking that they think of God in His own realm? While God actually deals with the evil, He waits until Peter brings it to light.
S.McC. It is interesting that, as we were saying earlier, Peter does not have a vision nor a direct word from the Spirit, but he sees what needs to be dealt with and acts accordingly, God coming in to support him in the action he takes.
G.R.C. Is there any link with this and the word to Timothy, "Those that sin convict before all" (@1 Timothy 5: 20)? This is apostolic and I wondered how far it might be extended. You were saying the other day that apostolic mandates were enshrined in the assembly. How far would that work out today?
S.McC. "Rebuking before all" is seen in the assembly today as the person is dealt with. It would involve separation and withdrawal from the person. Rebuke is administered in that way.
W.H. Would it seem that divine Persons are pleased with the fact that evil is met? In verses 11 and 12 of @Acts 5 there seems to be an increase in power and testimony.
S.McC. Yes, and it should be an encouragement to us in these days that we need not be afraid of meeting evil. The enemy might suggest we shall lose everything; we shall lose persons. The weakness, so prominent in Christendom, is because of an inability to deal with evil in its midst. In the assembly, where there is the light of divine Persons, there is ability and power to deal with evil as it comes in, leading to enlargement and prosperity in relation to the work of God.
A.E.M. Do you take it that, at this early stage, it was the custom to speak to the Holy Spirit? I was talking to a brother today who is liable to be lost on this question, and I would like to save him.
S.McC. I think it is evident that Peter had to do with
{176}
the Spirit in the words that are referred to in @Acts 10. The voice speaks to him, "And there was a voice to him, Rise, Peter, slay and eat" (verse 13). And Peter replies saying, "In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common or unclean. And there was a voice again the second time to him, What God has cleansed, do not thou make common" (verse 15). And verse 19, "But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him ... " It is quite apparent that the voice that came to him was the voice of the Spirit.
A.E.M. Yes, quite so, and it says, "Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?" (@Acts 5: 3).
S.McC. That clearly shows the Spirit is viewed objectively as a Person thus to be regarded and addressed.
W.L. Is it striking in @Acts 10: 21 that not only did the Spirit of God speak to Peter but the Spirit of God says "I have sent them" in referring to the men sent from Cornelius?
S.McC. If this were better understood, persons would have less difficulty or no difficulty at all about this matter, "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?"
C.M.M. "Lied *to* him." The lie would refer to what was expressed.
S.McC. Just so. You made a good reference some days ago as to what had helped you. I believe it was the verse in @Acts 15 where the apostles and elders say, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (verse 28), showing that He must have been conferred with or consulted. Generally in business if a person is with you in what you are doing, you consult or confer with him. Am I right in saying that?
C.M.M. Yes. Unless I had conferred with a person, I would not know what he thought. It says, "For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us", suggesting that the assembly had conferred with the Holy Spirit.
S.McC. Just so. @Acts 5: 11 -- 14 says, "And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they
{177}
were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, but of the rest durst no man join them, but the people magnified them; and believers were more than ever added to the Lord)." Think of the situation here! On the one hand the greatness and attractiveness of the position, yet on the other the repelling power in regard to evil.
Rem. Does the way in which Sapphira answers Peter's question in verse 8 of @Acts 5 suggest a sister speaking in the assembly?
S.McC. If something had to be brought out and there was no other way of doing so, there would be liberty for that. But the position as to sisters would generally be governed by Paul's word that the women are to be silent in the assemblies.
P.L. Does Peter's activity here, apostolically and judicially, in an inferential way, suggest that the assembly had not yet been set up under Paul's ministry as a deliberative body in localities to investigate matters and arrive at a moral judgment?
S.McC. Just so. Paul's ministry comes in later to regulate things over against what we have in this section. It says, "and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them", but under Paul's ministry we become regulated, holding what we have in the light of stewardship.
J.S.E. Your allusion yesterday to what was inaugural marks this as to detail, but the principle of guarding jealously what pertains to God's realm goes on.
S.McC. Just so, and there should be with us constant concern that the greatness and holiness of the assembly realm, the vessel of praise, should be kept clean and free from all defiling influences.
T.M. It says here that Sapphira came in, "not knowing what had happened".
S.McC. Yes, that is interesting. They did not come in together. Sapphira came in three hours afterwards not knowing what had happened. If she had been more with her husband she would have known what had happened.
A.H. Would @Acts 5: 11 -- 16 in any way link up with @Matthew 18: 18, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven"?
{178}
S.McC. No doubt in the way believers were more than ever added to the Lord. Why does the Spirit of God use that expression, if it is not to impress us with the way heaven was supporting the position? Divine Persons were supporting the position and believers were more than ever added to the Lord. The passage in Revelation gives us the final side of things in the assembly, whereas in Acts we have the primary view of it in the inauguration of the dispensation. We need to understand, as we have been taught, that the assembly in principle goes right through and comes out in the millennial world. "And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it" (@Revelation 21: 27). This helps us to see that what obtained in a primary way in the beginning of the dispensation obtains in a final way as seen here.
A.H. I thought that was the ratification of it.
S.McC. What an attractive realm is suggested in the reference to the pearls and the twelve gates. You were referring earlier to love, and love amongst the saints is suggested in this great administrative system -- twelve gates, twelve pearls; "each one of the gates respectively was one pearl; and the street of the city pure gold, as transparent glass". That would mean unity in the working out of the administrative position. Wherever you look at the city, at whatever gate -- Glasgow, Bournemouth, or Edinburgh -- you see the same things among the brethren.
W.S.S. Does it also show the assembly is the place of light? In the 5th of Acts there was light and it exposed the position.
S.McC. Just so. If issues are raised as to the truth in one locality, it should not be said in another locality, Oh well, we do not take up these things. That would be a very serious matter, and an entrenchment on the greatness of the assembly realm, affecting the unity that marks it administratively.
W.S.S. In regard to the pearl, would you say that every administrative activity would reflect the lustre of the assembly, as suggested by the pearl being at the gate, the place of administration?
S.McC. I am sure it does. It is interesting to see how all these features are linked with the city in her
{179}
administrative glory as the Lamb's wife. Every feature of administrative glory appears in a perfect way in the holy city. It is important, in dealing with evil and matters related to the truth, that we should be united.
P.L. Is there fresh testimony as to the greatness of this vessel in the angels, unjealously (these distinguished beings) being content to be door-keepers at the gates of this glorious vessel? Would it also suggest that in all our meetings, administratively, we are assured angelic care?
S.McC. Yes, it does.
E.G.J. Does @John 20 bring us to this point when it says, "the doors being shut"? The kingdom line you have been bringing before us is so followed up that we enjoy now the greatness of these things referred to in the Revelation.
S.McC. Just so. It is needful to keep out any influences that would intrude; hence the importance of unity in the teaching and in the ministry as bearing on the assembly. Unity is essential, too, in administration. We are not to be lax in one locality as to features of lawlessness and evil, but there should be unity among the brethren in the way in which matters are met.
Rem. What kind of things have you in mind?
S.McC. In the matter of addressing the Spirit, why should there be some who say, when things are taken up in one locality, Oh well, we do not take it up in *our* locality? That is a denial of the twelve gates and the twelve pearls. We should also be united in our judgment of evil, such as unions, or unholy associations, radios and wireless, or smoking. Wherever there is opposition to the truth, whether or not it is energetic, there should be unity among the brethren in dealing with it.
A.P.C.L. The street of the city is said to be *one* street.
S.McC. That would intensify our references to our moving together in things. There is only one street.
A.P.C.L. And it is pure gold. Previously it is said to be as transparent glass. Would the gold suggest our moving together as united in relation to what God is as "our God"?
S.McC. Very good. The gold would remind us of the divine nature, divine righteousness, and that we are in a
{180}
realm where things are of God and according to His standards.
L.E.S. In 1st Corinthians Paul links the assembly of God which is in Corinth with "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours", and then he says, "Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion" (@1 Corinthians 1: 10).
S.McC. How important it is that there should be unity among us in relation to matters involving the administrative position.
C.A.M. In the practical bearing of these matters, is it significant that they brought the sick out into the streets that the shadow of Peter might fall on them? Would that be an action of earnest care? Sometimes we say we must wait for a certain thing to become overt or reach some proportions before we actually take it up.
S.McC. Yes, silent opposition is just as serious as active opposition; it is all opposition. We might say it is not active, but even if it is silent it is opposition nevertheless.
W.S.S. Does this matter of unity involve the principle of leadership? I may not see things, but I have brethren in whom I can trust and I can move with them.
S.McC. That is set out in @Acts 15 in the lead that is given in dealing with the matter and how unity is preserved.
C.M.M. Would the principle of imitation seen with the Thessalonians help us to come into uniformity? They were imitators of the assemblies and became models to all that believed in Macedonia and Achaia. If we see a meeting going on well, do we do well to take account of that?
S.McC. Just so. The Thessalonians were remarkably affected by the example set by the assemblies in Judea.
J.S.E. Would these principles of unity and leadership be seen in Nehemiah? Would unity in administration be seen when "all the people gathered together as one man in the open place that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe" (@Nehemiah 8: 1)? It then goes
{181}
on to say, "And the ears of the people were attentive to the book of the law" (verse 3).
S.McC. Yes, in the type that illustrates the unity of which we are speaking.
H.McL. Does this matter of localities raise the question of good elders? In Titus it says, referring among other things to their qualifications, "clinging to the faithful word according to the doctrine taught, that he may be able both to encourage with sound teaching and refute gainsayers" (@Titus 1: 9).
S.McC. Very good. I am sure that the principle of elderhood is important in our localities, especially the positive feature of encouraging as well as that of refuting gainsayers. We see the double feature of their service there.
A.C.S.P. In that connection it refers in @Revelation 21: 27 to that which maketh a lie. Would you connect that with @Acts 20, as to the propriety of things which the elders were to suggest?
S.McC. No doubt, because it would represent the making. It says, "Nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it". The perverted things that are referred to in @Acts 20 show how untruthfulness may enter into that kind of movement.
A.C.S.P. Is the truth with a twist a perverted thing and more dangerous because of that?
S.McC. If the truth is turned round we might say it is in some way perverted. It is wrought upon and changed, which makes it very serious. Two things are outstandingly serious in the history of the assembly. One is collusion, and the other parties. In Acts the outstanding sin is collusion as implied in Ananias and Sapphira. In Corinth the outstanding sin is schism or party features.
G.R.C. Does the name of our Lord Jesus Christ have a great bearing on the character of unity of which you are speaking? The apostle speaks "of all that in every place call *on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ*" (@1 Corinthians 1: 1) and verse 10, "I exhort you, brethren, by *the name of our Lord Jesus Christ*, that ye all say the same thing", and in chapter 5, "I, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present, to deliver, *in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ*" (verse 3). Would that be a very
{182}
important thing to keep before us? The Lord speaks of gathering together to my name.
S.McC. I think it is. It is interesting how "the name" comes in in these references to which you draw attention. We do not think sufficiently of the greatness of the Name and what is linked with it. It means that the Lord is not here, He has gone on high, but the Name is here. How great it is and what authority and power are linked with it.
J.S.E. Does the preposition "in" in chapter 5 in relation to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ involve what you are saying?
S.McC. Yes. It is a preposition involving power, "For I, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present, to deliver, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". Of course this is an apostolic act and is unique, but the principle of the spirit being saved in the day of the Lord Jesus is important. In executive action in the assembly, involving withdrawal from persons, we never have anything less in mind than the carrying of the persons through, even to the day of the Lord Jesus. We know that this man is saved before that according to the second letter.
Rem. Why is it the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and not the power of the Spirit here?
S.McC. I think he is stressing the full glory and dignity of the administrative position. While the Spirit is not formally referred to, He is here in full representation of the authority and power that are at the right hand of God.
J.S.E. Is it to emphasise the precious fulness connected with Christ our passover?
S.McC. How important it is that we should be built up constitutionally in regard to the administrative side. It says in verses 6 -- 8, "Your boasting is not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Purge out the old leaven that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth." How important it is that we should be free from any trace of malice or wickedness and that we should feed on the
{183}
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, Christ our passover having been sacrificed.
J.M. May I ask as to this two-fold presentation of Paul's spirit, "I ... present in spirit", and "ye and my spirit being gathered together"?
S.McC. Verses 3 and 4 bring out the uniqueness of the apostolic position, and we must always remember the glory of the apostolic position. Delivering him, "to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus", is clearly an allusion to the apostolic side. Paul is showing how he is with the brethren in what has to be done.
J.M. And by extension would it be right for us to have the spirit of this on such occasions; that is, Paul's teaching and what he represents in these matters?
S.McC. I doubt if we could carry it forward into our day, except that the principle of Paul's ministry governs us in regard to assembly matters. Paul has the first word in regard to assembly matters, because he gives us the assembly formally and his word would govern us in regard to assembly action.
A.J.G. Would you say that, although the apostles are no longer with us, we still have the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power and authority connected with it?
S.McC. How great that is! The Name is still here and the Spirit is still here, so that we can, in dealing with evil in a day of brokenness, as acting in the light of the assembly move according to @2 Timothy 2 and apply what is indicated to us in the teaching here.
L.E.S. Would not the matter of Christ our passover be the basis for the working out of every administrative matter and would not that enter into the matter of ecclesiastical righteousness?
S.McC. Do you think it suggests dealing with things in a feeling way as having a constitution nourished and built up in this kind of food?
L.E.S. That is exactly what I am thinking and it leads to liberty.
S.McC. What it cost Christ!
The whole chapter is to remind us of the dignity of the assembly as we spoke of it in relation to @Acts 5 and
{184}
@Revelation 21. We must not minimise wickedness in stressing the glory and the grace of the dispensation. We must see to it that a full judgment of wickedness is maintained.
G.R.C. Is it important that the word "assembly" first occurs in @Exodus 12 in connection with the passover? Does it suggest that our basic setting together, assembly-wise, is on the basis of the moral judgment of evil seen in the death of Christ?
S.McC. It is interesting that it is mentioned in @Exodus 12.
A.P.C.L. Is verse 6 humbling in that Paul has to say, "Do ye not know that a *little* leaven"?
S.McC. It is indeed. It is remarkable how he speaks in that way, "A little leaven leavens the whole lump".
A.C.P.L. We are prone to say, This is a small thing, but then the matter circulates and persons become disaffected by it.
S.McC. Just so, and how serious the disaffection becomes. It is remarkable how Paul stresses the character of the sin here. He says, "and ye are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you" (verse 2), and again further down, "him that has so wrought this; to deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan" (verse 4).
W.H. Would the severity of the matter of which you spoke previously be seen in verse 13, where the person is referred to as a wicked person? While we would hold such a brother in affection in family relations, this is a public matter associated with sin.
S.McC. Just so. Matthew would regulate us as to that. John's ministry would help us as to our basic links in the family of God, and Matthew's ministry would regulate us as to the judicial side; he is to be unto us as one of the nations (@Matthew 18: 17).
A.H. Would you say that the apostle's word in chapter 5, verse 8 is to encourage us to eat the sin offering in the holy place?
S.McC. Just so.
A.J.G. The effect of having to deal with evil is that we become more exercised, not simply for a particular
{185}
occasion or for a short time, but we are permanently developed in the maintenance of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. The feast of unleavened bread was for a full seven days.
S.McC. That is important. It is not just for a particular occasion, but we are maintained in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
G.M.S. Do you think we would normally shrink from that which works an abomination or maketh a lie, but John adds, "nothing common"? It is only continual feasting on unleavened bread that prevents us from dropping down to the level of what is common.
S.McC. So that we are to see the dignity of the assembly realm and how sins vary. They are not all to be classified under the same heading. The holiness of God in the assembly realm is entrenched upon by the kind of sin that we have here. The recent reference to grace and repentance and forgiveness is not in any way to minimise in our minds and souls wickedness and evil.
T.M. Would you say that the judgment of evil is a divine necessity in view of the service of God?
S.McC. Yes. There may be cases when we cannot do other than withdraw because of the nature and character of the evil. That is not quite the normal side, as forgiveness is usually extended where repentance exists, but there may be cases where we have no other course open to us, but, in the light of @1 Corinthians 5, to clear the Lord's name and the public position.
W.H. Has this not been referred to under the expression, 'capital sin'?
S.McC. Just so. I suppose every sin and the persons involved would be considered separately according to the facts which governed each case.
DIVINE OPERATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY READING (5)
@John 4: 1 -- 30; @John 20: 1 -- 18
S.McC. I thought that, this morning, we should look at certain features of the service of God in relation to the
{186}
assembly. This subject is brought up in connection with these two women in John's gospel, and one is concerned, in view of what was said last night, that we should approach it not so much in a doctrinal manner, but from the side of spiritual power. We would not in any sense minimise the importance of doctrine, for the Lord Himself says in this gospel, "My doctrine is not mine, but that of him that has sent me" (@John 7: 16). It is thought, however, that we might get help in approaching our subject from the side of spiritual feeling and power, having in mind the teaching that comes out in the Lord's service to these women. In @John 4 it is brought in by the Lord in such an informal yet remarkable way. It is noteworthy that the Spirit is stressed at this particular juncture as the thought of the service of God is approached. Power is needed for this, and we are all tested as to just what we have reached in the way of experience in the conscious sense of the Spirit being with us and in us, and whether we make room for Him and the great order of things suggested in the "springing up into eternal life". I thought we might get help in considering it this morning from this viewpoint and perhaps this afternoon we might see the assembly in relation to it in the different settings in the epistles.
A.E.M. Is the approach in John's gospel on the basis of the family of God?
S.McC. Yes. It is remarkable how John would impress us with the thought of the family of God right from the outset. His distinctive touches regarding it contrast with the synoptic gospels in a remarkable way.
A.E.M. Would you say that we have to approach the service of God having in mind our relations with one another in the family of God?
S.McC. Just so. Love comes into John's writings in such a wonderful way as it is seen in divine Persons and in the family of God. We shall never arrive at the truth rightly unless we do so from this basis, because the thought of the family of God promotes confidence in one another and strengthens our links with one another.
L.E.S. Might I read the verse I think you are alluding to? "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his
{187}
name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God" (@John 1: 12 -- 13).
S.McC. That is a very striking expression and we should note the word "Exousia" in the footnote. This is a remarkable word because it would seem as if, from the standpoint of what was moving in Jerusalem in relation to the Lord's presence and ministry, the Spirit of God would emphasise the legality of the position of the family of God. Whatever the Jews, the priests and the levites may take away from them, the Spirit of God emphasises the legality of the position of the family of God.
-- .G. Is there a fine distinction between "flesh's will" and "man's will", the second perhaps being more difficult to be relieved of in regard to the service of God?
S.McC. It is important that we should see the fine distinctions made by John. We would have put them all together, but John says; "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". I think it is important to see how 'will', in whatever way it may be viewed, is put out of court in the light of the family of God. In considering the worship of God in @John 4, the Lord's words to the woman would impress us with the necessity for a right apprehension of Christ objectively coupled with a right apprehension and a conscious enjoyment of the Spirit, as in the living water. John the Baptist's reference to Christ in the end of chapter 3 is unique. He is a man whose joy is fulfilled, and we are thus in the presence of something that is completed. It was said of John the Baptist, when in his mother's womb, that the babe leaped for joy as Elizabeth saluted Mary, the mother of our Lord, but here we are in the presence, not of the beginning of his joy, but of its completion in the introduction of the bride and the bridegroom. The bride has an essential part in regard to the service of God, but in John's ministry it is introduced informally. An allusion was made last night to the way in which John refers to it and how it forms a special part of his ministry, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom".
A.J.G. Is it not characteristic of John's ministry that he gives us the truth informally? Without exactly naming it, he gives us the thing vitally in the power of the Spirit.
{188}
S.McC. That helps us today in our approach to the service of God as seen in connection with the assembly, because we are so inclined to approach it from an academic standpoint, whilst John emphasises the great matter of life.
A.H. Do you think that John, in bringing in the family, has in mind to sweep away the ecclesiastical system so that God may be ministered to according to Himself?
S.McC. Just so. We were speaking of ecclesiastical unrighteousness, and righteousness yesterday. We can see in @John 1 how the counter-movements from Jerusalem are baffled by what is coming in from heaven. They do not understand and are in perplexity as to what the truth is. The Spirit of God, through John the evangelist, stresses the legal position of the family of God, the children of God.
G.R.C. It seems striking that the worship of the Father and of God, in this chapter and in chapter 20, is communicated to a woman, where the Lord says, "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God" (@John 20: 17). Could you help us as to the thought of the family and the idea of a woman coming in?
S.McC. I think there is something to be noted in the fact that the most wonderful touches as to the service of God and the worship of God come to us through the Lord's service to two women, one of whom He serves as a Prophet and the other as a Teacher, "Rabboni". We are not seeking to discredit the twelve in any sense, but it is illuminating that, in John's ministry, which bears on the last days, the official element is not in the foreground, but rather what is informal and unofficial, as suggested in these two women who remind us of the assembly.
A.J.G. Are you suggesting that affection, as suggested in a woman, is a necessary basis for the truth, but affection that needs to be delivered from an unlawful object and centred on a lawful object, that is Christ? Her affections become governed by the intelligence the teacher would afford.
S.McC. That is exactly what is in mind. The introduction of the woman in @John 4, immediately following @John 3, is significant on account of the unique reference
{189}
to Jesus in verse 1 of chapter 4. It is unique. John has not used the word "Lord" before, "When therefore the *Lord*". Others call Him "Rabbi" and speak to Him in that light, but in chapter 3: 35, it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", which indicates that the economy in a formal way, and administration are committed to the Son. It then says, "When therefore the *Lord* knew". That is, we get the administrative side impressed on our minds which is followed by the woman coming into our view.
G.R.C. Is your thought that the Lord's service, in a prophetic way, disentangles the woman, sets her affections on a legitimate object, and makes way for the positive teaching of @John 20?
S.McC. Just so. We shall never arrive at the fulness of the truth as to the worship of God, unless Christ personally and objectively, and the Spirit, have a right place in our affections and in our minds. Mr. Taylor, years ago, in referring to John the Baptist's statement, "he that has the bride is the bridegroom", asked how the bride came in? Did she come in through baptism or through the Lord's supper? She comes in through the apprehension of the greatness of Christ and the power of the Spirit. John the Baptist's testimony bearing on the greatness of Christ is followed by what we have in @John 4. "Come see a man", shows how that Man eclipsed the woman's affections -- that is Christ Himself. Then there is the living water; the Spirit in His energetic movements and service to us, having in mind the order of things indicated in eternal life and the worship of God.
P.L. "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (@Ephesians 2: 18). This would help us in seeing that the greatness of Christ and the greatness of the Spirit are essential to the service of God.
S.McC. Yes. @Ephesians 2 reminds us of the mediatorial system, and John's gospel shows the essential need of that system. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth." That verse brings out the necessity for the mediatorial system, and the mediatorship of Christ which is referred to so much in this gospel.
{190}
A.E.M. Would you say that we must come under the operations of the economy before we can worship God in the full light of His revelation? I am alluding to @John 3: 34, "for God gives not the Spirit by measure".
S.McC. Yes, I think what you say is important: the whole economy has been designed that we might know the God whom we worship. The relations the economy brings before us are that we should know the God whom we worship. That is why God has come out in these specified relations indicated in the Father and the Son.
W.S.S. Do we have a wonderful outline in this section of the operations in the economy: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the man and the woman, the bride and the bridegroom?
S.McC. We do. It is unique here. As John opens his gospel he would impress us with the way God has tangibly come within our range. God is a Spirit and this necessitates the mediatorial system. What comes to light in it is that God has drawn near so as to be apprehended and known in a tangible way. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (@John 1: 18) has in mind that we should know God tangibly and this reference, "the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life", stresses tangibility in the Spirit.
W.S.S. I was thinking of what was remarked as to the necessity of our spirits entering into these things in view of the service of God.
S.McC. That is why John writes so distinctively of the unique place Christ has in sonship and all the spiritual excellence that is linked with it as in @John 1: 18, and here in the reference to the living water becoming in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life. We are tested as to what we know of God come so near to us tangibly in the economy.
A.P.C.L. In verse 15 the matter is exceedingly attractive to the woman. As a result of the Lord's presentation of the water she desires it, and it is not until that point that He raises other matters with her.
S.McC. It is very interesting, showing how the moral question must come up. It is important to recognise that
{191}
in most cases where there is disaffection as to the truth, a moral issue underlies, and I am sure that the Lord would help us to be like this woman and be affected by things tangibly. We are so prone, I speak for myself, to approach the worship of God from an academic standpoint and to try to work out things just from the principle of light. That is important, but we want to get an impression as to the tangibility of God who, although He is a Spirit, has come within our range in the mediatorial system in Christ as Man.
Rem. Does it appear from verses 11 and 12 that the woman is surrounded by that which would keep her at a distance from God?
S.McC. Just so. The service of the Lord Jesus here is to impress her with divine nearness.
J.S.E. I was thinking of your allusion to chapter 4, "when therefore the *Lord* ... " This word 'Sir' is the same is it not?
S.McC. It shows how the woman comes into line with what is in mind in the operation of the administration; there is a dignity about the Person which impresses us that the administration is in divine hands. Although this is faintly perceived by the woman to begin with, yet something is arrived at. She comes to more later.
C.M.M. What is the link between eternal life and the service of God?
S.McC. Eternal life has a relative position in connection with the service of God. That idea must underlie the service of God, as the service of God involves a living state of things. That life not only affects us operatively, but we are brought into a sphere of life where the pressure of death is lifted off our spirits.
G.R.C. The great sphere of life in Genesis was not complete until the man and the woman were there. Do you think the great sphere of eternal life, spiritually, requires, for its fulness, the man and the woman?
S.McC. It does. The woman is very interesting in that light, because Jerusalem comes up for review early in John. In the first chapter the Spirit of God, through John the evangelist, gives us a view of what exists there. In Nicodemus we get another view of the position, because
{192}
it reminds us of what is around. Where is the woman in what is around? The woman is left out.
H.S.M. Would you say a little more as to the tangibility of God? Are the three Persons in mind?
S.McC. I was only referring to the way in which God has come within our range in a tangible way in Christ as Man. The Spirit is suggested in the figure of the living water as something that can be felt and known as a real experience in our souls.
J.S.E. Does @1 John 1: 1 help, "that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life"?
S.McC. Just so; that enters into it. We are to see the greatness of Christ's Manhood. As Mr. Taylor has said, the eternal subsisting state between God and man exists in the revelation of God in a Man.
Rem. Are we specially tested when divine Persons require to be served, as here, the Lord asking, "Give me to drink"?
S.McC. Yes. His word is very interesting, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, *thou* wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". He reminds us here of His own seeking. Later He speaks of the Father seeking, but here *He* is seeking.
T.M. Is the word 'sent', used of John, important as set against what is accredited at Jerusalem?
S.McC. Yes. It stands related to what is apart from man. We read in regard to John the Baptist, "There was a man sent from God, his name John".
J.S.E. May we come back to this matter of what is tangible? What our brother has raised is in the mind of a good many. Does the word of John Baptist, "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him" (@John 1: 32), involve what you have said about tangibility?
S.McC. It shows how the Spirit was taken account of by John the Baptist, and was of course special to him. The Lord Jesus, in verse 18, is viewed as the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, and in verse 32 the Spirit is viewed, descending as a dove upon Jesus, upon the Son
{193}
of God. All that is to remind us of the way that God is coming within our range so as to be apprehended through these ways of approach.
A.J.G. Would not tangibility in regard of the Spirit lie in what He affords in ourselves in witness and in the springing up?
S.McC. That is what one is thinking of. This expression, "springing up" is what is within us -- tangibility is there. It is a known, real, and felt presence and power. It is not just a matter of light or what is academic, but a real felt and known power in us to help us in regard to the service of God.
E.J.B. The inward enjoyment of that turns our hearts towards the God who has come within our range in that way in the power of the Spirit.
A.E.M. In speaking of tangibility, have we not to bear in mind that the incarnation of Christ is the central feature of the revelation?
S.McC. That is true. Everything hinges on the incarnation, and the Spirit's movements, as sent from heaven, have to be taken account of in its light. The Lord is not said to be sent from heaven, but the Spirit is sent from heaven, and that has to be understood in the light of the incarnation.
M.A.W. Is the reality of the incarnation seen in verse 6 where He is said to be, "wearied with the way he had come", and yet it says, "he sat just as he was"?
S.McC. Just so. We are reminded of the reality of His humanity, the reality of it. Yet this great Person who is before us in John's gospel, is the One who is referred to in chapter 1 -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". He is seen as having become flesh, and here in the reality of His humanity. How it should affect our hearts! We must always remember, however, that in the light of John's ministry and of the scriptures, He retains His absoluteness.
W.W.S. Does @Luke 24 in any way bear on what you say, "being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit" (verse 37)? Is tangibility stressed there and the truth of the incarnation brought in?

S.McC. That shows how substantial are the things that have come within our range in divine movements. We are not dealing with things in the air, but they are seen in a substantial way, supremely in Christ. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
G.R.C. In his first epistle John says, "That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, that which we contemplated, and our hands handled". That would relate to tangibility and is based on the incarnation.
S.McC. Just so. It is alluded to in the life that has come into testimony in Jesus, as He is viewed in Manhood in His relations with the Father. "The eternal life which was with the Father." It is the uniqueness of what was seen in Jesus in Sonship as a Man here.
A.H. John the Baptist speaks of a Man who is preferred before him, and goes on later to speak of, "He must increase". Would you think the woman, in her spiritual history, has come to the supremacy of Christ?
S.McC. Yes, "Come see a man". We are reminded of what has come within our range. John presents to us, God coming within our range in Christ as Man, and yet while Christ comes into Manhood, it is essential to see that, according to the scriptures, He retains His absoluteness.
F.M. I was wondering, in connection with Mr. M.'s remark as to the incarnation, if verses 14 -- 18 would give us the truth of what we are seeking to enquire into? "The Word became flesh", and verse 18 "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", would cover the truth as to the incarnation.
A.E.M. When we speak of tangibility we must have the incarnation of Christ before us, because everything that can be made known of God is seen in Him.
S.McC. It is important that we should see that God is known in a Man, and will be known eternally in a Man. The position will not be in any way changed in eternity. The subsisting state and condition and relations between God and men will all hinge on His revelation in the Man to whom we are alluding.
{195}
L.E.S. Would @Colossians 2: 9 fit in with this? "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."
S.McC. Just so, reminding us of the greatness of what is there in Christ. The greatness of what was here as presented in chapter 1, is not necessarily for our apprehension, but it was there; the fulness was pleased to dwell in Him. Chapter 2 of Colossians in the added word, 'bodily' particularly alludes to what has come within our range so that, in so far as we can, we might apprehend it.
A.A. Does the apostle express it in @1 Timothy 3: 16, "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory"?
S.McC. Just so. We are to be impressed especially from John's standpoint with that which would help us in the service of God and how God has come within our range. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him." It is not just to affect our minds, but to affect us feelingly. Our affections are to be stimulated in the manner in which God has come into these relations in a tangible way in Christ who is the only-begotten and the object of divine affection. God has come near to us in these tangible relations that we might know Him thus.
F.M. In @John 3: 35, it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand. He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life". Believing and subjection seem to be the link between what you have referred to in chapter 1 and what follows.
S.McC. Yes. The footnote (1) as to 'subject' is important especially stressing what one has in mind. It says, 'it is the obedience of submission to His person, not practical obedience to His commands, whatever proof this may be of the other, but it is not exactly the same thing as believing on Him as an Object revealed in grace'. It is the Person. If we are to take up the worship of God, we should be affected by these two great features -- the greatness of the Person of Christ in Manhood (God
{196}
apprehended in relation to that) and the greatness of the Spirit in the economy, typified in the living water which becomes a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.
A.P.C.L. In verse 14 it says, "shall become in him". Would that suggest a certain amount of responsibility on our part to make way for the Spirit?
S.McC. Just so. Think of the mystery surrounding and entering into this! What can we say about it! He says, "the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water". Something transpires, tangibly known and felt in our souls, "shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life". When we think of what the Spirit of God has in mind in the type, it surely must affect our souls in this inward matter.
A.P.C.L. I was thinking they were self reacting, for submission to His Person must be the result of making full way for the operations of the Spirit.
S.McC. Yes, we can see how they are interrelated.
G.M.S. Does the Lord bring the two points together in verse 10 at the beginning of this conversation, as He also would with us -- "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is"?
S.McC. We are constantly cast back upon the greatness of this Person. John the Baptist says, "He who comes from above is above all. He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks as of the earth. He who comes out of heaven is above all" (@John 3: 31). This is unique and is not in the synoptic gospels. John the Baptist -- who belongs to another dispensation -- is a man who is filled with the greatness of this Person who has come into such a lowly subordinate position in the economy, yet never ceases to be what He always was.
W.S.S. Is the woman brought before us as indicating one (possibly the assembly) who enters into those great thoughts?
S.McC. That is what is in mind. The assembly enters into our thoughts in this reference to the woman. We have a sinful history, but this chapter contemplates, in figure, redemption as taking full account of and dealing with sinful history in the members of the assembly. We are thus set free for the enjoyment of the heavenly order of
{197}
things indicated in eternal life and the presentation of the knowledge of God.
W.S.S. When the Lord converses in verse 21, He says, "woman", not now "the woman". Is it not suggestive of the end of His service being reached?
S.McC. Quite. The Spirit would help us to understand how, underlying this, there is the great thought of redemption which frees us from sinful history, enabling us to enter upon this great order of life that links with the service of God.
W.McK. Would you say why water is mentioned before the blood in chapter 6?
S.McC. We are concerned here with the great necessity for inward deliverance, and known power in regard to a sinful state which would hold us. The woman is a type of members of the assembly who have had a history of sin, but redemption frees them from that sinful history and the Spirit is received, and in known power, frees us for the heavenly order of things that are in mind.
G.R.C. Is there any thought in the use of the word "draw"? The Lord does not do all the speaking, but draws out from persons what they have to say. Does that bear on our part in the service?
S.McC. Yes it does. It is interesting to see the skill of the Lord in that way and in the way he approaches the woman; how He answers her questions and meets her remarks. It says in verse 16, "Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband and come here". It is interesting to see what the Lord does here. He does not say, I will go with you, He says, "Go, call thy husband and *come here*". She is to come back to this particular point and the Lord has confidence that she will come back.
A.E.M. Would the scripture, "Blessed the pure in heart, for *they* shall see God" be illustrated in @John 4?
S.McC. Very good; the resolving of the moral state of this woman leads to that which comes out as to God, not only God in the specified relation into which He has come in the economy, but the great thought of God as involving all three Persons. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth." What effect these words must have had on that woman's mind!
{198}
A.E.M. Does John's gospel show us how we are to see God?
S.McC. Yes. We are to see God in Christ.
L.E.S. Holiness enters largely into this matter. "Pursue peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord" (@Hebrews 12: 14).
S.McC. Just so, the need of holiness is important. That is how the worship of God is brought before us here, the Lord as it were saying, We must have these questions resolved before the worship of God can be entered upon. The woman of course brings it up.
L.E.S. Does not the matter of holiness affect our spirits to a very large extent?
S.McC. It does and you feel that we shall never be in power in the service of God in the assembly unless holiness is present.
A.P.C.L. Are there not two words for worship in use in the New Testament, one involving personal homage and the other service?
S.McC. You are alluding to the difference between what we have in @Philippians 3 as to the general side of the service of God. Say something more about what is in your mind as to @John 4.
A.P.C.L. I wondered whether this act of personal homage and prostration needs to be understood by us when we are in the presence of God?
S.McC. I am sure it does, because God has in mind that, as coming within our range as a Man, we should be marked by the spirit of prostration or worship. "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."
-- .G. Would you say a word as to the bearing of what has been said as to tangibility, and God being a Spirit?
S.McC. I am glad you referred to that. There is another side which must be borne in mind in connection with the service of God in the assembly. Not only is there tangibility but spirituality. These are two great features in relation to the knowledge of God as having come out, and our drawing near to Him. God coming out involves the thought of what is tangible in the incarnation and Christ as Man. Our drawing near to God involves the presence of the Spirit and spirituality on our part as
{199}
making room for Him. "They who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." Tangibility does not militate against spirituality, nor does spirituality militate against tangibility. The two go together in regard to the worship of God.
J.S.E. Does that explain the usage of the words, "ye", "we" and then "they"? I was thinking of the way the Lord says, "*Ye* worship *ye* know not what; *we* worship what *we* know, for salvation is of the Jews". When He comes to the greatest of all matters, He says, "*they* who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth".
S.McC. That is suggestive, say something more.
J.S.E. I wondered if the Lord in ruling out both the mountain and Jerusalem, emphasises what you said earlier. He was insistent on this relationship with the Father in order to worship Him and the Lord says, "*Ye* worship *ye* know not what; *we* worship what *we* know". The contrast is between "ye" and "we", and when you come to the matter of God, it is neither "we" nor "ye" but "they". Is there not a sense in which the Lord would not use "we" when He speaks of God, because He himself knows full well that He is included in that title, so He says "they"?
S.McC. That is very interesting. The Lord says, "they who worship him"; He does not say "we who worship him", for we must at every turn have great regard for the Person of Christ. We would not refer to Him as a worshipper, because of who He is. What you say helps in that regard. These features of tangibility and spirituality are important in regard to the worship of God. If I might refer to the second verse of Hymn 8, which has been giving difficulty to some, 'Blest Son we adore Thee', it always has to be kept in mind that the worship of God involves two things -- tangibility and spirituality. God has come within our range in a Man and is known in a Man, and the Person who is before us as Man, is in Himself, God. Spirituality along with that thought, reminds us that God is a spirit and "they who worship him must worship him inspirit and in truth". From the standpoint of @John 4 we cannot be materialistic in our way of thinking or in our outlook.
{200}
V.T.S. Do those two things affect us in worship in relation to the love of God? In John's first epistle it says, "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only-begotten Son into the world" -- tangibility -- "that we might live through him" -- spirituality (@1 John 4: 9).
S.McC. Very good.
G.R.C. Mr. Taylor has said in connection with, "for in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily", that there is no hard and fast line between what is revealed and what is inscrutable.
S.McC. Just so. Spirituality enters into the worship of God. In @John 4 we have been stressing the idea of tangibility in relation to the incarnation and Christ in Manhood. That must be carried through and it will be carried through right into eternity. We shall never have to do with God apart from what is tangible in Christ as Man. Spirituality does not mean that we can enter into the depths of Deity as Christ as Man can enter into it, but that we worship according to what we know of God as having come within our range in revelation.
P.L. God is revealed in a Person who is infinite. Does that promote in us a sense of worship that gives tone and body to the service of God?
S.McC. Just so. We are always to be reminded of it and have it before us.
G.R.C. Would that bring about prostration? At the end of the service inaugurated by Solomon when the Ark was brought in, it says, "And all the children of Israel ... bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped and thanked Jehovah" (@2 Chronicles 7: 3).
S.McC. Very good, showing what was reached in regard to the service of God in those circumstances.
In @John 20 it is interesting to note the way in which Mary comes before us, and how Peter and John come into the matter. Mary is before them, but "She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him" (verse 2). She brings them into
{201}
it, "*We* know not where they have laid him". She is impressing on their minds what they do not know about what has transpired. Then Simon Peter and John move and what is said in verse 6 is remarkable, "Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying, and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself". We are again reminded of the uniqueness of Christ, and we have to keep it in mind. In verse 12 it says, "As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb, and beholds two angels sitting in white garments, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain". Why does it say this? It could have said, One at one end and the other at the other, but it says, "one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain". The head and the feet are mentioned. Then we have the Lord's approach to Mary which brings before us the wondrous and great light conveyed in the message.
H.McL. Would you say a word as to verse 17, as to the difference now made between "my God and your God"? I am not clear on the matter and many others are not. Perhaps we could have help. I understand the reference to "my God" has in mind the Lord speaking in Manhood, but in the reference to "your God", the three Persons are included.
S.McC. In the first place it is important to see that the Lord says, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father". We must not miss this out -- God known in this relation as Father. God has come into this specified relation in order that we might know Him in relation to His love. Then He says, "and to my God and your God". The Lord Jesus could speak of God first as "my Father" in a specified relation. Let that sink into our minds, because it helps in the understanding of the verse; He first refers to the appellation of God which draws attention to the specified relation into which He has entered. Then He says, "to my God". Think of the greatness of the Being who is before us to whom Christ alludes as "my God"! Involving the Name that covers the whole thought of the Deity -- "my God".
{202}
Then He says, "and your God". He is our God in this light. That is the God he refers to in @John 1: 18 who has come out, has been declared, and who is fully revealed in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. That is our God. The Person of the Father is before us in @John 20, but the Lord moves our thoughts, widening them out to the great appellation of God which covers the whole thought of the Deity and involves the three Persons.
A.J.G. Do you think that is referred to in @John 13: 3 where it says, "Jesus knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God"? Is that an allusion to this final part of the message, "to my God, and your God"?
S.McC. Just so. I think that helps and we need to be helped in regard to this, because so many difficulties are made in regard to this passage. Our earlier reference to tangibility and spirituality would help us in regard to this. While the Lord, in speaking as Man, says "my God", we must always remember that spirituality would take account of the inscrutability of His Person, for in the Mediator God is presented to us.
H.McL. Would it be going too far to ask which of the Persons in the Godhead was God to Christ in Manhood?
S.McC. That is putting the question in a confused kind of way. God was God to Christ in Manhood and if we think of the Father, and Christ speaking to Him as God, we have to bear in mind that it is God Himself. There is no difference between God in the pre-incarnate conditions of Deity and in Christ in Manhood, and what He will be eternally; it is the same God.
H.McL. Do you suggest then that the reference to "my God" is to the Father?
S.McC. It is God. Why should the Lord say "*and* my God"? He has already said, "I ascend to my Father, and your Father"; that is distinctly God in that specified relation as we know Him in that Person, but He goes on to say, "*and* my God". God is presented to us in the Father, but it is not God as limited to the Father, because as we said at the beginning, the Lord always retains His absoluteness and we must keep that in mind. When the Lord says, "my God" it is that Being, in all His greatness
{203}
and majesty whom He knew as no one else could know. I mean as to ourselves as creatures, because He is divine. He is a divine Person, and we are creatures with finite understandings.
A.E.M. I am convinced that the confusion that is in the minds of some of the brethren is in some way connected with the incarnation. The Lord in becoming Man did not cease to be what He was as God.
S.McC. That is important and is what is in mind in stressing that He retains His absoluteness. That is where the difficulty comes in; we would like to try and explain it, but we cannot explain it. Why should we try! If we try to explain it we may get beyond our depths. The fact is that Christ is Man, but He retains His absoluteness. While the Person of the Father is before us -- "my Father and your Father", and "my God" (Christ speaking as Man) -- we must keep the abstract side in mind. While He is before us as Man, abstractly He has part in Deity.
H.McL. My difficulty was "my God"; if we include the full thought of God there. In the Lord speaking as Man, it might be unsuitable to include the Lord Himself in that term. I am not against the thought of worshipping God as God.
S.McC. I think it is important that we should be clear as to that. The difficulty lies in regard to what is concrete and what is abstract. The Lord Jesus retains His absoluteness. In the Mediator we have not only Man viewed in relation to God in an exalted way, but God viewed in relation to Man. The greatness of His Person enters into Mediatorship, and while, as to condition, He is Man, in Person He is God, and we must keep that before us.
DIVINE OPERATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY READING (6)
@John 20: 17 -- 18; @Ephesians 3: 14 -- 21; @1 Corinthians 15: 24 -- 28
S.McC. These passages should serve to help us in relation to the knowledge of divine Persons as it bears on the service of God in the assembly. It will be noted that each passage commences with some thought in connection
{204}
with the Father and leads on to the fuller thought of God. We have been taught that the more we move on to the higher levels of the truth spiritually, the more God as God is before us. In @John 20: 17 Jesus says to Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God". The thought of "my Father, and your Father" is to stress nearness and intimacy with God in this relationship. When we come to "my God and your God" it is not so much to stress the thought of intimacy as in "my Father; and your Father", but the greatness of the Being who is before the Lord Jesus when He says, "my God, and your God". It is important to see that we approach God in this known relationship suggested in, "my Father, and your Father". Our relationship of sonship, alongside of Christ, gives us a wonderful sense of the nearness and intimacy in which we stand in relation to God in that special name and relationship of Father. "My God, and your God" brings us to the thought of Deity; not Deity, exactly, in Its own realm by Itself in absoluteness, but Deity -- God as He has drawn near to us in revelation.
G.R.C. Did you make a remark just now as to God the Supreme Being?
S.McC. "My God, and your God", would involve, I suppose, His supremacy, but there is something more than supremacy; God personally is there; God as He desires to be known by us in the blessedness of His being in so far as He can be known by us with creature and finite understanding.
C.M.M. Could we connect this with chapter 13? "He came out from God and was going to God" (verse 3).
S.McC. I think that fits in with what John has in mind. He alludes in @John 13 to both the Father and to God. We are helping one another in regard to this great matter, and the Spirit affords us latitude. The Comforter is with us, and we are arriving, together, at the truth in this relation.
A.E.M. Is the Lord taking us as far as it is possible to go?
S.McC. Very good. Many years ago you wrote to one as a young brother and said that, as regards soul progress
{205}
and knowledge of the truth, the Lord would take us as far as we wanted to go. That is what comes into this matter; the Lord is taking us as far as we can go.
-- .G. Does this reference to, "I ascend", indicate that the thought of "my God and your God" is above "my Father and your Father"?
S.McC. I would hesitate to use the word "above", as the Father remains in the inscrutability of Deity. The verse is progressive in the sense of widening our thoughts. It is not just the Deity as limited to the Father, if I may speak reverently, but it is the Deity in the full sense, inclusive of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
-- .G. I was just thinking of the service as we are privileged to know it and the way of reaching God at the end. That is really what is in my mind when using the word "above", but I did not like the word myself.
S.McC. Mr. Taylor used the word progression, indicating that it was on the ascending line; we are going up.
-- .G. I meant "above" in the sense of the ascent by which He went up.
J.S.E. Does it help us if we view the Lord's statement as coming from One who loves us and who knows the whole matter in its fulness? Does it not require that the Spirit be given the fullest possible scope and that other scriptures must come to our aid?
S.McC. Just so. It is important that we have the help of the Spirit, not only in a gathering like this, but in the service of God. The Spirit is helping us in the worship of God, Himself. The Lord Jesus and the Spirit are in the mediatorial position; the Lord as Man by us and the Spirit as helping and strengthening us, and yet neither of Them have left Deity in the abstract sense. We must not attempt to explain "God", as we are always confronted with inscrutability. The word elsewhere is, "no one has seen God at any time".
G.M.S. Does the expression, "my God" as coming from the Lord Himself, indicate that, as Man He fully answered to the full thought of God?
S.McC. Exactly; in regard to manhood.
G.M.S. It is our privilege to be alongside of the Lord and to see how He regards God.
{206}
S.McC. Just so, and think of His knowledge of God, how great it is! It is important to see that our relationship with the Father, linked with our place in sonship is carried through. We do not get to a point in the worship of God where we are outside relationship; that is not the thought at all; we remain in the relationship of sons. The appellation, "God", draws attention to the Name which, although relative, includes the whole thought of the Deity.
A.P.C.L. Might I enquire as to the word to the overcomer in Philadelphia? "I will write upon him the name of *my* God" (@Revelation 3: 12). He does not say, I will write upon him the name of *your* God, but "*my* God".
S.McC. It is interesting to see how the Lord would bring us to finality, as in the Philadelphian phase of church history. The Spirit would help us as to what is involved in the promises to the overcomer. He has to do with each of the assemblies, and would especially help us as to the exalted character of what the Lord speaks of, "the name of my God".
A.P.C.L. Can we think of God not only as One Supreme Being, but are we also privileged to think of Him as we have known Him in the economy?
S.McC. Exactly, as we have known Him in revelation. Revelation brings out that there are three Persons in the Deity. In the Old Testament Jehovah is presented as Elohim and Eloah, but when we come to revelation in the New Testament, involving Christ coming into Manhood (all hinges upon His incarnation) we find that revelation brings God out in tangible evidence, known in three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
A.P.C.L. You do not suggest that we could reach God in any other way than that.
S.McC. Not at all. We must always remember that the coming into Manhood of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit descending upon Him and the voice being heard, did not make or begin the Trinity. The Trinity always existed in Oneness.
A.P.C.L. I feel that is most important.
S.McC. One thing needs to be guarded. Mr. Darby used an expression as to the community of undistinguished Godhead, and if that is taken out of its context in the
{207}
article in which it appears, it may hinder some minds. Care has to be taken in the use of that expression, otherwise we may drift into the error of Sabellianism.
V.T.S. Would you say a word as to when we might use the expression, "God and Father" in the service?
S.McC. After the Lord's heart has been ministered to on the marital side, we approach the Father in the light in which He is presented in the economy, to speak to Him in that way (i.e. as God and Father) because He is so spoken of and spoken to in the economy. As to the three Persons, while God is One and we are reminded of the majesty and greatness of His Being, we must never forget that scripture carefully maintains that there always was distinct personality. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. *He* was in the beginning with God".
P.L. In @John 17: 5, "and now glorify me, thou Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". Mr. Darby points out in his note that it is 'along with' as to presence and place.
S.McC. Just so. That verse brings out the distinctness of divine personality in the Father and in the Son. It has been pointed out that the preposition 'with' denotes the community of relations in which They stood the One to the Other. We do not know the form of God, but we do know that love was there -- They loved One Another -- and glory and light were there.
P.L. And as self existent!
S.McC. Three Persons co-equal and co-eternal in Their glory and greatness, yet One God -- "God is one".
L.E.S. It is interesting that after the death of the apostle John, this very matter became the crux of the conflict in the first and second centuries.
S.McC. It is, and the great errors of Tritheism and Sabellianism had to be counteracted, and also Arianism.
C.A.M. Would you say a word as to Sabellianism so that all may get clear on it.
S.McC. Tritheism is the error which treats of three Gods, and Sabellianism is the error which treats of one God but in three phases. Both are equally wrong.
{208}
J.S.E. Is it not the weed of the one that has led some persons to accuse the brethren of the other?
S.McC. I do not follow what you have in mind.
J.S.E. In a certain locality five persons accused the brethren of Tritheism, and they made that charge because they refused the intimacy we are privileged to enjoy with the Spirit. That makes me say the weed of Sabellianism was there for them to make such an accusation.
S.McC. That is very humbling. God in revelation is known in three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. These Names are relative Names bearing on Their relative positions in the economy. The Names do not indicate the relationship in which They stand in essential Deity and absoluteness, and the only way we can speak of the Persons is by the Names by which we know Them in revelation.
G.M.S. Would you say that the root of these heresies is the lack of appreciation of the Person of Christ? In this matter of "my God" we may be deficient in that appreciation.
S.McC. We often think of what it must have been for the Lord Jesus to say, "my God"; how He knew God and could speak of God as no creature could, "my God, and your God"! In Christ it would, of course, involve a knowledge that is outside of revelation, for He is not limited to revelation as having part in the Deity. When it comes to us we are limited to what has come out in revelation.
C.M.M. God being love, we can only approach this great matter in the sense of love. This would save us from mere reasoning.
S.McC. God is love and He desires to be known by us, and how wonderfully that desire came into evidence! It was in the way Christ came into Manhood. The economy in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit opens up the whole subject of love.
A.J.G. Would you say -- that in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we have the complete presentation of love to men?
S.McC. Very good.
W.H. Would the thought of the fulness of the Godhead
{209}
dwelling in Christ who is Head of the assembly, enrich us in our response to that revelation of God? The answer to the shining out of love would thus be equal to the love that shines out.
S.McC. That is it. It is important to see that God has not only come out tangibly in love as He is seen in Christ in Manhood, and in the relations in which divine Persons stand to each other in the economy, but He is going to be responded to in love.
P.L. In Colossians and Ephesians, the Deity of Christ is set forth before His service on our side is introduced in relation to the service of God.
S.McC. That is interesting. Sometimes it is suggested that we cannot hold more than one Person in our minds at one time, and sometimes Mr. Darby's ministry is brought in to support this. It might be interesting to refer to Mr. Darby's note "m" on @1 Thessalonians 3: 11. "Here 'direct' in Greek, as @2 Thessalonians 3: 5, is in the singular; God the Father and Christ the Lord forming, so to speak, one in the apostle's mind, though personally, clearly distinguished". Apparently Mr. Darby contemplated that Paul held more than one Person in his mind at one time.
A.E.M. The passage in @Revelation 2 helps.
S.McC. Just so. John, especially in Revelation, constantly presents God and Christ so that at times two Persons seem to be before us, yet They are presented as One. Christ is presented as God. Sometimes it is difficult to discern which Person he is referring to, but it is clearly evident that, at times, Christ is regarded as God in John's ministry.
G.R.C. Would you say something further as to the Name "my God"? Is it synonymous with @Matthew 28, the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, or does it bring in something further?
S.McC. I think it involves more, because it is Christ speaking and saying, "my God". He does not bring "our God" into @Revelation 3. In @John 20 it is, "my God, and your God"; there is that distinction, but the address to Philadelphia is wholly "my God". We can take account of a majesty and fulness to it which would particularly belong to Christ.
{210}
G.R.C. And yet that Name has to be written on the overcomer.
S.McC. That is the remarkable thing about it.
G.R.C. The assembly stands, apparently, especially related to God in that character because He says, "the name of the city of my God".
S.McC. Just so. In @John 20 we are, in the same way, standing alongside Christ as His brethren in sonship when He says, "my God". How wonderful the expression is on His lips.
G.R.C. Is there a marvellous feature of majesty and greatness as attaching to the Deity suggested in "my God"?
S.McC. As on the lips of Christ you mean?
G.R.C. Yes, and our coming into it in some measure as alongside Him. I was thinking of the Old Testament name of relationship, Jehovah, and the fact that there are other great names such as Elohim and Jah. Is there not something similar in the New Testament, as not only is there the name involving relationship but the greatness of God as God -- Christ's God?
S.McC. While we can stand alongside Christ as He says, "my God", we must always understand that He can encompass depths of knowledge as to the Deity that we never could. We are alongside Him, however, and in the presence of it. It gives us a sense of adoration and prostration before the Deity.
G.R.C. Do you think the assembly as a vessel can penetrate into the meaning of it as no other vessel can, as shown in the references to "the city of my God" and "glory to God in the assembly"?
S.McC. Just so. If we keep in mind that, in using the word 'penetrate' we cannot with our creature and finite understanding go beyond what is revealed.
G.M.S. Some of us have misinterpreted a statement by Mr. Raven in which he said that, as we are finite we could not think of the Lord as God and Man at one and the same time. Mr. Raven never intended to convey that the Lord was not both God and Man at one and the same time.
S.McC. It is important to see that the Lord Himself stresses in John that He is God and Man at the same time.
{211}
"And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven."
G.B. Is there any difference in the name God when the Lord says, "my God" and when He says "your God"?
S.McC. There is no difference in the name, but there is a difference in the apprehension. In His apprehension, "my God", we must allow for what is unique. When we come to "our God", it is the God fully revealed in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and we are governed by the revelation. The Lord Jesus, as a divine Person, has part in the Deity and therefore His knowledge must be unique.
A.C.S.P. Is it important to remember what you were saying this morning about the Spirit? "The water which I shall give him shall become in him". Is it a question of room being made for the Spirit to give us capacity to understand that which could not otherwise be understood?
S.McC. Just so. It is important that we see the necessity for the help of the Spirit in this great matter. We must understand that any latitude we have in such an exalted subject, as Mr. Taylor has said, is in the Spirit. In speaking in this way, God Himself desires to be known, not only in relation to the name Elohim, supreme being, but as He is to be known personally in so far as we can know Him in Christ.
J. van S. Would you say a word in relation to @Hebrews 11: 6?
S.McC. "For he that draws near to God must believe that he is". That is a clear statement as to His constant Being. He is not like us in that He did not begin to be, nor does He cease to be. "God is" refers to constant Being.
J. van S. "To seek God out" -- how would you apply that?
S.McC. @Hebrews 11 is not dealing with the service of God, it is dealing with the testimonial position; it is the realm of testimony.
J. van S. My desire is to know how to seek Him out. You have referred to God in several settings. What is meant by seeking out?
{212}
S.McC. "Without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out". It means that you go to Him and pray to Him, cry to Him about matters. We have the idea in relation to the gospel in @Acts 17, "If indeed they might feel after him" (verse 27).
A.H.D. I understood you to say that we were governed by revelation but are you making a distinction in Christ's knowledge of God in that His knowledge was not governed by revelation?
S.McC. I would not say it was not governed, but rather that it was not limited to revelation.
A.H.D. Is there something beyond that?
S.McC. Certainly. He has part in Deity and therefore His knowledge must be unique, going beyond anything we could enter upon.
P.L. Would you say that it is not just something beyond, but everything beyond?
S.McC. Exactly, although we are brought into it in so far as we can be brought into it.
P.L. The Lord's knowledge is infinite.
S.McC. Yes, and our knowledge is finite, but our knowledge here, is, "my God, and your God". It is the same God, but His knowledge, being a divine Person, must go beyond ours. Who appreciated God in revelation in the way Christ did in perfect Manhood! The whole testimony of His sonship in John bears on that involving His appreciation of God, and how He lived in relation to Him. "I do always those thing which please the Father".
A.H. Would you say that we are helped in the apprehension of this as we understand that the Deity Itself delights to be known. @John 17: 3, "That they should know thee, the only true God".
S.McC. Sometimes when the word Deity is used, it is thought that we are referring necessarily to what is inscrutable. Deity is inscrutable, but then God has come out in revelation and is known in Christ so that we should not be afraid of it in that sense.
Rem. Would you say a word as to the doxology in @1 Timothy 1, "Now to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages
{213}
of ages. Amen ". How far is the apostle going in his mind in using that expression?
S.McC. He says, "the blessed and only Ruler shall shew, the King of those that reign, the Lord of those that exercise lordship; who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see". He is referring to God in His essential Being, unknowable by us in the realm of unapproachable light. We are not dealing with unapproachable light in @John 20, we have approachable light. We have first, God known as Father, and then the Name which alludes to the full thought of Deity. God is the final thought in the Name, "my God and your God". We begin with that in Genesis, God is the primary thought, and God is the final thought.
A.R. Would the enjoyment of the relationship of Father and all that would mean, help us in passing on to the further thought of God? We have, as you have said, in these different passages, the Father and then God. Is the knowledge of the Father the way to God?
S.McC. Just so, otherwise we might be overawed by the majesty of the One whom Christ refers to as, "my God, and your God". In the setting of "my Father, and your Father", we are with God as known in that relationship and in all the nearness -- and intimacy of which that relationship speaks. How precious it is; how near we are to Him -- "nearer we could not be" -- and then we come to this great Name "God", which elicits worship; the majesty and greatness of who He is, nevertheless drawn near to us, as He has in grace, to be known in a personal way; God Himself.
A.P.C.L. He says, "I have not yet ascended to my Father". That statement stands by itself. Do you think there is something unique even in relation to His place with the Father?
S.McC. I am sure there is. We are brought through grace into association with Him as the Son of God, but sonship in Him is unique, everything from the angels and from Adam onwards looking on to the incarnation. Everything afterwards looks back to the incarnation, the uniqueness of sonship in the Manhood of Christ.
{214}
W.J.B. Can you help us as to the thought of God in His Own essential Being? Has that thought a place in the service of God?
S.McC. It has in so far as we are able to know Him with finite minds. Whilst the name Jehovah is the name of relationship, it is peculiarly the personal name of God, the personal name of Him who is Elohim, the Supreme Being. Jehovah is the personal and abiding name and indicates to us His desire, not only to be known according to His almighty power, El Shaddai, but He wants to be known as far as He can be known in what He is in Himself. God is love -- that is absolute.
W.J.B. Would there be something answering to, "To him be honour and eternal might. Amen", in the service of God?
S.McC. Yes. The majesty and might and the glory which David alluded to, and our hymn book too (which we thank God for) has furnished us richly with outlets in that regard.
W.H. While there is that which is beyond us, it but awakens the spirit of reverence and worship in our hearts.
S.McC. That is it. It is well to keep in mind *all the time*, that there is that which is beyond us, not at any particular time, but all the time we are in a realm where we are faced with inscrutability. With the Lord Jesus as Man, we have to recognise who He is in His essential Being.
Rem. Chapter 20: 12 refers to the head and the feet and the angels. Would the teaching of that enter into our understanding the message given to Mary?
S.McC. That occurred to one this morning; I have never noticed it before. We have always linked the feet with Luke where the Lord presents Himself. In @John 20, however, the "feet" are to remind us of the way of love, as we are moving towards these great and exalted levels of the truth where God is known as God and as He is. Verse 12, "where the body of Jesus lay" reminds us of love's way.
W.H. Would @John 12 support that? Mary anointed His feet in view of His entry into death.
{215}
S.McC. Just so, and the head would remind us of the uniqueness of the Person that was there in Manhood. An address was given the other day as to the name of the angel in Judges, "How is it that thou askest after my name, seeing it is wonderful" (13: 18) and then "he did wondrously". I think the word 'wonderful' links with the head, and 'did wondrously' links with the feet, suggesting the way of love in which He moved in the economy into which He had come. Do you think that would be so?
A.J.G. Yes and perhaps be carried forward in this way as leading to the Father, do you think?
S.McC. Just so.
P.L. So that His feet are inferred in the expression "stood" (verse 19)?
S.McC. Yes. The way of love not only included going down into death, but also the ascent into the presence of His Father and our Father, His God and our God.
J.M. Is it interesting that the feet are mentioned in @Exodus 24: 10, "under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire"? This is the first mention of the God Israel of which would suggest relationship and at the end of that passage it says, "they saw God". Is that a progressive thought?
S.McC. I am not getting your thought.
J.M. I was wondering if the God of Israel might link with the thought of the Father in the New Testament, and the feet with the way love has been expressed, leading to the final thought of seeing God, in @John 20.
S.McC. I think that is suggestive -- something to think over and reflect on.
A.E.M. As some young persons may not understand this great subject, is it not comforting to recall that the name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Spirit was called over them at baptism? Had this in view their coming under the service of divine Persons so that they might learn to worship Them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in the service of God.
S.McC. I am sure that is important. We have to do with God from the beginning in our primary relations on Christian ground. We have also to do with Him finally in that exalted way on assembly ground.
{216}
P.L. We come into the knowledge initially by the way of baptism -- burial -- these thoughts of baptism and burial being preserved in view of our disappearance in relation to all that would be merely mental. Do you not think that there is an indication in the baptism in Matthew of the importance of our disappearing in order to be conversant and at home in all that attaches to divine Persons?
S.McC. Just so. As the truth of our baptism is maintained in that way, there would be the disallowance of all that would hinder our entrance into the full light of God as in @John 20.
P.L. I thought all that was intensified in the word 'circumcision' in @Philippians 3: 3. As worshippers of God, we are of the circumcision.
S.McC. Just so. "Who boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh".
In @Ephesians 3 we see how the exalted features of assembly knowledge bring the apostle to his knees. This is an important matter. We have been speaking about the woman of Samaria, and the woman in @John 20, and now we have the apostle, the great minister, in prayer in a priestly attitude. This emphasises the essential need of a spiritual State. The power of His Spirit, is a wonderful allusion; strengthening us with power in the inner man -- marked with such fulness -- "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus". In that verse we see the wondrous fulness of the mediatorial position.
A.P.C.L. Does Paul show his knowledge of the Father when he says, "according to the riches of his glory"?
S.McC. He does. It is a remarkable reference, "according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man". It is *His* glory, *His* Spirit, and how affecting that is!
W.S.S. Is the reference to the Father not remarkable here? He says, "that he -- the Father -- may give you". The Father gives us by the Spirit to know all things.
S.McC. Just so. The knowledge of the Father in these passages, and the apprehension of the Father in His activities, are all means to an end. They are not the end, and we are not to make them the end. The great end is, as we have in @John 20, "my God, and your God", and
{217}
then "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages" -- it alludes back to God in verse 19.
W.S.S. It seems such a wonderful thing that there is a suggestion here of the Father serving us by the Spirit to this end.
S.McC. One has often been affected by the thought of the Father's Spirit. Generally, when we speak of the spirit of a person, we think of the inward side of things, and we are impressed with "inwardness" in this whole realm of operations, involving such power. The Father's Spirit is to strengthen us.
A.J.G. Do you mean that the Father's Spirit would give us the capacity to have before us the whole range of glory of which the Father is the source? Does it also suggest the Father's thoughts and feelings in regard to Christ who is the centre of it?
S.McC. That is what I thought. This allusion to, "riches of His glory", and to the great domain that is in mind, is not something that is altogether beyond us. While infinitude enters into it, the strengthening by the Father's Spirit would help us to apprehend and enjoy it.
A.J.G. Would you say that sons should be able to enter intelligently into all the Father's interests?
S.McC. Just so.
W.B.S. Does that lead us to a point in the assembly service where the response takes more the character of ascribing glory to God?
S.McC. It takes that form here, although it is interesting to notice how the mediatorial position is carefully guarded, " to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus". Years ago, some thought we reached a point in the service of God when we went beyond the mediatorial side of things and we did not need to say, "in the name of the Lord Jesus"; that will never do. We never get beyond what is mediatorial, and never will even in eternity.
A.H. Would you say more as to that, please? You said, some used to omit, "in the name of the Lord Jesus". I believe it would help if you enlarged on that.
S.McC. Some did in certain parts, but it was not general. They thought that we reached God in His
{218}
supremacy, and we went beyond the mediatorial side of things so that we need not use or finish with, "in the name of the Lord Jesus". We have to be governed by scripture and it says plainly, "Whatever ye may do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him" (@Colossians 3: 17).
A.E.M. Even in praising the Lord you would always finish, "in the name of the Lord Jesus".
S.McC. Certainly, because we are in a mediatorial position. We are in a mediatorial state of things and all things are to be done in the name of the Lord Jesus: we never get outside of that.
H.S.M. We find there is a lack of liberty in speaking to God, having in mind Father, Son, and Spirit. Why do you think there is this lack of liberty?
S.McC. I can only speak for one's own locality and what one has noticed in meetings in the north and around. There is liberty in speaking to God, known in the three Persons. There may be a lack of liberty in certain quarters, but I have noticed that, generally in movements among the meetings, there is liberty to speak to God, known as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
A.R. Would it be right in addressing God to name the three Persons?
S.McC. Just so. It is important to see what is involved in the full revelation of God in the three Persons. It does not necessarily mean that every time we name the three Persons, nor does it mean that we exclude the naming of the three Persons. We may speak to God as God without referring to Each of the Persons in Their several names, but we may, and are intended to speak to God having in mind the three Persons in Their several names.
A.R. It would not be out of place to do so.
A.H. Would you say that @Ephesians 3: 21 involves the cherished thought of the man and the woman, and would that link up with @Hebrews 2: 12, Christ praising God in the assembly?
S.McC. No doubt. This verse is a very full one, "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". It not only includes fulness in regard to the three divine Persons, but also
{219}
brings in the three ways in which those that compose the assembly are seen -- the brethren of Christ, the bride and wife of Christ, and the sons of God. It is a very inclusive verse, inclusive of the three divine Persons, and the fulness of the teaching in regard to our relationship with Them.
G.R.C. Do you mean we carry forward in the service the features you have mentioned -- the idea of the brethren, and of the bride and wife, into this final phase? We do not leave them behind.
S.McC. We do not. They are carried forward and all the wealth linked with each of those phases enters into and augments the final thought in the service of God. We are not speaking of them, but they are there, and with them the wealth, the known love and affection linked with them.
A.E.M. You could not worship God in the highest sense unless you go that way.
S.McC. That is it; that is just the point.
G.R.C. The active love of the Christ would give impulse to all that goes on in the assembly in Christ Jesus.
S.McC. Just so. The verse, "to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" is a remarkable reference. It reminds us of His part in Deity, as although the allusion is to Him as Man, the Christ, the reference is clearly to His Deity. It could never be said of a creature, but is said of One who has His place in Deity, and yet is before us as Man.
A.P.C.L. That One has a place in each of our hearts. It is not exactly in the assembly heart, but in your hearts through faith.
S.McC. Very good. It reminds us of the realm of sonship, what we are in this wonderful domain of glory, the Father's domain. We begin with the Father's embrace, the Father strengthening us, and we enjoy it according to our individual impressions of Himself and of Christ.
A.P.C.L. I wondered as to that, because femininity is connected with the assembly as the woman becomes the bride. Yet response to God is in sonship.
-- .G. Would you say a word as to "filled *to* all the fulness of God"? It is not filled *with*.
{220}
S.McC. It is the objective side; we are filled *to* it. The fulness alludes to what has come out as God has shone out in Christ. God intended that there should be an answer to the outshining, and the answer is found in the assembly.
P.L. And in the heavenly city, would you say, as having the glory of God?
S.McC. @1 Corinthians 15 should help us in regard to the finality of things. It says, "when he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father" (verse 24). Mr. Darby's note "r" is interesting -- "It is almost impossible to render the Greek idiom, which unites with one article either two qualities of the same person, or two persons under the same quality. But I prefer this awkward English to 'God, even the Father', because this phrase is uncertain in doctrine, and might be used as meaning that the Father only is God, which is not the sense." In Ephesians chapter 5: 20 we have the same allusion "giving thanks at all times for all things to him who is God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ". The note "y" to that verse says, "'To him who is'. This alone gives the sense. 'God even the Father' might be taken as meaning that the Father only is God, and it is far from exact as a translation." All this is to help us in our consideration of the matter of the knowledge of God.
G.R.C. In a note elsewhere as to the article, Mr. Darby says, where it appears before a noun by itself, it means the totality of the thing. That occurs in verse 28, "that God may be all in all", and also in @Ephesians 3, "the fulness of God"; it is the totality of Deity.
S.McC. Just so. This passage is very impressive. It begins with the delivering up or giving up of the kingdom, "to him who is God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power". It goes on to say, "when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all". It would never do to say that the Father might be all in all, or that He who is God and Father might be all in all, because that would exclude the Lord and the Spirit. An end is in mind in
{221}
the giving up of the kingdom to Him who is God and Father, and in the Son being placed in subjection, and that end is God. God is the final thought, "that God might be all in all ".
A.H. Is this really the filling out of, "from eternity to eternity thou art God"?
S.McC. It would embrace that, although I think our verse involves more. "From eternity to eternity thou art God", refers to what abides and is an allusion to supremacy. @1 Corinthians 15 includes that, but involves more "that God may be all in all".
P.L. Has it not been said that "all" is objective, and "in all" character?
S.McC. Just so.
A.P.C.L. Do you think when it says, "the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection", the apostle had something definite in mind in that the reference is changed from "the Christ" who has been mentioned in the whole chapter until that point?
S.McC. That is a very good reference. The Spirit of God, through Paul, is reminding us of the greatness and the Deity of the Person who takes the place of subjection in the liberty of love in Manhood. The Son is the name of that Person.
A.P.C.L. "And shall be placed" is as having come into Manhood.
S.McC. All is in the liberty of love. The word "placed" suggests that. It is not an arbitrary exercise of power; it is in the liberty of love, because no divine Person could impose a position upon another divine Person in conditions of Deity.
P.L. Have we not reached now a point in this scripture when all evil has been dealt with and a region for love's complacency and satisfaction eternally is established?
S.McC. Just so. It helps us to see that the economy abides. The divine economy into which God has come and is known in these wondrous relations, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, abides and goes through. The Son remains in Manhood. He does not give up His Manhood. His Manhood is retained, because we shall never know God apart from His Manhood.
{222}
A.P.C.L. I was thinking of Philippians, "taking *his place* in the likeness of men" (2: 7). The Son takes His place as Man, and in that sense in relation to men.
S.McC. That is a beautiful touch. The word "place" is distinctive, as we think of what is related to it. "Then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all". The Son in Manhood is before us, but behind all the relations in the economy, behind all the grace and love seen in the economy, there are the inscrutable relations in Deity. We cannot bind Them to any position into which They come and in which They may be viewed by us.
E.G.J. What is involved in the kingdom here? Is it an abstract thought, or does it include all that are in it?
S.McC. I think it is an abstract thought. The kingdom goes through. There is the eternal side of the kingdom. All that the kingdom is at the present time in meeting the principle of sin and lawlessness finishes, but the kingdom in another sense continues through eternity, because God is God and we are men.
W.H. And, "To the King Eternal", would suggest His position eternally in relation to the kingdom of God.
S.McC. The thought of reigning also enters into it. @Revelation 22 gives us the thought, "The Lord shall shine upon them, and they shall reign to the ages of ages" (verse 5). That involves eternity and shows that the kingdom in some form or another continues, not on the official side in dealing with sin and lawlessness, but from the side of love, rule, and control. God is God and we are creatures.
G.R.C. In the eternal sense in @Revelation 21, "He that sat on the throne said, Behold I make all things new", the throne is still there.
S.McC. Very good.
L.H. I would like to ask about "placed in subjection". Would that be the final working out of the arrangement between the three divine Persons before time?
S.McC. What is arrived at in finality in relation to God and man, is in accord with the eternal purposes and counsels of God.
{223}
DIVINE AFFECTION FOR THE SAINTS
S. McCallum
@1 John 2: 14 -- 17; @Romans 8: 33 -- 38; @Romans 15: 29 -- 33
I have in mind to speak on the thought of divine affection as the portion, refuge, and stay, of our hearts in difficult and testing circumstances. You will notice that in all the passages read, allusion is made to this thought of divine affection; the love of the Father in the first, the love of Christ in the second, and the love of the Spirit in the last -- in their fulness representing to us the love of God known in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And yet these passages, dear brethren, remind us of the distinctiveness of each of the Persons of the Trinity in relation to Their position in the economy into which they have come and in which they are known, and particularly, as I have said, viewed as the known portion and stay of the saints. Other passages indicate to us divine love operating through divine Persons in relation to Themselves, and to and for Their own pleasure and delight. But these passages are particularly affecting because they represent how love seen in relation to each of the Persons is the known portion, support, and stay, of our hearts.
I would especially desire to encourage our hearts by this reference to the love of the Father in the first passage, especially as it is our desire to carry the younger brethren with us in such gatherings as these, in all that enters into the blessedness of what is known and enjoyed amongst the saints in relation to this love. The subject of love in this first letter of John's, is a wonderful subject.
{224}
Christianity is presented in this letter in the most attractive way, over against the world's system. It is presented in a way that is calculated to encourage and sustain our minds and hearts in the very scene where evil and lawlessness are present, John beginning this letter with the wonderful allusion to life in the testimony of Jesus seen in His place here in Manhood. The eternal life which was with the Father -- he presents it as having come within our range so attractively, to be contemplated, to be seen, to be handled by persons such as ourselves, as it was the disciples lot particularly to do. The whole ministry of John is to impress us with the nearness into which God has come to men. As he goes on in the epistle he comes, in the portion that I have read, to the stages of growth in the family of God. Oh, the delightfulness of life in the family of God, in the normal stages of development, each phase and stage of development marked by a particular knowledge of the truth and of divine Persons. He is engaging us with life in its normality in the family of God in all its attractiveness, and he comes to the thought of the young men (which of course would include the young women too) and he says, "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." Now while this is referred to in a negative way, it means that the love of the Father is the known portion of those that are apart from the world. The world is presented as a great counter-system here, and the love of the Father, as it has become known in Jesus, has entered within our range in a sphere where the Father is known, and where His love is to be the all-engaging portion as refusing the world. "Nor the things in the world". To many minds Christianity in the path of the testimony affords little outlet for what is of present advantage to those that are referred to here, the young men. But how it should touch the hearts of the younger brethren that the love of the Father has moved on to our view in relation to their exercises and their difficulties and overcoming the world; that the love of the supreme Person in the economy has moved into the
{225}
position of being the portion of the younger brethren as overcoming the world, overcoming the wicked one. It says, "Ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you." Have we ever thought -- I appeal to those that are addressed here, to those that are in the same class in this gathering -- have you ever thought of the advantages of this stage of life in the family of God? -- the word of God abides in you. What a resource over against the advances of the foe, who knows how to move the departments of the world and their various features against us to ensnare and to damage us in relation to the testimony. What a resource we have in the word of God abiding in us. It says, "Ye have overcome the wicked one", and in the light of this he says, "Love not the world nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." Then he goes on to speak of all that is in the world -- the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world. He is reminding us negatively of a system of things unknown to men generally, but known to faith and those who have the Spirit, and to those who have the word of God abiding in them; a system of things that belongs to the Father. It is specially presented here in the thought of the love of the Father, the affections of the Father, as the portion of the believer in this stage of growth, contemplated here over against all that is denied him in the world and all that he has to deny himself in regard of in the world. What a refuge the love of the Father is! Many of us, it may have been, have become embittered with the frustration of strong ambition naturally, which, had it not been for the rights of God and the claims of the testimony, might have found much scope in the world. But what a touch on the part of the Spirit of God through His servant John, to remind us that the love of the Father is the portion of those that have forsaken the world, that do not love the world. If we love the world, the love of the Father is not in us -- the inference being that if we do not love the world, the love of the Father is in us. What a balance, what an asset piety is, as we bring God into circumstances which so try and test us, especially in the ambition and energy and strength of youth. What a
{226}
portion the love of the Father presents, the Father's system presents. The writer, John, has particularly in mind -- not only in the epistle but in his gospel in the ministry of Christ -- to help us in relation to the attractiveness of the Father's world. I would point out some of the advantages of it, and the attractions in it, because divine affection would have it so. This chapter, as it opens alludes to the fact that, if we become damaged, if sin operates, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. We have a system of things set up in relation to the Father and His world that is to meet whatever may come into our lives here, not only the world with its allurements and attractions which appeal to us in youthful years, but the very matter of sin operating. We are reminded by John of what there is with the Father, with that glorious Person -- God known in that Person. A system of things comes into operation immediately in regard to what is referred to here -- "If any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." What an asset the knowledge of that is in our souls! You will recall in John's gospel how he speaks of the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father (@John 1: 18). What a wonderful thing it is to be drawn into a realm where the Father's love and affections are known. What a steadying object Christ, in the spiritual excellence of His Manhood, is in the Father's realm, known and adored in that position by the myriads of those that love Him. You will remember how the Spirit is referred to as going forth from with the Father -- the One who has taken up His abode with us and does not desire enviously. He has come forth from with the Father -- a definite link in our souls with the Father's world, the Father's system, the Father's affections. I would encourage our hearts to think of this more, that God has come within our range in this way. Sometimes reference is made to the Father remaining in the inscrutableness of Deity, but think of the reference here to the love of the Father as the portion of the believer in refusing the world. Is it not an incentive to turn away from the world, as the love of the Father engages us? What fructifying soil then shall result; soil in which the truth prospers, soil in which the seeds, so wondrously implanted, yield so fruitfully, both
{227}
for the divine joy and our own joy too. The love of the Father is a real matter, and it is impressive to think of it as linked with this stage of development in the family of God. John is fully measuring what it may be to face the world, to face advancement in our position, and what it may affect with us in the way of damage. John is fully cognisant of what it may be for us to give up certain ambitions, certain desires on natural lines, special and peculiar to youthfulness, but he would remind us in such an encouraging, attractive way that the love of the supreme Person in the economy, the Father -- the One of whom the Lord Jesus says, My Father is greater than I -- is to be our known portion. What a refuge, what unalloyed sweetness there is in it! What it imparts over against all that may disappoint, all that may bring bitterness and even sorrow, in the denial of the world. He says, "The world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity". If we go in for the world and the things of the world, they may seem little to us as far as damaging influence is concerned. We may cater for them in the office. We may, in an ungirt moment, give way and yield to the constant encroaching movement of the enemy, little by little, but suddenly we yield and give ourselves over to it, the love of the world becomes so real and bitter in our experience. Oh! to be held through the strengthening power and resource of the word of God abiding in us, so that, as we are faced with these encroachments, as they may offer us this and offer us that, as they may ask us to come into this and come into that -- the world bound up with it all -- let us revert to what is within us, the word of God. Let the word of God exercise its power. The sword of the Spirit is the word of God. What a power there is in the word of God to be wielded against the alluring and damaging approaches of the world. May we be helped of the Spirit to be conscious of how great a portion that is.
Now I want to speak of the love of Christ. We have the love of Christ presented in relation to another set of circumstances, not now exactly the side of moral evil in the world, but as the known refuge of the believer, and the stay of the believer over against all that which, in our
{228}
circumstances, if allowed to gain the ascendancy, would repress and retard spiritual development and growth. There is nothing like circumstances, especially difficult circumstances, if they gain the ascendancy with us, to hinder spiritual development. This chapter of Romans is a wonderful chapter in the way that it brings in resource for the believer, the Spirit of God being alluded to in many ways and many times. How important it is that we should know how to make full room for Him, not just as we have been considering it in ministry, and in relation to teaching, but that, individually, we should know how to make full room for Him. What will He not do for us? Oh, the power that is linked with the Spirit in the light of @Romans 8! The Spirit is life in view of righteousness.
What advantages the believer has. How morally superior he is to the world and all that is in it, to the flesh and all that attaches to it, as in the light of this chapter. Reference is made to creation and what has entered in through sin, bringing untold damage and difficulty and distress. Divine Persons have come into these very circumstances to deal with the whole matter of sin and what sin had brought in. As the believer is extricated morally from it, he knows the presence of the divine Person, that we have alluded to, in a subjective way in his soul. The power he experiences is a real matter, not just an academic matter. The Spirit is life in view of righteousness, so that every obligation can be filled out in power, whether in natural relations, business relations, or school relations. The Spirit is power in view of every relationship being filled out rightly according to God. Difficulties are real, the infirmities many, but what we are to understand is the known, conscious service of the Holy Spirit. Oh, that we knew Him better and that we lived in communion with Him more day by day. What do we know about communion with the Spirit? What do we know about the Spirit joining its help to our weakness, to our infirmities? This chapter has it all in mind.
Divine love has devised the best for us, and is doing the best for us. We read, "Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? It is God who justifies; who is he that condemns? It is Christ who has died, but rather has
{229}
been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us". Why is Paul writing this? To bring into our souls the great feature of power to meet circumstances, to bring into our souls, into our minds and hearts, that which will help us to be invulnerable to the approaches of the enemy through circumstances. A position is contemplated here in which divine love is active in the love of Christ who died. It is Christ who has died, the One who loves us, the One of whose love we are about to speak. It says, "but rather has been raised up"; that is, it is the way up out of the world. We have been speaking about the world and the way out of it is before us here. Notice that it does not say just, "has been raised", but "has been raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us". You will recall in verse 30 the multiplying of "also's" in the chain, and the links in it that divine love has formed, of the wonderful blessings attaching to the believer. "Whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified." These "also's" refer to the wonderful chain, and the links in it down here in the saints, as having the Spirit, for the glorification alludes to the saints as having the Spirit.
When we come to the "also's" in verse 34, we have the wonderful links of the chain connected with the position of Christ on high; as it says, "Who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us". We have thought of the links down here, but think of the links connected with the movement of Christ into the position where He represents us on high, so that we might be strengthened in power in our souls, and maintained in spiritual constancy over against all the discouraging influences in circumstances. As Paul reaches the position of Christ interceding on high at the right hand of God he says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long: we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter". The path of the testimony involves suffering, suffering of the most testing
{230}
character, but the love of Christ is a known refuge to the believer in the midst of what would almost overthrow him in the difficulties of circumstances in the desert path. He knows what it is to repair into this enjoyed resource, this enjoyed refuge, the love of Christ. Think of the greatness of divine love! God is love, and in order that we might know it He has come into these relations where we can know that love, and not only know it, but enjoy it in the different ways in which it is presented in the economy as the refuge and stay of our hearts, the Spirit of God helping in relation to the enjoyment of these features of the love of the Father and the love of Christ. Paul says, "But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us". He not only refers to the love of Christ as a present portion and refuge for our hearts, but he refers us to the historical side of that love, to the Person that loved us. The proof of His love, the witness of it in all its fulness, is seen at Calvary in His death, and that love now, the love of Christ, is the known, inseparable portion of the believer. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine" -- nothing can separate us from it. Oh, how great it is, dear brethren, what a stay to our hearts in our localities where there is so much to test us. Divine Persons have moved so near to us, and divine affections have been brought so near to us that the love of each of the Persons is to be known in a strengthening way over against all the artifices of the devil, and the discouragement he would bring to turn our feet from the path of the testimony. In all this we can know what it is to repair into the love of the Father, and into the love of Christ.
I want now to allude to the love of the Spirit. A different set of circumstances is before us in this delightful reference, dear brethren, in surroundings where the power of the Spirit is so evident in the ministry. The minister is thinking of his ministry, thinking, too, of its acceptance among the saints, and of the working of unbelief. He repairs into the known stay, so fully and consciously enjoyed by him, in the love of the Spirit. He says, "But I beseech you, brethren". Think of the great apostle, the authority of the commission he had, the wealth of the dispensations
{231}
committed to him in the gospel and in the ministry in regard to the assembly! How he appeals to the brethren as he thinks of the enemy approaching, not now through tribulation and distress. He could speak of tribulation as very few could -- he comes next to Christ in that -- but he is not speaking of that so much here. He says, "that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judea; and that my ministry which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints." He brings the love of the Spirit under the view of the brethren, beseeching them by it for he knew it was his stay. He not only knew what the power of the Spirit was in preaching and in teaching, but he knew what it was, when difficulties were encountered in the acceptance of the teaching, to repair into the known stay of the love of the Spirit. Dear brethren, I want to impress our hearts with the love of the Spirit and its bearing on the ministry. You will remember in @Genesis 24, that great typical chapter in relation to the Spirit and His service, that when Laban came out he saw the man standing by the camels by the well. I believe that is to bring into view (as we go back to the type by faith) the love that held him there -- the love of the Spirit. It is love that holds Him to the service, to the mission that He has come to carry out in relation to the assembly for Christ, the fulness of the truth that is in mind in this dispensation involving Christ and the assembly. The Spirit is held, if I might say reverently, in the energy of that love in relation to all the blessedness that enters into His mission. Just as with Isaac, in the great chapter in @Genesis 22, the ram sets out the progenitive idea, the energetic side, and suggests the love of Christ. The ram caught in the thicket is a type of Christ held in the energy of love in regard to His mission, and @Genesis 24 brings before us in type and in figure the Spirit held in the energy of His love and affection in regard to *His* mission. It is a stay and comfort, dear brethren, over against all that is around us and all that may come up amongst us. So he says, I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ -- what a touch! It is the full official Name, *our* Lord Jesus Christ; not the Lord Jesus, the great assembly Name of affection, but the full official Name, the one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things
{232}
and we by Him. He says, "I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ", as if all the power linked with that official position, that official Name, would enter into this matter of ministry and its prosperity among the saints, and allied with it the love of the Spirit; on the one hand the power and authority linked with the official Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and on the other the resourcefulness of the love of the Spirit. Oh, to see, dear brethren, the intimate links between the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the mediatorial operations so well known by Paul that he says, "I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers". How we need to strive in prayers in regard to the ministry, so that the minister and those who serve in the ministry might be saved from those that do not believe. Think of his holy concern -- striving together! It is not a question of striving together in argument, or arguing the pros and cons of the ministry or the truth. Paul is bringing in the resources of the mediatorial realm, enlisting the sympathies of the saints, that they strive together with him in prayers according to God. What need there is at all times, in view of the prosperity of the truth, for the saints to strive in prayers. Striving -- think of the force of the expression, the love of the Spirit entering into it, as if the Spirit is so available, His love so near, that it is a known resource and stay to be brought into this matter, all operating in view of the prosperity of the minister and the ministry. How much we attach to argument and logical reasoning. Would that we knew more of repairing into these known resources, as such a minister as Paul must do, on our faces before God and the Lord Jesus, striving in prayer that all the truth may come out and may be entered upon. It has come out, and it is important that it should be entered on, and that room should be made for the Spirit to help us.
That was what I had in mind, dear brethren, to draw attention to divine affections, to the love of God as it has come so near and so known; divine affections in relation to each of the Persons as a known and enjoyed portion over against what may be difficult and trying.

THE HOLY SPIRIT IN JOHN'S WRITINGS
A. J. Gardiner
@Revelation 1: 4 -- 6; @1 John 5: 6 -- 8; @John 14: 15 -- 20; @Revelation 22: 16 -- 17
I wish to present to you, dear brethren, certain particular lights in which the Holy Spirit is presented in John's writings. John has an exceptional way of speaking of the Holy Spirit, which has a special bearing upon ourselves, John's writings having especially the closing days in mind. The presence of the Holy Spirit in the assembly, and as indwelling believers, is of course the great characteristic feature of Christianity, and the truth as to the Spirit occupies an important place in all the epistles. James refers to the Spirit in a most touching way. He says, "Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously?" Peter speaks of sanctification of the Spirit; he speaks of the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon one who is reproached in the Name of Christ. Jude speaks of the importance of praying in the Holy Spirit and keeping ourselves in the love of God. But Paul, to whom is given the light of the assembly and to whom it was given to complete the word of God, speaks very largely of the Holy Spirit. In the epistle to the Romans, for instance, he brings in the Spirit in many ways -- the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us; the Spirit being the power, and the alone power, by which we can fulfil every righteous obligation; the Spirit, too, being the power by which we can mortify the deeds of the
{234}
body and so live. Indeed, the Spirit is life, as it is said, on account of righteousness, and moreover, the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. In Corinthians the Spirit has a very large place necessarily -- in the first epistle especially, and in the second epistle presented as the anointing, and the earnest, and the seal; then there is that remarkable expression at the end of the epistle, the communion of the Holy Spirit. In the epistle to the Galatians, how important is the place that the Holy Spirit has -- the Spirit of liberty, the Spirit of God's Son. In the epistle to the Ephesians the earnest of the inheritance, and the One by whom we have access to the Father, and the Father's Spirit strengthening us in the inner man that we may be able to apprehend the whole expanse of what the Father has in His thoughts. What wondrous grace, dear brethren, that the Father's Spirit should be operating in our hearts with that in mind.
We might enlarge upon the place that the Holy Spirit has in the various epistles, and yet it will be found that John's writings give the Holy Spirit a place and present Him in certain lights which are peculiar to John. I suppose we may say that Paul's service was to present the whole extent of the truth of God in a formal way in doctrine, and as we have said, he completed the word of God. But then John is raised up, as one has said years ago, as a reserve man. He is raised up having in view days when the truth, established through Paul's ministry, would be given up, and the public position would be in ruins. The things of God are to go through notwithstanding. The work of God is not going to fall to the ground, and so John ministers in view of days when the truth is recovered -- not in outward recovery in a general way, but on the principle of life. John does not name things formally, but he gives us the truth vitally, held in persons who are going on with the Lord and with the Spirit. In that setting he has a certain way of his own of presenting the Spirit of God, that we may be fully assured that, in the presence with us of the Holy Spirit, we have all that is needed to go through to completion, notwithstanding the difficult conditions that obtain in the last days. You remember that Paul in writing to Timothy, contemplating days of
{235}
departure, all in Asia having forsaken him, said, "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him". I have no doubt he referred to the fact that, when everything was outwardly going to ruins, he so to speak handed back to the Lord the ministry that had been entrusted to himself, and said, I am assured that He will see it through. I believe we may say humbly, dear brethren, that we are living in days when the Lord is making good that confidence that Paul reposed in Him, the Spirit is making it good; so that whatever Paul brought out in his ministry is being recovered and held among the saints in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Now I start with John's letter to the seven assemblies. The fact that he is writing to seven local assemblies shows that he has in mind not merely the statement of the truth in a kind of doctrinal way, but that there should be an answer to the truth. It is important, I believe, to bear in mind, in relation to local assemblies, that it is in the localities that there is (or there is not) an answer to the truth. The truth should come into expression in localities, and John is writing to seven local assemblies, doubtless intended to represent the whole assembly in its responsible setting. He presents the Lord walking in the midst of the seven local assemblies, taking account of conditions that He finds there, passing an appraisement upon them, commending what He can commend, but alas, finding much that He has to condemn. John in writing to the assemblies says, "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come." That is, he is presenting God majestically, because he has in mind opposition to the truth rising to its height. He is contemplating, as this book shows as we proceed, the full development of lawlessness, and power accompanying it, in opposition to the truth. Having that in mind he presents God majestically. "Him who is". That cannot be said of any *man*. God IS absolutely; as the Lord Jesus, who is in His Person God, said, "Before Abraham was, I AM". He stands out majestically as the One who is. What is man in contrast to that? He is so to speak but a shadow. His life may last seventy, eighty, or a hundred years, but
{236}
that is all, and what is that in the presence of Him who IS? "And who was". That is what He has proved Himself to be historically. He who could support a man like Daniel, who could support Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego -- Him who was -- the God who has proved Himself in history. "And who is to come". John says, "and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ". This is something that Paul never does. This is something peculiar to John. Paul in his epistles says consistently, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." John says, "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come" -- that is God -- "and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne". He invokes grace and peace upon the saints from the Spirit of God, and he even puts Him before the Lord Jesus -- I will say in a minute why I believe this is so -- not in any sense to interfere with the order in which the Persons of the Godhead stand in the economy, which is the Father first, the Son second, and the Holy Spirit third. We can see that is right, because the Son sends the Spirit as well as the Father sending Him. Nevertheless, here John, in the liberty that there is in the Holy Spirit, not only does what Paul never does, invokes the Spirit to afford grace and peace to the saints, but he even puts Him before the Lord. Why is that? Is it not, dear brethren, that he is giving peculiar place in our minds to the Holy Spirit of God as the great support, the great standby of the saints in the last days, and so he says, the seven Spirits which are before His throne. That does not mean that they are in heaven. Of course, when we come to speak of any One of the Persons of the Godhead, we cannot limit Him by questions of location. We cannot say that One of Them is on earth and therefore not in heaven, or anything of that sort; so that "the seven Spirits which are before his throne" means that the Spirit in fulness of power is here with the saints in order to support the throne of God. Everything that affects the rights of God, everything that challenges His rights, every issue as to the truth whatever it may be -- the Spirit is here, the Spirit, who is God, is here personally in fulness of power to support the throne.
{237}
What a great thing that is, beloved brethren. We read in @Isaiah 59: 19, "When the adversary shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a banner against him." The great resource of the saints is the Spirit of God. Indeed, in John's writings, we have two great supports that we can fall back upon. In the 13th of John it says, the Lord, "knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". It is as though the moment having come for Him to depart, He so to speak took up that attitude of mind and let them know it, that one thing that they could rely upon through everything -- through thick and thin as we say -- was His own love, the love of Christ. We were having it yesterday -- that nothing can separate us from it. In the 14th chapter He introduces the Comforter, to be with us for ever and to be in us. He is giving us a second resource that we can rely upon whatever arises in the course of the testimony here.
John puts the Spirit before the Lord here, and I believe for this reason, that he would establish us first of all in the sense that the Spirit, who is God Himself, is here to carry the testimony right through in power that cannot be overcome. On what lines is it to be carried through? It is committed to the saints, because the testimony is committed to men. It is committed to the Spirit it is true, but it is the saints that are being used in testimony. It is we to whom God has given the great privilege of being committed to the truth and to carry it through not only in word but in life, right through to the end. The testimony is entrusted in grace to men, but on what lines is it to go through? It is to go through on lines of suffering, and so he says, "from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness" -- faithful even unto death. He is the firstborn from the dead. Moreover, He is the prince of the kings of the earth. I understand, dear brethren, that it is a question of the truth going through in testimony right to the end. The Spirit of God, who is God, here in the scene of testimony and conflict to carry it through in divine power. The manner in which it is to go through is in faithfulness in manhood, even though it is faithfulness unto death. He
{238}
is Jesus Christ, the faithful witness; He has gone through.
I need not enlarge on the doxology that immediately follows. It is a touching thing, beloved brethren, that when God is presented, or the Lord Jesus, in the scriptures we so often get these doxologies. I think it is a challenge to one, perhaps a challenge to us all, as to how we hold the truth; whether we just hold it in correctness of terms, or whether we hold it in affection for God and for Christ, and you might say for the Spirit. Here the Lord is mentioned as the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. John says, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages." He has washed us from our sins in His blood. That is to say, we are never to return to them, dear brethren. Sin is lawlessness, and sins are just the accumulation and detail of the lawlessnesses, the way in which lawlessness is worked out in detail with every one of us, and He has washed us from our sins in His blood. We are never to return to the principle of lawlessness. He has washed us from it in His blood, in order that He may hold us as a kingdom, under His own protection and His own administration, in view of the service of God.
What I really had in mind is the way the Spirit is presented in John's writings, and so there is this remarkable expression, the seven Spirits before the throne. We get more than once in the book of Revelation the seven Spirits of God, showing that the Spirit is here in fulness of divine power to meet every exigency that arises. It may be that the fact that he says, "the seven Spirits", and there are seven assemblies, is in order to bring home to us in our several localities, however weak the position may be outwardly, that the Spirit in fulness of power is available to us in that locality. The testimony is in localities, and the Spirit is here commensurate to the demands and requirements of the testimony.
Before I proceed, let me just allude to what is well-known, how at the end of each of the seven addresses to the assemblies we have the word, "He that has an ear, let
{239}
him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"; the Spirit speaking to the assemblies. In each of these addresses the Lord is dealing with the particular conditions that He finds in the assembly which He is addressing. In five out of the seven He has something to condemn. In Smyrna and in Philadelphia He has nothing to condemn, but whether He has something to condemn or not, He finishes with this: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the *assemblies*". That is to say, the Lord will adjust things in a locality according to the conditions that He finds there, but having adjusted them He has in mind that that locality, with all the others, should link on with the universal trend of the Spirit's ministry. The Spirit has a voice to "assemblies", in the plural, and he that has an ear is to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. That of course requires spiritual discernment on our side. It involves also that there should be with us a recognition of leadership in the ministry.
Perhaps one could just add in relation to what we have been saying as to the Spirit presented as power to support the rights of God -- as the brethren will remember -- in the 12th chapter of Luke the Lord is contemplating the saints having to appear before rulers or authorities and to give an answer in respect of their faith. He tells them not to prepare beforehand what they should say, for, He says, "The Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said". That is just an example of the way the Spirit is presented in this expression, the seven Spirits before His throne. It is a question of the rights of God being maintained; it may be the refusal to do something which conscience will not allow one to do, but whatever it is, it is a question of the rights of God, of the rights of the throne, and the Spirit is here to support in that relation, and the Lord says, "The Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said".
Now coming to John's epistle, this has not in mind our public position in testimony, but our enjoyment consciously of eternal life. The apostle is speaking of Jesus the Son of God. "This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the
{240}
truth." He then speaks of the three that agree in one witness. "For they that bear witness are three; the Spirit (putting the Spirit first), and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one." They agree in one witness, they all point to one thing, and the witness they agree in is this, as we read later on, "that God has given to us eternal life: and this life is in his Son". Now this is a remarkable expression, "This is he that came by water and blood". He is referring to the death of Christ. He came deliberately to die, in order that in the power of His death we might be set apart from all that attached to us as responsible in flesh and blood here, in order that we might be given life in God's Son. Not by water only, the apostle says. If it were water only, it might be regarded as reforming the first man, as an effort to purify and cleanse the first man. That of course is what the religious world is full of. He says by water and blood. I know that the blood meets the claims of God and effects expiation, but this is a cleansing that is effected by mean of death, and nothing less than death. The blood witnesses to that, that the death of Christ vicariously meant the ending of the man. I know that all will probably accept that as right teaching, but I wonder whether we have all *honestly* accepted it. We ought to accept it; we are not genuine if we do not; it is part of the gospel. Have we really accepted it, that the first man has been ended vicariously in the death of Jesus, in order that God might give us life by the Spirit in His Son? Is not that wonderful? Is not it a great liberation? Is not it dignifying, to think of God's thought, what God has set us up in? He has given us eternal life and we are set up before God in His Son, as it says later in this very chapter, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ". We have a fixed place in the love of God in the Person of His Son; we are set up before Him in His Son. God has not come in to patch up the first man. He has come in in Christ to end his history in death, in order that, receiving the testimony brought to us in the gospel, we might receive the Holy Spirit and be set up before Him in life in His Son. The way God has met the
{241}
situation that came in through the devil is by entering into the situation Himself, first in the Person of Christ and then in the Person of the Spirit. The more you think about it the more wonderful it becomes, that God Himself has entered into the situation, first by bringing in Christ and then by giving the Spirit. God takes us completely out of one order of things and sets us up before Him eternally in His beloved Son. I say, that is a way that is worthy of God, and so he says, We know that the Son of God has come. Oh, what bed-rock that is! "We know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true." The true God stands out before our hearts in the light of His movements toward us in Christ, that we might know Him that is true. "And we are in him that is true." He that dwells in love dwells in God, John says. You come more and more to the sense that we are embraced in God. " ... in His son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life". On the one hand He is God personally, and presents God to us in the light in which He has shone out; on the other hand He is the presentation in Himself as Man of the perfect answer to that. But now the Spirit witnesses to this. It is not a question of stating the truth objectively; the apostle has in mind that we should come consciously into the knowledge that we have eternal life. It is a question of conscious knowledge, and so he says the Spirit is the witness. He then says, "for the Spirit is the truth" -- a remarkable statement. In the gospel of John, Christ Himself is the truth objectively. In the epistle of John, the Spirit is the truth subjectively. I believe that is what we have to come to more and more, dear brethren. It is a question of the extent to which the Spirit personally controls our thoughts, and our affections. The more the Spirit has place with us in a practical way, controlling our thoughts and directing what we shall say in relation to the truth, the more we shall know it is the truth. If a brother stands up and is wholly controlled by the Spirit in his thoughts and words, you may rest assured that what he says is the truth. That is what is so urgent for us now, that we should arrive through exercise at the sensitiveness, each one of us for himself, that is able to discern what is
{242}
of the Spirit and what is not, and to reject in himself thoughts that are not of the Spirit, and commit himself fully to thoughts which are of the Spirit, because the more we move in the Spirit the more we shall be fully assured that what we are moving in, is the truth. The Spirit is the truth.
I come now to this well-known passage in the 14th of John's gospel, because it is a most affecting one, and is intended to establish us in personal appreciation of the Comforter. "The Comforter" is a personal presentation of the Holy Spirit which is peculiar to John's writings. John, of course, refers to the Holy Spirit in many ways, but when we come to this chapter, in which he records, by the Spirit, the Lord's own words, we have this remarkable presentation of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter -- presented in a very personal way, and presented to us in this personal way by the Lord Himself. The Lord Himself is, if one may say so reverently, introducing us to the Spirit and commending Him to us. He would have us know Him and appreciate Him, indeed He says, Ye know Him. It raises the serious question whether we do. Evidently we are intended to know Him. The Lord is contemplating going away, leaving the disciples, and it is an interesting thing that in this chapter the Lord is seen speaking with the disciples, and the disciples speaking with Him, in the greatest liberty. They have difficulties; they do not understand everything, and so they express their difficulties and ask questions of the Lord. Thomas asks Him something, Philip asks Him something, and Judas, not Iscariot, asks Him something -- they are all at perfect liberty to ask the Lord as to difficulties they have, and He answers them. But now He was going away, and they would lose all that, and the Lord says, I will give you another Comforter. That is to say, I will give you the Spirit, who shall be to you what I have been to you. You have been able to ask Me questions, and you have got your questions answered, and you will be able to ask the Comforter questions, and you will get them answered. How could He be another Comforter in place of the Lord Jesus if that were not open to the disciples? Another Comforter to be with you for ever, and not only to be
{243}
with you forever but to be in you. Think of the wonderful intimacy, the nearness of it. Think what it means to have such an One dwelling in us. I admit that we begin to find out that this requires a certain amount of self-examination as to what we are going on with, and as to what we allow in our minds and thoughts and spirits and ways. Because, you see, if you receive a great person into your house you necessarily realise that you have to make preparation, to have things in suitability. If God Himself is coming to take up His abode in us, as He has done, what kind of conditions are we going to provide for Him? Suppose I were to ask you into my house, and you were to come and dwell there -- and the Spirit has come to be with us for ever -- you come into my house and dwell there and I do not speak to you. You speak to me, but I do not answer. How would you feel about it? Would you not feel insulted? The Spirit of God has come in to dwell with us, to take up His abode in us. He is ready to speak, and He is ready to be spoken to. He is ready to be asked questions; He was to be another Comforter. The Lord speaks of Him first of all as "Another Comforter", and then He says, "*The* Comforter". The Lord was going away; He had been a Comforter, and now the Comforter is left with us to guide us into all the truth, as the Lord says, and to enable us to take up in liberty and power all that is open to us that belongs properly to the assembly. These verses have in mind what properly belongs to the assembly -- assembly privilege. John, writing as we have said for the last days, brings it down to very small conditions outwardly -- indeed he brings it down to only one. I have no doubt John in Patmos proved the gain of those words in regard to the Comforter. John is bringing things down to very small compass outwardly, but showing what the Comforter would be in relation to all the truth proper to the assembly, and the privileges open to us in the knowledge of the blessed God.
He not only says that the Spirit should dwell with us and be in us, but then he comes down to what should be known, known objectively by virtue of the Spirit being with us. He says, "In that day" -- the Spirit's day -- "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in
{244}
you". We are dependent on the Spirit for our knowledge of that. It holds true whether we know it or not, but the Spirit will give us to know it. He loves to direct attention to Christ in the position that He is filling as Man in His Father's affections. The Spirit keeps it before our hearts day in and day out, that Christ is where He is, the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father. He is there as Man, that wonderful position of unalloyed affection. I believe, "I am in my Father" goes even beyond that. I believe the Spirit brings home to our hearts that this is He who is in His Person equal with the Father, although having taken in the economy a second place in order that God's thoughts regarding man should be made good. This thought, "I am in my Father", involves, I believe, the truth as to His Person. You will remember how the Lord says in verse 10 of this very chapter, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?" Then again, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the works sake themselves." It is a question of who Christ is in His Person. The more this is before our hearts, and He is known in the glory of His position as Man in the Father's affections, the more the whole wonder of the economy stands out before our hearts, the way that God has conceived to make Himself known in thoughts of infinite blessing to men and to establish those thoughts so that we are brought into them. He establishes them in Christ as Man in His presence, and He gives us the Holy Spirit to set us up before Him in the life of Christ. The Holy Spirit shows us these things, He gives us to know that Christ is in His Father, and we in Him. It is a wonderful thing -- we in Him! It speaks of our place as wholly united to Christ. We have no part, I need not say, in Deity. It is important to keep that steadily in mind, because we are brought so wonderfully near that we have to be preserved in our thoughts. We have our part as united to Christ in His Manhood, but the One with whom we are united in His Manhood is in His Person no less than God. A wonderful thing it is, the way God has taken to bring in an order of manhood wholly suitable to Himself and to have Christ before Him as of that order in glorious
{245}
Sonship, and to bring men through redemption and the gift of the Spirit into a place of union with Christ. So, dear brethren, we are near to God in Christ, as it says, "We are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ". How great these things are, and the Spirit makes them good to us. The Spirit sets them before us, "that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". Christ is in the saints, He dwells in our hearts. The saints are His body; He is there in the saints. What it means for the pleasure of God to see Christ before Him in the saints. A wonderful thing this is that God has brought to pass, and this is what He has given us to have part in now through grace. This is the heavenly calling, and our answer to God in the service of God should be in keeping with it.
One more word and I close. We have this well-known passage in the last chapter, where the Lord presents Himself: "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the assemblies". He has not spoken in this intimate way before in the book. He presents Himself in the beginning in a judicial capacity, involving certain distance between Him and the beloved disciple John, so that when John saw Him he fell at His feet as dead. The Lord immediately reassured him, laying His right hand upon him and saying, "Fear not: I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold I am living to the ages of ages", but still there was that judicial presentation of Christ. But now we come to the end, and He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies. I am the root and offspring of David ". As dear Mr. Taylor has well said, the root is the gospel of John and the offspring is the gospel of Matthew. "And the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say. Come." That is a presentation I think that is peculiar to John; the Spirit seen with the bride and the bride with the Spirit -- the Spirit and the bride. This is the culmination, that which we are coming to. The Spirit is seeking to get His place with us all, that there should be no hindrance whatever to our moving along with Him; nothing to hinder concerted movement with the Spirit, because He wants the Spirit and the bride to arrive at this point, that with just
{246}
one voice they say, "Come" to the Lord Jesus. Are we exercised to take on bridal features? You might say, Well, we love Christ. That may be, but a bride suggests something that is special. We read in @Isaiah 61 about a bride adorning herself with her jewels. Are we concerned to adorn ourselves, beloved brethren, with that which will really be precious in the sight of Christ, or are we careless as to what He would look for? We know in natural things (I am not suggesting in any sense that we should take up worldly habits) a bride wants to look her best on her marriage day, and what will affect her as to what she will put on is what would gratify the heart of her husband. Are we concerned to take on bridal features? It is a good thing to be exercised in wifely features, that there should be faithfulness to the interests of Christ in His absence, and that we are to be in concert with His mind in all things, but what about bridal features, which stand for what is specially refined, adorning with jewels? It says in the 21st chapter, the holy city comes down in eternity prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. That is one of the things connected with the thought of the bride -- being adorned for her husband. Are we concerned as to it? It is time we gave thought to these things, dear brethren, as to whether we are taking on adornment that is suitable to the heart of Christ, the kind of thing He would look for. Jewels to be adorned with are not easily picked up, they cost something, but they are worth having.
The Spirit and the bride say, Come. It seems to me that this scripture brings together the two aspects that we had before us in the previous scriptures. On the one hand, the public aspect, and the word to the Lord Jesus to come is really to come in relation to public conditions in the world and take up His rights where they have been so long denied Him. The Spirit would urge us in that direction. But then I believe there is the private side, linking perhaps more with John's epistle and John's gospel, that we cry, Come, to the Lord Jesus because we want Him, and He wants us. The Spirit and the bride say, Come. Then He says, "Let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely." Another presentation of the Spirit peculiar to
{247}
John's writings -- the water of life; what there is in a living way among the saints in the presence of the Holy Spirit here; the water of life refreshing and constantly fresh; the river of God, it says, is full of water -- no diminution. There is no lack of freshness, and that is what we should be concerned about in our local companies, that as having the Spirit there is a constant flow of that which is fresh and living, so that anyone who thirsts may take of the water of life freely.
Well, beloved brethren, I trust what one has said may stimulate our interest in all that the Spirit is prepared to be to us in these closing days, and if there should be the slightest hesitation on the part of anyone here as to speaking to the Spirit of God, may the Lord deliver you from any such fear or hesitation. There is nothing whatever in scripture contrary to it. There is liberty for it -- where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. There is nothing whatever in scripture against it, and plenty in scripture to indicate that such a thing is pleasing to God; and the way the Lord presents the Comforter in the 14th chapter of John is the greatest possible inducement to us to avail ourselves of His presence and seek to cultivate an intimacy with Him which He will richly reward. May the Lord bless the word.

EXPANSION
J. S. Ephgrave
@John 4: 19 -- 24; @John 20: 14 -- 18; @Revelation 3: 12 -- 13; @Revelation 21: 5 -- 7
The thought of expansion is in mind. Those present at the readings will recall an observation that it is necessary on our side to start at the bottom and to go upwards. It is that remark that has served to help in taking this line tonight. It would be unsuitable, in view of all that has come before us, to go outside the writings of John. He is never, so far as I know, presented in any of his writings apostolically, although he was an apostle. He refers to himself in the apocalypse as a brother -- a delightful word. He indicates himself in his first epistle unquestionably as a father; in the second and third he refers to himself as the elder, but in the gospel narrative he is before us as a lover. The whole trend of the ministry in the narrative is the securing of lovers, and developing in them the power to love more. I venture to say, the more that takes place with us the more happy and easy we shall find our part in the responses which are proper and essential to love's circle.
I wish to make a remark first of all about chapter 1, and the usage of this precious term, "The Word", so that none of us may get astray in our thoughts as we speak of Christ. I refer to the first verse of the chapter, "the Word was God", feeling it is essential that that should be carried with us at every turn in the narrative. Then the fourteenth verse says, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us ... full of grace and truth". This term "the Word", is peculiarly connected with the circle of lovers. I think I
{249}
am right in saying that Luke and John refer to it peculiarly as appreciating the preciousness of Christ as coming into circumstances where He could dwell among certain persons in a certain way. "Dwelt among us" -- the "us" is the circle of the lovers. There are other terms used by persons outside this circle: I might refer to the questions of the synoptic gospels -- @Matthew 13: 35, "Is not this the son of the carpenter?" -- a term of belittlement, with no love behind it. @Mark 6: 3, "Is not this the carpenter?"; and @Luke 4: 22 "Is not this the son of Joseph?" They are all interrogations of belittlement, outside the circle of the lovers. One is concerned that we may all consciously locate ourselves within this circle, so that we have no need to say, "Is not this" -- but we may link on with those who said, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us ... full of grace and truth".
In chapter 2, there is no respect paid to Him -- scarcely patronage. Chapter 3 brings in a certain element of patronage, but little outside that. We come now to this woman to whom reference has been made, but in relation to whom one desires to say something, in order that Christ in the tenderness of His ways in wooing grace would lay hold of her in a suitable way, that she might be numbered among the lovers, for that is the end in view, and I would suggest that this is a beginning at the bottom. Many of us I believe have been guilty of an endeavour to begin at the top. God alone can do that -- as He must do, for if we are to be secured He must come down, come down to where we are, and this He has done in Jesus. So this dialogue proceeds, and what comes to light is most affecting; that the Lord Jesus, He who is earlier said by the lovers to be the Word -- the Word was God -- He is found here in quest of this person, content to accept the appellation "a Jew" -- a very limited term for anybody, but how much more so for One so glorious as He. He did not contradict the woman when she brought the name forward. Neither when she brought in the terms "mountain" and "Jerusalem" did He assume in His language to be anything outside the name she had accorded Him. This is an important matter, a matter that was enquired into this morning. There is a scripture which speaks of
{250}
Him, that "If ... he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest". "For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests." That explains to me why the Lord Jesus, great and glorious as He is, was free to come to the level of this woman's word "worship". Had He employed the other word, it would have betrayed something outside the tribe of Juda. The Lord did not in His circumstances here ever assume to what belonged to the sacerdotal circle. But oh, how much else comes into view, dear brethren; so that He in the presentation of matters to the woman is not exactly emphasising a system. He says, "The hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". Why does He say that? For our sakes: as the writer says at the end of the book, "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name". These things are written for us, and this particular term is to emphasise to us the fundamental necessity of known relationship before we can intelligently enter into matters pertaining to a system. I believe that is why John in this gospel does not refer formally to the assembly, but constantly urges the blessedness of relationships which are essential to its operations. This term, the Father, is one that the woman had never heard before in that mountain, and probably it was never heard in Jerusalem. The Lord takes her right away from both and touches something as to the elevated character of relationship in this word, the Father. "The hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". He then says, "Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews". He keeps to her own language in order to attract her outside a system, false in its character of course, and to make her heart move in the direction of relationship. I believe, dear brethren (and I say this particularly for those who are growing up amongst us -- youths and maidens and young men and young women -- for with the modern course of schooling it becomes naturally easy to adopt terms) the basic essential is known and enjoyed relationship. If I may say it reverently, no one could ever
{251}
be moving here below like Jesus moved in the undimmed joy and satisfaction of His own relationship with the Father, and He is just making this suggestion to this woman at the bottom in order that she might be attracted in this direction. He goes further, and He says, "the hour is coming and *now is*"; as much as to say, you can begin at once. What a word that is. If anyone has not begun at this point, the Lord would say to you, as He said to her, "The hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth". Thank God for the thousands of them that are doing it day by day. Yes, day by day, because worship in this sense is a daily matter. Would that we knew more about it -- an attitude of reverential character to the Father day by day. Oh, how attractive it is. The Lord says, And now is. Would you not like to come into this? Would not you like to have a beginning right here at the very bottom? This word "worship" is largely connected with the bottom. It is a word suggested, I believe, in one of the hymns we sang this afternoon -- prostration of an inferior in the presence of a superior. Think of the greatness, the supremacy of the Father, and then the Lord suggests the supremacy of God, and lays it open that we might have a beginning there on these lines in spirit and in truth. Notice the words He uses. "The hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers *shall* worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers. God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth". I am safe in saying, that a beginning on this line, at the bottom, would save us from many a pitfall in the mere use of technique and formula. What does the woman do? Does she speak about a system? No, she speaks about a Man -- the evidence, I believe, that the truth in so far as it was presented to her had laid hold of her, and she delights to trace it to the Man who brought up before her in powerful measure the whole course of her long history, and she had it out in His presence and she had nothing more to say to it. This is the Man, she says, for me. "Is not he the Christ?" I have a feeling that this is rightly the bottom for all of us. Thank God for those who have begun there,
{252}
and for those who have emphasised to us, as they have sought to serve us in the ministry, the great necessity of a beginning there.
But, as I said, expansion is in mind, and I come to chapter 20, and one is concerned that what is said about it may be suggestive in this direction. Oh, how Mary felt the loss of her Lord. One might say, she felt His absence. Do we feel it? Do we really feel, dear brethren, the way that Christ has gone out? She missed Him, and yet she needed teaching. If one may say so, the key-word in chapter 4 is connected with what is prophetic, because it has largely to do with the conscience. Chapter 20 is linked with teaching, and involves the affections and the mind. We must never divorce these -- never. There is a danger sometimes of doing this. The woman, when she is finished with the angels -- they do not seem to be able to help her -- makes a partial turn and she sees Jesus, but does not know it is He. The Lord was pleased with that movement, even though it was not full. Teaching is a gradual matter; learning, alas, with most of us is exceedingly slow, but I am not prepared to say it was slow with Mary, for she learned a tremendous amount in the course of one day. It is a problem sometimes as to whether some of us learn anything. She says to Him, "Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away". Now, I say brethren, the Lord was pleased with that remark, because it showed she was prepared to move, and He says, Mary. Now she turns right round -- we might say with her back even upon angels -- and her face (I say this reverently) looking straight into the face of Jesus. And what could she see, but this inexpressible love which pervades the circle of the lovers. Why does the Spirit say, Mary said to Him in Hebrew? There was another person who used this term, but it does not say he used it in Hebrew. My own impression is that it links on with this principle of expansion. It suggests the language of one who is prepared to move further. Yes, prepared to move further, and still needing help to do it. Who is to give it to her if it is not the Object of her affections? See how expanding all this is -- you might say compressed into a very few verses -- but it suggests to us
{253}
that if we are ready for teaching, if we are ready for expansion, it is the easiest thing in the world to have it. Many deplore the fact that they find themselves cramped, and there is no reason for it, no reason at all.
The Lord says, in effect, it does not come this way. Mary. You must let Me alone, you must not touch Me, but you must go to the circle of the lovers, for they need expansion as well as you, and you will get more as you find your place amongst them. He then gives her this message as we had it this afternoon, "Go to my brethren". That is a remarkable statement. Many are in danger of analysing these expressions, "My God and your God", without embracing in the holiest of affections and subjection, the grandeur of the statement, "My brethren". Jesus claims us at the level of His own kindred, so that in a certain way all that is His is ours. I say, in a certain way; there are things which are His and not ours, but He is asserting here that what is His in the blessedness of these wonderful relationships is to be ours; it is ours. "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God." If we were expanded in relation to this, could we afford to reduce Him to the level of a creature, and never think of Him in His Own essential relationship and position? The thought is foreign to any lover of Christ. We need expansion in this direction, for it is love that is asserting itself in relation to His kindred. Think of ourselves here, every one who loves Christ; He would claim us and own us as His own kindred, in view of our sharing and enjoying with Him as far as is possible what He has Himself. Does not that make matters attractive to us? This is not the bottom, dear brethren, oh no! There is no time in the shortness of the period allowed for a meeting like this to deal with the stages. You might say that the Lord Jesus is about to go to the top, and as He is doing that He is asserting this great matter. It is the answer I believe to the teaching of the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying, but not now in a figure but in love's assertion. I wonder sometimes if we really receive it. We need the Spirit to enjoy it; do not let us overlook that. Nevertheless the assertion is made by Jesus Himself, and it stands, whether I enjoy it or not. Thank
{254}
God the Spirit has taken His abode in us in order that we may enjoy it. As we make use of the Spirit in relation to the enjoyment of this precious setting, we shall find it very easy to fit ourselves into the service of the system connected with Christ in glory, for once our Lord terminates the condition of flesh and blood, He takes up His place as the great Priest who has passed through the heavens, and the whole matter of system service then begins to develop. I say again, our part in service in that way, in its liberty and freshness, is dependent on the measure of our joy in our normal relationships in this holy circle of love.
I come now to this touch in Revelation. The Lord is addressing the assembly in Philadelphia at the level of love -- not correction. The more we enjoy our place in love's circle, the more we shall appreciate the matter of expansion, and so the Lord speaks, as He does, to the overcomer in Philadelphia of this very principle. He had never said anything like this before. It comes into expression here with those who are enjoying love's circle and are to be expanded in it, because of what is to accrue to God, for our association with Christ, while it goes right through and abides eternally, has in view something distinctly for God Himself. Because these brethren were in the joy of this association, they were empowered to keep His word and not deny His Name. Now He says, "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God". This word temple is the shrine. In the days of His flesh, our Lord kept His place, and is not referred to as in the shrine at any time, but as having gone up; everything is open to the saints. When He speaks of the shrine in the days of His flesh it refers to the temple of His body -- the greatest mystery to the Jews, the religious people, but not to His lovers. "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God". This word pillar not only suggests stability, but ornamentation, and it just seems to indicate that expansion involves ornamentation in the service of God. We use the word refinement, and that enters into it. Then He says, "I will write upon him the name of my God". He is directing them on the principle of expansion, towards finality with all that it
{255}
involves -- to "Go no more at all out". How wonderful it is! "And the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God". How delighted the Lord must have been with an assembly from this viewpoint to present such matters. This is within our reach. The great end in view is God Himself. The Lord says, "My God", and we are to understand that this was always before Him.
Now He says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"; as much as to say, this is to circulate amongst all the saints. It is to find a place in Edinburgh, where we are tonight, and by way of our being here, into all the places where we come from and where we move in relation to the truth. It would be a poor thing if we left these meetings with no sense of expansion. It would be a waste of time, a waste of money, and may I say a waste of the Spirit's service to us here. Expansion does not belong to any but creatures, and it is peculiarly essential in the department of creation to which we belong. We need to encourage one another, and this is what the Lord, the Holy and the True, is seeking to do as He addresses Himself in this way to the overcomer in the circle of enjoyed affection and relationship. The more we enjoy the circle and the relationships that are proper to us, the more we shall be ready for expansion.
I want to observe now this last passage. We might say, Who is the speaker? The allusion is to Him that sat upon the throne, and several allusions in the chapters find certain creatures addressing Him who sat on the throne as, "Our Lord and our God" (4: 11): "To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb." The chapters are extremely interesting, as the living creatures burst forth in chapter 4 at the marvel of God's pleasure in creation; in chapter 5 -- "Thou art worthy ... because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God" (a wonderful circle of persons, yes), "made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth". There is yet another circle whose ascription is completely to the Lamb, and still a wider one whose ascription is to Him that sits upon the throne and to the Lamb. Oh, how wonderful, dear brethren, the thoughts of God are.
{256}
These circles widen out. The greatest expansion is in the inner one, and that is the one to which we belong, because we have been redeemed to God by the blood of the Lamb. I wonder if we really treasure that? Do we really treasure the matter of our being brought back to God, and what is the reason? That we might serve Him in this intimate way -- priests to our God. I venture to suggest that He who sits upon the throne is a back allusion on that line, and now He is speaking. And to whom does He speak? He first of all speaks in a general way, and then He speaks in a personal way to him that overcomes. The allusion to Him who sits upon the throne is to help us to see the necessity, whilst we are still here, to overcome, even though we have the knowledge of what the end will be. The present time is not only the time for expansion, but it is the time for overcoming. So far as I understand, expansion is very closely allied to overcoming. I say that with a certain amount of care, but I believe it is right. "He that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new." And He says, "to me ... Write, for these words are true and faithful ... I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". I feel this allusion to thirsting and the fountain of the water of life freely is to help us to see that the power for expansion and overcoming for us lies in the Spirit. And the final touch -- "I will be to him God". What are we to say about it? Are we to say it is something else, or, simply accept the veracity of the Spirit's language, "I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son." That is now, dear brethren, in the joy of expansion. These things can be touched, and I believe the Spirit's primary urge with us at the present time is in this connection. Let us understand we can never rightly touch the zenith of the matter if we are not prepared to face the moral issues of the gospel and have our beginnings as suggested in the 4th of John.
I trust what has been said may be of some encouragement to all our hearts, and a stimulus to us to set ourselves, with the Lord's help and the Spirit's help, in this positive direction.
