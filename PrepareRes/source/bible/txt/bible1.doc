{#Genesis}
{1}
1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
2  And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
3  And God said, Let there be light. And there was light. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
4  And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness. And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
5  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the first day. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6  And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7  And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse; and it was so. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.
8  And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning -- a second day. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
9  And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear. And it was so. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.
10  And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good.
11  And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12  And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good. And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
13  And there was evening, and there was morning -- a third day. And the evening and the morning were the third day.
14  And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15  and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so. And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16  And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night,  -- and the stars. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
17  And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth, And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
18  and to rule during the day and during the night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.
19  And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fourth day. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
20  And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
21  And God created the great sea monsters, and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
22  And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
23  And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fifth day. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
24  And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
25  And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
26  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27  And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
28  And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you; And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30  and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.
31  And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the sixth day. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
{2}
1  And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2  And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
3  And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
4  These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens, These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
5  and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground. And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.
6  But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
7  And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul. And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
8  And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
9  And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
10  And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main streams. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
11  The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is. The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold;
12  And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx stone are there. And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.
13  And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush. And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same [is] it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
14  And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates. And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.
15  And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
16  And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat; And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
17  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
18  And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like. And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
19  And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof.
20  And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
21  And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
22  And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man. And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
23  And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man. And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
24  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
25  And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not ashamed. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

1  And the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2  And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3  but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not touch it, lest ye die. But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
4  And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly die; And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
5  but God knows that in the day ye eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
6  And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8  And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of the trees of the garden. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
9  And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou? And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art] thou?
10  And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared, because I am naked; and I hid myself. And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.
11  And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat? And he said, Who told thee that thou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12  And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate. And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13  And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14  And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust all the days of thy life. And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16  To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17  And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life; And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;
18  and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
19  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art], and unto dust shalt thou return.
20  And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
21  And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22  And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever...! And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
23  Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24  And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

1  And Man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man with Jehovah. And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
2  And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman. And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
3  And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
4  And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering; And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
5  and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
6  And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen? And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
7  If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
8  And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
9  And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: [Am] I my brother's keeper?
10  And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
11  And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. And now [art] thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
12  When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
13  And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne. And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.
14  Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, [that] every one that findeth me shall slay me.
15  And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him. And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
16  And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden. And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

19  And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah. And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
20  And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle. And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle.
21  And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe. And his brother's name [was] Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
22  And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah. And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain [was] Naamah.
23  And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise. And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
24  If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
25  And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: ...For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him. And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, [said she], hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
26  And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

4  Let now a little water be fetched, that ye may wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it].
29  And he continued yet to speak with him, and said, Perhaps there may be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake.
30  And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry that I speak! Perhaps there may be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it if I find thirty there. And he said [unto him], Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there.
31  And he said, Behold now, I have ventured to speak with the Lord. Perhaps there may be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for the twenty's sake. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake.
32  And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, that I speak yet but this time! Perhaps there may be ten found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for the ten's sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten's sake.
33  And Jehovah went away when he had ended speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place. And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

4  Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from the youngest to the oldest -- all the people from every quarter. But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
5  And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that have come in to thee to-night? bring them out to us that we may know them. And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

9  And they said, Back there! And they said [again], This one came to sojourn, and he must be a judge? Now we will deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard on the man -- on Lot; and drew near to break the door. And they said, Stand back. And they said [again], This one [fellow] came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, [even] Lot, and came near to break the door.
10  And the men stretched out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
11  And they smote the men that were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the smallest to the greatest; and they wearied themselves to find the entrance. And they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12  And the men said to Lot, Whom hast thou here besides? a son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and all whom thou hast in the city -- bring [them] out of the place. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring [them] out of this place:
13  For we are going to destroy this place, because the cry of them is great before Jehovah, and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it. For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
14  And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, Up, go out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he was as if he jested, in the sight of his sons-in-law. And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
15  And as the dawn arose, the angels urged Lot, saying, Up, take thy wife and thy two daughters who are present, lest thou perish in the iniquity of the city. And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16  And as he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him; and they led him out, and set him without the city. And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

19  behold now, thy servant has found favour in thine eyes, and thou hast magnified thy goodness, which thou hast shewn to me in preserving my soul alive; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest calamity lay hold on me, that I die. Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20  Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is small: I pray thee, let me escape thither -- is it not small? -- and my soul shall live. Behold now, this city [is] near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is] it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21  And he said to him, Behold, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken. And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22  Haste, escape thither; for I cannot do anything until thou art come there. Therefore the name of the city is called Zoar. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

25  When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these [belong] am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, whose are this signet, and this lace, and this staff. When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these [are, am] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
26  And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She is more righteous than I, because I have not given her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

21  And Jehovah was with Joseph, and extended mercy to him, and gave him favour in the eyes of the chief of the tower-house. But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
22  And the chief of the tower-house committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the tower-house; and whatever they had to do there he did. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer [of it].
23  The chief of the tower-house looked not to anything under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and what he did, Jehovah made it prosper. The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing [that was] under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and [that] which he did, the LORD made [it] to prosper.
{40}
1  And it came to pass after these things, [that] the cup-bearer of the king of Egypt and the baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. And it came to pass after these things, [that] the butler of the king of Egypt and [his] baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
2  And Pharaoh was wroth with his two chamberlains -- with the chief of the cup-bearers and with the chief of the bakers; And Pharaoh was wroth against two [of] his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
3  and he put them in custody into the house of the captain of the life-guard, into the tower-house, into the place where Joseph was imprisoned. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph [was] bound.
4  And the captain of the life-guard appointed Joseph to them, that he should attend on them. And they were [several] days in custody. And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
5  And they dreamed a dream, both of them in one night, each his dream, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup-bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the tower-house. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which [were] bound in the prison.
6  And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked on them, and behold, they were sad. And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they [were] sad.
7  And he asked Pharaoh's chamberlains that were with him in custody in his lord's house, saying, Why are your faces [so] sad to-day? And he asked Pharaoh's officers that [were] with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye [so] sadly to day?
8  And they said to him, We have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [your dreams], I pray you. And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [them], I pray you.
9  Then the chief of the cup-bearers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine [was] before me;
10  and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded: its blossoms shot forth, its clusters ripened into grapes. And in the vine [were] three branches: and it [was] as though it budded, [and] her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
11  And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. And Pharaoh's cup [was] in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
12  And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days. And Joseph said unto him, This [is] the interpretation of it: The three branches [are] three days:
13  In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee to thy place, and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his cup-bearer. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
14  Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee, and deal kindly, I pray thee, with me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house; But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
15  for indeed I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
16  And when the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also [was] in my dream, and, behold, [I had] three white baskets on my head:
17  And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of victuals for Pharaoh that the baker makes, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head. And in the uppermost basket [there was] of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
18  And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation of it: the three baskets are three days. And Joseph answered and said, This [is] the interpretation thereof: The three baskets [are] three days:
19  In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and hang thee on a tree; and the birds will eat thy flesh from off thee. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
20  And it came to pass the third day -- Pharaoh's birthday -- that he made a feast to all his bondmen. And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cup-bearers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his bondmen. And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
21  And he restored the chief of the cup-bearers to his office of cup-bearer again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
22  And he hanged the chief of the bakers, as Joseph had interpreted to them. But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
23  But the chief of the cup-bearers did not remember Joseph, and forgot him. Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
{41}
1  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
2  And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed-grass. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
3  And behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, bad-looking and lean-fleshed, and stood by the kine on the bank of the river. And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river.
4  And the kine that were bad-looking and lean-fleshed ate up the seven kine that were fine-looking and fat. And Pharaoh awoke. And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
5  And he slept and dreamed the second time; and behold, seven ears of corn grew up on one stalk, fat and good. And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
6  And behold, seven ears, thin and parched with the east wind, sprung up after them. And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
7  And the thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke; and behold, it was a dream. And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.
8  And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the scribes of Egypt, and all the sages who were therein, and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none to interpret them to Pharaoh. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
9  Then spoke the chief of the cup-bearers to Pharaoh, saying, I remember mine offences this day. Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
10  Pharaoh was wroth with his bondmen, and put me in custody into the captain of the life-guard's house, me and the chief of the bakers. Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, [both] me and the chief baker:
11  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each according to the interpretation of his dream. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
12  And there was there with us a Hebrew youth, a bondman of the captain of the life-guard, to whom we told [them], and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each he interpreted according to his dream. And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
13  And it came to pass, just as he interpreted to us, so it came about: me has he restored to my office, and him he hanged. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
14  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph; and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved [himself], and changed his clothes, and came in to Pharaoh. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself], and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
15  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamt a dream, and there is none to interpret it. And I have heard say of thee, thou understandest a dream to interpret it. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
16  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
17  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
18  And behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they fed in the reed-grass. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
19  And behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor, and very ill-formed, and lean-fleshed -- such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness. And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
20  And the lean and bad kine ate up the seven first fat kine; And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
21  and they came into their belly, and it could not be known that they had come into their belly; and their look was bad, as at the beginning. And I awoke. And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
22  And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good. And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
23  And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, parched with the east wind, sprung up after them; And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
24  and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. And I told it to the scribes; but there was none to make it known to me. And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.
25  And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God will do he has made known to Pharaoh. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.
26  The seven fine kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. The seven good kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.
27  And the seven lean and bad kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears, parched with the east wind, will be seven years of famine. And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
28  This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: what God is about to do he has let Pharaoh see. This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
29  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt. Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
30  And there will arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will waste away the land. And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
31  And the plenty will not be known afterwards in the land by reason of that famine; for it will be very grievous. And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.
32  And as regards the double repetition of the dream to Pharaoh, it is that the thing is established by God, and God will hasten to do it. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
33  And now let Pharaoh look himself out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
34  Let Pharaoh do [this]: let him appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty, Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
35  and let them gather all the food of these coming good years, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, for food in the cities, and keep [it]. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
36  And let the food be as store for the land for the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt, that the land perish not through the famine. And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
37  And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his bondmen. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
38  And Pharaoh said to his bondmen, Shall we find [one] as this, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?
39  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has made all this known to thee, there is none [so] discreet and wise as thou. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art]:
40  Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy commandment shall all my people regulate themselves; only concerning the throne will I be greater than thou. Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
41  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
42  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothes of byssus, and put a gold chain on his neck. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
43  And he caused him to ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee! and he set him over all the land of Egypt. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.
44  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
45  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over [all] the land of Egypt.
46  And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh, and passed through the whole land of Egypt. And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
47  And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls. And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
48  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years that was in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the food of the fields of the city, which were round about it, he laid up in it. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which [was] round about every city, laid he up in the same.
49  And Joseph laid up corn as sand of the sea exceeding much, until they left off numbering; for it was without number. And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for [it was] without number.
50  And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On bore to him. And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
51  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh -- For God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
52  And the name of the second he called Ephraim -- For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
53  And the seven years of plenty that were in the land of Egypt were ended; And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
54  and the seven years of the dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said. And there was dearth in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
55  And all the land of Egypt suffered from the dearth. And the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph: what he says to you, that do. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
56  And the famine was on all the earth. And Joseph opened every place in which there was [provision], and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine was grievous in the land of Egypt. And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
57  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph, to buy [grain], because the famine was grievous on the whole earth. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy [corn]; because that the famine was [so] sore in all lands.
{42}
1  And Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
2  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down thither and buy [grain] for us from thence, in order that we may live, and not die. And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
3  And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy [grain] out of Egypt. And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
4  But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest mischief may befall him. But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
5  So the sons of Israel came to buy [grain] among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Israel came to buy [corn] among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
6  And Joseph, he was the governor over the land -- he it was that sold [the corn] to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came and bowed down to him, the face to the earth. And Joseph [was] the governor over the land, [and] he [it was] that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him [with] their faces to the earth.
7  And Joseph saw his brethren, and knew them; but he made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them, and said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
8  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they did not know him. And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
9  And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamt of them; and he said to them, Ye are spies: to see the exposed places of the land ye are come. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
10  And they said to him, No, my lord; but to buy food are thy servants come. And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
11  We are all one man's sons; we are honest: thy servants are not spies. We [are] all one man's sons; we [are] true [men], thy servants are no spies.
12  And he said to them, No; but to see the exposed places of the land are ye come. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
13  And they said, Thy servants were twelve brethren, sons of one man, in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. And they said, Thy servants [are] twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not.
14  And Joseph said to them, That is it that I have spoken to you, saying, Ye are spies. And Joseph said unto them, That [is it] that I spake unto you, saying, Ye [are] spies:
15  By this ye shall be put to the proof: as Pharaoh lives, ye shall not go forth hence, unless your youngest brother come hither! Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
16  Send one of you, that he may fetch your brother, but ye shall be imprisoned, and your words shall be put to the proof, whether the truth is in you; and if not, as Pharaoh lives, ye are spies. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether [there be any] truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye [are] spies.
17  And he put them in custody three days. And he put them all together into ward three days.
18  And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, that ye may live: I fear God. And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I fear God:
19  If ye are honest, let one of your brethren remain bound in the house of your prison, but go ye, carry grain for the hunger of your households; If ye [be] true [men], let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
20  and bring your youngest brother to me, in order that your words be verified, and that ye may not die. And they did so. But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
21  Then they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he besought us, and we did not hearken; therefore this distress is come upon us. And they said one to another, We [are] verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
22  And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the lad? But ye did not hearken; and now behold, his blood also is required. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
23  And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them. And they knew not that Joseph understood [them]; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
24  And he turned away from them, and wept. And he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
25  And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. And thus did they to them. Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
26  And they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed thence. And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
27  And one of them opened his sack to give his ass food in the inn, and saw his money, and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it [was] in his sack's mouth.
28  And he said to his brethren, My money is returned [to me], and behold, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this [that] God has done to us? And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them], and they were afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God hath done unto us?
29  And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father, and told him all that had befallen them, saying, And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
30  The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and treated us as spies of the land. The man, [who is] the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
31  And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies: And we said unto him, We [are] true [men]; we are no spies:
32  we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. We [be] twelve brethren, sons of our father; one [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
33  And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby shall I know that ye are honest: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [for] the hunger of your households, and go, And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye [are] true [men]; leave one of your brethren [here] with me, and take [food for] the famine of your households, and be gone:
34  and bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that ye are not spies, but are honest. Your brother will I give up to you; and ye may trade in the land. And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye [are] no spies, but [that] ye [are] true [men: so] will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

5  Is not this [it] in which my lord drinks, and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil [in] what ye have done. [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
6  And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
7  And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from thy servants to do such a thing! And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
8  Behold, the money that we found in our sacks' mouths we have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
9  With whomsoever of thy servants it is found, let him die; and we also will be my lord's bondmen. With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
10  And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your words: let him with whom it is found be my bondman, but ye shall be blameless. And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
11  And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the ground, and opened every man his sack. Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.

16  And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found. And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found.

22  And we said to my lord, The youth cannot leave his father: if he should leave his father, [his father] would die. And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for [if] he should leave his father, [his father] would die.
23  And thou saidst to thy servants, Unless your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
24  And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
25  And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food. And our father said, Go again, [and] buy us a little food.
26  But we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother [be] with us.
27  And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two [sons]; And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two [sons]:
28  and the one went out from me, and I said, He must certainly have been torn in pieces; and I have not seen him [again] hitherto. And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
29  And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief should befall him, ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to Sheol. And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
30  And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us,  -- seeing that his life is bound up with his life, Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad [be] not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
31  it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not [there], that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad [is] not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
32  For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall be guilty toward my father all my days. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
33  And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren; Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
34  for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me?  -- lest I see the evil that would come on my father. For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
