{#1 John}
{1}
1  That which was from [the] beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
2  (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:) (For the life was manifested, and we have seen [it], and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
3  that which we have seen and heard we report to you, that *ye* also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship [is] indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
4  And these things write we to you that your joy may be full. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
5  And this is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
6  If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
7  But if we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
8  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
9  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us [our] sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10  If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
{2}
1  My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin; and if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ [the] righteous; My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
2  and *he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world. And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of] the whole world.
3  And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
4  He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
5  but whoever keeps his word, in him verily the love of God is perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
6  He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also [so] to walk. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
7  Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard. Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
8  Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines. Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
9  He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now. He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
10  He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
11  But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
12  I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
13  I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father. I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
14  I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
15  Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
16  because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
17  And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
18  Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour. Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
19  They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us: but [they went out], that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
20  And *ye* have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things. But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
21  I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
22  Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
23  Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also].
24  As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father. Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.
25  And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal. And this is the promise that he hath promised us, [even] eternal life.
26  These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray: These [things] have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.
27  and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him. But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
28  And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming. And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
29  If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

1  See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called [the] children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not. Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
2  Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
3  And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
4  Every one that practises sin practises also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
5  And ye know that *he* has been manifested that he might take away our sins; and in him sin is not. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
6  Whoever abides in him, does not sin: whoever sins, has not seen him or known him. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
7  Children, let no man lead you astray; he that practises righteousness is righteous, even as *he* is righteous. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
8  He that practises sin is of the devil; for from [the] beginning the devil sins. To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
9  Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
10  In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil. Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, and he who does not love his brother. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
11  For this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
12  not as Cain was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and on account of what slew he him? because his works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous. Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
13  Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
14  *We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love [his] brother abides in death. We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not [his] brother abideth in death.
15  Every one that hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
16  Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down [our] lives. Hereby perceive we the love [of God], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.
17  But whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him? But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
18  Children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth. My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
19  And hereby we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts before him -- And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
20  that if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
21  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness towards God, Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, [then] have we confidence toward God.
22  and whatsoever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and practise the things which are pleasing in his sight. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
23  And this is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, even as he has given us commandment. And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
24  And he that keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
{4}
1  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
2  Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
3  and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that [power] of the antichrist, [of] which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world. And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
4  *Ye* are of God, children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that [is] in you than he that [is] in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
5  *They* are of the world; for this reason they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
6  *We* are of God; he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
7  Beloved, let us love one another; because love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
8  He that loves not has not known God; for God is love. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
9  Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
10  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.
11  Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
12  No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
13  Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
14  And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son [as] Saviour of the world. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.
15  Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
16  And *we* have known and have believed the love which God has to us. God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
17  Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as *he* is, *we* also are in this world. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
18  There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
19  *We* love because *he* has first loved us. We love him, because he first loved us.
20  If any one say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
21  And this commandment have we from him, That he that loves God love also his brother. And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
{5}
1  Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
2  Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
3  For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
4  For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, [even] our faith.
5  Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God? Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
6  This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus [the] Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth. This is he that came by water and blood, [even] Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
7  For they that bear witness are three: For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
8  the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
9  If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God [which] he has witnessed concerning his Son. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
10  He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself; he that does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
11  And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
12  He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son of God has not life. He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
13  These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
14  And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
15  And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
16  If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request. If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
17  Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
18  We know that every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked [one] does not touch him. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
19  We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked [one]. [And] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
20  And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [is] true; and we are in him that [is] true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
21  Children, keep yourselves from idols. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
