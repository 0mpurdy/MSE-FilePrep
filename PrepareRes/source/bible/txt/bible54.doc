{#1 Timothy}
{1}
1  Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ, according to [the] command of God our Saviour, and of Christ Jesus our hope, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, [which is] our hope;
2  to Timotheus, [my] true child in faith: grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
3  Even as I begged thee to remain in Ephesus, [when I was] going to Macedonia, that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach other doctrines, As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
4  nor to turn their minds to fables and interminable genealogies, which bring questionings rather than [further] God's dispensation, which [is] in faith. Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].
5  But the end of what is enjoined is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith; Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:
6  which [things] some having missed, have turned aside to vain discourse, From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
7  desiring to be law-teachers, not understanding either what they say or concerning what they [so] strenuously affirm. Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
8  Now we know that the law [is] good if any one uses it lawfully, But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;
9  knowing this, that law has not its application to a righteous person, but to [the] lawless and insubordinate, to [the] impious and sinful, to [the] unholy and profane, to smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers; to murderers, Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
10  fornicators, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, perjurers; and if any other thing is opposed to sound teaching, For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
11  according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God, with which *I* have been entrusted. According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
12  [And] I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me power, that he has counted me faithful, appointing to ministry him And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
13  who before was a blasphemer and persecutor, and an insolent overbearing [man]: but mercy was shewn me because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief. Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.
14  But the grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with faith and love, which [is] in Christ Jesus. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
15  Faithful [is] the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom *I* am [the] first. This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
16  But for this reason mercy was shewn me, that in me, [the] first, Jesus Christ might display the whole long-suffering, for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
17  Now to the King of the ages, [the] incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages. Amen. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
18  This charge, [my] child Timotheus, I commit to thee, according to the prophecies as to thee preceding, in order that thou mightest war by them the good warfare, This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
19  maintaining faith and a good conscience; which [last] some, having put away, have made shipwreck as to faith; Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
20  of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme. Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
{2}
1  I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men; I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;
2  for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity; For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
3  for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
4  who desires that all men should be saved and come to [the] knowledge of [the] truth. Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
5  For God is one, and [the] mediator of God and men one, [the] man Christ Jesus, For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
6  who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony [to be rendered] in its own times; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
7  to which *I* have been appointed a herald and apostle, (I speak [the] truth, I do not lie,) a teacher of [the] nations in faith and truth. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
8  I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning. I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
9  In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion, not with plaited [hair] and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing, In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
10  but, what becomes women making profession of the fear of God, by good works. But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
11  Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection; Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
12  but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man, but to be in quietness; But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
13  for Adam was formed first, then Eve: For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
14  and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
15  But she shall be preserved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with discretion. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

1  The word [is] faithful: if any one aspires to exercise oversight, he desires a good work. This [is] a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
2  The overseer then must be irreproachable, husband of one wife, sober, discreet, decorous, hospitable, apt to teach; A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
3  not given to excesses from wine, not a striker, but mild, not addicted to contention, not fond of money, Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
4  conducting his own house well, having [his] children in subjection with all gravity; One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
5  (but if one does not know how to conduct his own house, how shall he take care of the assembly of God?) (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
6  not a novice, that he may not, being inflated, fall into [the] fault of the devil. Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
7  But it is necessary that he should have also a good testimony from those without, that he may fall not into reproach and [the] snare of the devil. Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
8  Ministers, in like manner, grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not seeking gain by base means, Likewise [must] the deacons [be] grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
9  holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
10  And let these be first proved, then let them minister, being without charge [against them]. And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being [found] blameless.
11  [The] women in like manner grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. Even so [must their] wives [be] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
12  Let [the] ministers be husbands of one wife, conducting [their] children and their own houses well: Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
13  for those who shall have ministered well obtain for themselves a good degree, and much boldness in faith which [is] in Christ Jesus. For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
14  These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee more quickly; These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
15  but if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is [the] assembly of [the] living God, [the] pillar and base of the truth. But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
16  And confessedly the mystery of piety is great. God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in [the] Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among [the] nations, has been believed on in [the] world, has been received up in glory. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

1  But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith, giving their mind to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
2  speaking lies in hypocrisy, cauterised as to their own conscience, Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
3  forbidding to marry, [bidding] to abstain from meats, which God has created for receiving with thanksgiving for them who are faithful and know the truth. Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
4  For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing [is] to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving; For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
5  for it is sanctified by God's word and freely addressing [him]. For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
6  Laying these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up. If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
7  But profane and old wives' fables avoid, but exercise thyself unto piety; But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.
8  for bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for everything, having promise of life, of the present one, and of that to come. For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
9  The word [is] faithful and worthy of all acceptation; This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
10  for, for this we labour and suffer reproach, because we hope in a living God, who is preserver of all men, specially of those that believe. For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
11  Enjoin and teach these things. These things command and teach.
12  Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
13  Till I come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
14  Be not negligent of the gift [that is] in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
15  Occupy thyself with these things; be wholly in them, that thy progress may be manifest to all. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
16  Give heed to thyself and to the teaching; continue in them; for, doing this, thou shalt save both thyself and those that hear thee. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
{5}
1  Rebuke not an elder sharply, but exhort [him] as a father, younger [men] as brethren, Rebuke not an elder, but intreat [him] as a father; [and] the younger men as brethren;
2  elder women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity. The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
3  Honour widows who are really widows; Honour widows that are widows indeed.
4  but if any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to be pious as regards their own house, and to render a return on their side to [their] parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
5  Now she who [is] a widow indeed, and is left alone, has put [her] hope in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
6  But she that lives in habits of self-indulgence is dead [while] living. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
7  And these things enjoin, that they may be irreproachable. And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
8  But if any one does not provide for his own, and specially for those of [his] house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than the unbeliever. But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
9  Let a widow be put upon the list, being of not less than sixty years, [having been] wife of one man, Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
10  borne witness to in good works, if she have brought up children, if she have exercised hospitality, if she have washed saints' feet, if she have imparted relief to the distressed, if she have diligently followed every good work. Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
11  But younger widows decline; for when they grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
12  being guilty, because they have cast off their first faith. Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
13  And, at the same time, they learn also [to be] idle, going about to people's houses; and not only idle, but also gossipers and meddlers, speaking things not becoming. And withal they learn [to be] idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
14  I will therefore that the younger marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the adversary in respect of reproach. I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
15  For already some have turned aside after Satan. For some are already turned aside after Satan.
16  If any believing man or woman have widows, let them impart relief to them, and let not the assembly be charged, that it may impart relief to those [that are] widows indeed. If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
17  Let the elders who take the lead [among the saints] well be esteemed worthy of double honour, specially those labouring in word and teaching; Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
18  for the scripture says, Thou shalt not muzzle an ox that treadeth out corn, and, The workman [is] worthy of his hire. For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer [is] worthy of his reward.
19  Against an elder receive not an accusation unless where there are two or three witnesses. Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
20  Those that sin convict before all, that the rest also may have fear. Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
21  I testify before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou keep these things without prejudice, doing nothing by favour. I charge [thee] before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
22  Lay hands quickly on no man, nor partake in others' sins. Keep thyself pure. Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.
23  Drink no longer only water, but use a little wine on account of thy stomach and thy frequent illnesses. Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.
24  Of some men the sins are manifest beforehand, going before to judgment, and some also they follow after. Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some [men] they follow after.
25  In like manner good works also are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise cannot be hid. Likewise also the good works [of some] are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
{6}
1  Let as many bondmen as are under yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed. Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and [his] doctrine be not blasphemed.
2  And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them] because they are brethren; but let them the rather serve them with subjection, because they are faithful and beloved, who profit by the good and ready service [rendered]. These things teach and exhort. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them], because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
3  If any one teach differently, and do not accede to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which [is] according to piety, If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
4  he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, out of which arise envy, strife, injurious words, evil suspicions, He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
5  constant quarrellings of men corrupted in mind and destitute of the truth, holding gain to be [the end of] piety. Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
6  But piety with contentment *is* great gain. But godliness with contentment is great gain.
7  For we have brought nothing into the world: [it is] [manifest] that neither can we carry anything out. For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out.
8  But having sustenance and covering, we will be content with these. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
9  But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many unwise and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and ruin. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
10  For the love of money is [the] root of every evil; which some having aspired after, have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves with many sorrows. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
11  But *thou*, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness of spirit. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
12  Strive earnestly [in] the good conflict of faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
13  I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession, I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and [before] Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
14  that thou keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; That thou keep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
15  which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall shew, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; Which in his times he shall shew, [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
16  who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom [be] honour and eternal might. Amen. Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.
17  Enjoin on those rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust on the uncertainty of riches; but in the God who affords us all things richly for [our] enjoyment; Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
18  to do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in distributing, disposed to communicate [of their substance], That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
19  laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of [what is] really life. Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
20  O Timotheus, keep the entrusted deposit, avoiding profane, vain babblings, and oppositions of false-named knowledge, O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:
21  of which some having made profession, have missed the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen. <<[The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, which is the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana.]>>
