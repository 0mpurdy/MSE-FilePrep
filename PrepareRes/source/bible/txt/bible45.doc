1  Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, [a] called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
2  (which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings,) (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
3  concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
4  marked out Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of [the] dead) Jesus Christ our Lord; And declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
5  by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations, By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
6  among whom are <i>ye</i> also [the] called of Jesus Christ: Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
7  to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [our] Lord Jesus Christ. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
8  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
9  For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
10  always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you. Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
11  For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you; For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
12  that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith [which is] in the other, both yours and mine. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
13  But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
14  I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent: I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
15  so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [are] in Rome. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
16  For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek: For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
17  for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
18  For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
19  Because what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested [it] to them, Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them.
20  -- for from [the] world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, -- so as to render them inexcusable. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
21  Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
22  professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
23  and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles. And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
24  Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves: Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
25  who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever. Amen. Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
26  For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature; For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
27  and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
28  And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things; And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
29  being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers, Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
30  back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
31  void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful; Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
32  who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only practise them, but have fellow delight in those who do [them]. Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

1  Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest, for in that in which thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
2  But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who do such things. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
3  And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them [thyself], that <i>thou</i> shalt escape the judgment of God? And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
4  or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance? Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
5  but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in [the] day of wrath and revelation of [the] righteous judgment of God, But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
6  who shall render to each according to his works: Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
7  to them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal. To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
8  But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [there shall be] wrath and indignation, But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
9  tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek; Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
10  but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek: But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
11  for there is no acceptance of persons with God. For there is no respect of persons with God.
12  For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law, For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
13  (for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
14  For when [those of the] nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves; For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
15  who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;) Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
16  in [the] day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my glad tidings, by Jesus Christ. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
17  But if <i>thou</i> art named a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God, Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
18  and knowest the will, and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
19  and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who [are] in darkness, And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
20  an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law: An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
21  thou then that teachest another, dost thou not teach thyself? thou that preachest not to steal, dost thou steal? Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
22  thou that sayest [man should] not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
23  thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God? Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
24  For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, according as it is written. For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
25  For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [the] law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision. For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
26  If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision, Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
27  and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, [art] a law-transgressor? And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
28  For he is not a Jew who [is] one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh; For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
29  but he [is] a Jew [who is so] inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God. But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.
{3}
1  What then [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision? What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?
2  Much every way: and first, indeed, that to them were entrusted the oracles of God. Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
3  For what? if some have not believed, shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect? For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
4  Far be the thought: but let God be true, and every man false; according as it is written, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment. God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
5  But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak according to man. But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
6  Far be the thought: since how shall God judge the world? God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
7  For if the truth of God, in my lie, has more abounded to his glory, why yet am <i>I</i> also judged as a sinner? For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
8  and not, according as we are injuriously charged, and according as some affirm that we say, Let us practise evil things, that good ones may come? whose judgment is just. And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
9  What then? are we better? No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin: What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
10  according as it is written, There is not a righteous [man], not even one; As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
11  there is not the [man] that understands, there is not one that seeks after God. There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
12  All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as one: They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
13  their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps' poison [is] under their lips: Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
14  whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:
15  swift their feet to shed blood; Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:
16  ruin and misery [are] in their ways, Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
17  and way of peace they have not known: And the way of peace have they not known:
18  there is no fear of God before their eyes. There is no fear of God before their eyes.
19  Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God. Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
20  Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.
21  But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets; But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
22  righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference; Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
23  for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
24  being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [is] in Christ Jesus; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
25  whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
26  for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of [the] faith of Jesus. To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
27  Where then [is] boasting? It has been excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by law of faith; Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
28  for we reckon that a man is justified by faith, without works of law. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
29  Is [God] the God of Jews only? is he not of [the] nations also? Yea, of nations also: [Is he] the God of the Jews only? [is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
30  since indeed [it is] one God who shall justify [the] circumcision on the principle of faith, and uncircumcision by faith. Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
31  Do we then make void law by faith? Far be the thought: [no,] but we establish law. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
{4}
1  What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found? What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
2  For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works, he has whereof to boast: but not before God; For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory; but not before God.
3  for what does the scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
4  Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt: Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
5  but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
6  Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works: Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
7  Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered: [Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
8  blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin. Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
9  [Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. [Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
10  How then has it been reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
11  And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also; And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
12  and father of circumcision, not only to those who are of [the] circumcision, but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith, during uncircumcision, of our father Abraham. And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.
13  For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith. For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
14  For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect. For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
15  For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression. Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.
16  Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all, Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
17  (according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being; (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
18  who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be: Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
19  and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah's womb, And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:
20  and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God; He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
21  and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
22  wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
23  Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him, Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
24  but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among [the] dead Jesus our Lord, But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
25  who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned. Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
{5}
1  Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ; Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
2  by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
3  And not only [that], but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance; And not only [so], but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
4  and endurance, experience; and experience, hope; And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
5  and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [the] Holy Spirit which has been given to us: And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
6  for we being still without strength, in [the] due time Christ has died for [the] ungodly. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
7  For scarcely for [the] just [man] will one die, for perhaps for [the] good [man] some one might also dare to die; For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
8  but God commends <i>his</i> love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
9  Much rather therefore, having been now justified in [the power of] his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
10  For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in [the power of] his life. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
11  And not only [that], but [we are] making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation. And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
12  For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
13  (for until law sin was in [the] world; but sin is not put to account when there is no law; (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
14  but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
15  But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence? For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many. But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
16  And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification. And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.
17  For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:) For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
18  so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life. Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.
19  For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
20  But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded, Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
21  in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

1  What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound? What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
2  Far be the thought. We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
3  Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
4  We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory of the Father, so <i>we</i> also should walk in newness of life. Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
5  For if we are become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of [his] resurrection; For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:
6  knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
7  For he that has died is justified from sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin.
8  Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
9  knowing that Christ having been raised up from among [the] dead dies no more: death has dominion over him no more. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
10  For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
11  So also <i>ye</i>, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
12  Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
13  Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [the] dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God. Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.
14  For sin shall not have dominion over <i>you</i>, for ye are not under law but under grace. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
15  What then? should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Far be the thought. What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
16  Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves bondmen for obedience, ye are bondmen to him whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
17  But thanks [be] to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed. But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
18  Now, having got your freedom from sin, ye have become bondmen to righteousness. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
19  I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh. For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
20  For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
21  What fruit therefore had ye <i>then</i> in the things of which ye are <i>now</i> ashamed? for the end of <i>them</i> [is] death. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.
22  But <i>now</i>, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
23  For the wages of sin [is] death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
{7}
1  Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as he lives? Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
2  For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive; but if the husband should die, she is clear from the law of the husband: For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.
3  so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man. So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
4  So that, my brethren, <i>ye</i> also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among [the] dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
5  For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death; For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
6  but now we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.
7  What shall we say then? [is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust; What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
8  but sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, wrought in me every lust; for without law sin [was] dead. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead.
9  But <i>I</i> was alive without law once; but the commandment having come, sin revived, but <i>I</i> died. For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
10  And the commandment, which [was] for life, was found, [as] to me, itself [to be] unto death: And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.
11  for sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me]. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].
12  So that the law indeed [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
13  Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
14  For we know that the law is spiritual: but <i>I</i> am fleshly, sold under sin. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
15  For that which I do, I do not own: for not what I will, this I do; but what I hate, this I practise. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
16  But if what I do not will, this I practise, I consent to the law that [it is] right. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.
17  Now then [it is] no longer <i>I</i> [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
18  For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell: for to will is there with me, but to do right [I find] not. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.
19  For I do not practise the good that I will; but the evil I do not will, that I do. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
20  But if what <i>I</i> do not will, this I practise, [it is] no longer <i>I</i> [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
21  I find then the law upon <i>me</i> who will to practise what is right, that with <i>me</i> evil is there. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
22  For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man: For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
23  but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
24  O wretched man that I [am]! who shall deliver me out of this body of death? O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
25  I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then <i>I</i> <i>myself</i> with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
{8}
1  [There is] then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus. [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
2  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh, For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
4  in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit. That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
5  For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
6  For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace. For to be carnally minded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace.
7  Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be: Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
8  and they that are in flesh cannot please God. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
9  But <i>ye</i> are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ <i>he</i> is not of him: But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
10  but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness. And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.
11  But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
12  So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh; Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
13  for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live: For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
14  for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
15  For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
16  The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
17  And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him]. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified together.
18  For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
19  For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God: For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
20  for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope,
21  that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
22  For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
23  And not only [that], but even <i>we</i> ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body. And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.
24  For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope? For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
25  But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience. But if we hope for that we see not, [then] do we with patience wait for [it].
26  And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
27  But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.
28  But we <i>do</i> know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose.
29  Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
30  But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
31  What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us? What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?
32  He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
33  Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? [It is] God who justifies: Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? [It is] God that justifieth.
34  who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us. Who [is] he that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
36  According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
37  But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
38  For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
39  nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord. Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
{9}
1  I say [the] truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in [the] Holy Spirit, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
2  that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart, That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
3  for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh; For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
4  who are Israelites; whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises; Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;
5  whose [are] the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, [is] the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came], who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
6  Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel; Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they [are] not all Israel, which are of Israel:
7  nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee. Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
8  That is, [they that are] the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
9  For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah. For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.
10  And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father, And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac;
11  [the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls), (For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
12  it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less: It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
13  according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
14  What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought. What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
15  For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
16  So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy. So then [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
17  For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth. For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
18  So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.
19  Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose? Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
20  Aye, but thou, O man, who art <i>thou</i> that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?
21  Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
22  And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction; [What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
23  and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory, And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
24  us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations? Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
25  As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved. As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
26  And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, <i>Ye</i> [are] not my people, there shall they be called Sons of [the] living God. And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
27  But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved: Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
28  for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth. For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
29  And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha. And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
30  What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith. What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
31  But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to [that] law. But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
32  Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone, Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
33  according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed. As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
{10}
1  Brethren, the delight of my own heart and my supplication which [I address] to God for them is for salvation. Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
2  For I bear them witness that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
3  For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own [righteousness], have not submitted to the righteousness of God. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
4  For Christ is [the] end of law for righteousness to every one that believes. For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
5  For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law, The man who has practised those things shall live by them. For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
6  But the righteousness of faith speaks thus: Do not say in thine heart, Who shall ascend to the heavens? that is, to bring Christ down; But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above]:)
7  or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring up Christ from among [the] dead. Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
8  But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
9  that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the] dead, thou shalt be saved. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
10  For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth confession made to salvation. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
11  For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
12  For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call upon him. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
13  For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
14  How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches? How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
15  and how shall they preach unless they have been sent? according as it is written, How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things! And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
16  But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report? But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
17  So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God's word. So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
18  But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
19  But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, <i>I</i> will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by [them that are] no people, [and] by a foolish nation I will anger you.
20  But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me. But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
21  But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing. But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
{11}
1  I say then, Has God cast away his people? Far be the thought. For <i>I</i> also am an Israelite, of [the] seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin. I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, [of] the tribe of Benjamin.
2  God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel? God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
3  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and <i>I</i> have been left alone, and they seek my life. Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
4  But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Baal.
5  Thus, then, in the present time also there has been a remnant according to election of grace. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
6  But if by grace, no longer of works: since [otherwise] grace is no more grace. And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
7  What [is it] then? What Israel seeks for, that he has not obtained; but the election has obtained, and the rest have been blinded, What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
8  according as it is written, God has given to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, unto this day. (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
9  And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for a gin, and for a fall-trap, and for a recompense to them: And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
10  let their eyes be darkened not to see, and bow down their back alway. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
11  I say then, Have they stumbled in order that they might fall? Far be the thought: but by their fall [there is] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy. I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
12  But if their fall [be the] world's wealth, and their loss [the] wealth of [the] nations, how much rather their fulness? Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
13  For I speak to you, the nations, inasmuch as <i>I</i> am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry; For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
14  if by any means I shall provoke to jealousy [them which are] my flesh, and shall save some from among them. If by any means I may provoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh, and might save some of them.
15  For if their casting away [be the] world's reconciliation, what [their] reception but life from among [the] dead? For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?
16  Now if the first-fruit [be] holy, the lump also; and if the root [be] holy, the branches also. For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches.
17  Now if some of the branches have been broken out, and <i>thou</i>, being a wild olive tree, hast been grafted in amongst them, and hast become a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree, And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
18  boast not against the branches; but if thou boast, [it is] not <i>thou</i> bearest the root, but the root thee. Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
19  Thou wilt say then, The branches have been broken out in order that <i>I</i> might be grafted in. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
20  Right: they have been broken out through unbelief, and <i>thou</i> standest through faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
21  if God indeed has not spared the natural branches; lest it might be he spare not thee either. For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.
22  Behold then [the] goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since [otherwise] <i>thou</i> also wilt be cut away. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
23  And <i>they</i> too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them in. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
24  For if <i>thou</i> hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature, and, contrary to nature, hast been grafted into the good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree? For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree?
25  For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in; For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
26  and so all Israel shall be saved. According as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Zion; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
27  And this is the covenant from me to them, when I shall have taken away their sins. For this [is] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
28  As regards the glad tidings, [they are] enemies on your account; but as regards election, beloved on account of the fathers. As concerning the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.
29  For the gifts and the calling of God [are] not subject to repentance. For the gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.
30  For as indeed <i>ye</i> [also] once have not believed in God, but now have been objects of mercy through the unbelief of <i>these</i>; For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
31  so these also have now not believed in your mercy, in order that <i>they</i> also may be objects of mercy. Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
32  For God hath shut up together all in unbelief, in order that he might shew mercy to all. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
33  O depth of riches both of [the] wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways! O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
34  For who has known [the] mind of [the] Lord, or who has been his counsellor? For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
35  or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him? Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
36  For of him, and through him, and for him [are] all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen. For of him, and through him, and to him, [are] all things: to whom [be] glory for ever. Amen.
{12}
1  I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, [which is] your intelligent service. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.
2  And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of [your] mind, that ye may prove what [is] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
3  For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think; but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
4  For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
5  thus we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other. So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
6  But having different gifts, according to the grace which has been given to us, whether [it be] prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith; Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;
7  or service, [let us occupy ourselves] in service; or he that teaches, in teaching; Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
8  or he that exhorts, in exhortation; he that gives, in simplicity; he that leads, with diligence; he that shews mercy, with cheerfulness. Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
9  Let love be unfeigned; abhorring evil; cleaving to good: [Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
10  as to brotherly love, kindly affectioned towards one another: as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other: [Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
11  as to diligent zealousness, not slothful; in spirit fervent; serving the Lord. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
12  As regards hope, rejoicing: as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering: Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
13  distributing to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
14  Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
15  Rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with those that weep. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
16  Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly: be not wise in your own eyes: [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
17  recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men: Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
18  if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men; If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
19  not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [belongs] to me, <i>I</i> will recompense, saith the Lord. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance [is] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
20  If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
21  Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
{13}
1  Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
2  So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
3  For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it; For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
4  for it is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil. For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil.
5  Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. Wherefore [ye] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
6  For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they are God's officers, attending continually on this very thing. For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
7  Render to all their dues: to whom tribute [is due], tribute; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
8  Owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
9  For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
10  Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore [is the] whole law. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.
11  This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that <i>we</i> should be aroused out of sleep; for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed. And that, knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.
12  The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
13  As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
14  But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to [fulfil] the lusts [thereof].
{14}
1  Now him that is weak in the faith receive, not to [the] determining of questions of reasoning. Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations.
2  One man is assured that he may eat all things; but the weak eats herbs. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
3  Let not him that eats make little of him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
4  Who art <i>thou</i> that judgest the servant of another? to his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
5  One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind. One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
6  He that regards the day, regards it to [the] Lord. And he that eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, [it is] to [the] Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it]. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
7  For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
8  For both if we should live, [it is] to the Lord we live; and if we should die, [it is] to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
9  For to this [end] Christ has died and lived [again], that he might rule over both dead and living. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
10  But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou make little of thy brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
11  For it is written, <i>I</i> live, saith [the] Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God. For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
12  So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
13  Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way.
14  I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean, to that man [it is] unclean. I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.
15  For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ has died. But if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
16  Let not then your good be evil spoken of; Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
17  for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in [the] Holy Spirit. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
18  For he that in this serves the Christ [is] acceptable to God and approved of men. For he that in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to God, and approved of men.
19  So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace, and things whereby one shall build up another. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
20  For the sake of meat do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil to that man who eats while stumbling [in doing so]. For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence.
21  [It is] right not to eat meat, nor drink wine, nor [do anything] in which thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak. [It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
22  Hast <i>thou</i> faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not judge himself in what he allows. Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
23  But he that doubts, if he eat, is condemned; because [it is] not of faith; but whatever [is] not of faith is sin. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.
{15}
1  But <i>we</i> ought, we that are strong, to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
2  Let each one of us please his neighbour with a view to what is good, to edification. Let every one of us please [his] neighbour for [his] good to edification.
3  For the Christ also did not please himself; but according as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me. For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
4  For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope. For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
5  Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus; Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
6  that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. That ye may with one mind [and] one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7  Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to [the] glory of God. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
8  For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers; Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers:
9  and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among [the] nations, and will sing to thy name. And that the Gentiles might glorify God for [his] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
10  And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people. And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
11  And again, Praise the Lord, all [ye] nations, and let all the peoples laud him. And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
12  And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over [the] nations: in him shall [the] nations hope. And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
13  Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by [the] power of [the] Holy Spirit. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
14  But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
15  But I have written to you the more boldly, [brethren,] in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God, Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
16  for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the [message of] glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit. That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
17  I have therefore [whereof to] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God. I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
18  For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for [the] obedience of [the] nations, by word and deed, For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
19  in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ; Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
20  and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another's foundation; Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:
21  but according as it is written, To whom there was nothing told concerning him, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand. But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
22  Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you. For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
23  But now, having no longer place in these regions, and having great desire to come to you these many years, But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
24  whenever I should go to Spain; (for I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward thither, if first I shall have been in part filled with your company;) Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your [company].
25  but now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints; But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
26  for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in Jerusalem. For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
27  They have been well pleased indeed, and they are their debtors; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also in fleshly to minister to them. It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
28  Having finished this therefore, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will set off by you into Spain. When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
29  But I know that, coming to you, I shall come in [the] fulness of [the] blessing of Christ. And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
30  But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God; Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me;
31  that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea; and that my ministry which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
32  in order that I may come to you in joy by God's will, and that I may be refreshed with you. That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
33  And the God of peace be with you all. Amen. Now the God of peace [be] with you all. Amen.
