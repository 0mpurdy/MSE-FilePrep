1  Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman, Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
2  and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which [is] in thine house. And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
3  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4  I thank my God, always making mention of thee at my prayers, I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
5  hearing of thy love and the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints, Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
6  in such sort that thy participation in the faith should become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in us towards Christ [Jesus]. That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
7  For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
8  Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what is fitting, Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
9  for love's sake I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ. Yet for love's sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
10  I exhort thee for *my* child, whom I have begotten in [my] bonds, Onesimus, I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
11  once unserviceable to thee, but now serviceable to thee and to me: Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
12  whom I have sent back to thee: [but do *thou* receive] him, that is, *my* bowels: Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
13  whom *I* was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings; Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
14  but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind, that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness: But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
15  for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [from thee] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for ever; For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
16  not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother, specially to me, and how much rather to thee, both in [the] flesh and in [the] Lord? Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
17  If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [with thee], receive him as me; If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
18  but if he have wronged thee anything or owe anything [to thee], put this to my account. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;
19  *I* Paul have written [it] with mine own hand; *I* will repay [it]: that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine own self also to me. I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
20  Yea, brother, *I* would have profit of *thee* in [the] Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
21  Being confident of thine obedience, I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say. Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
22  But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers. But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
23  Epaphras salutes thee, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus; There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
24  Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workmen. Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
25  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen. <<[Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.]>>
