PRESERVATION IN LIFE
J. G. Frame
@Joshua 14: 6 - 15; @Deuteronomy 6: 20 - 24; @Proverbs 4: 1 - 4, 10 - 13; @Jude 20, 21
I would like to speak from these scriptures about being preserved in life. It is important that we should be preserved here in spiritual life amidst a scene where the deadening influences of Satan abound. Believers need to have before them the sphere where Christ is, in glory. Scripture speaks of our life being "hid with the Christ in God" (@Colossians 3: 3). What a great matter it is to lay hold of that truth. In @Romans 6, it says, "in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God" (verse ). What a thing to get a hold of in your soul -- that Christ is living to God! We are to live to God too. The apostle Paul could say, "but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20). May we be exercised to be maintained in life and able to enter into the enjoyment of the heavenly things that God has in mind for us.
I read this portion in @Joshua 14 to illustrate the fact that Caleb was a person who was conscious that God had kept him alive in the midst of so much unbelief. The men that had gone up with Joshua and Caleb to search out the land were marked by unbelief, and were not prepared to go into the land again. Caleb had the land in his heart. Joshua and Caleb said, "The land … is a very, very good land" (@Numbers 14: 7). Oh! that we might have a fuller impression of
{2}
the richness and fulness of that land that is beyond the Jordan. It typifies the heavenly land where Christ is, the sphere which divine Persons have purposed that we should enter. That is the land Caleb had in his heart. He had it by faith in his heart through the wilderness; he could speak well of it and bear witness of it.
Caleb reminds Joshua of what had been said before. He says, "Thou knowest the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses … concerning me and thee". There was a two-fold witness in Joshua and Caleb of what Moses the man of God had said. Caleb says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart. And my brethren that had gone up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God". I commend it to every one here, that we should acquire a knowledge of God, so that we can each say, 'My God', as having relations with Him.
We are to know God and His love. "If any one love God, *he* is known of him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 3). God would have us to be whole-hearted. The unbelief of others did not turn Caleb aside. How many, alas, have been turned aside! We need to keep our eye on Christ and on that sphere of blessing, the land. Moses swore to Caleb that day that the land whereon he stood would be his and his children's assuredly. Caleb was in no doubt whatsoever. He was holding fast and could bear witness to the fact that God was with him and would bless him and his household too.
That is what we look for, beloved, that the saints and their households should be blessed. These dear young people are growing up in a place of wonderful
{3}
privilege; may they be preserved from the world, for there are terrible things going on there. May the young be preserved as growing up among the saints where God is known and where the things of God are spoken about and cherished. It is a wonderful thing in our household readings to have the impression of how God can help and encourage us. It gives a wonderful sense of victory, as passing through such a world as we are in.
At eighty-five years of age, Caleb was still strong. He had not lost any of his strength. I think that flowed from the maintenance of his links with God. Our spiritual strength lies in waiting upon God in order that we might be maintained here until the Lord comes to take us to be with Himself in glory. We have, as it were, to dispossess enemies who have no right to be in the land. We have to understand that, until the end of our christian pathway, there will be conflict, and we need to understand that we are to take our part in it. We are to go out for war in dependence upon God, and come in to enjoy the fruits of the land. In addition, Caleb being a man of faith, asks for the mountain that God had spoken of.
That is an important matter. God had in mind for His people to bring them into the mountain of His inheritance, and Caleb lays hold of it in faith, even though the Anakim were there. He says, "If so be Jehovah shall be with me, then I shall dispossess them". Those who are with God and move in dependence upon Him, are strengthened by the Spirit to lay hold of the inheritance. I commend that to
{4}
each one of us at this time, so that we may lay hold of the purpose of God, and enter into the enjoyment of it with one another. Caleb's inheritance, Hebron, was built "seven years before Zoan in Egypt" (@Numbers 13: 22). It thus, typically, antedates the whole world system, and Caleb had the light of another world in his soul.
The inheritance is something we can enjoy together; it is both present and future. The Spirit is "the earnest of our inheritance" (@Ephesians 1:), and before we enter into the fulness and blessedness of God's purpose, He gives us a foretaste of it even now. How blessed it is to share these things! God would help us to enjoy with one another the great things that He has designed for us in the purpose of His love. How great it is! So it repeats, "Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb … to this day, because he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel". Note that: "the God of Israel". God always had the whole twelve tribes before Him, and, despite the defection of the two-and-a-half tribes, He would bring about His purposes and bless His people. That is what He had in mind.
What a man Caleb was! We have no record of his death. That may suggest continuity in the maintenance of what he represents. He said, "Jehovah has kept me alive". May we all have a sense of that; God is keeping us alive in relation to a spiritual order of things which is for His pleasure, which exists in the power of the Spirit, and which we can enjoy with one another. The psalmist says, "dwell in the land,
{5}
and feed on faithfulness" (@Psalm 37: 3). These words are to encourage our hearts.
In the scripture in @Deuteronomy 6, God anticipates that the young would raise questions. "When thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?" The young persons would, no doubt, see what their parents are enjoying, and ask what led them into the understanding and enjoyment of these things. What a blessed matter it is, if we are marked by obedience to God's commands and testimonies. All this is in view of the preservation of life. I believe that is what God has in mind in these days.
So the children of Israel were to say that they had been delivered: "We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a powerful hand; and Jehovah shewed signs and wonders". We should all be able to speak a little of the wonderful deliverance God has effected for us through the death of Christ, and in the power of the blessed Holy Spirit. He would give us some appreciation of Christ as the great Deliverer of His people.
And then we have this beautiful touch -- and we need to be reminded of it: "and he brought us out thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers". Let us have that continually before us. God brought us out -- that is one part of His operations in the glad tidings -- extricating us from evil in ourselves and the world system. It was all in view of bringing us, typically,
{6}
into the land flowing with milk and honey, "the land which he swore unto our fathers".
So we have the apostles¬ teaching (@Acts 2: 42) and Paul's teaching (@2 Timothy 3: 10) which have been handed down to us, and we can be thankful for that. Many of us have an appreciation of what has come down to us through spiritual fathers. We have had rich impressions of the enjoyment that belongs to the land. And Moses says, "Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good continually". May we understand what is for our good; God acts as a Father to us, and in His tender care and love toward us He may pass us through circumstances that perhaps are not congenial to us, but it is in view of bringing us to know His love better, and to bring us into the sphere which His love has designed for us.
Then it says, "that he might preserve us alive, as it is this day". May we be preserved in life, through however many days may ensue in the history of the testimony. Apostasy is increasing on every hand, but God has in mind to maintain in His people a testimony to life. What a great matter that is, to see that the saints are going through such a world and being preserved in life because they have their aspirations and longings in relation to another world, where Christ is, in glory. What an object for our souls!
That feature comes out in Joseph at the end of Genesis. He says to his brethren, "Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as it is this day, to save a great people
{7}
alive" (@Genesis 50: 20). So you can see how prominent this thought is with God, that His people should be preserved in life. It is our privilege thus to love God and obey His commandments in view of being preserved at the present time.
In the scripture in @Proverbs 4, it is a father that is speaking. Think of the tender appeal that comes out in this scripture. "Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father". Oh! how God loves to instruct us. If we are to be instructed, we must be obedient, and in subjection, and pay attention to what God is saying. As we understand that it is a Father's love that is behind it all, it makes it easier for us to accept it. It says, "attend". We have to attend to these things, and as we do we shall prove that "the liberal soul shall be made fat" (@Proverbs 11: 25).
It says, "I give you good doctrine". May we learn the good doctrine in the presence of fathers who know God. That is what marks fathers -- they know God, and have proved Him, and are able to give good doctrine, so that we who follow in their footsteps may be preserved in life. Then he says, "forsake ye not my law". What an appeal that is! Remember how God appealed to His people of old, and how He watched over them in the wilderness in view of their preservation. "Forsake ye not my law". May we understand that is a "law": The word means 'teaching' (footnote *f*). Love lies behind a Father's law. There is a man in @Psalm 119 who loved God's statutes and His commandments. That is the kind of man that is able to have part in the service of God.
{8}
"For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother. And he taught me". What a great matter it is to come under divine teaching! The Lord Jesus said in @Matthew 23, "one is your instructor, the Christ" (verse 10). How blessed it is to sit at the feet of Jesus, as Mary did, and to listen to His word (@Luke 10: 39). It is important that we should set aside a part of our life daily to pay attention to what the Lord is saying, and to receive divine instruction. If you have come to that in your soul, then you will not be moved, nor swayed by "every wind of *that* teaching, which is in the sleight of men" (@Ephesians 4: 14), such as is about today. I commend it to each one of us at this time. We, as believers, are all children of God. Let us heed the exhortation, "Hear, ye children". We have come into a wonderful relationship as children of God, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ. We will soon be with Him and share with Him in that wonderful scene where He will be supreme.
Then it says "Hear" again in verse 10: "Hear, my son, and receive my sayings". I think it is very important that we give place to the Spirit if we are to receive these precious things. What preservation lies in that! Many of us have proved it. How wayward we have been, yet God in His love and tender care has instructed us in the way that we should go, so that we might be preserved in life in view of giving pleasure to Him. I think that is what God has in mind in these verses.
There are other blessed features: it says, "Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out
{9}
of it are the issues of life" (verse 23). I think that is God's great appeal at the present time, that His people might be maintained in life, in the enjoyment of the heavenly calling. May it be our portion to continue in these things. That involves that we may have to be adjusted sometimes in the acceptance of God's will, but the result is that we come into a fuller knowledge of God Himself and are able to serve Him more acceptably. Discipline is necessary for each one of us. We may not like it at the time, but as we accept it there will be results for God. That is what God would have in mind.
Now, in our last scripture, Jude is writing, in a dark day testimonially, about what has come in among believers. He speaks of those who "have gone in the way of Cain, and given themselves up to the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core" (verse 11). These three examples are set before the people of God, so that we might take warning. He says, "But *ye*, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they said to you, that at the end of the time there should be mockers, walking after their own lusts … not having the Spirit" (verses 17 - 19).
Again he says, "But *ye*, beloved". Now he addresses the saints in this endearing way because of his affection for them. Jude tells us at the outset that he meant to speak of "our common salvation", but he had to turn aside and to write "exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints" (verse 3). Oh! may we indeed hold fast to that
{10}
which has been committed to us. "The faith" involves a system of teaching by which, if we are subject to it, we will be preserved in life and kept here for the pleasure of God.
Then Jude speaks of the antidote: "building yourselves up on your most holy faith". Jude stresses holiness: "holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord" (@Hebrews 12: 14). Holiness is an absolute necessity as we have to do with God. It says in regard to His house, "holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever" (@Psalm 93: 5). There is no relaxation of that matter, because God is a holy God. It is important to become more acquainted with the faith, the christian faith, and how it has come down to us through the apostles¬ doctrine. The Spirit is unfolding in these days the great things of God. He is opening up to the saints an order of things in which they will be preserved here in a scene of rising apostasy. Jude has in mind the preservation of the saints.
Another feature of the last days is "praying in the Holy Spirit". What a need there is to be cast upon Him for help and instruction in relation to what may come into the pathway here. What a great matter it is to know the Holy Spirit as One who dwells in us. He is One to whom we can appeal, and we should be here as those who are continually praying in the Holy Spirit. "Keep yourselves in the love of God". We are to be in that state, always enjoying the love of God who has purposed us for blessing. Then we can enter into something of the fulness and blessedness of God's love as it has reached us in Christ, and
{11}
appreciate His giving us the Holy Spirit as Comforter to help us here below. He is the One we are to know. "Ye know him", the Lord says (@John 14:). We are to know the help that He can afford as we are subject to the will of God.
Jude says, "awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life". We are looking forward to that. Wonderful mercy has been shown us. I believe we need to deepen in a sense of divine mercy that has taken each one of us up, while passing others by, and has preserved us here right up to the present time.
May we be encouraged by these thoughts, and, like Caleb, continue in the line of faith, be prepared to receive the instruction of a father, and take advantage of these features that Jude brings before us, so that we may be preserved in life until that moment when the Lord will come and take us to be with Himself.
May He help us, and bless His word, for His Name's sake!

MANHOOD
J. Taylor
@1 Corinthians 14: 20, 21; @Ephesians 4: 7 - 16
I desire to say a word about manhood, the divine thought being that God should surround Himself with men, with families no doubt, but with men, for it is said as the heavenly city comes down from God out of heaven, that "the tabernacle of God is with men" (@Revelation 21: 3). So that God's thought for us now
{12}
is that we should be men; although we have to begin as babes, we are not to remain babes, for there is nothing said as to babes in that world. God has men before Him.
So, in coming to the New Testament what is presented is a Man. The saints in the Old Testament times could not be men in the sense in which I am speaking, except in a typical way. I have no doubt that Jacob, in type, arrived at manhood in the wrestling with the angel. He had strength, and he received a name which indicated manhood, his name being changed from Jacob to Israel, for "thou hast wrestled with God, and with men, and hast prevailed" (@Genesis 32: 28). So we find that Jacob, in his interview immediately after with Esau, has tender sympathies that belong to manhood. These are expressed to those who come under his care.
Esau proposes that Jacob should accompany him. No! Jacob says, the children are young and tender, and the flocks too. We do well to take that in. We have to take account of the weakest. I may go on in my own soul with God, but I cannot leave the weakest behind. Jacob had had to do with God alone -- the children were not there, the cattle were not there, they had all gone over the brook; they had gone on ahead; but a Man wrestled with Jacob until the break of day. God would have to say to him, and weaken him, but Jacob's weakness was his strength, for immediately afterwards he takes account of the weak ones of the flock.
So the stronger I am spiritually the more I shall
{13}
be content to wait. I shall not lose anything by waiting, for I cannot lose anything if I am with God, but I can be content to wait for the weak ones. Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and go on, and I will go before thee". Jacob replied, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and the suckling sheep and kine are with me; and if they should overdrive them only one day, all the flock would die" (@Genesis 33: 12, 13). There must be no overdriving in the things of God.
As regards my own progress, let no one stop me. As the apostle says to the Galatians, "who has stopped you?" (@Galatians 5: 7). Ye did run well. Let no one interfere with my spiritual progress, but if there be children, young and tender, what about them? Is my agility to become their death? We all understand what kind of man Esau was, a man of the field, an athlete, one might say. His pace would be too much for the little ones, and so the man who had just wrestled with God thought for the little ones and the flocks.
Now these are the exercises of a man, for Jacob had become that, and he took account of the little ones, and thus those who are with God today, those who are developed into manhood, will take account of the little ones, for the weakest amongst us must necessarily retard our outward progress. We have to tarry, "wait for one another" (@1 Corinthians 11: 33). We all know how in the world those who have the care of the young and the sick must have patience.
When we come to the New Testament, we come to manhood. Saints in the Old Testament could not possibly arrive at manhood, being kept under tutors
{14}
and governors until the time appointed of the Father (@Galatians 4: 2). They were kept there. It was a matter of God's appointment. They, under the old covenant, could not be perfect, for the law made nothing perfect, not even a David or an Isaiah (@Hebrews 11: 40). They without us could not be made perfect. We must come first; those who form the assembly must have the first place.
So when you come to the gospels what is presented to you, what the soul finds, is manhood. The Lord is presented to us in the perfection of manhood. He looks up into heaven and the Spirit of God comes down in the form of a dove, and the voice from heaven says, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3: 17). Then we are told, that He is "led" (@Luke 4: 1), or "carried up" (@Matthew 4: 1), by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. @Mark 1: 12 says, "the Spirit drives him". He does not go there, but is carried, reminding us that true manhood according to God does not take up evil unless the Holy Spirit leads him to it. The Lord is carried into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, but then He returns from the wilderness "in the power of the Spirit" (@Luke 4: 14). He returned and came unto Nazareth, "where he was brought up".
He is now in full levitical manhood, and He takes up His levitical work. The book of the Scriptures is handed to Him, and He sets before us an example of levitical perfection in that He finds the scripture that fitted the position He occupied. He was there to
{15}
announce the gospel. It was to be announced in Him, in full levitical manhood, and He finds the place and announces that "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears" (@Luke 4: 21). There is the perfection of levitical manhood in Christ. He is presented to us as a Model, and so one would seek to lead to this, that we may apprehend Christ as He is presented in the gospels, for directly one arrives at manhood one finds oneself in the gospels. The epistles set us free, so to speak, to go to the gospels. When the epistles treat of the Old Testament, they employ it generally in the way of relief, that our souls should be relieved; whereas the gospels, in the main, especially as the Lord uses them, present the Old Testament as it speaks of Christ.
How do you read the Old Testament? A young believer is likely to read it in the light of the epistles; a mature believer will read it in the light of the gospels, because it presents Christ. Do you read the Old Testament thus? It says the Lord began at Moses; that is, the Pentateuch, including Genesis; He began there and in all the prophets "he interpreted ... the things concerning himself" (@Luke 24: 27); you have there an inexhaustible mine and storehouse for your soul.
So the Lord says to the Jews, "Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me" (@John 5: 39). Let the Old Testament have its place with us. It testifies of the Lord. Thus, too, it is quite right to read the Old Testament in regard to the needs of one's soul. The apostle says in Timothy,
{16}
"Every scripture is ... profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (@2 Timothy 3: 16). You ask, Is the first chapter of 1 Chronicles profitable, all that list of names? Yes, that is profitable; it is divinely inspired.
A brother once wrote to me referring to the New Testament as 'where only we get christian doctrine', as if the Old Testament has nothing to say to christian doctrine. We need doctrine, because the affections are set up in their proper course by doctrine. And reproof, do we not need reproof? Is it not profitable for correction? Yes, profitable for correction. And is it profitable for instruction in righteousness? Yes, profitable for that too, that the man of God may be "fully fitted" (@2 Timothy 3: 17), that he might be perfect, according to God.
What exercises me is the poverty of one's service when one thinks of others who have served, and it is a wholesome exercise to compare yourself in your service with others. The word is "Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith" (@Hebrews 13: 7). It is a wholesome thing to take account thus of those who have ministered to us the word of God. What humbles us helps us. The Old Testament is given us that the man of God might be furnished, fully furnished, unto every good work. That is what the Old Testament is for in regard to the building up of our souls.
Then there is the other side, "they it is which bear witness concerning me" (@John 5: 39). The eunuch
{17}
reads @Isaiah 53. He is reading about a Man, and he says to Philip, "concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other?" (@Acts 8: 34). And Philip began at that scripture and "announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him"; Jesus! The Man. He read the scripture, "he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers" (@Isaiah 53: 7). What a word for that Ethiopian! What a word, what a consolation for that man!
It says in the Psalms, "I am as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs" (@Psalm 38:). What a word in regard to our difficulties. And so John says, in referring to that same scripture, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him" (@John 12: 41). Isaiah spoke of Jesus, for "the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus" (@Revelation 19: 10). Then let us read the prophets in the light of all that. Isaiah saw His glory. He spoke of it. He spoke of the glory of Christ.
So with Abraham, I take these two instances. The Lord says, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced" (@John 8: 56). He saw Messiah. I have no doubt he saw it on the day that Isaac was weaned (@Genesis 21: 8). He made a great feast for Isaac; Isaac was everything on that occasion, foreshadowing the time when the true Isaac shall fill this place, when all shall revere Him. These instances illustrate what the Lord had before Him.
The Lord, in speaking to the two going to Emmaus, expounds the Old Testament as testifying to Himself (@Luke 24: 27). The gospels alone present
{18}
the Man fully. So when the epistles have done their work in the soul, one appreciates the gospels. Thus true manhood in the believer is nourished and maintained. It says, "Brethren ... in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" -- in your minds (@1 Corinthians 14: 20). Malice is a terrible thing and it crops up; it is one of the things which is innate in the human heart. So at Corinth the apostle speaks of the old leaven of malice and wickedness. "In malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men", not merely men.
If the epistles have served their purpose in removing the grave clothes from us, where do we go? You remember how the Lord said, "Loose him". That is the service the epistles render. "Loose him and let him go" (@John 11: 44). If I go to Romans I get the word of righteousness. Romans is to set me free from that state. It sets my soul in exercise so that I become practically righteous all the rest of my days. Love in Romans is said to be the fulfilling of the law (chapter 13: 8). Romans teaches us "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" (@Romans 8: 4). Hence it sets my soul in exercise as to the claims of God and what I owe to the brethren, so that I cease to be a babe, and have my senses exercised to discern between good and evil. Why is it we cannot see the simplest things at times? Because our senses are not "exercised for distinguishing both good and evil" (@Hebrews 5: 14). If I discern between good and evil, then I forsake the evil and cleave to the good.
{19}
Now consider fellowship. There are different fellowships in the world, but "our fellowship", the fellowship to which we are called, is the fellowship of God's Son (@1 Corinthians 1: 9). He is Son over God's house (@Hebrews 3: 6). You cannot limit the Son of God to a locality. Paul preached that Jesus is the Son of God. The Son of God is over the house of God, Son over God's house. If I am called to the fellowship of God's Son, it is *general* fellowship, it includes *all* the saints. How then can I have fellowship *locally* if I have not got it *generally*?
Well now, 1 Corinthians helps me as to fellowship. Colossians enables me to enter Canaan, hindrances being taken out of the way. The latter is very much like @John 12. The Lord said of Lazarus, "Loose him and let him go" (@John 11: 44), and then we find him in Bethany; they make the Lord a supper there (chapter 12: 2). Nothing hinders the activity of love in Bethany now. The shadow of the grave is gone, it is no longer there, not a word about that. The position there is almost entirely in keeping with what the saints do. There is no evidence that it was not agreeable to Christ. Martha is not cumbered now, for it is a resurrection scene. The hindrances are all gone. Colossians takes everything out of the way so that the way to heaven is opened up. And now, if I am loosed, where do I go?
They were marked at Bethany by keeping with Christ. Martha served and Lazarus was one of those at the table with Christ, and Mary had the ointment. Mark you, she had "kept" it (verse 7). It was not a
{20}
matter of impulse, not something procured that day. She had kept it in view of the Lord's burial, and she anointed His feet. She knew that those feet were to carry her Lord to death; Mary had thought about it. He says, "Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial" (@John 12: 7). His burial was very precious in her mind, and the Lord felt it.
If one is released, where does one go? I apprehend that we go to the gospels, for there we find Christ in the perfect way in which the Holy Spirit presents Him for our affections. I appeal to you as to this, that God would have us to be "grown men". In Ephesians the apostle presents the ascended Man as giving gifts for the "edifying of the body of Christ" (@Ephesians 4: 12). I love to think of the way the apostle includes all the saints: "until we all arrive", he says.
In Colossians he says, "whom *we* announce ... that we may present every man perfect in Christ" (@Colossians 1:). Think of the scope of his ministry. See how the gifts came down from heaven in Ephesians for "the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive …" Notice that it is not 'until we are brought'. It does indeed say that He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". That is chapter 2: 6, but I read from chapter 4: 13, "until we all arrive", that is my movement. Ministry is the presentation of Christ to you; the next move is yours. Ministry presents perfection in Christ.
Philippians is the other side to this, "I pursue,
{21}
looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (chapter 3: 14). He pressed forward. Thus ministry is in order that you and I may move on "until we all arrive". Arrive at what? "The knowledge of the Son of God" (@Ephesians 4: 13), at the perfect man, because sonship underlies manhood, for if God is to have men for Himself, He is to have us in that relationship. We are to arrive at "the knowledge of the Son of God" by ministry, "at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ".
I do commend to you the simple thought of manhood, for the Lord is seeking to bring this about in us. The babe state exposes us to Antichrist. You will remember that John, in his first epistle, says a great deal more to the babes than to the young men or the fathers. He warns them about Antichrist, and babes in Christ are exposed to the influences of men. The Antichrist is yet to come; hence the great need of having our senses exercised. Thus I come back to my text, if one might so speak, "in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men".
May God bless the word, and lead us into its practical reality.

THE GLORY OF DIVINE GRACE
A. J. Gardiner
@Ephesians 1: 3 - 11; @Ephesians 4: 8 - 16; @Joshua 10: 10 - 14
I wish to say a word, dear brethren, as to God's thoughts concerning us as they are presented to us in the epistle to the Ephesians, and as to the means by which He is giving effect to them at the present time in the saints.
The apostle, as we have often remarked, as introducing this great subject, he introduces it in a spirit of worship, saying, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ". This would show that these things are not to be regarded by us in any academic way, but as entering into the feelings of love in God which lie behind the thoughts which He has made known concerning us; and getting some little impression of the greatness of what God is pleased to do for His own satisfaction, and the wisdom by which He effects it, and the power too, that is brought into expression in effecting these thoughts, that we should be developed in a spirit of worship.
You will remember that Jacob, who is taken up as an example of God's ways with one who is the subject of His sovereignty, finishes his days as a worshipper. He "worshipped on the top of his staff" (@Hebrews 11: 21), as though that is an end that God is working to with us, that every one should become developed in the ability to worship, and not only to worship, but also to celebrate God's praises intelligently and feelingly.
David, too, in the last chapter of 1 Chronicles,
{23}
speaks to God and says, "thou art exalted as Head above all" (chapter 29: 11). His heart rises to God in a sense of the exaltation which attaches to the blessed God. So with others also, such as Simeon, who, coming into the temple and embracing God's Christ in his arms, "blessed God" (@Luke 2: 28). His movements were in the Spirit, and the Spirit of God has a large place in the epistle to the Ephesians, for the Spirit of God in His ungrieved operations is essential if we are to have any true understanding of what God has taken us up for.
But Simeon came in the Spirit into the temple and took up the child Jesus in his arms. It had been made known to him by the Spirit that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ; that is, the Christ of God, and he took up the child Jesus in his arms, and blessed God. It is a great secret in regard of our spirits being called forth in worship Godward, to have an apprehension of the Christ of God; that is, not now in relation to ourselves, but Christ apprehended in relation to God, as the One by whom and in whom God effects every thought that His love has cherished.
Well, now, the epistle to the Ephesians, I need not say, is written from the standpoint of the exaltation of Christ, as, indeed, we are told in this very epistle that God has "set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named" (@Ephesians 1: 20, 21). We are in the presence, in this epistle, of the greatest conceivable exaltation,
{24}
the greatest conceivable elevation too in a moral sense, and that is to give us an idea of the kind of riches, so to speak, into which we are introduced.
The greatest thoughts of God are now to be opened up to us, and Christ is already there as Man in the position from which those thoughts are unfolded. That is a great thing to take account of. In olden times, Abraham and others saw things as God revealed them to them distantly. "Abraham", the Lord says, "exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced" (@John 8: 56). At the same time, what he saw was still in the distance, but things are no longer in the distance. Christ is already in the place which God's purpose has marked out for Him, and the Holy Spirit is here, the Earnest (@Ephesians 1:), and in the Earnest there is the power in the saints to enter at the present time into all that will soon be ours in glorious actuality.
Indeed, dear brethren, one frequently reminds oneself that it will only take a twinkling of an eye; *that* is all the time it will take to prepare us for the place, and in the bodily condition, in which these blessings are to be realised in their fulness and for eternity (@1 Corinthians 15: 52). It only requires a twinkling of an eye to complete the matter so far as our bodily condition is concerned, but there is that completion to go on in the meantime in our souls in a formative way, and that is what we are concerned about.
What I am seeking to stress is that the day for these things has come, in that Christ is already in the position which the purpose of God has marked out
{25}
for Him as Man, and the Spirit has come. The day for heavenly things and spiritual things has come.
That is what one wants to reach, that the day for these things is now. We are not to put them off till the future, and so the apostle says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us". The apostle can speak in that way. He is dealing with God, and with God's standpoint, so to speak, and, as I say, Christ is already in that position, and, in Jesus where He is, is the setting out of what God has in His thoughts for us. It is well for us to take that in, and so the apostle can say that God "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ". He has chosen us, he says, "in him before the world's foundation".
It is remarkable the scope that is covered in one or two verses, going back to before the foundation of the world, eternity in the past (if one may speak of the past in relation to eternity), going back to that, and then looking on to what is called the administration of the fulness of times -- which is the day that is to come; then in chapter 3, going on to all generations of the age of ages, which is eternity in the future. The apostle, in a very short span, so to speak, so far as words are concerned, covers an immense scope as regards time or eternity. He says, God "has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will".
{26}
We have often gone over these things, dear brethren, but it is well to go over them again to get our minds and spirits saturated with the sense of the blessedness of God operating entirely from His own side; not presented as actuated by any question of need on our part or desire, for indeed these matters go back to before the foundation of the world, but choosing us for His own pleasure, choosing us in Christ. One sees, dear brethren, what divine purpose is, how marvellous it is! How, from the very outset, when once the thoughts of divine love were conceived, the incarnation was in view, as, you might say, the keystone of all that God was going to effect. He chose us in Christ. The explanation of it, of course, is that all is "according to the good pleasure of his will". It is not a question of what might meet our most exaggerated thoughts or desires; it is a question entirely of what will satisfy the heart of God. You might say, why should God desire it? Well, it is a matter for us to consider, why indeed?
I was speaking of different ones who were moved in a spirit of worship. Paul, himself, is another remarkable instance. So blessedly did he know God that, in writing an epistle like Romans, he constantly bursts out in doxology. In chapter 1, he refers to God as Creator, saying of men, that they "honoured and served the creature more than him who had created it, who is blessed for ever. Amen" (verse 25). Then in chapter 9, he speaks of Christ coming in of Israel, according to flesh, and then in order to establish the truth of His Person, he says, "who is
{27}
over all, God", but then he has to add, "blessed for ever. Amen" (verse 5). That is the spirit in which Paul handles divine things. As he thinks of God and as he thinks of Christ, a spirit of worship arises in his heart, and that is what the Lord would help us in, lest we should become academic or formal in these holy things.
In @Romans 11, Paul traces God's ways and, as he does so, he says, "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?" (verses 33, 34). And then he says, "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen" (verse 36). That is how Paul is affected as he thinks of God. If he thinks of Christ, who He is, he is affected in the same way. If he thinks of God's ways, he is also affected in that way, and as he thinks of the mystery, he is similarly affected, according to the end of @Romans 16. The spirit of worship is intended to characterise the saints as they take account of God.

JOSEPH AS A MAN OF FAITH
F. E. Raven
@Hebrews 11: 17 - 23, 27
As far as I understand the church, it was set up here entirely in the power of the Holy Spirit; I do not think the apostles had anything much of administration before them. They have a place in administration -- they are to "sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (@Matthew 19: 28). But there is something greater than administration, and that is the church's relation to the Father; the identification with Christ of the many sons that God is bringing to glory.
The church is the seat of perfect administration as the assembly of the living God; but it is the assembly of the firstborn which are written in heaven (@Hebrews 12: 23), and that is morally a greater thought. If you apprehend the God of resurrection, you cannot limit God to administration, any more than you can limit God's blessing to the line of the flesh, and it is in that way that I understand that Jacob blessed both the sons of Joseph. That is what he did when this world was fading out of view; and he worshipped, leaning on the top of his staff.
There are two things that mark Joseph at the end: he made mention of the departing of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones. Resurrection is the ground upon which God delivered His people out of Egypt; and the fact is this, except God acted on the ground of resurrection, there are questions which God would have to raise with men. But the blood was the witness of death; God's
{29}
righteousness had been vindicated, and in the Red Sea God had, as we have seen, acted on the ground of resurrection, apart from the question of sin, or the law, or flesh, to bring His people into His light.
The brightest moment of Jacob's life, if I might say so, was his death; the fathers died in faith, and Jacob's brightest moment was perhaps when he died. So with Joseph: all his greatness in Egypt was gone, everything had faded from view, and what comes before him was that his brethren were in Egypt, and he makes mention of their departing; God would come in for them, and deliver them out of the land of Egypt. And yet Egypt had been the scene of Joseph's glory; his children were born there, his links were there, but, in the hour of his dying, Egypt was gone from him.
My conviction is that if Joseph had lived in the time of Moses, Joseph would have done what Moses did, for Moses carried out that of which Joseph spoke. Joseph had light to speak about it, but the time was not yet come for action; still, it formed part of the testimony of the God of resurrection, and all of that testimony will be made good in the power of resurrection. God does not deliver Israel out of Egypt again; it was the God of resurrection who brought them out. They never understood that, but, nevertheless, He was in that light, delivering His people out of the bondage of Egypt.
Joseph had not only light in that way, but he "gave commandment concerning his bones"; he would not leave any memorial in Egypt, and yet
{30}
Egypt was the land of his greatness. After the flesh he might have looked to have a statue in Egypt, but he would not leave even his bones there. That is where Joseph shines out as a man of faith, and, as I said, had he lived in the time of Moses he would have been the instrument of God's deliverance from Egypt.
The strength and ability of Moses after the flesh could not deliver the people of God, only God could do this; faith brought in the light and the power of God, and therefore had Joseph lived in the time of Moses he would have been the deliverer of Israel. Joseph and Moses are brought together in @Acts 7, both as being in the first instance rejected of the people, and yet ultimately the instruments of God to deliver them.
Joseph lived in his own day, and had to enjoy the light that God gave *him*; and a man can never go beyond his faith, he can act only on the light he has from God. But if Joseph had lived in our day, he would have understood that he was risen with Christ! I gather that from the fact that he would not leave a memorial in Egypt. Most of us have some kind of a name there, and I believe that until a person has entered into the mind of God for him by faith, until he sees that God's mind toward him is that he is risen with Christ, he will not be willing to give up his name in the world.
It is just as much the mind of God for us that we are risen with Christ, as that we are justified, and until it can be said of us that we are risen with Christ, I do not think we are clear of the reproach of
{31}
Egypt. Joseph did not desire a memento in Egypt; in death his name died out with him, and his bones were not to be left there; not even would he be buried out of sight there -- the break with Egypt in that sense was complete. Egypt had gone from view; Joseph would have been delighted to enter into the blessed truth of resurrection with Christ.
It was when the children of Israel reached Gilgal that the reproach of Egypt was rolled away. People are not cleared of the reproach of Egypt when they are justified. It is a blessed thing to enter into deliverance from sin and the flesh and law; but it is a greater thing to be in spirit outside of all that is national and religious, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free, but where Christ is all and in all, where everything is pervaded and regulated by the affections of Christ. If Christ is all and in all, He is in all in the sense of divine affections, and that is the scene which God has for His people. We do not find people always prepared to give up the Jew and the Greek; they cling a good bit to distinctions after the flesh, but these things have no place in God's mind for us; it is just as much His mind for us to know our place in the christian circle as that we are justified. You would be wise to accept the thought of God about you. Joseph and Moses would have done so had they lived in our day.
Now, beloved, we accept the mind of God, and this is by *faith*; but then, if you enter into the *mind* of God, the *work* of God is corresponding to it. He has "quickened" you "with the Christ" (@Ephesians 2: 5), so
{32}
that you can be *with* Christ without hindrance. It is not faith that brings you into conscious association with Christ, but God's work, so that you may be qualified for the greatness of the position which God has for you.
But to be quickened with Christ means to be rejected in the world, and perhaps, too, not to have a very great place in the providence of God -- you may not be favoured in that way. His providence is a veil behind which God hides Himself. But if you are sharing Christ's rejection you will certainly get glory with Him. If you suffer with Him now, you will be associated with Him in the day of His glory; you form part of the heavenly city which has the glory of God, and in which God will Himself be in connection with the whole universe of bliss.
The men of whom we have spoken acted up to the light which God gave them. It was limited, and in a sense their faith came out when they were dying; but I think you will accept what I have said, that they would have thankfully accepted the light of God, that they were "risen with Christ", and the reproach of Egypt rolled away, where the "body of the flesh" (@Colossians 2: 11) is put off not only for *God*, but for you too.
May God give us to enter into His mind, so that we may be prepared for the refusal of any name, or renown, or repute in the world.

THE TESTIMONY IN THE PRESENT TIME
R. Gray
@Hebrews 3: 7 - 14; @Numbers 21: 14 - 20; @Joshua 3: 2 - 5; @Ephesians 3: 8 - 17
The exercise in reading these scriptures is, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to speak about the testimony of our Lord at the present time. Many of us, especially those of us who are older, tend to dwell somewhat on the past, and that has its own worth. There is much that has gone on in the testimony that is well worth remembering and going over. Indeed, I think it is useful to have some understanding of the history of the church, from the beginning. And, of course, we look forward to the coming of the Lord -- that should be ever in our minds, too. But what is in mind, in reading these scriptures, is to speak about the present time.
The scripture we began with in Hebrews says, "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, Today …". If we were asked about the testimony, 'What is the Lord doing today', it would be an exercise as to how we might answer; and yet it is vitally important, because if we only look back (blessed as that is) and look forward (encouraging and bright as that is) the tendency is, perhaps, to go on somewhat aimlessly, looking only on the weakness of present conditions, and feeling it too, no doubt. But, what *is* the Lord doing today? Well, He is still working; that is certain. There has been evidence of it among the young in these parts, and indeed in the localities of the saints.
{34}
The expression "Today" as used here refers to a period of time, but one takes the liberty of applying it to ourselves, just at the present juncture in the testimony: "Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation". That applied to Israel initially, but then it has a bearing on us too.
Now, I am not charging brethren with hardness of heart, but what I *am* saying is that we need to be kept alive and tender in our affections towards Christ, first of all, and then to keep His interests constantly before us at the present time, because there are many distractions around us. Some one asked me recently as to what *my* church was doing about conditions in Sudan; why were we not furnishing a lorry and sending out goods (I do not despise these things; they have their place)? My reply was that I do not think that the assembly of Christ, the assembly of God indeed, has as its primary function, meeting needs in the world of that kind. I am not saying we might not do so as individuals, but it is a personal matter. Paul, was enjoined to remember the poor: "which same thing also I was diligent to do" (@Galatians 2: 10) -- that has its place.
I say this because the enemy would seek to distract us by any means possible from the real function of the assembly, which is to be here faithful to Christ and His interests, and to minister to His heart and to minister to God. The Lord emphasized that side of things when He said, "ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always" (@John 12: 8). That is, He was to be their first Interest, as He should be with us.
{35}
The Spirit of God goes on (@Hebrews 3: 10) to speak of Israel's erring in their heart, and so on, but what I wanted to come to was the reference in verse 12 to "the living God", and the injunction of not "turning away from the living God", because, to my mind, that bears very particularly on the present time. We can speak about how God brought about recovery of the truth early in the nineteenth century, and how He has maintained the truth; but what about the living God? that is, the God who is active today in the testimony. And how are we in relation to what He is doing now?
So it says, "See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God". What is the antidote? "But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called Today". "Encourage yourselves *each day*". One of the booklets available from the Kingston Bible Trust called, simply, "*DAILY*", deals with this very matter, and it is a very important part of our lives. What is daily connects with the testimony. There is what is weekly too -- beginning with the Breaking of Bread on the Lord's day -- but what is daily is vitally important in our lives: reading the Scriptures, praying, etc. You say, 'Well, we have heard all this before'; but do you do it? Do *I* do it? Let us keep close to the Lord, keep short accounts *daily*, for there is nothing so weakening as when a cloud comes between our spirits and the Lord.
"Encourage yourselves *each* day, as long as it is called Today, that none of you be hardened". I know
{36}
this may sound as if I am pursuing a rather negative line, but I know my own heart; the routine of things, the sheer pressure of being in the world from day-today, what we have to contend with *tends* to harden us, unless we are kept close to Christ and kept *living* in our links with Him. Remember, it is the living God that we have to do with; that God of whom it is said that He neither slumbers nor sleeps (@Psalm 121: 4).
I think, when we come to the judgment seat of the Christ (@2 Corinthians 5: 10), we will not only get a review of our responsible pathway here, but we will see how much God has saved us from in order to preserve us in view of the testimony. Think of Balaam, for instance, and his attempts to curse Israel (@Numbers 22 - 24). Israel knew nothing of the fact that Balaam was there on the mountain seeking time after time to bring cursing on them. Who prevented it? God did, in His gracious intervention, and He put in Balaam's mouth words of blessing. What a God He is! The living God with whom we have to do, each day.
I go on now to @Numbers 21 where the connection with "Today" might not be immediately evident, but I would suggest that this section bears very much on the present phase of the testimony. Israel had had distinctive leadership in Moses and Aaron, and from them they learned God's will for them. They had come now to a time when Aaron had died (chapter 20: 28), and Moses was soon to be taken from them. If we consider our own history, for many years there was what was spoken of as a universal lead, and
{37}
with it a definite and clear line of ministry, which had the Lord's support. It seems clear that the emphasis now is on what this section speaks of, which is as we have been taught, inward leadership; that is, the leadership and the power of the Holy Spirit known at the present time.
The Spirit is addressed here therefore, typically, and it is interesting, in this poetic section from the middle of verse 14, the number of references to water: "brooks", "stream" and then the "well" to which they sang. I believe that our salvation lies at the present time in having to do with the living God; and that includes our relations with the Holy Spirit, keeping them clear and being sensitive to His promptings. You may say, 'Well, does that mean that the Lord has a lesser place?' Most *emphatically* not; but the scripture we will come to shortly in Joshua, shows that the ark -- a type of the Lord Himself -- became greater in Israel's view than ever before as they came to the Jordan.
I would refer briefly to the fact that, when the Lord left His own, (and I am thinking particularly of John's gospel chapters 14, 15 and 16), the way in which He spoke of the Holy Spirit -- His coming, first of all, as sent by the Father, and as sent by the Son ("I will send", chapter 15: 26), and then as coming of Himself -- should emphasise to our minds and hearts the fact that the Spirit of God would have a very great place with the saints in the present dispensation. The Lord Himself said, "He that believes on me … shall do greater than these" (@John 14: 12).
{38}
That is, the building upon the foundation which the Lord had laid in regard of God's great thoughts as to the assembly, was to be continued and amplified in this present dispensation. I would repeat what has often been said in recent times, (again, one speaks of one's own experience), that there is a danger of thinking that the testimony is fading away. The truth of the matter is that God is still working, the living God is working. We have not come to the present phase of the testimony by accident. We may feel the effects of God's government, and rightly so; we would not minimise that, but the fact of the matter is that God is completing what was set on at Pentecost; He is doing it in these last days, and we are to have our part in it.
I would appeal to us all, that we should be alive in our minds and hearts to the fact that we are on the brink of the very greatest things. You say, 'We have been saying this for years'; yes, that is so. But I think this scripture would bear that interpretation. Instead of wandering, as has often been said, Israel went on. They became a *purposeful* company. It says, "And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah; and from Mattanah to Nahaliel", and so on; step after step of deliberate movement, because they had come to a certain point in which the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, typically, was known.
When we come to Joshua chapter 3 what we find is that Israel had come to the time of going over Jordan. As remarked already, what appears here is not that the Holy Spirit typically is in prominence, but
{39}
rather that Israel saw the ark move in a distinctive way. The arrangement, as is well known, as to the movement of the camp was that the cloud moved, then certain groups of tribes, three and three set forward, then the tabernacle and then the remaining tribes. Here, it would appear that the ark took the lead. It says, "When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then remove from your place"; that is, they were to follow it. I believe, for us, that is the fruit of the work of the Spirit. We begin to see the Lord, by the eyes of faith, more clearly than we ever did; our eyes are *fastened* on Him. We are sensitive as to His movements and we are ready to move; and more than that, we are *fit* to move; these persons had had special food (@Joshua 1: 11) and they were fitted to move as following Christ, typically.
I would turn aside briefly to Revelation where the scripture refers to the Spirit and the bride saying, Come. We have been well taught that that would always be the language of the saints of the assembly: "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" (@Revelation 22: 17); but I think we have to see that it has a peculiar resonance at the present time. How could it be that the bride would speak in consonance with the Spirit, except that her relations with Him were close and vital? I believe there is something of distinctive character being wrought out in the saints. It has been said that suffering nowadays is in the spirits of the saints. But the result would be, as Paul laboured for it in Corinth, and as the Spirit of God is labouring
{40}
for it now, that the Lord Jesus might be our sole Object: "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (@2 Corinthians 11: 2). Thus the Lord becomes greater in our view.
"Remove from your place, and go after it". I would say this too, in passing, that one of the many ways in which the Holy Spirit serves us is as the Power for movement. We may be dismayed sometimes by the exercises that come up, especially when we are younger, for the world is a very attractive place to the flesh in us all. What is going to help us? You say, Attraction to Christ. That is true, but the Spirit of God is the Power for change. He is the One who will help us to change, and who gives us different tastes and a different outlook on things here. As we prove the Holy Spirit's help practically, may we come eventually to what is spoken of in @2 Corinthians 3: 18: "transformed … from glory to glory". That is the height of His service in one sense.
But it says here, "When ye see the ark … remove from your place, and go after it", and "there shall be a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure". That was a Sabbath day's journey, but in their case, it had in view that the full reverence due to the Person of Christ, typically, was maintained, and yet they knew what it was that was going before them -- the ark of Jehovah. The work of the Spirit then would be that we would have a clearer view of Christ than ever before, and we would have a greater impression of His glory and dignity, too.
{41}
I refer now to Ephesians, which is the crown of the ministry given to Paul. In fact, it is such an elevated setting out of the truth, that sometimes we may feel it is beyond us, but Paul was not so minded. He wished the saints to enter into what Ephesians speaks of, and enjoy it. He says, "I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; what a Resource -- the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! One of the things which was on his heart was that he might "enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery". That is not exactly the assembly, it is the administration of it; that is how things are worked out in it, and this is to be seen, in some measure, in our local companies.
This "administration of the mystery…" was "hidden throughout the ages in God". You think of that! This was something so precious and so rare that God hid it in the safest place that He could: He hid it in Himself. He did not even tell the patriarchs about it. He did not tell Abraham or Moses or David. He hid it in Himself, and He has brought it out in this dispensation. What a glory belongs to this dispensation! What favour attaches to it!
And what else? "Hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things, in order that *now* to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God". That is *today*. That is what the living God is going on with. And He is working that the all-various wisdom of God may be made known. Saints are passing through circumstances,
{42}
tests and exercises that, perhaps, there is really no precedent on which to act. What is it to bring out? "The all-various wisdom of God". And who does He work it out in? -- local companies made up of persons like ourselves. Would that we had a greater impression of the glory and the grandeur of what God is doing. The world to come will show what God has secured for Himself, through the exercises we have spoken of, but I believe that eternal conditions will answer fully God's desires, and ours. "God *himself* shall be with them, their God" (@Revelation 21: 3).
May the Lord bless the word.

BETHANY (VI)
C. H. Mackintosh
@John 11; @John 12
In our Lord's reply to Martha we have one of the very finest utterances that ever fell on the human ear: "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" (chapter 11: 40). What living depth, what divine power, what freshness, sweetness, and comfort in these words! They present to us the very gist and marrow, the heart's core, the essential principle of the divine life. It is only the eye of faith that can see the glory of God. Unbelief sees only difficulties, darkness, and death. Faith looks above and beyond all these, and ever basks in the blessed beams of the divine glory.

Poor Martha saw nothing but a decomposed human body, simply because she was governed by a spirit of dark and depressing unbelief. Had she been swayed by an artless faith, she would have walked to the tomb in company with Him who is "the resurrection and the life" (verse 25), assured that, instead of death and decomposition, she should see the glory of God.
Reader, this is a grand principle for the soul to get a thorough grasp of. It is utterly impossible for human language to overstate its value and importance. Faith never looks at difficulties, except indeed it be to feed on them. It looks not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are unseen (@2 Corinthians 4: 18). It endures as seeing Him who is invisible. It takes hold of the living God. It leans on His arm; it makes use of His strength; it draws on His exhaustless treasury; it walks in the light of His blessed countenance, and sees His glory shining forth over the darkest scenes of human life.
The inspired volume abounds in striking illustrations of the contrast between faith and unbelief. Let us glance at one or two of them. Look, for example, at Caleb and Joshua, in contrast with their unbelieving brethren in @Numbers 13: 28 - 33. These latter saw only the difficulties which stood in their way. "Only, the people are strong that dwell in the land" -- not stronger than Jehovah, surely -- "and the cities are walled, very great;" -- not greater than the living God -- "moreover we saw the children of Anak there". It is very clear that they did not see the glory of God; indeed they saw anything and everything
{44}
but that. They were wholly governed by a spirit of unbelief, and hence they could only bring "an evil report of the land which they had searched out" to the children of Israel, saying, "The land, which we have passed through to search it out, is a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we have seen in it are men of great stature" -- they did not see a single small man, not one trifling difficulty; they looked at everything through the magnifying-glass of unbelief. "There have we seen the giants" (no doubt!) "-- the sons of Anak are of the giants". And nothing more? Nothing whatever. God was shut out; they could not see Him at all through the glasses they used. They could only see the terrible giants and towering walls. "And we were in our sight as grasshoppers, and so we were also in their sight".
But what of Jehovah? Alas, He was shut out! Unbelief invariably leaves God out of its calculations. It can take a very accurate account of all the difficulties, all the hindrances, all the hostile influences, but as for the living God, it sees Him not. There is a melancholy consistency in the utterances of unbelief, whether we listen to them in the wilderness of Kadesh, or, fourteen hundred years afterwards, at the tomb of Lazarus. Unbelief is always and everywhere the same; it begins, continues, and ends with the absolute and complete exclusion of the one living and true God. It can do naught save to cast dark shadows over the pathway of every one who will listen to its voice.
{45}
How different are the accents of faith! Hearken to Joshua and Caleb, as they seek to stem the rising tide of unbelief (@Numbers 14: 6 - 10). "And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of them that searched out the land, rent their garments. And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land. If Jehovah delight in us" -- here lies the secret -- "he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land that flows with milk and honey; only rebel not against Jehovah; and fear not the people of the land; for they shall be our food" -- faith actually feeds on the difficulties which terrify unbelief -- "Their defence is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not".
Glorious words! It does the heart good to transcribe them. "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" Thus it is always. If there is a melancholy consistency in the utterances of unbelief, there is a glorious consistency in the accents of faith, wherever we hearken to them. Caleb and Joshua saw the glory of God, and in the light of that glory, what were giants and high walls? Simply nothing. If anything, they were bread for the nourishment of faith.
Faith brings in God, and He shuts out all difficulties. What walls or giants could stand before the Almighty God? "If God be for us, who against us?" (@Romans 8: 31). Such is ever the artless, but powerful, reasoning of faith. It conducts all its arguments, and
{46}
reaches all its conclusions, in the blessed light of the divine presence. It sees the glory of God. It looks above and beyond the heavy clouds which at times gather upon the horizon, and finds in God its sure and never-failing Resource. Precious faith! -- the only thing in the world that really glorifies God; the only thing that makes the heart of the Christian truly bright and happy.
Let us take another illustration. Turn to @1 Kings 17: 7 - 16, and contrast the widow of Zarephath with Elijah the Tishbite. What was the difference between them? Just the difference that ever exists between unbelief and faith. Listen again to the utterances of unbelief. "And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse; and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die".
Here, truly, is a gloomy picture. An empty barrel, an exhausted cruse, and death! Was that all? That was all for blind unbelief. It is the old story of the giants and lofty walls over again. God is shut out, though she could say, "As Jehovah thy God liveth". In reality she had no real sense of His presence, and of His all-sufficiency to meet her need and that of her house. Her circumstances excluded God from the vision of her soul. She looked at things that were seen, not at the things which were unseen. She saw not the invisible One; she saw nothing but famine and death. As the ten unbelieving spies saw nothing but the difficulties; as Martha saw nothing but the
{47}
grave and its humiliating results; so the poor Zarephath widow saw nothing but starvation and death.
Not so the man of faith, Elijah. He looked beyond the barrel and the cruse. He had no thought of dying of hunger. He rested on the word of Jehovah. Here was his precious Resource. God had said, "I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee". This was quite enough for him. He knew that God could turn the very barrel itself into meal, and the cruse into oil, to sustain him, if necessary. Like Caleb and Joshua, he brought God into the scene, and found in Him the true solution of every difficulty. They saw God above and beyond the walls and the giants. They rested on His eternal word. He had promised to bring His people into the land, and hence, though there were nothing but walls and giants from Dan to Beer-sheba, He would most surely fulfil His word.
And so with Elijah the Tishbite. He saw the living and almighty God above and beyond the barrel and the cruse. He rested upon that word which is settled for ever in heaven, and which never can fail a trusting heart. This tranquillised his spirit, and with this he sought to tranquillise the widow too. "And he said to her, Fear not;" -- precious, soul-stirring, utterance of faith! -- "go, do as thou hast said … For thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: The meal in the barrel shall not waste, neither shall the oil in the cruse fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the face of the earth!"
Here was the solid ground on which the man of
{48}
God rested when he ventured to offer a word of encouragement to the poor desponding widow of Zarephath. It was not in the light-heartedness, or blind recklessness of nature that he spoke to her. He did not attempt to deny that the barrel and cruse were almost empty, as the woman had said. This could have given her no comfort, inasmuch as she knew too well the facts of her case. But he brought the living God and His faithful word before her aching heart; and hence he could say, "Fear not". He sought to lead her soul to that true resting-place where he himself had found repose, namely, the word of God -- blessed, unfailing, divine resting-place for every anxious soul!
Thus it was with Caleb and Joshua. They did not attempt to deny that there were giants and high walls. That would have been of no possible use. But they brought God in, and sought to place Him between the hearts of their desponding brethren and the dreaded difficulties. This is what faith always does, and thus gives glory to God, and keeps the soul in perfect peace, let the difficulties be ever so great. It is the height of folly to deny that there are obstacles and hostile influences in the way. There is a certain style of speaking of such things which cannot possibly minister comfort or encouragement to a poor troubled heart. Faith accurately weighs the difficulties and trials, but knows that the power of God outweighs them all, and rests in holy calmness on His word, and in His perfect wisdom and everlasting love.
{49}
The reader's mind will no doubt recur to many other instances in which the Lord's people have been cast down by looking at circumstances, instead of looking at God. David, in a dark moment, could say, "I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul" (@1 Samuel 27: 1). What a sad mistake! The mistake of unbelief. What should he have said? Denied that the hand of Saul was against him? Surely not; what comfort could that have given him, inasmuch as he knew too well that it was really so? But he should have remembered that the hand of God was with him, and that hand was stronger than ten thousand Sauls.
So with Jacob, in his day of darkness and depression. "All these things", said he, "are against me" (@Genesis 42: 36). What should he have added? 'But God is for me'. Faith has its 'buts' and 'ifs' as well as unbelief; but faith's buts and ifs are all bright, because they express the passage of the soul -- its rapid passage from the difficulties to God Himself. "*But* God, being rich in mercy" (@Ephesians 2: 4). And again, "*If* God be for us, who against us?" (@Romans 8: 31). Thus faith ever reasons. It begins with God, it places Him between the soul and all its surroundings, and thus imparts a peace which passeth all understanding, a peace which nothing can disturb.
But we must, ere closing this paper, return for a moment to the tomb of Lazarus. The rapid glance we have taken through the inspired volume will enable us to appreciate more fully those most precious words of our Lord to Martha, "Did I not say to thee,
{50}
that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" (chapter 11: 40).
Men tell us that seeing is believing, but we can say that believing is seeing. Yes, reader, get hold of this grand truth. It will carry you through, and bear you above, the darkest and most trying scenes of this dark and trying world. "Have faith in God" (@Mark 11: 22). This is the mainspring of the divine life. "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20). Faith knows, and is persuaded, that there is nothing too hard, nothing too great, yea, and nothing too small, for God. It can count on Him for everything. It basks in the very sunlight of His presence, and exults in the manifestations of His goodness, His faithfulness, and His power. It ever delights to see the platform cleared of the creature, that the glory of God may shine forth in all its lustre. It turns away from all creature streams and creature props, and finds all its resources in the one living and true God.
Only see how the divine glory displays itself at the grave of Lazarus, even spite of the unbelieving suggestions of Martha's heart -- for God, blessed be His name, delights at times to rebuke our fears, as well as to answer our faith. "They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me; but I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And
{51}
having said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him go".
Glorious scene! displaying our Jesus as the Son of God, with power, by resurrection of the dead. Gracious scene! in which the Son of God condescends to use man in rolling away the stone, and removing the grave-clothes. How good of Him to use us in any little way! May it be our joy to be ever ready! May His grace in using us produce in us a holy readiness to be used, that God in all things may be glorified!

THE GLORY OF DIVINE GRACE
A. J. Gardiner
@Ephesians 1: 3 - 11; @Ephesians 4: 8 - 16; @Joshua 10: 10 - 14
As I was saying, we might well ask, Why should He purpose these things and why should we be the subjects of them? Long before man was created, He brought into being an order of creature infinitely greater in power and glory than man -- I refer to the angels -- and yet when we come to the epistle to Hebrews, we find, "he does not indeed take hold of angels by the hand, but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham" (@Hebrews 2: 16). That is God's sovereignty. Why should He do it, save that He is pleased to do it? He is pleased to magnify His grace, to exalt His
{52}
own Name in the glory of what His own grace is able to do, but, if, on the one hand, it is infinite grace that takes up such as we, there is another side to it and that is that He makes us entirely worthy of the position which His love has marked out for us.
While it is right to have low thoughts of ourselves, to be marked by humility, it is not right to have thoughts of ourselves lower than what God thinks of us. You will remember that when the unbelieving spies came back and spread a bad report of the land, they said, "we were in our sight as grasshoppers, and so we were also in their sight" (@Numbers 13: 33). That was not the divine view of the people at all. Balaam, a little later, had his eyes opened and said, "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel; Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in his midst" (@Numbers 23: 21). God's view of the saints is not at all that they are grasshoppers, and we are not to have a view of ourselves less than what God has of us.
So it says, "he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved". That is one central point that is to hold our hearts, "the Beloved". It is the light that governs the present dispensation. It says in @Isaiah 60: 1, "Arise, shine! for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon
{53}
thee". Our light has come. It is the light of Christ in glory, and then of the assembly as of Him and united to Him, so that the first thing that is to hold our hearts is the light of "the Beloved". It is Christ in a settled position, loved of God, on account of what He is in His moral excellence in manhood and in sonship; beloved in that position. He is the antitype of both David and Solomon. It says, we have been taken "into favour in the Beloved". That is the position which we fill out in sonship, and then it adds, "in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace". We have that in the Beloved, and through *His* blood, the blood of the Beloved. How touching that is, dear brethren.
In @Proverbs 8: 24, Solomon writes, "When there were no depths, I" (wisdom) "was brought forth", but there came a time when depths came into evidence, and one of the greatest depths that came into evidence was when God's Beloved went down into death and judgment that we might receive forgiveness of sins. The depths have come into evidence, and God has brought in wisdom in order that we should be furnished with that which is intended to appeal to our hearts and enrich them with a sense of how blessed God is. Paul prays that God would give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.
That is the great thing, and then, not only are we taken up in sonship, but God would have us marked by intelligence. To be characterised by affection and
{54}
liberty are two great features of sonship, but also to be characterised by intelligence. A parent who has young boys regards them, of course, as his sons; they are his sons. At the same time, they do not represent, while they are boys, the full thought of sonship. The full thought of sonship involves full manhood, so that they are capable of entering in an affectionate and intelligent way into the thoughts of the father.
Having introduced this thought of sonship, we get the further thought then that God has abounded towards us in the riches of His grace in making known to us the mystery of His will. He wants us to be fully intelligent, and all this, dear brethren, is to take shape now. It is not at all the thought that it should be put off to the future. There is no object in putting off to the future our becoming intelligent as to the administration of the fulness of times, because when the fulness of times has come the administration will be seen, but what God wants us to be intelligent about is what He is doing before it actually comes to pass, and so He has made known to us the "mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him, in whom we have also obtained an inheritance".
That shows the place that the assembly has with Christ. It answers to Eve as given to Adam, for Adam was set over all the works of God's hand.
{55}
There were the fowl of the heavens, the cattle, every beast of the field, the creeping things, and the fish of the sea, all were placed under Adam. He was set over them all as head. It was a prefiguring of what God has purposed for the administration of the fulness of times, that all things are to be headed up, both heavenly and earthly, in the Christ.
Now Adam being in that position, God said, "It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like" (@Genesis 2: 18). There is the deep sleep and the rib taken out of the side of Adam, and the building of the woman, and the bringing her to the man. She was brought to the man in that position, and that is exactly what is before us here: "In whom", that is, in Christ, "we have also obtained an inheritance". We have an inheritance with Christ because He is to inherit all things, and we are to have part with Him in His inheritance. The point is, dear brethren, Are these things to affect us now? It is a wonderful thing that these things are ours, but how are we to be fitted to have part with Christ in that day?
Adam rejoiced when he saw someone brought to him whom he could recognise as being worthy of him, and capable of entering intelligently with him into the position in which God had placed him. He said, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man" (@Genesis 2: 23). That is, there was, in feminine form, in the affections and grace connected with the feminine idea, that which was the exact counterpart to the man. That is what we are to
{56}
have before us, dear brethren. This is God's side of the matter.
In the fifth chapter of this epistle (Ephesians), we have Christ's side of the matter (Christ viewed in this position as the One in whom all things are to be headed up); "the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word, that *he* might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless" (verses 25 - 27). We only arrive at what is holy and without blemish as we are brought into correspondence with Christ, and hence that is what we come to in chapter 4, what God is working for at the present time in the assembly. We read in chapter 4 that Christ has gone up far above all heavens. "Wherefore, he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men. But that he ascended, what is it that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens".
I was speaking a moment ago of the exalted position in which Christ is. He is there permanently, never to be dislodged from it. He is to be taken account of there. It says, "He … has also ascended up above all the heavens". In the first chapter He is presented as being set by God in this exalted position; in this chapter He is presented as gone there in His own right and power, "ascended up above all the
{57}
heavens". We get a wonderful view of Christ, the One whom God has supremely exalted on the one hand, and the One who has in His own Person the inherent right and power to go far above all heavens, beyond the created sphere, and hence we are in the presence of the greatest conceivable thing: a divine Person in manhood, and yet we are to be united to Him.
We are not to have part in Deity, of course, but, at the same time, to be brought near, to a most intimate and most holy place, to be united to a Man who has part in Deity. "He … has also ascended up above all the heavens". He has gone there in His own right and power, far outside the created sphere. What a glorious Christ! Then from that position, so to speak, unaffected by conditions down here -- that is, not operating from that standpoint but operating entirely from the standpoint of divine counsels -- He has given gifts, but then Paul calls attention to the fact that before He ascended He descended first into the lower parts of the earth. All that had in mind the formation of the assembly. The body of Christ is to be brought into view, and is to be brought into view as corresponding with Himself, as formed under the influence of His love expressed in death.
Adam went into a deep sleep, and the woman was formed out of what was taken out of his side in the deep sleep, and Christ has gone down into the lower parts of the earth. It means complete identification in love with the position in which we were; not, of course, that the assembly has any past history, I am not suggesting that, but then the assembly,
{58}
as the body of Christ, is to be formed in moral features, formed in features that are of God, formed in love, in righteousness, in holiness, and these things are learned in the light of the death of Christ. Those who are to compose the body of Christ are those who have had a past history, though viewed as the subjects of the work of God they have no responsible past history. So the process of formation goes on, and Christ has ascended up above all the heavens, and from that position He has given gifts.
Later in this same chapter, we read, "But *ye* have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus; namely, your having put off according to the former conversation the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts; and being renewed in the spirit of your mind; and your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (verses 20 - 24).
It is a question, I believe, of the way the work of God goes on. On the one hand, there is Christ personally before us: "But *ye* have not thus learnt the Christ", and then the entire disallowance of one order of man in order that an order of manhood created according to God in righteousness and true holiness should come into view. That truth is learned in Christ and in the light of His death: "*ye* have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus". Now the work of God is going on in the formation of the body of Christ.
{59}
We should bear in mind that what is in view is the formation of this vessel that is to be the fulness of Christ, the complete answer to all that is found in Him as a Man. There are two means which God employs, and the first is the gifts from an ascended Christ, and the second is what we ourselves do amongst ourselves as holding the truth in love. These are the two means by which God is effecting His present thoughts in the saints.
First of all, there are the gifts from Christ ascended far above all heavens: they represent the invincible power of the ascended Christ. They are used, it says, "for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man". The Son of God is God's ideal. Christ in manhood is God's idea of manhood, and we are to have an apprehension of the Son of God and arrive, in the appreciation of Him, at the full measure of stature, no less measure of stature than that of the fulness of the Christ.

THE WORK OF THE HOUSE OF GOD AND THE WORKMEN THEREIN
J. N. Darby
@Ezra 3
The books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah hang together. In Ezra, we get the temple built and
{60}
worship restored; in Nehemiah, the restoration of the city; Haggai opens out the secret of the hindrances to the work; in Zechariah we have truth presented by which God strengthened the hearts of the remnant.
Truth meets persons in our days in external things; it is common to see Christians opening the Scriptures and being struck with the fact of how unlike the things there presented are to what they see around them. Man would set to work to put things in order. God's remedy is to meet practical departure in oneself, to begin with self. We have "the word of the Lord",¦ are we bringing our consciences to it -- not asking for increase of light, increase of power, but more honest, holy obedience to what we know, just doing that, in all our weakness, which God teaches us to be right?
I read @Philippians 2: 13, "it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure"; if I am waiting for more power, before I work out that which it is His will I should do, I am denying that He is working in me to accomplish it by His power -- to will and to do.
We are to walk, step-by-step, as God gives the light. Some will say, 'Yes, when the door is opened, as it was for the Jews -- when power is put forth, as it was for the Jews, then we will go forth, not seeing that, when the Jews walked disobediently, God
¦There was a moral appeal to conscience in the Jew -— 'you know what Moses says, and, you have departed from it' -— 'how came you Jews out of the land?' 
{61}
raised up enemies from without, standing by to sanction their captivity'. The Jew could say, 'We must be in bondage until the years of the captivity be ended'.
Not so the Christian. God has set him free from all captivity, in Christ. If he get into bondage, through the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, the moment God gives him light to see where he is, that moment the word to him is, "cease to do evil, learn to do well" (@Isaiah 1: 17). The question at the Reformation (and so now), was, 'Is the word of God to be obeyed or not? -- the Lord hath spoken, and shall not we obey?' It is for God to see in us obedience to His word, so far as we know it, and more knowledge will be given -- "whoever has, to him shall be given" (@Matthew 13: 12).
But, here, it is necessary for us to see that conduct may go beyond faith. If it does, it will break down. Right conduct on a wrong motive must fail. In @Ezra 3, we have the Jews working for God, and that from the written word; for what Moses commanded, they observed (verse 2), and what David did, they set themselves to do (verse 10). But they failed. The adversaries of Judah came and stopped the work (chapter 4). Looking at the outward form, we should have said, 'Now here is obedience'. But God's eye saw through it all. Self-complacency was there; the corrupt heart was there. Haggai furnishes the key. The heart was unpurged. These adversaries, what were they? The remnant had escaped, had got into the land, had begun to build -- and why did they not go on? God was using the adversaries of Judah, as the occasion, to
{62}
show the cause of their failure.
Circumstances bring out the cause of failure; but occasion and cause are constantly confounded. The cause of failure was not in the adversaries of Judah, but in the hearts of the people which were set upon their own things and not upon the things of God, upon their own ceiled houses, and not upon the house of the Lord. And so, we find, through the whole of the word of God, the occasion one thing, the cause another. That which is not done to the Lord, is not done in faith.
Have we a purpose? -- Jesus had a purpose to which He ever turned. Oh! how little purpose of soul have we for God. The Jews had plenty of thoughts; but, when difficulties sprang up, they had no purpose. God, therefore, had to teach them purpose, to teach them whether it was His energy, or their own, they were walking in, to teach them to trust in Himself. Action, in the time of difficulty, is what God expects from us, as knowing and acting in the strength we have in Him -- to go forward in the purpose of God, as the channels for His energy to flow in, to show that there is strength and energy in Him, far beyond all the hindering circumstances, which may come to try our purpose.
Divine energy will never lose its purpose for God. Human energy will say, "The time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built" (@Haggai 1: 2), and will be amusing itself with its vineyards and fields and houses, squandering the time, instead of carrying on with untiring energy, the settled
{63}
purpose of the soul, amidst all the difficulties and dangers which may threaten or oppose.
In Haggai, I find God acting; and there, I get a lesson for myself, for I have to do with God. I see the hypocrisy of man, doing a right thing, but not doing it to God, doing it from a wrong motive. Whatever is not done in faith, to God, will fail. As soon as there is confession, when the people "feared before Jehovah" (chapter 1: 12), there is the gracious answer, "I am with you, saith Jehovah" (verse 13) Thus, we have three great points brought out:-
1st. -- Are we walking in what we know, up to the light we have?
2nd. -- The course of the conduct the light brings into, will not do for the flesh to walk in, but the energy of faith alone.
3rd. -- Whatever connection the circumstances of providence may have with the things of God, they are not of power in the work of God. The providence of God may open the prison-door, lead the people out, raise up Cyrus, Zerubbabel, etc.; but, when they want power for action, we find the Spirit of prophecy opening their eyes to see their departure from God, telling them what was in their own hearts, and then telling of the grace in God's heart towards them, and the glory that awaited them. (See @Ezra 5: 1, 2).
By the mercy of God, the government of this country is favourable; the quietness we enjoy, the privilege of meeting together without fear of interruption or violence has been the boon (under God) of the government. This, to us, is a great
{64}
responsibility. But there is nothing of real power in service, but a "thus saith Jehovah". There is no power in the floating topics of religion, it must be the truth of God in our own souls -- knowing the truth of God, as God's truth, and then our action, action for God. Are we searching the word of God to find God there?
What is the value of seeing all the scenes pointed out in scripture -- things past, or things to come -- and not seeing God in them? There are two marks of spiritual experience in scripture. First, having studied such a portion, have you seen God as presented in those circumstances? have you met God there? If so, you have been bowed down and humbled; and, if humbled, you have got rest. Secondly, a spiritual reception of scripture will ever produce corresponding action, a going forth, a "Here am I" (@Isaiah 6: 8). If one say, 'I cannot understand' -- when the Spirit is teaching, He takes us to what we can understand. Power for service is learned in the presence of God, and there alone; for, in the presence of God, we get humbled and rest in His grace.
Is my study of Scripture a drawing out of God's word of what I am, and of what God is?

MAKING THINGS OUR OWN
P.W. Burton
@Exodus 12: 1 - 9, 21; @Matthew 26: 26; @1 Timothy 6: 6 - 12, 17 - 19; @Proverbs 23: 23
I would like to encourage each one of us to make divine things our own. Many of us have had the privilege of being brought up in a christian household, of being brought to the meetings at an early age, and of hearing about the Lord Jesus and about God, and that is a great blessing that many have not had.
We can appreciate what others have acquired of spiritual substance, and we can gain some blessing and joy from what others have to tell us, but there is no substitute for having stored up spiritual substance for yourself -- to have made it yours; no one can ever take it from you; it is yours eternally. The only one that can stop you having the joy of these things is yourself. You may get down in your soul, but you can be recovered through repentance, and in the ways of God, through grace. Impressions and thoughts of Christ that you have in your soul through having to do with the Lord Jesus, will be yours eternally, and be an anchor to your soul through the storms of life here.
How do you get spiritual substance? You need to have soul exercise and experience with the Lord Jesus; spend time communing with Him to get divine thoughts and make these things your own. God in His wondrous grace has made it available to you, but you have to lay hold of it for yourself. I would encourage you to do that. Every one here, I
{66}
trust, will have had some experience of reading a verse of Scripture or thinking over some point of the truth, and suddenly, through the help of the blessed Holy Spirit, the truth becomes living and real to you as never before. You may have heard about it, you may have understood it before in a technical way, had the light of it, but suddenly it becomes real in your soul -- it is yours! It may be a promise of God that you have proved. Take God at His word; God loves to be proved. God said to His earthly people of old, "prove me now herewith" (@Malachi 3:10). He does not like us just to have the truth in our heads; He wants it to be put into practice. God promises you something because He wants you to enjoy it, and He sets it before you that you might prove it for yourself. It becomes an experience in your soul. It may be a bitter experience, or it may be a joyful experience, but you have gained something that is yours and that no one can ever take from you.
We have read of the passover lamb, which speaks to us of the Lord Jesus Christ. How available He is to every one of us. God would say to you, 'Take a Lamb'. Thank God for every one in this room who has taken the Lord Jesus as their own Saviour. That is open to every one here. God has made the blessed Saviour, the Lord Jesus, available to you. Take Him for yourself! The Israelites were to take the lamb, the one that was going to be the sacrifice, as we read of here, the one that was going have its blood shed and put upon the doorposts and the lintel, the one that was to shelter the firstborn from judgment. The
{67}
blessed blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses us from all sin, the Lamb of God (@1 John 1:7). Take Him; He can be yours! "Let them take themselves each a lamb".
For four days the lamb was to be kept in the house, and each one of that household, surely, would love that lamb, would appreciate its perfections, its blemish-free character, its beauty, its attractiveness. For four days that lamb was the centre of that household -- it was *their* lamb. So God says, in @Exodus 12:5, "Your lamb", not just 'the lamb', not just 'the lamb of God's providing'. Yes, Jesus would never have been available to us had God not provided Him, but now God would say to us, He is your Lamb. Well, is He your Lamb? Have you treasured Him in your heart, treasured up the blessed perfections of the glory of that One?
Those four days have been linked to the four gospels, where you may read of the glories of the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of God, that are presented for your appreciation, to make your own; features of that Lamb, the One who came here for you -- not just to take as your Saviour (that is the starting point), but carry on, develop, learn, make Christ your own day-by-day, year-by-year. The Passover was going to be a yearly experience for them. The judgment was not coming every year, but the lamb was to be taken every year. In our experience it should be every day, I believe. Take Him afresh. Prove the Lord Jesus, make Him yours!
The lamb had to be slain -- there was no other way if the destroying angel was to pass over that
{68}
house. How we should grow in our appreciation of Christ and His sacrificial love. It does not just stop at the initial reception of the glad tidings when we opened our heart to the Lord Jesus; our appreciation is to go on and deepen as to the One who gave His life for us, the One who died that we might live. Oh! you say, in one sense the death of the Lord Jesus was an act between God and the blessed Lamb Himself, and so it was. Yet we are to be brought into the reality of the truth of it. One had to take that lamb, one had to sacrifice it. Each in the house would have felt it, the lamb being slain, the lamb that they had treasured, "your lamb" being slain that the firstborn might live, because of the blood of the lamb being put upon the doorposts and the lintel.
Then there is something further: the lamb that had been in the house for four days and then slain, was to be eaten. Every household in Egypt experienced death that night: either the death of the lamb or the death of the firstborn. Death is something that is to be ours too, as Paul says, "Whether ... life, or death ... all are yours" (@1 Corinthians 3: 22); death becomes a power for the believer. God would have us to make death ours. What does that mean? That we are to become formed in our affections through contemplating the One who bore the judgment for us and went into death. What we are by nature as sinners, God has removed, has taken away.
The Israelites were to take the lamb and they were to eat it. And we too are to feed upon Christ, contemplating what He has done for us, and to be
{69}
formed in our affections by it. Oh! let us take Christ, the One who has done everything for us, take Him as the One who has ended before God that which can never please God, the first order of man. Take Him as the One that has brought to life a new order of man that can please God, of which we are to be part as having believed on Him. So Moses says to the elders of Israel, "Seize and take yourselves lambs" (verse 21). Is Christ yours? No one can ever take Him from you; when you have that link in your soul with Christ, He is yours. May we grow in our knowledge and understanding of Him.
In @Matthew 26, having partaken of the Passover, the Lord, in introducing the Supper, says in regard to the loaf, "Take, eat". Think of the Lord Jesus as setting on the Supper! What we enjoy on a Lord's day morning has come down to us from that time in the grace and faithfulness of God. Think of what the Lord Jesus took -- a body that was prepared for Him by God (@Hebrews 10: 5); a "bondman's form", His place "in the likeness of men" (@Philippians 2: 7).
It is a very great privilege at the Lord's supper to be able to "take" the loaf that was given thanks for and then broken to make it available to us to partake of. The Lord would say, "Take". Maybe sometimes we do it out of routine week-by-week. May it not be so! May it be a living reality week-by-week to take it afresh. Think of the wisdom of God that has given us something that, to speak simply, we physically do take hold of. Think of the import of what you are doing -- taking and eating of that loaf which speaks
{70}
to our hearts peculiarly of the Lord's love.
Paul, in writing to Timothy, exhorts him to "Lay hold of eternal life, to which thou hast been called" (verse 12), and to "Enjoin on those rich in the present age ... that they may lay hold of what is really life" (verse 19). Have you made life yours? Have you made what is really life yours? Have you laid for yourself "a good foundation for the future"? Life is yours; it is your title as a believer in the Lord Jesus. Have you laid hold of it for yourself? Men would say, Lay hold of life here, make the most of the opportunities that are given to you, lay for yourself a foundation to really enjoy life. Ah! there is nothing here that is really life. There is nothing here that is worth your time and energy to lay hold of. What God offers you is far greater than anything that this world can offer you for life. Go in for the things that relate to the Lord Jesus; commit yourself to Him and His interests here. You may observe others who obviously enjoy life among the saints, but you will not enjoy it for yourself unless you go in for it.
Moses says to the children of Israel at the end of their wilderness pathway, "life and death have I set before you ... choose then life" (@Deuteronomy 30: 19). God would set life before you today. We are not just talking about life as having received the Lord Jesus as Saviour, but the enjoyment of life, life according to God. Enjoy this life, live it to the full as it relates to God. Sometimes we are so half-hearted in things (I speak for myself), we want some of this life here and some of that life, and we do not enjoy either. As
{71}
a believer, you cannot enjoy life here as men do -- nothing can really satisfy your soul apart from Christ. You will be disappointed, no matter how much of this life that you have in possessions and material things that go to make up man's life. Have they made him happy? No. Have they satisfied him? No, and they will not satisfy or make you happy either.
But there is something that will make you happy -- that is, life according to God; the power to live in the things relating to God. He wants you to live as His son. He has taken you up for blessing that you might be His son and that you might fill out your life here as a son and know Him as a blessed Father. There is no age barrier to being a son; there is no level of knowledge and understanding to be acquired in order to be a son. John writes to the little children. Why did he write to them? "Because ye have known the Father" (@1 John 2: 13). He has set before you life that you might have the power in the Spirit to live as a son for His joy, and to enjoy a link with those who love the Lord Jesus too.
That is life, the life that is found amongst those who love Jesus too. John says again, "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren" (@1 John 3: 14). We can love those who are marked by this character of life, and may we too commit ourselves to this manner of life and put our energy into it, and experience the joy, happiness and satisfaction it brings. There are so many things (and I speak simply, for myself), that perhaps we occupy ourselves with which we would have to say are not
{72}
"really life". They are bounded by death, and not worth time being spent on them. I am not talking about the things that we have to attend to in regard to our responsibility in fulfilling righteousness here. It is not a question of neglecting those things, but, having attended to them, being drawn away to something that is better, "really life". I think Paul knew it, and he was stimulating Timothy, and by him all the saints, to lay hold of something that is worthwhile and of great value. "Lay hold of what is really life". Seize it, make it yours, enjoy it for yourself.
We read in Proverbs: "Buy the truth, and sell it not". Buying involves a cost, a sacrifice. If things are to become ours in Christianity, if we are to progress and really make things our own, there is cost involved. The Lord says, "buy of me" certain things (@Revelation 3: 18). Are you willing to pay the price? It involves, again, a transaction with the blessed Lord Jesus, I believe; being alone with the Lord in prayer and, in the secret history of your soul, making these things our own. You do not get it just by reading about it, or by listening to others, but by being prepared to pay a price to get it. Once you have paid that price, it is yours. And do not sell it. It is yours, and it is eternal.
May each one of us be encouraged to ask the Lord Jesus that we might have these things made real to us, so that they are not just words that we speak about, or that we have heard spoken about, but they are realities that we prove, that we have
{73}
enjoyed, that we live in and that are ours, now and for eternity.
May it be so, for His Name's sake!

THE WINGS OF A DOVE
J. Taylor
@Psalm 68: 13; @Revelation 4: 1, 2
It is in my mind to speak about the Holy Spirit, but to confine my remarks to the Spirit as the power in the believer by which alone he can lay hold of, and enter into, his heavenly position. I have selected this verse in @Psalm 68 because it speaks of *doves¬ wings*; "as wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold". It refers thus emblematically to the Holy Spirit as characterising the believer. To those spoken of it is said that they should be like doves¬ wings. It is not that they *have* them, but that they should be *as* them: "ye shall be *as* wings of a dove".
The dove is emblematical of the Holy Spirit. We all remember how the Holy Spirit came down on our Lord Jesus Christ in bodily form as of a dove, and abode upon Him (@Luke 3: 22). When He came at Pentecost it was as cloven tongues of fire, and sat thus upon each of those assembled in the upper room at Jerusalem. The fact that He came in that way had its own voice: "And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting. And
{74}
there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them" (@Acts 2: 2, 3). First of all there is the *sound*; and then the cloven tongues of fire; thus there should be, on the one hand, *speaking*, and on the other, the means of consuming what is unsuitable to God.
The result of the activity of the Holy Spirit as thus seen would be to bring about what we get in this verse; that although the saints had lain among the sheepfolds, they should be as "wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold". That is the end reached; in other words, the believer is brought by the operation of the Holy Spirit in him to conformity with Christ. You should be as the wings of a dove, only covered with silver. The dove which came upon our Lord did not need that. We are not told what the wings are like or the plumage. It could add nothing to Christ in these respects, for all divine beauty was embodied in Him. The Holy Spirit came and abode upon Him; that is, there was a divine resting-place there.
In @Genesis 8 we get the first reference to the dove in Scripture. It says there, "God remembered Noah" (verse 1), and as the waters of judgment abated on the earth, Noah sent out a raven (verse 7). The raven went to and fro until the waters were dried up. He brought back no tidings to Noah. Nothing accrued to Noah or to the occupants of the ark through that enterprise. Then it says, "he sent out the dove *from him*" (verse 8), as if to remind us of the link between Noah and the dove. One need not say as to that, that
{75}
the Holy Spirit is one in the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is referred to in Scripture at the very outset; He was hovering over the face of the waters (@Genesis 1:2). He fully represented the divine thought in regard to the chaotic state which had come in. He hovered over the face of the waters, and was there when God said, "Let there be light" (verse 3). By Him God garnished the heavens (@Job 26: 13), and now when the raven fails to return, Noah sends out the dove from him. There was a link between him and the dove.
We are then told that "the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot, and returned *to him* into the ark"; suggestive again of a link between them. Then it says, "he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her *to him* into the ark" (verse 9). The dove goes out again and returns with an olive leaf plucked off. This shows us that the Holy Spirit does not rest in a scene under judgment, but He takes account of the fruit He produces. It was not an olive leaf *floating* on the waters, but one plucked off. The product of the Holy Spirit in the believer is not regarded as detached, but in relation to its root; hence it says it was "plucked off" and brought back to Noah in the ark. What a remarkable testimony!
It is a kind of foreshadowing of the day in which we now are. The deluge is a type of baptism: "which figure also now saves you, even baptism" (@1 Peter 3:21). In relation to that the Holy Spirit produces fruit for God. There is a nine-branched fruit tree in @Galatians 5: 22, 23, which we should ponder. The features the Holy Spirit looks for are the elements
{76}
which survive the judgment. In those who recognise the Holy Spirit and walk in the Spirit there is that blessed fruit for God, evidence of vitality; the dove brought the olive leaf back. There was the fruit of life in the midst of death.
Now the believer, as being like the wings of the dove with feathers of gold, may rise and enter into his distinctive heavenly portion. It was said that God bore Israel on eagles¬ wings and brought them to Himself (@Exodus 19: 4). Mark, it is eagles¬ wings, not doves¬ wings. When it is a question of being taken out of Egypt there is no thought of beauty or adornment, but when entrance into the divine sphere is in view the thought of adornment is introduced. If one is cold, one is not concerned as to the *colour* of his clothing, but the *warmth* that will accrue from it; if we *need* light we are not concerned as to the *kind* of light, whether it be candle, gas, or electricity, we want *light*; so it is in regard of power. When the Egyptian monarch was close upon the Israelites in pursuit, they were not thinking of the beauty or order of their equipment, what they needed was *power* -- swiftness to escape from the hostile armies close upon them. The eagle is the emblem of these features. So Jehovah says, "I have borne you on eagles¬ wings and brought you to myself". They are the wings of deliverance.
But when it is a question of entering into the divine sphere there is something further. Hence in Colossians we get the word 'fitness', because now it is a question of entering into Canaan. In Romans it is
{77}
exit from the world, which corresponds with Exodus; but Colossians is like the book of Joshua. Hence in Colossians we read, "giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light" (chapter 1:12). There is carelessness among the saints as to entrance into the presence of God. We have learnt something of the eagle's wings, but what about the dove's wings covered with silver and feathers of green gold, and entrance into the presence of God? When coming into the assembly it is not a question of eagles¬ wings, but of doves¬ wings. We are made "fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light".
In the message through Paul, the word was that they should receive an inheritance among them which are sanctified; the title to that is in the gospel, but Colossians speaks of fitness. Think of the light which shines in the circle of the saints! Were I ushered into heaven tonight what I should find would be ineffable light. Think of the magnitude of the grace of God which has made us meet for that! We know something of the full light of the sun at noon-time, but the apostle in his exuberance describes the light that shone around him as "a light above the brightness of the sun" (@Acts 26: 13). It brought him down to earth. Were we ushered into heaven tonight, ushered into all that light, there would be no falling down, we should be *holy and without blame before Him in love*, for "he has taken us into favour in the Beloved" (@Ephesians 1: 6).
The King's daughter is "all glorious ... within;
{78}
her clothing is of wrought gold" (@Psalm 45: 13). The "within" does not refer to her clothing, but to the King's palace; her clothing is in every way in keeping with the King's palace; yea, she *adorns* it.
It was thus with the prodigal: the servants were told to bring forth the best robe and put it on him; the robe was brought out (@Luke 15: 22). It is what Christ is as Man in the presence of God put on the Christian. Is there anything more magnificent than that? The robe is brought out -- the *best* one. There is only one best. The Holy Spirit brings out of heaven what Christ is as Man and puts it on the Christian, and he enters in that. It is wrought in the Christian; as here, "Though ye have lain among the sheepfolds, ye shall be as wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold". The silver is the token of redemption; we go in on that ground:
<blockquote>'Higher and higher yet, <br> In Thee, through blood made nigh; <br>We taste the love that knows no let, <br> And "Abba, Father!" cry' (`427:5). </blockquote>
Now the apostle John in the book of Revelation helps us as to this. In thinking over the subject my mind reverted to the epistles and traversed Romans, Colossians, Ephesians, and finally reached Revelation. The epistle to the Ephesians coupled with the book of Revelation shows the power of the Holy Spirit in the Christian as enabling him to enter into his heavenly portion. In Romans the Spirit is connected with the *state* of the Christian; through Him deliverance is practically effected. In Revelation the
{79}
believer is seen outside natural laws and impediments. It is well to take note of that. The epistles take account of us in this world for God. The book of Revelation contemplates a state outside natural laws; it comports in that with the feast of weeks (@Deuteronomy 16), a feast not bound by time like the other feasts in Deuteronomy. The feast of tabernacles is the millennium; it is governed by *time*; a long era of great blessing, but limited. When we come to the feast of weeks, it is not so; no time of duration is given; it refers to what lies in the Spirit, and the Spirit is the power in us by which we rise outside of time and its limitations and reach what is eternal.
We see in @Revelation 21 the holy city *coming down* from God out of heaven. In order to come down it had to be placed in heaven, and Ephesians and Thessalonians instruct as to this. Revelation touches on the power of the Spirit by which the believer has an exodus out of time limitations into what is eternal. Hence at the outset we read, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice ... and I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me" (@Revelation 1: 10, 12). John sees Christ and sees Him here in the midst of the assemblies. After this things are shown him and the passage I read says, "I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven", not now for someone to come out -- the Lord has come out. The Son of man descended and is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens. Now there is a door opened in
{80}
heaven; it is not here translation; that is not by the Holy Spirit, but by the direct act of the Lord Himself. He comes Himself, as in Thessalonians: "the Lord himself, with an assembling shout ... shall descend from heaven" (@1 Thessalonians 4:16). The Lord comes down to meet us and take us up.
Here John hears a voice which said, "Come up here". That voice has resounded throughout the dispensation. If it enters our souls it makes strangers of us as in this world. If strangers, then pilgrims. The Lord calls us to our heavenly portion. John says, "Immediately I became in the Spirit". We see thus that entrance into heaven *now* is by the Spirit. I refer only to the principle, as of course what is spoken of in these verses was special. There is no ladder in view here as in Jacob's vision (@Genesis 28: 12). There a ladder was set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven, and angels of God ascended and descended on it. The ladder was for the angels to go up. The point was that Jacob here on the earth was the object of interest to heaven; that is, in picture, the millennium. The Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these ... Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (@John 1: 50, 51).
But now the Lord is in heaven and there is no ladder for us to ascend by, but John was in the Spirit. To enter on our heavenly portion we must become in the Spirit and know how to retire into what is spiritual. We can enter into divine things only by the Spirit; we must be as the wings of a dove; we reach
{81}
that by the power of the Holy Spirit. "Though ye have lain among the sheepfolds, ye shall be as wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold". The Christian enters in that beauty into the presence of God. We shall have spiritual bodies also.
Thus, beloved brethren, we can understand the correspondence effected by the Spirit between Christ and the saints. "ye shall be as wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold". They find their place as holy and without blame before Him in love, as those taken into favour in the Beloved.

MORAL DECONTAMINATION
J. Mason
Most people now know the significance of the term 'decontamination' in connection with A.R.P. (Air Raid Protection) work. The gases released by the explosion of gas bombs contaminate the substances with which they come in contact, so that these substances themselves become such that they will give off dangerous vapours or cause injury by contact. Hence they need to be decontaminated so as to be rendered harmless.
The object of this paper is not to explain A.R.P. procedure, but to draw the attention of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ to certain very important principles, of which we are reminded by this subject. We are in a world where contaminating evils abound,
{82}
and, alas! we well know how easily we become contaminated, the flesh in us being what it is. It is true, also, that we may carry contamination, and so it is a matter of importance to see how we may be decontaminated, if we may apply the figure.
As having received the glad tidings, we have come into blessings which are eternal; blessings of which none can rob us because they have been secured for us by Christ; blessings, too, which are heavenly in character (@Ephesians 1: 3). We believers are a heavenly people (@John 17: 14, etc.), called out for a heavenly portion; but, while we wait for the full realization of our blessings, we are left down here to learn the moral character and attributes of God, and what is suitable to Him. We have to learn to judge sin, the flesh, and the world. For this reason the Scriptures abound with instructions for believers as to these things.
When a believer sins, his conscience witnesses to him of it, and therefore his joy and communion with God are hindered. On the other hand, there are wonderful divine activities on his behalf and for his recovery. "If any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (@1 John 2: 1). Christ is there with the Father to take up our case, and He is always available: we *have* Him. Our being brought to feel sin and confess it are the outcome of His activities. The Holy Spirit, too, indwelling us, acts for us and in us down here. He is grieved where sin is, but grace brings us to repentance and confession, so that we can be free with God again, happy in
{83}
the presence of Christ, and in the enjoyment of all our blessings in the power of the Holy Spirit. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (@1 John 1: 9). The sin is judged and the sense of contamination gone. What a wonderful system of grace we are brought into! Yet we need to have a deeper judgment of what sin is and what the flesh is (see @Romans 7). Christ had to be forsaken of God and go into death on our account, bearing the righteous judgment of God on sin and on all that we are in the flesh.
To continue in sin is most serious, for we not only dishonour Christ and lose our own joy, but we may have to face the consequences of it in the government of God. We should, therefore, get quickly adjusted; and it is blessed to know that divine Persons are active in view of recovery. The types in the Old Testament are instructive in this respect. In the book of Leviticus we see what a system of offerings was available to the children of Israel in relation to their approach to God, and what was provided for sin and trespass. It all suggests appreciation of the perfections of Christ and His one perfect offering, for it is only by Him that we can approach. He had to go the way of suffering and death on account of our sins and that the order of man who sinned might be removed judicially from before God.
@Leviticus 13 and 14 give detailed instruction as to leprosy -- that dread disease, a type of sin -- lawlessness, the activity of man's will. It is not
{84}
intended to go into the details now, but what is to be noted among other things is that the leper was to be separated from the people (@Leviticus 13: 45, 46). He was unfit to be in the company of others, as the disease would spread. Great care was exercised by the priest as to the leper's recovery also. We must bear in mind that wherever the will of man appears, it is sin. Much of this has now developed in Christendom without being judged and put "outside the camp", so that many are defiled. How solemn it is when what is merely of man and man's mind enters into the service of God. King Uzziah (@2 Chronicles 26: 16 - 21), attempted to offer incense in self-will, and leprosy appeared on his forehead and he was driven out. So we are challenged as to the present conditions in which we are found. What are we going on with? Are we 'contaminated' with what is so rampant today in what professes to serve God? Are we associated with evil?
Some say that by remaining where they are they can exercise a certain influence for good; others say that they may worship God though they be side-by-side with unbelievers. But what really matters is: how does the blessed God, who is holy, regard these things? If we love Him, we shall accept His word and seek to walk humbly in the light of it.
A scripture directly bearing on these matters is @Haggai 2: 10 - 14. The priests were asked: "If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread ... or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said,
{85}
No". This question and answer show that holiness is not communicated to common things by associating with them.
Another question is asked: "If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, is it become unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean". The instruction is clear: uncleanness is communicated by association. So that a believer coming into contact with the dead system of this world -- even its religion -- is himself 'contaminated'. This is solemn, because what is offered to God is unclean in these circumstances (see verse 14).
And, further, it is these evil conditions which account for the barrenness and lack of food amongst many Christians now (verses 16, 17). There is so little concern in these days in which we live as to what is suitable to God. How it should strike home to every heart so that there may be a revival of affection for Christ and a desire to serve the living God according to His requirements. "Consider your ways", He says through the prophet (@Haggai 1: 5). Where we are exercised to provide right conditions there will be plenty (see @Haggai 2: 18, 19, and @Malachi 3: 8 - 12).
The New Testament supports this. The call now is to the people of God to come out and be separate (@2 Corinthians 6: 14 - 18), from the world system. Even the whole system of professing religion has been 'contaminated' by the enemy, and man's will has sway there, not the Spirit of God. Indeed, it is soon to come under the direct judgment of God, as the book of Revelation shows it under the figure of
{86}
Babylon. But we are called upon to have a judgment of it now and to purge ourselves. The voice from heaven is saying, "Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins, and that ye do not receive of her plagues" (@Revelation 18: 4).
Then we have that word in @2 Timothy 2: 19: "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", and, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these" (i.e., vessels to dishonour), "he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work". We are then free to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (verses 21, 22), and so there can be true christian fellowship.
The Lord Jesus, ere leaving this world, expressed a desire to His own: "This do in remembrance of me". He again communicated it through Paul (see @1 Corinthians 11:23 - 25). The Lord's supper was intended to keep Himself livingly before our hearts and minds in all His great love for us, and so secure from us a response to Himself. How worthy He is! He, whose body has been given and whose blood has been poured out for us! Are we answering to this love and its request? Professing Christendom has forgotten Christ and is fast turning away, just as Israel did in Moses¬ absence. They said, "for this Moses ... we do not know what is become of him!" and they turned to idolatry (@Exodus 32: 1). Well, it becomes a challenge to every true Christian as to whether Christ has His place in his or her affections. The
{87}
Lord's supper is to the end that He may have His place in a sustained way. But it involves our being free from the iniquity and idolatry around, and being found in pure conditions suitable to Christ -- we must be 'decontaminated', so to speak. The teaching of @1 Corinthians 10 and 11 shows this. Evil must be judged in the individual and in his associations, and the Lord's rights practically owned. It is only in this way that we may have His presence and enjoy the privileges of the assembly. We must be guarded even in relation to professedly 'separate' companies of believers. Do they recognize the rights of the Lord? Do they make room for the Holy Spirit? Is the truth maintained? These are matters we have to see to in seeking to find "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" in an evil day.
These are urgent matters for us to attend to, for the days left to us here are few. The Lord Himself will soon have come to take us to be with Himself (@1 Thessalonians 4: 16, 17). We feel that moment is near and the prevailing world conditions show it, too. May we not be found going on with what is evil when He comes! May the hope of His coming burn in our hearts! The practical effect will be, as Scripture puts it: "every one that hath this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure" (@1 John 3:3).

THE GLORY OF DIVINE GRACE
A. J. Gardiner
@Ephesians 1: 3 - 11; @Ephesians 4: 8 - 16; @Joshua 10: 10 - 14
I trust that I am able to convey what I have in mind. One seeks to present the great thought before the mind of God -- the body of Christ, the fulness of Christ -- and that what God is effecting now by means of the gifts is nothing less than this, and what we are to have before us is nothing less than this, "the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", no less measure. The Son of God is God's ideal. The Christ is what He is working to, and so no less a thought than the full thought of manhood as set out in Jesus is to be before our hearts.
I need not say that there is a dual thought in God's mind, in regard to manhood as seen in Jesus: one is that Man is before Him entirely for His pleasure, capable of responding to Him in a way that affords Him satisfaction; and the other is that Man is in view as the One in whom God can be perfectly expressed. "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion ..." (@Genesis 1:26). Both these thoughts are to be filled out in Christ and the assembly, His body, for the assembly is the great vessel in which God is to be ministered to for His own pleasure, in affectionate and intelligent response ...
There is not only what ministry has in view, but there is also the part we are all to play in this. There is something now brought in which is not a question of gift. We are not all gifted, but we all have a part
{89}
to play in this matter of the edifying of the body. Verse 15 reads, "but, holding the truth in love, we may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply ...". It is a question of the saints as set together, compacted, every joint doing its part.
How important this is in our local companies, that we should be compacted, and that every one should hold himself under the influence of Christ, and that the truth should be held in love, not abstractly, but in love, understanding that all the saints are essential for it. "God ... has raised us up *together*, and has made us sit down *together* in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2: 4 - 6). All the saints are necessary. We do not want to be without them. It is a question of being fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply; each brother and sister having something to supply with a view to the increase and building up of this vessel which has one end in view, and that is the expression of Christ. That is what is contemplated here: "according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love". As the truth is held in love, and we are growing up in all things to Christ, who is the Head, and deriving from Him, there is the ability to edify ourselves. The body edifies itself in love.
In closing, I want to refer to the passage in Joshua, for I think that is illustrative of what I have been saying, and also brings in a further feature
{90}
which enters into what God is effecting. @Joshua 10 is, I believe, the point of greatest power reached by the people under Joshua, and the beginning of the chapter presents to us certain kings, of whom the first was the king of Jerusalem, coming against the people to prevent them from entering into the inheritance which God had prepared for them.
Jerusalem in Scripture nearly always sets forth the truth of the assembly in actual expression among the saints, not in the abstract thought of it, which is more Zion, but in actual expression among the saints, and that was in enemy hands. A king of the Amorites was king of Jerusalem and it was a question of the people of God coming into their inheritance. They went to battle and the people themselves effected a great deal, and then, in addition to what the people effected, God effected a great deal. He cast down hailstones from heaven so that there was a complete victory gained by this two-fold means: what the people themselves did, how they slew the enemies, and then what God Himself did from heaven, casting down hailstones upon them.
It is a good thing, dear brethren, to see that these are the two lines on which God is operating now with a view to our being brought practically into His present thoughts for us. There is what is being effected in the power of gift from Christ in heaven, but we must not think that everything is going to be effected by gift. There is what we have to do ourselves, and as we set ourselves to do our part, we shall find that God is with us, and that the power
{91}
exercised by Christ in heaven will help to further what we, ourselves, are doing; but both means were used in this great victory to overthrow these kings, so that the people of God might go into the inheritance. But then there is another thing and that is the power of prayer. Joshua saw what was needed, that the day should go beyond the length of an ordinary day, and so he calls upon the sun to stand still. He says, "Sun, stand still upon Gibeon; and thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon".
We must acknowledge that there is much to be done yet if the saints are to be brought into full possession of all that God has in His mind for them. With all the light that God has given us (and the Lord has been giving much light), we must acknowledge we have a long way to go yet as regards actually getting into these things in power. So that Joshua, seeing what was needed there, called upon the sun to stand still. He seeks that the full shining of Christ should continue: the sun stood still in the midst of heaven.
It is a question of appealing, so to speak, that the full shining of Christ should be brought to bear powerfully upon the saints. "Arise, shine! for thy light is come" (@Isaiah 60: 1). The apostle says, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee" (@Ephesians 5: 14). It is a question of prayer that calls upon God to cause the light of Christ and all that it means to shine powerfully upon the present situation, that the saints should be brought into their inheritance.
{92}
So Paul, in the epistle to the Ephesians, doubtless feeling that it was beyond even his ability to set out at great length what the thoughts of God were, and indeed if there were any attempt to define them it would but limit them, whereas in fact, they are illimitable, just sets out enough to convey the mind of God in outline and to incite interest in it on our part, and then he prays. He tells us in chapter 1 at great length what he prays, and in chapter 3 he prays again, that the Father would strengthen us with might by His, the Father's, Spirit "in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith in your hearts" (verse 17). It is as though he is crying to the Father that He would cause the Christ to shine, and to shine unchallenged upon the hearts of the saints. That is what Paul does, he prays, he bows his knees.
There was never a day like this day in Joshua which extended about the length of two days, and that is what this present dispensation is doing. It is being extended about the length of two days. "One day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (@2 Peter 3:8). This great dispensation is being extended because God has His choicest thoughts to effectuate in the saints. So what is needed, in addition to what we do ourselves and what Christ does from heaven, is that there may be power to pray, and power to pray in a way that will prevail: "And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man". A man commanded the situation. You may rest assured that the more we pray in relation to
{93}
these great things, the more God will answer it in bringing the saints into them in power. Paul prays in chapter 3, and in chapter 6 he urges us to pray and persevere in it for all the saints (verse 18). He enlarges on the necessity for prayer. As to this great victory, it says, "there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel".
That is all I had to say, to stimulate us in the recognition of the importance of this day, the great things that God has in mind for the saints that we are to be brought into. I repeat that it is not a question of waiting until the Lord comes to bring us into these things. What Ephesians has in mind is not the future but the present, the saints entering into their portion at the present time. There is ministry from the Christ in glory; there is also what each is to do as a joint of supply contributing his own part; and then, finally, there is the great power of prayer, prayer exercised by those who have power with God, for God will hearken to the voice of the man who is in the appreciation of His thoughts regarding the assembly and desires that the saints may come into them.

BY THE RIVER OF GOD
F. S. Marsh
@Psalm 65: 9; @Ezra 8: 15 - 23; @Ezekiel 1: 1, 26 - 28; @Acts 16: 9 - 13; @Revelation 22: 1
A touching description of a beloved servant of God, now with the Lord, was given by one who knew him well, in these words: 'He lived by the River of God, which is full of water'.
How much this was in accord with the references in the Scriptures to those who were found "by the river", prophetically indicating that they were enjoying the presence, and drawing from the resources, of the Holy Spirit of God, and were thus maintained in power, freshness, and spiritual vigour.
EZRA evidently attached great importance to this when he was about to return to Jerusalem with many of those who had been in captivity in Babylon. He "gathered them together *at the river* that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days". It was then discovered that there were "none of the sons of Levi there". As a priest, who had the interest of God at heart, he knew that, if the service of God was to be recovered, Levites were essential. So he sent messengers to "bring us ministers for the house of our God". They came, thirty-eight Levites and "two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were expressed by name". The Lord knows the name of every one who is willing to consecrate his service to God!
Then at that river he proclaimed a fast "that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of
{95}
him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance ... and we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was entreated of us".
How encouraging it is that in the face of the perilous journey of life and the desire in each heart to be a contributor to the work of God, there should be found by the river of God suitable <p><b>PREPARATION FOR THE SERVICE OF GOD</b>
and that, consequent upon prayer and fasting, the needed power for all that is before us is obtained in the Holy Spirit.
No wonder that journey which Ezra took was accomplished, despite all the perils, without harm and loss, and that the temple of God having been rebuilt, the service of God was re-established, when the spiritual movement commenced by the river!
EZEKIEL, too, knew the import and value of this. His prophecy begins with the words, "as I was among the captives *by the river* ... the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God". It is significant that the centre of those visions was "a man" above upon the throne (verse 26). It was prophetic of Christ in glory, but it was given to this man, who could say, "the Spirit lifted me up ... and I came to them of the captivity ... that dwelt *by the river* Chebar, and I sat where they sat" (chapter 3: 14, 15). A moment had come in his life when, by the leading and power of the Spirit of God, he had been brought to sit with those who were true to God, who were mourning the state of the people and their captivity, and whose heart-feeling found expression in the beautiful words of
{96}
@Psalm 137: 1, "*By the rivers* of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion". Each one could say that he preferred Jerusalem above his chief joy.
As there was a sovereign movement of the Holy Spirit of God in that day, even so in this day there are those who, under the leading of the Spirit of God have identified themselves with those who, though despised, have God's centre in their hearts, and God's house and its holy service as their chief interest. In language often employed today, Ezekiel 'came into fellowship' by the river, with the result that he was given <p><b>LIGHT AS TO THE TRUTH OF GOD</b>.
In his inspired prophecy he lays great emphasis on the action of the Spirit of God -- seven times referring to His direct operations. To be intelligent as to God's mind, it is essential that each should be prepared to bear the reproach of Christ; to sit together with those who love God and cherish His assembly; and to dwell by the river-side, continuously empowered and enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONS TO GOD
P. J. S. McMullan
@Matthew 12: 15 - 21; @Genesis 18: 16 - 21; @Romans 16: 1, 2; @1 Chronicles 4: 9, 10
I have in mind, dear brethren, to say a little, as the Lord may help, about the importance of persons to God -- the importance of men and women, and boys and girls, to God Himself. Men in general take little thought, I believe, for God, yet God is thinking about them. I use the word 'men' to include the female. You will remember when Paul writes to Timothy, he exhorts that prayers should be made "for all men; for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life ... for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth" (@1 Timothy 2: 2 - 4). Men are of such great importance to God that He wants them not only to be saved but to come to the knowledge of the truth.
In @Genesis 1: 2, it says, "the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep". What a transformation God effected in six days, for by then the earth was producing grass, herb and fruit-trees; there were animals on the earth, fish in the seas, fowl in the heavens -- the whole scene was teeming with life! And then "Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward" ("Eden" means 'pleasure'), "and there put Man whom he had formed" (chapter 2: 8); there He made "every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food" (verse 9). How beautiful that garden must have been!
{98}
"And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it" (verse 15); and then God made Man "a helpmate, his like" (verse 18). What care, may I say reverently, God had taken for Man's benefit! Then we read of God "walking in the garden in the cool of the day" and He "called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou?" (chapter 3: 8, 9). Think of that! The mighty God, the Creator of all things, came down to seek out His creature Man. Such was God's interest in man then, and that interest continues right until this day. Indeed, He is going to dwell with men eternally. What a God He is!
Alas! Man was hiding from God, for he and his wife had sinned. Think of the distance that sin brought in between man and God! But God had in mind the incoming of Christ four thousand years later, who would take up the whole sin question, the liability that lay upon men, to God's satisfaction. Why? That God might have men and women, and boys and girls in nearness to Himself, for His pleasure.
We read in @Matthew 12 about the word through Isaiah the prophet, "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen", speaking prophetically of the Lord Jesus Christ. In @Genesis 18 we read of Abraham, a man of whom God said, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah". In @Romans 16 we have a valued sister in Cenchrea, who was going to visit in Rome, and so there was a letter written on her behalf by Paul -- the epistle to the
{99}
Romans -- commending Phoebe to the brethren in Rome. Then we read in @1 Chronicles 4 about Jabez who asked that God would richly bless him and enlarge his border. Think of some one asking God to richly bless him!
I referred to Matthew first, where it says of the Lord Jesus that "great crowds followed him; and he healed them all", and then Jesus "charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known". The people would have made much of Him then, but it was not the time for His receiving glory from men. That day is soon to come. The next great event will be when the Lord comes to take all those who believe on Him to be with Him -- for those of us who are alive, "we shall all be changed, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet" (@1 Corinthians 15: 52); those who have died in faith "shall be raised incorruptible"; and together we will be taken up to be "always with the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 4:17). What a moment that will be!
But the time for His display to this world will be after that, when the Lord will come out of heaven with His own to reign over the earth for a thousand years. What a day that will be! Christ will have His proper place *then*, but in the meantime He is in rejection. So, in @Matthew 12, He would not have Himself made much of, and it is the fulfilling of the word spoken through the prophet Isaiah, "Behold my servant ...". Think of the delight of God in Jesus, and what He meant to God as, "my servant"!
"Behold" -- I do not suppose we use that word
{100}
much today, but I would suggest that it means that we should 'take a good look': take a good look at the Lord Jesus as the One who was here as God's Servant, "whom I have chosen, my beloved". Oh! dear brethren, what did the Lord Jesus mean to the Father? My Servant, My Beloved "in whom my soul has found its delight". What delight the Father found in Jesus as He was here upon the earth. He did everything that was pleasing to His Father; He did not do anything apart from the will of God. He came into Manhood for that purpose.
You and I might like to exert our own wills (and oftentimes my will will be in conflict with the will of God), as to the way in which we should live and deport ourselves here. The Lord Jesus knew nothing of that. He was here only to do the will of God, no matter what man or Satan might do to Him, or might try to do to Him. You will recall that they tried to throw Him over the edge of the cliff on one occasion, "but *he*, passing through the midst of them, went his way" (@Luke 4: 30). But here, typically, the Father was speaking of the One in whom His soul had "found its delight". Would that my soul found more of its delight in Jesus! Would that that was the portion of each one of us!
"I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations". He is going to do that very shortly. Before He reigns -- and we have spoken about that -- He will come and take all believers to be with Himself, both those who are living and those who have died. Then there will be the "time of
{101}
Jacob's trouble" (@Jeremiah 30: 7), and then the terrible judgments that will come upon Europe and its outgoings -- whether it be in the Americas, or Australasia, continents which were largely populated initially from Europe -- and then the Lord will commence to reign for one thousand years. You can read about those awful judgments in the Revelation.
Revelation is a book that has a blessing attached to the reading of it. Even if you do not understand it, there is a blessing for you for having read it (@Revelation 1:3). It is very interesting the way it opens: "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen" -- that is, believers -- "what must shortly take place" (chapter 1: 1). Now is that not a remarkable thing, that God would, may we say, think it well to put down His thoughts in writing so that you and I might understand what He was about to do?
"He shall not strive or cry out ... until he bring forth judgment unto victory; and on his name shall the nations hope". "The nations" is another interesting thought in Scripture, because the Jews were God's favoured people. Who were the nations? The Jews were the people of God, and the nations, or the Gentiles, everybody else. Thank God, that includes us, so that we too can have our hope on the name of the Lord. "On his name shall the nations hope". This is the One of whom the Father could say, "In whom my soul has found its delight". Oh! the feelings, dear brethren, that we are allowed to appreciate of what God thought about Jesus when He was here.
Now in @Genesis 18 we read of Abraham, who is
{102}
said to be "father of us all" (@Romans 4: 16), and he had a very remarkable history. He was called upon by God to leave his country and his family and "Go ... to the land that I will shew thee" (@Genesis 12: 1). We find in chapter 18 that "Jehovah appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre. And he sat at the tent-door in the heat of the day" (verse 1). Abraham hastens (verse 6) and gets Sarah to knead "three seahs of wheaten flour, and make cakes". He runs to the herd and takes a calf, tender and good, and dresses it and provides a fine meal for these heavenly Visitors, who were typical, indeed, of God. But God is going on to judgment, as we find later in the chapter that "the men rose up thence", -- that is, these heavenly Visitors -- "and looked toward Sodom".
Then Jehovah says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" Abraham is called the "friend of God" (@2 Chronicles 20:7; @Isaiah 41: 8; @James 2: 23). Think of God having a man for His friend! I seek to speak simply, dear brethren, but I trust reverentially, in relation to the feelings of the blessed God. We have spoken of the feelings of the Father in relation to Jesus, as the One "in whom my soul has found its delight", but here we have Abraham, a man of faith, who was called out from land and kindred, and who did not know where he was going, but he took God at His word and he came out. Of that man God says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing? Since Abraham shall indeed become a great and mighty nation; and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him".
{103}
What a man he was! How important he was in the ways of God! Abraham's children, and their children, and the succeeding generations, were going to be brought into the land of promise, as God had told him in the previous chapter. It says in relation to Abraham personally, in verse 19, "For I know him" -- God knows him, just as He knows you and me -- "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him". Think of the way in which Abraham conducted the affairs of his household -- "and they shall keep the way of Jehovah". God was finding pleasure in Abraham, a man of faith, but a man who was able to organise his affairs in such a way that God says, I know what he will do -- "he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice".
What pleasure God could take in that man! So He would today, as each of us take up our responsibilities before God to do what is right and proper in His sight. It says, "they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him".
Then we find that Abraham is able to intercede with God. Abraham knew that his nephew, Lot, was in Sodom, and his wife and his family, and he intercedes with God for them. Do you see the way in which he does it? He says, "There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty
{104}
righteous that are therein?" Then Abraham reduces the number, bringing it down to forty-five, then forty, then thirty, then twenty and, finally, to ten, and Jehovah says, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake" (verses 22 - 32). So Lot and his family were saved out of Sodom by the intercession of Abraham. We have thought of the Lord Jesus as One who is delightful to God, and in Abraham we have a man in the ordinary affairs of life, and he is important to God too!
In @Romans 16 we read about Phoebe, and I think that is all we ever read in Scripture about her. It says that she is a minister, and footnote *e* tells us that she was a deaconess, that is, not one who ministers to the spiritual needs of others, but to their practical needs. From time-to-time, you may know of some one who is ill and may be in need of some assistance, perhaps to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy for some items; or a person who would be very cheered by a visit to inquire after their welfare, or to read to them. As we know, there are people who are unable to leave their home. They may not see anybody for perhaps days, or weeks on end. It is a good service to go and visit those who are not so favoured as ourselves, and, I believe, the Lord is pleased with such service to His own.
The Lord Jesus says in @Matthew 25, "I was ill, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me" (verse 36). Of course, the Pharisees reply that they never saw Him ill, nor in prison. The Lord says, "Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me" (verse 40).
{105}
What a service we can render to a fellow-believer! Phoebe was one who did whatever was needed in the place in which she lived, in Cenchrea.
Paul says, "I commend to you Phoebe, our sister ... that ye may receive her in the Lord worthily of saints, and that ye may assist her in whatever matter she has need of you; for *she* also has been a helper of many, and of myself". Paul could speak of the way in which Phoebe had catered for his needs, and those of many others. I believe that Phoebe was an important person in the sight of the Lord. Paul could speak well of her, and he was one who was of great importance in the service of the Lord. Indeed, when he was taken up, the Lord said, "this man is an elect vessel to me" (@Acts 9: 15). He was an important person to the Lord.
But Phoebe's service was not ministering to the saints in other parts, but in ministering to the needs of those in her own home town, where she was an encouragement and help to those who were there, and to those who visited; and the Lord takes note of such service to His own. Let us lay hold of this thought, dear brethren, that we are of importance in the sight of divine Persons; They take account of our activities.
Now we read in @1 Chronicles 4, "And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, Oh that thou wouldest richly bless me". I wonder if we have ever done that -- asked God to bless us. What sort of blessing would we want? Help to pass our examinations? A good job? A nice house? What would you
{106}
ask for? Jabez was not vague in what he asked for. He wanted a rich blessing, no small blessing; he wanted to be richly blessed, and he said, "and enlarge my border". What did that mean? Jabez would be responsible for what was inside his own borders, but he is asking for more, for more responsibility. Now here is a man who is of great interest to heaven.
We only have these two verses about Jabez, but they have been retained in Scripture that you and I might read them and challenge ourselves if we are moved in our affections sufficiently to ask God to bless us. Do you ever ask the Lord to give you a job, to give you some service to do for Him or for His people? Did you ever do that? I believe divine Persons love persons like Jabez, who will ask for something else to do for Them.
"Oh that thou wouldest ... enlarge my border, and that thy hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil". Not only was Jabez looking for additional responsibility, but he was also asking that he might be kept from evil. He wanted to be kept serviceable, as it were, to the Lord, not to be distracted with evil but to be here doing what was pleasing to the Lord, as it says, "that it may not grieve me!" And what does it say? "And God brought about what he had requested". What will you ask the Lord for today? Will He give you something? Prove Him for yourself!
As believers, we are of great importance to divine Persons -- whether as those who have delight in
{107}
God's Servant; or as those, like Abraham, who arrange their affairs, and can influence those about them, in a way that is pleasing to the Lord; or as those, like Phoebe, who are willing helpers of the saints; or, like Jabez, who want the Lord's blessing and to be available to Him for service.
May our desire be, dear brethren, that we may be pleasing and serviceable to the Lord in the days that remain to us, until He takes us to be with Himself! The Lord bless these thoughts to us, for His Name's sake!

GOD'S DISPENSATION AS KNOWN IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH
C. A. Coates
@1 Timothy 1: 4, 5, 18 - 20
The gospel is "the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God" (verse 11). It makes God known in His glory -- His righteousness, His power, His love -- and it shows how favourable that glory is to men. Men naturally dread to think of God, but all the glories that compose His name stand engaged to bless men. The glad tidings make known God to us as revealed in grace so that we may turn to Him and be blessed. "Sound teaching" (verse 10) is according to the glad tidings; it exposes every evil, but it puts the believer in the possession and enjoyment of good.
Those who have been illuminated by the glory of the blessed God as made known in the glad tidings
{108}
constitute "the household of faith" (@Galatians 6: 10). In a rightly ordered household each utensil has its place, and each servant has his or her appointed service to fulfil. But no household that ever was on earth had such a perfect ordering as the household of faith, if we consider it according to the divine thought, for God's dispensation, or household order, is known there. The word translated "dispensation" refers to the management of a household. God has a dispensation, or household, at the present time, and every one who knows God is called to take up the exercise of furthering it. This is a great privilege; everything should be subservient to it. That dispensation can be summed up in two words -- faith and love.
We all believe that there will be a wonderful ordering of things in "the administration" -- same word as "dispensation" in @1 Timothy 1: 4 -- "of the fulness of times" (@Ephesians 1: 10), when the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth will be headed up in the Christ. There will be nothing out of place then. God's pleasure which He purposed in Himself will have its perfect answer. What a "dispensation" will that be! It will be a public spectacle of beautiful order; there will not be an element of imperfection in the administration.
But there is a dispensation now just as wonderful, though not so public, and it is of the utmost importance that we should know how to further it, so that it may work out efficiently so far as we are concerned. There are many things which do not further it, but such things are vain and worthless. "Other
{109}
doctrines", "fables", "interminable genealogies", "vain discourse", "law-teachers", all miss the mark. They "bring questionings rather than further God's dispensation".
God's dispensation is *in faith*, but we must not think of faith as something shadowy and unreal. Faith *substantiates* things hoped for; it is the conviction of things not seen (@Hebrews 11: 1). When faith begins to operate, it powerfully affects every detail of our lives. Paul, while present in the body, walked "by faith, not by sight" (@2 Corinthians 5: 7), and there is no other principle on which to walk with reference to God. What is not in faith forms no part of God's dispensation. Faith leads to taking a course which is definitely in relation to God; it is an active and operative principle.
@Hebrews 11 is a wonderful chapter as showing how faith acts. All through it is, 'they did so-and-so'. It is not simply that they believed certain things, but they took a certain course. No doubt we believe many things! We hear people say sometimes that they believe every word in the Bible! But the question is, Have I ever taken a single step which was simply in relation to God? a step which I should not have taken but for the fact that I had light in my soul from God? That bit pertained to God's dispensation; it was in faith.
Moses "persevered, as seeing him who is invisible", and in the light of that "he left Egypt" (@Hebrews 11: 27). Faith leads one to leave the wisdom of this world, and of the rulers of this world (@1 Corinthians 2: 6 - 8).
{110}
They "come to nought", but God's hidden wisdom was predetermined before the ages for our glory. None of the princes of this world knew it. Faith stands in God's power, and His ordering of things is outside this world, outside man's wisdom altogether; it is *in faith*. God had wonderful thoughts in Christ "before the ages for our glory", and when we come into the light of them in faith we leave Egypt; we part company with the wisdom of this world. If Christians do not do so they cannot further God's dispensation.
"And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think; but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith" (@Romans 12: 2, 3). God's dispensation is alluded to here, and we see that each believer has his allotted place in it. "God has dealt to each a measure of faith". In His ordering of things He has served out to each a measure of faith which determines the place and service which each one has to fill in the household of faith. We have to think soberly and wisely about this, because what is in faith has to be furthered.
None of God's called ones can say that they have not had dealt out to them a measure of faith. It is for each one to find out what that measure is, and we find it out by thinking soberly about it. I must not
{111}
have high thoughts above what I should think, for I cannot have such thoughts *with God*, nor shall I have Him *with me* in seeking to carry them out. But, on the other hand, I must not allow my thoughts to come short of the "measure of faith" which God has dealt to me.
I believe most of us are more in danger of stopping short of our divine measure than we are of going beyond it. If a man takes the place of being able to do all that is needed amongst the brethren -- like a clergyman or minister -- he certainly has "high thoughts above what he should think". But amongst those who see the evil of this there is probably more need of the whip for the horse than of the bridle for the ass (@Proverbs 26: 3). We need inciting to come up to our measure as much as we need warning not to soar above it. Archippus was exhorted to take heed to the ministry which he had received in the Lord, to the end that he fulfilled it (@Colossians 4: 17).
Each member of the body has an office to fill, and God has dealt faith to each for the function which is appointed to each in His dispensation. It is thus that we find our place as one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other (@Romans 12:5), and we find that we are essential to each other, and that we can go on together for mutual help. *Your* faith is essential to *my* prosperity, and mine to yours. I would say to the youngest believer, The brethren need *your* contribution of faith. Think of the great "apostle of nations" (@Romans 11: 13) looking forward to seeing the saints at Rome, "to have
{112}
mutual comfort among you, each by the faith which is in the other, both yours and mine" (@Romans 1: 12).
God would have each of us to realise that we are indispensable to the body. The brethren need the contribution of my God-given "measure of faith". Let us get away from human thoughts as to ourselves, and seek the furtherance of what is in faith. We can only serve and comfort our brethren according to our "measure of faith". Every service rendered should be because God has given us faith to render it. A brother takes part in a meeting because he has faith to do so; and, indeed, this principle of faith touches every detail of practical life -- even eating and drinking. It is in that connection that it is written, "whatever is not of faith is sin" (@Romans 14: 23). What cannot be done in faith forms no part of God's dispensation.
The Christian's privilege is to connect everything with God, and to bring God into everything. The knowledge of God has come to us in the glad tidings, and we now bring it to bear on all the detail of life. God would have us to connect the commonest things in life with Himself. What a privilege to know that we may hold everything in relation to God -- even the most trivial things! As we maintain faith, it gives a colour to our lives in every practical detail that nothing else could, and God's dispensation is furthered.
At the end of @1 Timothy 1 we see that maintaining faith involves conflict; it necessitates "the good warfare" (verse 18). Satan will do his utmost to hinder
{113}
the furtherance of God's dispensation. In regard to Timothy there had been prophecies which had definitely marked out his service. His faith would revert to them as encouragement in the conflict. *In principle* there have been prophecies as to us, for the line of God's ordering for us has been marked out beforehand in the holy Scriptures, and we are never to lose sight of it. We could not have faith for anything which was not in accord with the Scriptures. But we serve in personal faith, according to our measure, whether it be to prophesy, to serve, to teach, to exhort, to give, to lead, or to show mercy. (See @Romans 12: 4 - 8). Each of us has faith to do something; then let us see that we do it with diligence. It will mean a warfare, but it is through conflict that the saint becomes an overcomer.
Maintaining faith would include all divine light that has come to us, and a condition of soul that would hold it all in relation to God, so that it does not become mere orthodoxy.
Then a good conscience is of the greatest importance. God's dispensation has not to do with His eternal purpose, but with His ordering of things amongst His saints as found here in responsibility. If I do not maintain a good conscience, the precious truth of God is invalidated so far as I am concerned. Conscience applies the knowledge of good and evil to responsibility. If I recognise a thing to be good, I cannot maintain a good conscience if I do not pursue it. If I recognise it to be evil, I cannot maintain a good conscience if I do not abstain from it. One of
{114}
the most valuable counsels that I know lies in the words, 'Never go before your faith nor lag behind your conscience'. I would press on myself, and on others, not to trifle with conscience. The secret of the unhappiness of many believers is that they are not maintaining a good conscience. One who does not is neither going on with God nor with himself.
The maintenance of a good conscience has an important place in the furtherance of God's dispensation. Never do anything that do you not feel quite happy about. Conscience is one of the most valuable things down here, but it will not be needed in heaven. If we put away a good conscience there is great danger that we may make shipwreck of faith. There is no positive power in conscience, but it is an important check, like the anchor that holds a ship on a lee shore. If the anchor fails, the ship goes on to the rocks. One who puts away a good conscience may become a blasphemer like Hymenaeus and Alexander.
A boy went to buy a chemical balance, and he was told that he must handle it very carefully, as a minute's rough handling might destroy its sensitive accuracy. The conscience is like a sensitive balance; it can be thrown out of adjustment. There is perhaps nothing more needed amongst the people of God generally than sensitiveness of conscience. Of course, conscience can never in itself be the standard; the most accurate balance is not a standard, it needs correct weights; but, if used with correct weights, it can be relied on if not put out of order.
{115}
We are preserved from a morbid or perverted conscience by having our consciences purged and perfected by the value of Christ's offering, and by the knowledge of grace and truth as come by Jesus Christ.
In God's dispensation the great end in view is *love*. He would have holy affections developed in His saints: "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love" (@Galatians 5: 6). What is in faith, and by the Spirit, will work out in the service of love. "The end of what is enjoined is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith" (@1 Timothy 1: 5). *Love* is the product of these three things. Any attempt to get love in activity without these things as its root will not have a divine result.
All the impurity came into man's heart through God not being given His due place. Men failed to glorify God or to be thankful; they "honoured and served the creature more than him who had created it, who is blessed for ever" (@Romans 1: 25). Every kind of vile lust comes into man's heart if he gives up God. Every kind of idolatry is impure, but, in being brought back to God as the Source of all good, man's heart is purified. The gospel is the great purifier because it brings God to us as the beneficent Giver.
Read Peter's sermon in @Acts 10 and see how he presents God. The light which Peter presented was used by God to purify the hearts of the gentile company in the house of Cornelius. "And the heart --
{116}
knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit as to us also, and put no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith" (@Acts 15: 8, 9). The gift of the Spirit is thus God's witness to a purified heart. Peter gave great prominence in his preaching to the movements and actings of God. His hearers received the light of God into their affections, and thus their hearts were purified. From a heart thus purified, holy love can flow out in active service.
In knowing God and having the Spirit there is grace and power to maintain a good conscience. We must be true to the light we have; there must be no trifling with things which are known to be wrong.
A third thing is unfeigned faith. This had been found in Timothy's grandmother and his mother, and it was in Timothy himself (@2 Timothy 1: 5). It is very necessary to have unfeigned faith in the midst of a mass of unreal profession. Hypocrisy is a terrible leaven. Nothing but what is unfeigned will do for God, and it is more than ever essential in face of many pretenders to faith, and all the unreal conditions of the last days.
Where there is a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith the end of all that God has enjoined can be reached. Love can flow freely, and the dispensation, or household ordering, of God reaches its end. His saints are set up in the knowledge of God; they maintain moral conditions that are suitable to God; and the divine nature is found in activity in His household.
{117}
What an atmosphere where the good of all is cherished by each! Each is there to serve -- to help -- as finding liberty and joy in so doing. All God's ordering is to this end. In His dispensation everything is in faith, and faith works by love. A young man who was desiring to identify himself with the people of God was told by a brother, 'I can promise you one thing; you will find love in activity amongst them'. The young man said afterwards, 'I have found his words to be true'. That is the way that God's dispensation works out when saints are set to further it. It brings about in the household of faith the freedom of holy and spiritual affections. May He give us grace to further it!

JOSEPH'S WORD OF HIS GLORY IN EGYPT
F. E. Raven
@Genesis 45: 1 - 15; @John 16: 7 - 15
Taking up this scripture may have the appearance of going back, since last time we had before us the close of Joseph's career. But it struck me that there was a point which it was of some moment to see. I do not look upon Joseph as being at all times typical of Christ. I doubt if here he is typical. I use the history of Joseph only in the way of an analogy, and you do get striking analogies in Scripture. The analogy in Joseph is to what Christ is doing at the present moment, to the position and action of Christ; and that is a very important point.
The first time we were together the point before
{118}
us was the beginning of Joseph's history. He had the testimony of God. We do not see him at the beginning as the man of faith, but as having a testimony from God. That testimony was to his own exaltation; his brethren and his father and mother were all to bow down to him. Now, before anybody is exalted according to God, testimony must be borne to it; we see this principle in the case of the Lord. He bore testimony to His exaltation when He rode into Jerusalem on an ass; He claimed what was His in the way of testimony. The church, too, is here in witness to its own place in association with Christ -- its moral exaltation. It is in that way that I understand the epistle to the Ephesians; the church stands to its place of union with Christ, and that testimony precedes the actual exaltation. You first get moral exaltation, for that is the great thing with God.
Now Joseph reached, in due course, the glory of which he had testified; he may have been the greatest man of his time; he was in a peculiar position, second to none but Pharaoh; he had everything at his disposal; the administration of Egypt was committed to him, and his brethren had to come down and bow themselves to him. They did not at first know him, but eventually he makes himself known to them, and he sends by them to his father the tidings of his glory in Egypt. That is now my point. Then his father was to come to him in Egypt, for that was the object of Joseph sending; and if Jacob had not come down to Joseph in Egypt, he would have come to want (verse 11). Joseph was urgent in the matter; he lays
{119}
stress upon his glory in the land of Egypt, and desires his father Jacob to come down with all his household into Egypt. Now, as I said, I am not taking this up as typical, but only by way of analogy.
Joseph is, no doubt, in a great deal of his history, figurative of Christ; he is spoken of in that way in @Acts 7. We see him there as the deliverer of his brethren, though first rejected of them; he is, like Moses, a figure of the Deliverer of God's people. But I do not see in what is before us that Joseph was quite a figure of Christ, though you get certain points which illustrate the position and activity of Christ at the present moment.
In @John 16 Christ speaks of going to the greatest place -- the place of supreme honour and glory; and He would send down here a testimony to His glory; when He goes His way to Him that sent Him, He sends down the Holy Spirit. The Lord says to them, "It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you" (@John 16: 7). He speaks of the coming of the Comforter, and of what the Comforter will do: "he receives of mine and shall announce it to you" (verse 15) -- He was to bear witness to the disciples of the glory of Christ, so that their hearts might be attracted to Him. They were to reach Him in that sense; if they did not act on the testimony that came to them, the effect would be that they would come to spiritual poverty. So in regard to the present day: if Christians do not act on the testimony that has come down to them, they come to
{120}
spiritual poverty. Probably the bulk of Christians in the present day are suffering from spiritual poverty. They hardly fulfil the functions of priests, to which God has called them.
I see in the epistle to the Romans the idea of a good Christian in the wilderness, and in a sense you cannot go beyond that; but I do not see much about the priest there. You have the love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit (chapter 5: 5), but, after all, the fringe of God's purpose is hardly touched. We have to go to other scriptures to find all that the Holy Spirit has come down to testify of the glory of Christ.
All this is much like Joseph in the land of Egypt, hidden from his brethren, in a position of great honour and glory. And what led Joseph to send word of his glory to his father was that he had strong affection for his father. I think he had affection too for his brethren, badly as they had treated him; but he had been the favourite son of his father, and loved his father. I do not think Joseph sent to his father simply to preserve his life from famine and death, but he had pleasure in the thought of the company of the one he loved; and that is the difference between love and philanthropy. A philanthropist does not necessarily care for the company of those he ministers to; a millionaire may give much to benefit man, but the evidence of love is that it delights in the company of those upon whom it showers favour.
So, though one object with Joseph was that his father and his household might escape famine, yet
{121}
one can see a deeper motive -- the promptings of real affection. And if we love one another, what we desire is the company of one another. Do you think that I could believe that a person really loved me, if he did not desire my company? If I have real affection for Christians I shall desire their company.
Now I leave Joseph and come to @John 16. The Lord was going to the Father, and that was the greatest possible place. The Lord Himself had said, "my Father is greater than I" (@John 14: 28); He came forth from the Father, and He was now going back to the Father (chapter 16: 28).
The ground on which He was going to His Father was that the Father's will had been completely accomplished; everything that stood in the way of divine counsels had been removed. Jesus said, "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work" (@John 4: 34), and now He goes back to the Father. It is brought out prominently in the gospel of John that "All things that the Father has are mine" (chapter 16: 15). This came out first by His own testimony, and then in the testimony of the Holy Spirit: "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (chapter 3: 35). Everything is centred in the Son, so the Lord says, "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (chapter 16: 14).
I will endeavour to make it plain to you that the Holy Spirit was sent down here in testimony to what was Christ's. If you read @John 16 you can see that
{122}
verses 8 to 11 are, in a sense, parenthetical; the direct line of the Lord's communications goes on from verse 7 to verse 12. The Spirit, when He came, would convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; that is to say, incidental to His presence here. In view of the rejection of Christ, everything was brought to an issue; sin and righteousness had come into conflict, and the result was judgment -- the "ruler of this world is judged". The whole world-system is judged in the presence of the Holy Spirit; it is not a question of judging persons, but the system is laid bare and judged. Sin and righteousness never came perfectly to an issue until Christ was here, but now all is judged for God and for the Christian who has the light of the Holy Spirit.
But the point was that the Holy Spirit, when He came, was to bring into view another system -- a system of things that lay in the Father's counsels. There is nothing more important for us to apprehend than that God is sovereign in what He creates; it was so in regard to the first creation. If God sees fit to create millions of suns, He does so according to the sovereignty of His will. And if He sees fit to display His love, He is sovereign in the display of His love. God has His own plans and purposes, but the Object in all -- the One who was to be displayed in them -- was the Son. "All things that the Father has are mine" -- all that system of things that lies in the Father's counsel is centred in the Son; it is the glory of the Son. The glory of the Son is this, that having become man to give effect to divine counsels, He
{123}
becomes the Head and Centre of those counsels. He has power to give "life eternal" (chapter 17: 2) as the Father had given to Him; the Father's counsels all have the *Son* for their *Object* and *Centre*.

BETHANY (VII)
C. H. Mackintosh
@John 12
The opening paragraph of @John 12 brings before us a scene of deepest interest, and full of most precious instruction. We feel we cannot do better than quote at full length the lovely record, for the spiritual benefit of the reader. There is nothing, after all, like the veritable language of holy Scripture.
"Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead. There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him. Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment".
Here we have illustrated, in the most striking and forcible manner, the three grand features which ought to characterise every Christian and every christian assembly, namely,
<ul>
<li>calm, intelligent *communion*, as seen in Lazarus seated at the table;</li>
<li>holy *worship*, as seen in Mary at the feet of her Lord; and</li>
<li>loving *service*, as seen in Martha, in her activities about the house. </li>
</ul>
{124}
All three go to make up the christian character, and all three should be exhibited in every christian assembly. We consider it a very great moral mistake to set any one of these features in opposition to the others, inasmuch as each, in its proper place, is lovely; and, we may add, each should find its place in all. We should all of us know what it is to sit at table with our blessed Lord, in sweet communion. This will most assuredly lead to profound homage and adoration; and we may rest assured that, where there is the communion and the worship, there will not be lacking the loving activities of true service.
The reader will observe that, in the above beautiful scene, there is no record of any collision between Martha and Mary. Each had her place to fill. There was room for both. "Jesus loved Martha and her sister" (@John 11: 5). In verse 1, we read of "Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister". Here, in @John 12, Martha is put first. Looked at from a divine standpoint, there is no need why anyone should in the smallest degree collide with another. And further, we may add, there is no necessity whatever for comparing the sphere of one with that of another. If Christ be our one absorbing Object, there will be lovely harmony in action, though our line of things may vary.
Thus it was at Bethany. Lazarus was at the table, Mary at the Master's feet, and Martha was about the
{125}
house. All was in beautiful order, because Christ was the Object of each. Lazarus would have been entirely out of his place had he set about preparing the supper; and if Martha had sat at the table, there would have been no supper prepared. But both were in their right places, and we may rest assured that both would rejoice in the odour of Mary's ointment as she poured it on the feet of their ever-loving and beloved Lord.
Is not all this conveyed to us in that one sentence, "There therefore *they* made him a supper"? It was not one more than another. All had part in the precious privilege of making a supper for the one peerless Object of their heart's affections; and, having Him in their midst, each fell naturally, simply, and effectively, into his and her proper place. Provided the beloved Master's heart was refreshed, it mattered not who did this, or who did that. Christ was the Centre and each moved round Him.
Thus it should be always in the assembly of Christians, and thus it would be, if odious self were judged and set aside, and each heart simply occupied with Christ Himself. But, alas! here is just where we so sadly fail. We are occupied with ourselves, and our little doings, and sayings, and thinkings. We attach importance to work, not in proportion to its bearing upon the glory of Christ, but its bearing upon our own reputation.
If Christ were our one Object -- as He surely will be throughout eternity, and ought to be now -- we should not care the least who did the work, or who
{126}
rendered the service, provided His name was glorified, and His heart refreshed. Hearken to the utterance of a truly devoted heart in reference to the very subject before us. "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings, that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain. But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all. In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me" (@Philippians 2: 14 - 18).
This is uncommonly fine. The blessed apostle presents in this exquisite passage a true sample of self-forgetting devotedness. He expresses Himself as ready to be poured out as a drink-offering upon the sacrifice and service of his beloved Philippians, utterly regardless of himself. It mattered not to him who contributed the component parts of the sacrifice, provided only that the sacrifice was presented as a sweet odour to Christ.
There was none of that contemptible littleness and self-occupation about that beloved servant of Christ which so often, alas! appear in us, and prevent our appreciation of another's service. We are all alive when any little service of our own happens to be under consideration or discussion. We listen with intense interest to any one speaking or writing about our usefulness, or the result of our preachings or
{127}
writings; but we hear with cold apathy and marked indifference the record of a brother's success. We are by no means ready to be poured out as a drink-offering upon the sacrifice and service of another's faith. We like to provide both meat-offering and drink-offering ourselves. In a word, we are deplorably selfish, and assuredly never is self more thoroughly contemptible than when it dares to mix itself up with the service of God. Bustling self-importance in the work of Christ, or in the church of God, is about the most hideously ugly thing in all this world.
Self-occupation is the death-blow to fellowship and to all true service. Nor this only; it is also the fruitful source of strife and division in the church of God. Hence the deep need of those faithful and most wholesome words of the blessed apostle, "If then there be any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and compassions, fulfil my joy, that ye think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing; let nothing be in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves; regarding not each his own qualities, but each those of others also. For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men; and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even
{128}
unto death, and that the death of the cross. Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to God the Father's glory" (@Philippians 2: 1 - 11).

THE TILLAGE OF THE POOR
J. G. Bellett
@Proverbs 13: 23
It has been said -- and it is much for the observation of our souls -- that we should take care how we traffic with unfelt truth. A little knowledge, with personal exercise of spirit over it, is better than much knowledge without it, as the proverb says, "Much food is in the tillage of the poor".
The poor make the most of their little. They use the spade, the hoe, and the mattock: they weed, they dress and turn up their little garden, and their diligence gets much food out of it.
And we are to be these "poor" ones, ever to use divine Scripture as they carry on their tillage, and make the most of little. If we use diligence to lay aside malice, and hypocrisies, and envies and the like, we shall be really feeding and growing (@1 Peter 2: 1 - 3).

AVAILABILITY
G. V. Stanley
@1 Samuel 3; @Genesis 37: 2 - 16; @Acts 9: 1 - 16.
I wanted to speak of the thought of availability in the way of response to the Lord's voice. This feature is seen in these three cases -- the boy Samuel; the young man of seventeen, Joseph; and in the still more matured man, Saul of Tarsus.
One would like to speak of Samuel first, to gain the ear of every child. I can assure the children here, that in those that surround them, there is genuine love, frequent prayers and spiritual longings for them -- you could be in no better place. The Ark [the Lord Jesus as carried by believers here in testimony] is still being carried by those who love God, by those who are lowly and content to be out of sight. There is room for the children alongside of the Ark; and there is no need to put on any appearances. Thank God for simplicity! We do not expect children to be unnatural; they love their play, for play belongs to children. There is a city to come where old men and women will be leaning on their staff for very age, and children will be playing in the streets (@Zechariah 8: 4, 5).
The Ark is a centre for the preservation of those that love God. We can all look with joy on the generation to follow, and consider for the children. The time comes when they put away childish things and their play, and come up to the house of the Lord to sing His praises. As we look on them, we see potentialities, and we learn to love them, and to give them
{130}
knowledge, to pray to God for them, and wait upon God to operate in their hearts, so that when the Lord comes and calls their names, He may have His way with them.
It is beautiful to hear your name called by some one who loves you truly! "Samuel! Samuel!" God wanted him! He adapted His voice to that boy. It took on the tone of Eli's voice. God speaks much as the brethren speak; He adapts Himself to that kind of speaking. He did not deceive the boy with a feigned voice. Samuel goes immediately to Eli, the aged priest, who discerns it is *God* speaking! Jehovah came and stood -- as if He would give all His attention to one child for the moment; He wanted to take up that youthful heart to answer to His. *Jehovah* called! He is often calling.
Do not get weary with God speaking to you; God wants to speak to you. Perhaps you think the Scriptures are hard to understand; Peter thought Paul's ministry was hard to understand (@2 Peter 3: 15, 16); but if you get one impression of the Lord's voice at every meeting you will soon be enriched. Be in the attitude Samuel was, when he said, "Speak, for thy servant heareth"; he was *obedient*. He used no vain repetition, but he did as he was told.
I wonder if you are obedient. Obeying father and mother means that you do as you are told. Your father should secure obedience from you. He should hold you to obedience. God wants you to give in before your will gets too strong. Your parents love you; you may want to go here and go there, and read
{131}
this book and that; your parents try to prevent you, because they see that these paths lead you away from the Lord. Now listen to what *He* says: "Children, obey your parents in the *Lord*: for this is just" (@Ephesians 6: 1).
Samuel was obedient, God spoke to him and told him a great secret as to what He was going to do -- something you would not expect to be revealed to a child! God must decide to whom He reveals His secrets. We like to be trusted with secrets, and God loves to tell us His secrets when we are together. This boy Samuel was where God loved to speak, and God told him what was coming to pass. In the morning he opened the doors of the house of God; but when Eli wanted to know what God had said, Samuel was afraid to tell him, but eventually he obeyed.
It is good to see a young brother obedient to an elder, because it is pleasing to the Lord. Those who want to do the Lord's will are subject to the brethren. Peter says, "all of you bind on humility towards one another" (@1 Peter 5: 5), this is the way to blessing. "Here am I" is a good answer; there is no *will* at work. Though so young, his word was with power, and he grew in the knowledge of the word of Jehovah, though the priest was old and failing. Do you read your Bible every day? Have the Scriptures first place with you?
Do you only read the Bible on your free days? It says, "Jehovah appeared again ... for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah". Heaven is interested in Scripture
{132}
searching. An Ethiopian was once reading the prophet Isaiah, and God sent a gospel messenger to him, who asked him, "Dost thou then know what thou art reading of?" He answered, "How should I then be able unless some one guide me?" (@Acts 8: 30, 31). Philip told him it was all about *Jesus*! If you read your Bible, I can tell you that it is pleasing to heaven. It says of the Bereans, that they were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they daily searched "the scriptures if these things were so" (@Acts 17: 11). Jehovah continued to make Himself known to Samuel, who became a youthful vessel available to God in a very difficult day. A revelation was rare in those days. God secured one youthful heart, and later on, Samuel was told to anoint David. Then Solomon, David's great son, was enthroned, and the glory came in.
Now I pass on to Joseph, who is seventeen, we are told. He fed his father's flock. Of all the sons of Jacob, God would bring *one* into great prominence; there were eleven others, as we know. The previous chapter forms a dark background to the picture, enumerating the sons of Esau, whose name was changed to Edom. The chapter is full of names of men who were *not* pleasing to God. They spread themselves over the land, and became proprietors of estates, titled people, who in their self-importance claimed what belonged to God. At that time Joseph was seventeen, and he was sent to feed his father's flock. He was not selfish.
Every one of us needs a word as to selfishness.
{133}
Even the most spiritual of us are in danger of being selfish with all the light, blessing, privilege, and comfort that we have. A shepherd is very unselfish; he sees to the welfare of the flock, and does not study his own reputation or his own feelings. David is a good example. He was a man also of great affections and had an eye for the mother-sheep; he was looking after the prosperity of the flock, especially those needing care. God says as it were, That is the man that will do for Me; make him king! He would lead, feed, and look after My flock -- My people. David was the shepherd-king, type of that "great shepherd of the sheep" (@Hebrews 13: 20) who has been brought again from the dead. He will feed you, and look after you.
Though Joseph was only seventeen, he was not too young to have an eye what would yield pleasure to God in a locality. There is one chief Shepherd, there are under-shepherds, who work together to one end. We are to care for those who are to hand in our midst. If we are faithful there, God will give us a wider field. Joseph looked after the sheep, and his father loved him more than all his children because he was the son of his old age. He is thus a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, coming in as a result of God's longings -- "when the fulness of the time was come" (@Galatians 4: 4). God had others who pleased Him, but they fade into insignificance now that His own Son has come. Jacob made Joseph a coat of many colours, having come in his experience to what we find in Hebrews -- "He takes away the first that he may
{134}
establish the second" (chapter 10: 9) -- another kind of Man, who always pleased God. Christ would die to bring into being a generation like Himself.
Then we have Joseph's destiny foretold in his dreams, on account of which he is hated; yet in love he brought his brethren into things -- he would not leave them out. In the New Testament we read how God sent to the Jews a trusted Messenger -- the Lord Jesus Christ -- who was willing to go. He came to carry God's love to His own people, and He would go all the way until he found them. Does it not touch your heart? Israel had put distance between themselves and their God, so in the type before us, Joseph is obedient to his father's will. However far it is, he goes to seek his brethren. In type he goes into the pit of death; "I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing" (@Psalm 69: 2). Further still, in prison in Egypt, where the iron entered into his soul! But typically in resurrection, he could say to his brethren, "Come near to me, I pray you" (@Genesis 45: 4). Peter denied the Lord, but to him, when he is restored, is committed the care of the sheep and lambs. He would cherish and nourish those for whom the Lord died.
Now, are we going to take this up according to the grace God gives, so as to be available to God now? God is looking for those are available -- not people in a religious public position, whose utterances must be controlled by men in order to please them. God wants available vessels to whom He can give treasure -- something to minister to others. May we have the instructed ear! "morning by morning, he
{135}
wakeneth mine ear" (@Isaiah 50: 4). One word from God in the morning often lasts a whole day; and to any needy one you may meet, you are able to give succour and comfort. Joseph was available to declare his father's thoughts of love, but he had to go into prison. Paul went to prison. He does not say that cruel men put him there, he says, "I, the prisoner in the *Lord*". In that great chapter in his Ephesian letter, written from the prison, comes to us that ministry which is our treasury -- "the mystery" -- committed to Paul to unfold to the assembly.
In @Acts 9 it says of Saul that he was still breathing out threatenings against the disciples of the Lord, and was going to Damascus to drag them to prison, so intent was he on stamping out the name which he so hated. The Lord lets him go so far, and then speaks from heaven: "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecutest me?" Saul answers, "Who art thou, Lord?". I do not think he had ever called Him Lord before! He had never before bowed to His authority, for he says later, that he was "an insolent overbearing man" (@1 Timothy 1: 13) -- he would brook no other will but his own. He says also elsewhere that he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees -- a great example of an excellent man in the flesh, but such a man is brought low by a word from the Lord -- "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?"
Behind that utterance lies the great truth of the oneness of Christ and the assembly. The first utterance from heaven after the Lord's ascension contains the whole secret of Paul's ministry: "*I* am Jesus
{136}
whom *thou* persecutest!" He is *obedient* immediately, and becomes available. Is there any one here who has not morally collapsed? It says of the Lord, in Luke, that He is "set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel" (chapter 2: 34). If you are to become available to the Lord, you will have to come down to a complete collapse. People who know the Lord as Saviour, but retain features of the pride of the flesh, self-will, and fleshly status, are not available to the Lord for His service.
We need to be kept in the sense of the mercy of God. It is a good conversion if we learn it at the outset, so that the Lord can soon put us in the path of service. He said in answer to Saul's question, "enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do" (verse 6). Where would he get his directions? God had prepared the brethren in Damascus to receive him. Instead of claiming to have the Lord's mind, it is better to feel our constant dependence upon Him to get it, and how often it comes by way of the brethren. Even in @Acts 16, it says, after Paul's vision, that they concluded the Lord would have them go to Macedonia (verse 10). He takes the brethren into his confidence.
The mind of the Lord is largely known as we learn to be subject amongst the saints. "It shall be told thee what thou must do". Brothers and sisters whom he had despised and persecuted, who were nobodies in his eyes before -- from these he was to learn; how he would learn, too, that the Lord loved them! It was as though the Lord had said, Those
{137}
people are *Me*, and you must learn My mind through them. Paul became like a little child introduced into the kingdom: "leading him by the hand" (chapter 9: 8). The hand is another idea of availability. He is ready to be adjusted. Ananias thought the Lord did not know that man; he had done so much harm to the Lord's people, and had come to Damascus for that purpose. "*I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (verse 16). Showing is the best line to take. It is the way of surpassing excellence, and produces availability. Love never fails, though you and I often do. Love always secures its end, and that is how things prosper.
May we be so available, leaving the decision, as to what we shall do, with the Lord, who said of Paul, "*I* will shew him". In Philippians Paul says that he hardly knows whether to desire to depart or to remain, but he was willing to stay for their sakes, He was available to serve them as required (@Philippians 1: 23, 24).
The Lord can do with every suitable vessel in this day when the Holy Spirit is slighted, and no room is made for Him in the religious world. May God have His way with each of us, for the building up of the assembly so precious to Him!

DIVINE INFLUENCE
J. Taylor
@Genesis 2: 8 - 10; @Ezekiel 47: 1 - 5; @Revelation 22: 1, 2
My desire is to show the various phases of the source whence divine influence flows, and I take up the figure of a river as representing this influence in Scripture. A river represents a source of influence. In some instances it is found to be a bad influence. As a matter of fact, whatever you find of God in the Scriptures is sure to have, in some sense, a counterpart on man's side; that is, God would influence man, but Satan would also influence man. Satan would have his river; but one is encouraged in taking up the figure, because Satan did not introduce the first river.
In the first scripture I read, the source of the river is Eden, the sphere of delights, or pleasure. In the second scripture, the source of the river is the house of God. In the third scripture the source of the river is the throne of God. I want to speak of these different phases of the influence that God proposed to exert over man.
We are all under some influence; it is quite impossible that any of us should stand alone. It is quite impossible that any one could stand in this world without coming under some influence. And the question is, What influence are we under? That is a serious question, especially for young people. And I do not mean simply the promptings of your own heart; they are never right, but I do not refer to them now. I refer to what is outside you. You are under some influence, and that influence may have gained
{139}
on you according to your natural proclivities. It may be the influence of the world of pleasure, and this counteracts the sphere of delights; or it may be an influence from the religion of the world, that would counteract the house of God; or it may be an influence from the political world, the side connected with rule and government, and that is opposed to the throne of God. I am not calling in question the rulers of the different nations; they are not to be set aside; we are told to respect them; I look on them as a divine provision for the moment, and the worst kind of government is better than none. But what I refer to is the moral influence that issues from the political world. Think of the dark counsels that lie behind the governments of this world, the sinister motives of those govern men.
What you find in the river that flows from God's throne is that it is "bright as crystal". Can you see through what is going on in the different governments of the world? Are they transparent? No, there are dark counsels behind them, and they permeate down to the lowest strata of the political world. Their influence is not like that of the water of life. It is not life-giving, but death-giving.
Then look at the world of pleasure. Go down the main streets of the towns and cities or anywhere where there are houses of amusement. What an influence over the young, and over the old, too. There is a deadly stream issuing from that source. Is it life-giving, bright as crystal? No, it is dark and death-giving.
Take the religious world, which assumes to be
{140}
the house of God. Organised earthly religion is opposed to God. God has abandoned it. "Ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father ... But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth" (@John 4: 21, 23). Organised religion is, in that sense, abandoned by God. And to go back to what God has given up is apostasy. I am not using strong words, but mild ones. Scripture uses stronger ones. To go back to what God has abandoned is apostasy, and from that apostate system issues a deathly influence. I have classified the influences under three heads: firstly, the world of pleasure; secondly, the world of religion; and thirdly, the world of politics. You are under some of these influences if you have not bowed to the Lord Jesus.
I take the last one, mentioned in @Revelation 22, that is, the throne. God has set Christ in heaven. "God has made him, this same Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ", says Peter (@Acts 2:36). If God has done that, He requires you to respect what He has done. He has placed Christ on the throne, and He looks to man for submission. And how wonderful the result of Peter's address! Three thousand were convicted of sin, saying, "What shall we do, brethren?" (verse 37). 'You crucified Him', says Peter, and 'God has made Him Lord and Christ'. They were pricked in their hearts. It is a wonderful thing to be pricked in your heart. "It is hard for thee to kick against goads" (@Acts 26: 14), the Lord says to Saul. It is a terrible thing to resist God. I have
{141}
seen it, and it ever ends in disaster. You cannot do it with impunity.
Instead of reproving Saul of Tarsus with bitter taunts, as He might have done, the Lord said, "it is hard for thee". What grace in this! And is it not hard for you? You have to resist your praying mother and father, and, perhaps, your friends; and your conscience has no rest at all. You may assume a very composed exterior, but your conscience has no rest. "It is hard for thee". Those words were fraught with grace. The Jews were pricked in their hearts. They did not say so, but there is better evidence; the Spirit says so. They asked what they should do. They were told what to do. They were told to repent, and that not in bands, but "each one of you"; and what were they to receive? The gift of the Holy Spirit. By bowing to the throne you get the Spirit.
What an influence the gift of the Holy Spirit brings! See the effect it had on them. Was there ever such a power for good in the world as was evidenced on the day of Pentecost? There was a mighty power for good introduced, and it was there for those who bowed to the throne. I love the description the Spirit gives, "bright as crystal". It is divinely described.
In @Genesis 2 the influence proceeds from a source of pleasure. The river did not have its rise in the garden, but in Eden; and it was intended to influence the garden. Flowing into the garden as a river, it becomes universal in its influence. It becomes four. When the Spirit of God came into the world to the Lord's people they became evangelical. They
{142}
said virtually, 'All must come under the influence of this'. This river was parted and became four. Four in Scripture usually refers to what is universal. It refers to the geography of the spiritual world. There is such a thing as divine geography. The four streams or 'heads' flowing out of Eden allude to it. The source of the river is a sphere of delights.
The Spirit of God has come out from the Father and the Son. It has come from that source; It flowed in here, and coming in here It became parted, so to speak. You all remember the character in which the Holy Spirit came, as "parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them" (@Acts 2: 3). And thus the testimony was, "we hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God" (verse 11). What an influence that was, carried north, south, east and west! It was a wonderful and blessed influence, coming out from the Father and the Son. Has it not flowed in a westerly direction? It has flowed in all directions.
The saints of early days became evangelistic; the river flowed in four distinct streams. The question, as I said before is, whether your heart has come under the influence. It is the source of real pleasure; there is no other. There is a verse in the Psalms which says, "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God" (@Psalm 46: 4). The mind is directed from the singular to the plural, the "streams". The influence became diversified, and what is the effect? The streams make glad the city of God. Think of the infinite joy that exists between the Father and the Son. The Spirit of God has come out
{143}
from that holy sphere. Is it not a gladdening power? A joyous influence? The happy faces of many Christians are a testimony to that, but, alas, there are many whose hearts are not glad; they are true believers, but they are not glad. "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God". I would transfer the figure to those who believe. Why are you not glad? There is that mighty source issuing from that sphere of delights to make your heart glad. Are you seeking gladness in man's world of pleasure? "Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again" (@John 4: 13). The gift of the Holy Spirit, viewed in the light of what I read from Genesis, is a gladdening influence. You ought to get into touch with the streams that make glad the city of God. I would emphasise the universal influence of it.
In Ezekiel it is not the universal influence. What you get there is the infiniteness of it. You cannot compass it. It was measured to four thousand cubits, and then it was a river, impassable, a river to swim in. That is what you want. It is a wonderful thing to get your thirst quenched and your heart made glad, but look, a river to swim in! That is a wonderful thing, and that is what I call *deliverance*. You are free of the world and the flesh there. From whence does the river come? From beneath the house, beside the altar of God. Jesus suffered for that. The altar was the place of suffering; the offerings were sacrificed there. Think of the Lord Jesus Christ delivering Himself up in love for us!
He "by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless
{144}
to God" (@Hebrews 9: 14); and so this wonderful influence, the Spirit of grace, has flowed out. It is impassable, but you can swim in it. Many, alas! are only up to the ankles, maybe up to the knees, or the loins, but you want waters to swim in, "a river that could not be passed through". Whilst the river is the Holy Spirit, unquestionably, it is the Spirit of grace. It is the Spirit adapted to human needs, and meeting man down here, and having the water of life. It flows from beside the altar, and everything touched by it lives. You see in the verses below that fishers were there. That type of death (the Dead Sea) is rendered living. From the north to the south there are fishers. There were no fish there, but the river changes the whole scene, and so "their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many" (verse 10).
In the last scripture I read, you have the waters described. It is not the extent, nor the breadth; it is not the universal character of the river, for there are no streams. What we are engaged with is the kind of water. It is "bright as crystal". It is wonderful to look into that. You come in among the Lord's people, and you find there transparency. Go into the world, and you find double-dealing everywhere. The world is marked by deception, but among the Lord's people normally there is respect for the authority of Christ, and for His commandments. You find there love for one another; the saints are free with one another. Practically, you can see how important it is to be transparent, if we are to be here in testimony for the
{145}
good of others. The river is bright as crystal. "Wherefore, having put off falsehood, speak truth every one with his neighbour" (@Ephesians 4: 25). If you have stolen, steal no more, but labour and give to others. What transparency! How good and how beneficial! The river of the water of life is bright as crystal. There is a street in the city, and you can walk there. Can you walk in the world? There is not a single road morally. But you can walk in the city of God alongside the river. It is accessible on either side. Do you think that any sect in the world is placed there? Every sect is one-sided, but there is no one-sidedness, no partiality, in connection with the river of God. And what is there? There is the tree of life, and no longer guarded by the cherubim; but on either side of the river; and even the leaves, what you see in the most casual way, they have healing in them for the nations. Such is the source of influence that issues from God's throne.
Then you get the great issue of God's dealings from the outset, when all that sin has brought in is removed. Then we shall see Christ's face. You cannot fail to see that there is at the present time an influence for good, and the question for your soul to answer is, are you under it? If not, you are under one of the other three influences, the world of pleasure, or of religion, or of politics.
May the Lord draw you from each by bringing you under the influence of the Spirit!

JOSEPH'S WORD OF HIS GLORY IN EGYPT
F. E. Raven
@Genesis 45: 1 - 15; @John 16: 7 - 15
In @Ephesians 3 the apostle prays to "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named". I cannot tell you what those families are, but they are named of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every family is named according to the place in which the Father is pleased to set it.
In @Psalm 45 you can see earthly families; or you can turn to the book of the Revelation, and try to make out the different families mentioned there. All those families centre in Christ, who is the Head of every family. I would like to see more clearly the relation in which Christ stands to every family. I can in measure see in what relation He stands to the patriarchs and to Israel, and in some sort the way in which He stands to the church; but there are evidently other families referred to in Scripture. It would be a great study to find the light in which Christ stands to every family in heaven and on earth, all of which have their names from the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
As we apprehend the greatness of the Father's purposes, we get enlargement of heart; you cannot know anything of the testimony of the Holy Spirit without getting enlargement of heart. But one finds that the hearts of people are so engaged with the things of this world, and they will not get enlargement of heart from these. What brings enlargement is the
{147}
testimony of the Holy Spirit to the glory of Christ.
Now the effect of this was to lead the hearts of the disciples to the place where Christ was; it could not have any other effect. The Holy Spirit did not come to leave people down here, but to conduct their souls to Christ where He is. Like the servant of Abraham, who was sent to conduct Rebecca to Isaac (@Genesis 22), so the Holy Spirit conducts us to Christ where He is. The testimony to the glory of Christ could not have any other effect. What led to the Lord's sending this testimony was affection towards the disciples. It is a difficult thing to take in the thought that the Lord loves us; we may challenge ourselves as to how much we love Christ, but your love to Christ will not be greater than your appreciation of the love of Christ to you. "*We* love because *he* has first loved us" (@1 John 4: 19). Now if Christ loves the church, He has pleasure in the company of the church; and this must be so, because company is what I would call the exigency of love. Love will have company; so Christ will present the church "to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things" (@Ephesians 5: 27).
So if Christ sent down the Holy Spirit to make known His glory to the disciples, the object of the Holy Spirit was to lead them to where Christ is with the Father. If you read the latter part of @John 16 you will see how the Lord brings out the liberty that they would have with the Father. He says, "the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me" (verse 27). The Holy Spirit has come
{148}
down to conduct us to where Christ is; but if you do not give the Holy Spirit His place, you will undoubtedly suffer from spiritual famine. You can see people all round suffering from spiritual poverty because they do not apprehend the glory of Christ, and therefore do not see their place in connection with that glory.
The church is a most important item in the glory of Christ; there is no company in heaven or on earth so intimately bound up with the glory of Christ; and as you understand your proper place in connection with the glory of Christ, you will get more and more insight into that glory. The church is that which is given of the Father to Christ in the day of His rejection by Israel; and the Holy Spirit has come down to show His glory, and thus to conduct the church to where Christ is in glory. And if you do not give the Holy Spirit His proper place, you will surely suffer spiritual loss.
Now the prayer in @Ephesians 3 brings out the state in the christian which enables him to enter into @John 16. You see all the divine Persons in activity here, or two of them, at all events -- that is, the Father and the Spirit; and this, I think, makes it run pretty much with @John 16. The apostle bows his knees to the "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; the movement springs from the Father, it is effectuated by the Holy Spirit. Saints are to be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man", and the object is that "the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts". So the source is the Father, the energy
{149}
is the Spirit, and the end that the Christ dwells in your hearts by faith.
In order that this state may be produced, two things are necessary -- one is love, and the other the knowledge of love. These are the two things that the Spirit produces; you are rooted and founded in love, that is the effect of the Holy Spirit indwelling. The love of God is shed abroad in the heart; the Holy Spirit is here in testimony to the love of God, and the object of that testimony is that we may be formed in love. It is a good way on when we are rooted and founded in love. The love presented to you has had effect.
Then you begin to apprehend with all saints what is the length and breadth, and depth and height. I connect that with @John 16, with all that is connected with the glory of Christ. We come to comprehend the whole range of divine counsel, and to see how God has effected it all; we see not only what God effects, but His wisdom is displayed in the way in which He has effected it. All is by *Christ*; of course, it is in the immediate power of the Holy Spirit, but Christ is the wisdom of God, and all God's ways are carried through in Christ. It is of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ that every family in heaven and earth is named, and they get their character from Christ. Christ is the second Man as well as the last Adam, and every family must take its character from Him.
The company in the Revelation that stands before the throne blameless (@Revelation 14: 5), where do they get that from? Why, from Christ. And those
{150}
who love God with all their heart, and their neighbour as themselves, they get that from Christ. And the church "rooted and founded in love" has that from Christ; everything is from Christ -- takes its character from Him. The Holy Spirit has come down here in testimony of the love of God, but where do we see the love of God displayed? In the death of Christ -- "God commends *his* love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (@Romans 5: 8). Now, being rooted and founded in love, you are able to comprehend the whole range of wisdom and glory.
And then you come to another thing, you "know the love of the Christ, which surpasses knowledge", you get exceeding power in being "rooted and founded in love" -- that is the work of the Holy Spirit. I feel we are not simple enough, or contented to leave ourselves in the hand of the Spirit; but it is when we are rooted and founded in love that we apprehend with all saints -- it is then that we get intelligence and wisdom. A man of the world cannot touch divine things, for he has not got the capacity. Rooted and founded in love is the capacity; acquaintance with Scripture in the letter of it will not enable one to enter into God's wisdom. For that you must have a man of another order, the man rooted and founded in love by the work of the Holy Spirit. Then you can apprehend what is the breadth and length, and depth and height, and know the love of Christ, that passes knowledge. The Holy Spirit exercises a wonderful power down here, shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts, that He may
{151}
form us according to that love; and then making known to us the glory of Christ, so that we might know what is the breadth and length, and depth and height, and then that we may know the love of the Christ, that passeth knowledge, "that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God".
It is that which I wanted to bring before you. I took up Joseph on account of the analogy he presented. But the Holy Spirit is come in testimony to Christ, sent from the Father -- from the very Source from which Christ Himself came, everything having been accomplished for God. Now, if you have only the state for it, you may know the love of Christ, that passeth knowledge, the practical effect of which is that in the church there is that which is adequate for the full expression of God.
God has introduced a man of a new order, a man of completely new powers, rooted and founded in love. Man of every order after the flesh, whether philosophic or scientific, or of great powers of assimilation, cannot comprehend God's wisdom. What could Christ have thought of the cobwebs that men spin down here? What would philosophy have seemed to Christ? He had all the light of God, saw through all the theories and systems of men. "He who takes the wise in their craftiness" (@1 Corinthians 3: 19). And if we are rooted and founded in love, we can apprehend the breadth and length, and depth and height, and know the love of Christ.
May God give to us to know these two great principles -- the love of God and the glory of Christ,
{152}
that which is the fruit and expression of the Father's counsel. I have thought much of the importance of our hearts being kept continually in the light of God's testimony, and that is by the Holy Spirit; it cannot but have the greatest effect upon us, for we are formed in that way in the divine nature.

BETHANY (VII)
C. H. Mackintosh
@John 12
Here lies the grand remedy for the terrible malady of self-occupation in all its phases. It is having Christ before our hearts, and His lowly mind formed in us by the Holy Spirit. It is utterly impossible to drink into the spirit of Jesus, to breathe the atmosphere of His presence, and be occupied with self in any shape or form. The two things are in direct opposition. In proportion as Christ fills the heart, self and its belongings must be excluded; and, if Christ occupies the heart, we shall rejoice to see His name magnified, His cause prospering, His people blessed, His gospel spread abroad, no matter who may be used as His instrument. We may rest assured that wherever there is envy, or jealousy, or strife, there self is uppermost in the heart. The blessed apostle could rejoice if Christ was preached, even though it was out of contention (@Philippians 1: 17, 18).
But to return to the family of Bethany. We wish the reader to notice particularly the three distinct phases of christian life exemplified in Lazarus,
{153}
Mary, and Martha, namely, communion, worship, and service. Should we not, each one of us, seek to realise and exemplify all the three? Is it not interesting and important to observe that in @John 12 there is no question raised between Martha and Mary? Is not this accounted for by the fact that in this beautiful passage we have the divine and heavenly side of the subject?
In @Luke 10 we have the human side. Here, alas! there is collision. Let us read the passage. "And it came to pass as they went that *he* entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, Martha by name, received him into her house" -- it was Martha's house, and of course she had to manage it -- "and she had a sister called Mary, who also, having sat down at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his word" -- blessed, privileged place! "Now Martha was distracted with much serving, and coming up she said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Speak to her therefore that she may help me. But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; but there is need of one, and Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her" (verses 38 - 42).
Here we find that Martha's self-occupation marred her service, and drew forth words of reproof from the lips of her loving, yet faithful, Lord -- words, we may safely say, which would never have fallen upon her ear had she not interfered with her sister Mary. Her service had its place and its value,
{154}
and her Lord knew well how to appreciate it; but, blessed be His name, He will not allow anyone to interfere with another. Each had her own place, her own line of things. Jesus loved Martha and her sister, but if Martha will complain of her sister, she must learn that there is something more to be thought of than preparing a supper. Had Martha gone quietly on with her work, having Christ as her Object in all that she was doing, she would not have had a rebuff; but she was evidently in a wrong spirit. She was not in communion with the mind of Christ; had she been so, she never could have used such words to her Lord, as "dost thou not care?" Surely He does care about us, and He is interested in all our works and ways. The smallest service done to Him is precious to His loving heart, and will never be forgotten.
But we must not interfere with another's service, or intrude in any way upon his domain. Our blessed Lord will not suffer it. Whatever He gives us to do, let it be done simply to Him. This is the grand point. There is not the slightest necessity for jostling one another. There is ample space for all, and the very highest sphere is open to all. We may all enjoy intimate communion; we may all worship; we may all serve; we may all be acceptable. But the moment we set about making invidious comparisons, we are clearly out of the current of the Master's mind. Martha, no doubt, thought her sister rather deficient in action. She was mistaken. The best preparation for action is sitting at the Master's feet to hear His word.
{155}
Had Martha understood this, she would not have complained of her sister; but, inasmuch as she herself raised the question, and gave occasion for any comparison, she had to learn that a hearing ear, and a worshipping heart, are more precious by far than busy hands. Alas! our hands may be very busy, while the ear is heavy, and the heart far away! but if the heart be right, then the ear, the hands, the feet, yea, all will be right, "My son, give me thy heart" (@Proverbs 23: 26).
We do not mean to imply that Martha's heart was not right in the main. Far from it. We feel assured it was. But there was an element which needed correction, as there is in all of us. She was a little occupied with her service. "Dost thou not care that my sister has left *me* to serve alone? Speak to her therefore that she may help *me*". This was all wrong. She ought to have known that service was not confined to cooking -- that there was something higher than meat and drink. Ten thousand might be got to prepare a supper for one that would break an alabaster box. Not that our Lord undervalued the supper; but what would that supper have been to Him without the ointment, the tears, the hair? What is any act of service without the deep and true devotion of the heart? Nothing. But, on the other hand, where the heart is really engaged with Christ, the smallest act is precious to Him, "For if the readiness be there, a man is accepted according to what he may have" (@2 Corinthians 8:12).
Here lies the root of the whole matter. It is an
{156}
easy thing to bustle about in so-called service, to run from house-to-house, and place-to-place, visiting and talking, and after all there may not be a single spark of genuine affection for Christ; but the mere worthless activity of a self-occupied mind, an unbroken will, the workings of a heart that has never known the constraining power of the love of Christ. The grand point is to find our place at the feet of our gracious Lord, in worship and adoration, and then we shall be ready for any sphere of action which He may see fit to open for us. If we make service our object, our service will become a snare and a hindrance. If Christ be our Object, we shall be sure to do the right thing, without thinking about ourselves or our work.
Thus it was with Mary. She was occupied with her Lord, and not with herself or her alabaster box. She sought not to interfere with anyone else. She complained not of Lazarus at the table, nor of Martha with her household cares. She was absorbed with Christ and His position at the moment. The true instincts of love led her to see what was fitting for the occasion, and grateful to His heart, and she did that -- did it with all her heart.
Yes, and her Lord appreciated her act. And not only so, but when Martha complained of her, He very soon taught her her mistake; and when Judas, with ill-concealed covetousness, talked of her act as being a waste, he too got his answer. Heartless man! hiding his covetousness under the cloak of caring for the poor. No one can have a true heart for the poor
{157}
who does not love Christ. Judas -- professor, and apostle, and all, as he was -- loved money: alas! no uncommon love. He had no heart for Christ, although he may have preached and cast out devils in His blessed name. He could talk of selling the ointment for three hundred pence, and giving it to the poor; but, oh! the Holy Spirit, who measures everything by the one standard of the glory of Christ, lets us see the roots of things, and He it is who tells the full truth as to Judas. "But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and carried what was put into it".
How truly awful! To be outwardly so near the Lord; to profess His name; to be an apostle; to talk about giving to the poor; and all the while to be a thief, and the betrayer of the Son of God!
Dear christian reader, let us ponder these things. Let us seek to live very near to Christ, not in mere profession, but in reality. May we find our place ever in the moral shelter of His holy presence, there to find our delight in Him, and thus be fitted to serve Him, and witness for His name!

REST
W. J. House
In the gospel of Mark we learn the incessant character of the work of the Lord Jesus. He is God's Servant, and much is made of His *hands*. Every lover of Christ would say of His hands that they are as "gold rings, set with the chrysolite" (@Song of Songs 5: 14). His blessed hands are marked by infinite glory and beauty.
Yet, in @Mark 4: 38, we have the instance of Jesus asleep in circumstances of the utmost restlessness around -- the wind raging on the sea and the ship full of water, the very opposite idea to that of rest. But Jesus was asleep on a pillow in complete restfulness and comfort at that moment.
What an example for us now! A storm is now raging [1942] over the earth: one of the most awful storms that has ever raged. The Lord would help us, as coming under His instructions and example, to learn what it is to be restful. His was the sleep of perfect confidence: it spoke of His <p><b>RESTING IN GOD.</b>
"To his beloved one he giveth sleep" (@Psalm 127: 2).
Whatever may be the appearances, the winds and the waters are under the control of God. With this known by our Lord perfectly, He lay down to sleep, and slept in comfort. How quickly we are agitated, but the Lord would serve us and support us in our confidence in God. Rest comes from implicit confidence in the supremacy of God -- "the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God" (@1 Timothy 1: 17).
{159}
His was not the sleep of insensibility, not the sleep of indifference, but the sleep of rest springing from perfect confidence in God.
The converse is found in @Psalm 22. There another storm is raging -- the storm of God's holy judgment against sin, Christ being the Victim. In that dreadful storm the Lord says, "there is no rest for me" (verse 2). There is nothing that should touch our hearts more than this! He had in view the securing of God's rest; even in this same psalm He speaks of God as having a dwelling place "amid the praises of Israel" (verse 3) --
<b>GOD'S REST </b><p>amidst the praises of those who are affected by the sufferings and sacrifice of Christ. It is beautiful to see here that, following the atoning sufferings of Christ, He gets an ever-widening place in the souls of men, beginning with the assembly. He becomes the Centre of a vast, redeemed universe in which God gets His rest, and Christ gets His.
@Psalm 132 speaks of God entering His rest: "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength" (verse 8). David anticipates the building of God's house, in which God would have His rest and in which the ark would rest. The ark is one of the greatest figures of Christ in Scripture. How blessed to think of a moment, soon to come, when Christ, the eternal Depository of every divine thought, will have a suitable resting-place for ever -- "This is my rest for ever" (verse 14). God will dwell ultimately in the whole universe. In that world of glory there will be
{160}
<b>A RESTING PLACE FOR CHRIST, </b><p>even as now in the assembly, and ultimately He is to have a suitable resting-place in the holy affections of a redeemed universe.
In the third chapter of the book of Ruth, the word from Naomi to Ruth is, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?" (verse 1). It is not well with us until we are at rest. How unsafe is a person whose affections are not satisfied! The Lord would so disclose Himself to our hearts that they may be satisfied. He would have us find <p><b>REST FOR OUR AFFECTIONS</b>.
Naomi wished Ruth to have an object to engage her affections. There was a mighty man of wealth named Boaz, one who had the right of redemption. She instructed Ruth to put herself at his feet, and he would tell her what to do.
The Lord will never disappoint the heart that wants Him for an object. The heart of the believer is to confide in Christ, and be to Another -- even to Him "who has been raised up from among the dead" (@Romans 7: 4). It is not well with us until we reach this in our hearts. The many avenues through which the enemy would seek to claim our hearts are closed when such a bond is entered upon.
How the Lord loves to see that we desire only Himself. He will never rest until the matter is finished and the blessedness of the bond is known in our souls.

THE ASCENDED MAN AND HIS ASSEMBLY
J. Pellatt
@Ephesians 4: 7 - 16
I thought we might find encouragement in considering the scripture we have just read. We need to take account of the setting of Scripture. I think the epistle to the Ephesians has its own peculiar character. In this epistle we find ourselves in the presence of perhaps the largest scope of divine things found in any epistle in the New Testament, both with regard to Christ personally and with regard to the assembly -- the church, His body.
While the heavenly side of things is prominent and emphasised in the beginning of the epistle, the scope of it cannot be limited even to heaven. Nothing less than the universe is in view in it, and I believe it is a matter of great moment that we should be able in some measure to take account of the largeness of it. I have no doubt we all suffer more or less from smallness. If we take sober account of ourselves in the presence of God, we are obliged to admit that we are very small. We never can become great in ourselves. The only possible way of becoming in any sense great is to be occupied with God's great things.
Our time would not permit us to go into much detail with regard to the body of the epistle, but we can readily see that we find ourselves, in the very opening of it, in the presence of the counsels, or purposes, of God. Indeed, so far as the saints are concerned, the highest note is struck. "Blessed be the
{162}
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ". And this is according to His choosing, or His choice of us -- "according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation ... having marked us out beforehand for adoption" (chapter 1: 3 - 5). Our Authorised Version has wrongly put 'the adoption of children', and in this way the current doctrine in Christendom is that we are children of God by adoption. But this is not the truth. If we are children of God, we are so by virtue of having been begotten or born of God. What we get in the original is, "having marked us out beforehand for adoption" -- adoption and sonship represent one and the same word in the Greek.
As to our Lord Jesus Christ, this epistle views Him distinctly as Man. I do not think you could find one single statement in it that speaks of Him as a divine Person. He is a divine Person. He is always and everywhere a divine Person, but Ephesians views Him distinctively as Man. The first sight of it will speak to us as to this in a very simple way -- He is viewed as having been dead. We are not told about His death or the manner of it; but as having been dead, He is raised up and seated in the heavenlies (chapter 1: 20), and in connection with His being raised up and seated we have the most wonderful expression of the power of God to be found in Scripture. It far exceeds creation -- it is the climax of the power of God. He is raised up and He is seated, and the Spirit of God labours to set forth the greatness of
{163}
His exaltation.
In the end of chapter 1 we get -- "and what the surpassing greatness of his power ... above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come" (verses 19 - 21). Marvellous statement! Then, with the Lord looked at in this wonderful place of supreme exaltation, we have the church -- the assembly -- brought in. "And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" (verses 22, 23). You only get a right thought of the assembly as His body as you connect the assembly with Himself in His place of exaltation as Man.
Ques. Is not that necessary in connection with what was suggested at the beginning -- that the epistle takes in the universe?
J.P. Yes. It says in chapter 4: 10, "above all the heavens, that he might fill all things". But here it is the wonderful position of the assembly in relation to Him as thus raised and seated in the heavenlies in Him, as this scripture describes.
Ques. Is the assembly viewed here on the privilege side?
J.P. Surely; the force of the word "fulness" is 'complement', just as Eve was the complement of Adam, and was adequate to set forth all that marked and characterised Adam in the place which God had put him, so the assembly is the fulness of Him that fills all in all and is viewed as adequate to set forth
{164}
all that characterises Him.
I think we do well to take note of what the Spirit of God sets before us in this epistle. It is just what God has in view in the administration of the fulness of times, when He is going to head up all things in the Christ, both in heaven and upon the earth. God has in view the marvellous display that will characterise His universe at that time. I think it is so important that we should have these things distinctly before us. The tendency amongst us is to drop down to something more contracted than what God has before Him.
Ques. What comes out in the assembly now?
J.P. This epistle is not much occupied with that; it is more occupied with what is to come out in the assembly by-and-by. So, if we are quickened together and raised up together, and made to sit down together in the heavenlies, what is in view? "That he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus" (chapter 2: 7). I think that Colossians gives us more what is to come out in the saints now, not in the way of testimony exactly, but what is to come out in the saints *now* for the satisfaction of the heart of God.
But the verses we have read in @Ephesians 4 are very largely connected with what is present. There will not be any need for gifts by-and-by; it is here and now that we need the gifts, and that we ought to be affected by the gifts; but it is all in view of what is coming. What I mean is that it is so important that
{165}
our souls should come into the largeness of this epistle. We often go in for present results, and rightly, in a way, and the Lord, of course, helps us on every line that it is possible for Him to help us on, but we do not go in much for the largeness of what God has in view.
Ques. Do you mean we are qualifying now for the future?
J.P. Exactly. That is what makes the present so important. The tendency is always to drop down to ourselves. See the defective gospel that is preached. Why? Because it only regards the need of man. And we do not get over this tendency easily; it hangs on us many a day. Even as to truth in regard to the assembly, we take it up too much in regard to ourselves. That is the dead fly in the apothecary's pot of ointment which hinders (@Ecclesiastes 10: 1).
Ques. Why do you say that Christ in this epistle is presented as Man?
J.P. Well, the first thing is to be sure that it is a fact. Then look to the Lord, and He will give you understanding of the fact. I do not want you to take it because we say so, and if you look to Him, I think you will find that it is so, that this epistle presents Christ pre-eminently as Man, and that in the largest way known even to Scripture.
Rem. Looking at Him as a divine Person, there is no need for a helpmeet.
J.P. Of course not.
Rem. It is in regard to Him as Man that the position of the assembly is marked out.
{166}
J.P. It is. As a beloved servant of the Lord (now with Him) remarked a few years ago, there is a great deal of confusion in the minds of many of the saints between union with Christ looked at distinctively as Man, and association with Him (the same Person), but looked at as Son of God.
Ques. Which do you get in this epistle?
J.P. You get a bit of both. You get sonship in this epistle as well as the truth of union with Christ, and you get the bride. But still there is distinction.
Ques. Is sonship communion with the Son of God?
J.P. Sonship is association with the Son of God. We shall be His companions in heavenly glory. There are two things (I do not mean separate, but distinct), there is the bride, the Lamb's wife -- that is the assembly; but then there is the assembly of the firstborn ones -- "that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" (@Romans 8: 29) .
Well, to come to the verses we have read, the first point is -- Christ is seen as having ascended. There is a certain difference between the way the Spirit of God speaks of Him in chapter 1 and in chapter 4. It is, as the Spirit tells us in chapter 1, the surpassing greatness of God's power that raises Him, and then, being raised, He is seated. God sets Him down at His right hand in the heavenlies. But in chapter 4 He has ascended. If God makes a distinction, you may depend upon it there is a difference, and there is spiritual profit in being able to take account of it. The language and the manner of it
{167}
employed in the epistle almost touches the gospel of John. We all know that what is peculiar to John is that His death is presented as "commandment" on the part of the Father and of obedience on His part (@John 10: 18); for He is sent here not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him, and that goes on to His death. He lays down His life -- no one takes it from Him. He has power -- authority -- to lay it down and to take it again. He says, "I have received this commandment of my Father". So His resurrection there is His own act.
You get three statements in the New Testament about the resurrection of the Lord. One we have just read in @Ephesians 1, it is the "surpassing greatness" of God's power (verse 19, 20). Then in @Romans 6 He is "raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father" (verse 4). And then in John He raises His own body (@John 2: 19 - 22.) And so with ascension. While you get ascension in Mark and Luke, there is no ascension in Matthew. In Luke He is "carried up" (chapter 24: 51), and in Mark He is "taken up" (chapter 16: 19); but in John He is not "carried up" or "taken up". He tells Mary Magdalene, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend" (@John 20: 17).
I know that this is commonly accounted for on the ground that He, as a divine Person, had a perfect right to ascend. Of course He had as a divine Person. He is God, equal with the Father and with the eternal Spirit. But I venture to think that in thus accounting for His ascension there is a point missed.
Ques. Is it not as a divine Person He raises
{168}
Himself from the dead?
J.P. I do not think that is just the way Scripture puts it.
Rem. We are waiting for the point that you say is 'missed'.
J.P. Well, it is as to the statement -- "I ascend". Here in @Ephesians 4 we find that there are three things predicated of Him as to what He has accomplished: first, He has "ascended up on high"; secondly, He has "led captivity captive"; thirdly, He has "given gifts to men". Of course He is a divine Person; but I think what is set forth of Him in Ephesians is more the wonderful place He has as *Man*. I think that is the point of the Spirit there.
Ques. What title would you give Him in that connection? I mean in connection with Him ascending as Man.
J.P. He is "the second man, out of heaven" (@1 Corinthians 15:47). He was that when He was here. God created the first man here in innocence. But God has brought in a Man down here who ... belongs to heaven, and after that Man had met every claim of God down here, and filled up everything in respect of human responsibility, He has a perfect right to heaven.
Ques. Then the second Man out of heaven goes into heaven, whence He came?
J.P. He does. That is what one has always felt about John's gospel; one has always felt that resurrection could not be the terminus of things in John's gospel. The One who is seen in John's gospel is the
{169}
second Man out of heaven, and He is bound to go back there. So if you read the gospel carefully, you need not be surprised to find twenty-one mentions of the ascension of the Lord in it. "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" (chapter 6: 62) "I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father" (chapter 16: 28), etc.
These five chapters in John (13 - 17) are all in the light of His ascension. Take chapter 13: "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come" -- that what? that He should go to the cross? that He should die? that He should be raised? He does not say so, but that "he should depart out of this world to the Father". That is the great terminus in John. It belongs to Him, it is part of His glory. So He said, "I ascend". So the Spirit says here, "he ascended", "he has led captivity captive", He "has given gifts to men". Then the Spirit tells us of the gifts He has given from the wonderful place that He has.
Rem. It is from that place the gifts are given.
J.P. Yes, it is from that position they are given, but they are given in view of the assembly being seated together with Him. We are made to sit down together in Him now -- a present spiritual reality. But what is present spiritual reality is going to become an eternal actuality. We shall be seated with Him. It is in view of that and the wonderful position of the assembly in relation to Him, when the assembly is found actually in the heavenlies with Christ ... It is all in view of that, I think, that much spiritual
{170}
enlargement results to us in the apprehension of it, and we get great spiritual encouragement in the contemplation of it. We sometimes think things are going to the bad; no, they are going to the good! When you get an Ephesian view of things it is simply glorious, and we need it, beloved.
Then the Spirit tells us the kind of gifts which the ascended Man has given. He has given some apostles and prophets, some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. Wonderful gifts! I do not think it is too much to say that we are in the good of all the gifts now. In this way, I mean -- has not the Spirit given us the record of the ministry of the apostles and prophets? And then there are, thank God, still some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. What for? For the perfecting of the saints, with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the building up of the body of Christ; He has given them. And what is the goal? "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God".
That is a wonderful statement! The gifts are given, and as far as they are in operation, in the power of the Spirit, the saints are being brought to this point -- "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God". Do not let us miss the truth. We have been so slipshod in our reading that we have failed to distinguish between the Son as a divine Person in relation to the Father and as a divine Person as the Son of God.

RESOURCES TO HELP IN DISCERNMENT
D. M. Crozier
@Hebrews 4: 12, 13; @Hebrews 5: 12 - 14; @Revelation 3: 14 - 20; @1 Samuel 25: 1 - 3, 32 - 35; @John 21: 1 - 14
I wondered, dear brethren, if we might consider some of the resources that are available to help us in spiritual discernment. Paul says, "*we* have received ... the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God", and he speaks of the things of the Spirit "being spiritually discerned" (@1 Corinthians 2: 12, 14). It is a great matter to prove the Spirit being with us to help us to discern.
In @Hebrews 4, the writer speaks of those who failed to get the blessing because of "not hearkening to the word" of God (verse 11). It says, "For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart". Well, that is what God's word would do to each one of us. There is nothing hid from God, as the scripture says, "there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do".
I am sure most of us know what it is to have come under the searching gaze of God in the preaching, and we know that His word applies to each of us. Have we not often been laid bare before a holy and a righteous God? I trust that, in this meeting, we may prove the word of God to be "living and operative".
{172}
Men have largely ignored God's speaking, and Christendom has set up a religious order of things, apart from the Spirit of God, which is not characteristically "living". But what a thing it is, dear brethren, to be in touch with what is living and operative. And we need to be exercised to get God's word for ourselves individually, and to be searched by it -- I must apply it to myself. But if we are governed by the word of God in our lives and in our comings together, I believe there will be results for the glory of God.
How fine this scripture is! It says, "the word of God is ... sharper than any two-edged sword". We often think of the sword that Solomon called for (@1 Kings 3:24) and the effect that it had -- it revealed the affections of the true mother of the child. God's judgment sword is still in abeyance, but it is soon going to be brought to bear upon this world. There is also the sword of the word of God operating at the present time and "penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart". Think, dear brethren, of the word discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. They are not hid from God, though they may be hid from one another. I believe we should be searched by the word of God in all its penetrating character, and by it to gain the ability to discern what is pleasing to God at the present time.
I would ask our young brethren, Do you desire to be governed by the word of God? That is, not only should we read the Scriptures, but desire to get a
{173}
precious current application of the word of God each day to help us to regulate our lives according to God's will. How precious to God are persons with such desires! I think those spoken of in @Malachi 3 would be like that: "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another ... and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name" (verse 16). And Jehovah says, "ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not" (verse 18).
We read in @Hebrews 5, "For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that one should teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God". Well, is there not a great need for teaching today? I think it is a challenge to those of us who are a little older as to whether we are able to bring in teaching, or whether we are "partakers of milk" and "unskilled in the word of righteousness". We may be deficient because we are not able to take "solid food". I believe the word of God would be "solid food", but our constitution may be such that we are only able to take "milk". A babe begins with milk, but it soon grows and can take solid food. As the child grows older, its experience is widened as passing through school and later into employment in "the present evil world" (@Galatians 1: 4), but what is the food of our souls?
Physically, we have five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. If we are deaf, we may miss what is said; if we are blind, we cannot see where we
{174}
are going, and so on. And, spiritually, we have senses that are to be "exercised for distinguishing both good and evil". We need to be able to distinguish between good and evil. Well, there is a lot of evil in the world today; it is not only that we are to keep away from evil, but, first of all, we have to distinguish it, and be able to name things as "evil". I believe we do that as we lay hold of the word of God.
As we go on in our spiritual history we should ask help of the Spirit that we may develop our tastes according to God -- what a variety of food God has to offer each one of us! What food for our souls there is in contemplating our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh! what spiritual blessings God has bestowed upon His people. They are for our blessing, our joy and our protection as we go through our pathway here. But the important thing is to be able to distinguish "both good and evil". There is great emphasis in the world today as to the source of ingredients in food. And we need to be concerned as to the source of what we are feeding on spiritually. We need to find the source of things and be able to distinguish "both good and evil". Oh! what a wonderful thing it is that we are able to discern what is good for us.
I read in @Revelation 3 because I believe that those in Laodicea had lost the ability to discern. It says, "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot. Thus because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spue thee out of my mouth". Well, the Lord Jesus, in this scripture speaks to us of what marks many in
{175}
Christendom today -- indifference, lukewarmness of affection for Himself -- but the Lord is looking for "first love" (@Revelation 2: 4) at the present time.
He says to Laodicea, "Because thou sayest, I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing". Well, I trust no one in this room would dare to say that they "have need of nothing". Oh! dear brethren, I believe there is great need amongst the saints of God at the present time, to be conscious of the presence of the Holy Spirit, and to give the Lord Jesus His true place amongst us. It is not that the Lord says to them, 'Here are some options for you'. He does not say that, but He says, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire". Well, I believe that gold would speak to us of the knowledge of God made known to us through the sufferings of Christ. He was tested in that extreme way when He went to the cross and into death, that He might secure that which His heart was set upon. Do you think the Lord Jesus is going to give that up? -- Never! We may grow cold in our affections for Him, we may become lukewarm, but the Lord is saying, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich". I believe we should be exercised to acquire these riches.
Then it says, "and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest". Well, the Lord knows our state, and I believe these white garments would speak of the need of purity in our associations, as to those with whom we keep company. The
{176}
Lord says further, "and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see". Oh! dear brethren, that we may be able to see clearly. The Lord in His love and grace would delight to draw near to us and put His loving touch upon our eyes that we might see. When the Lord sent Ananias to Saul of Tarsus, after he was converted, Ananias laid his hands on Saul and said, "Saul, brother, ...", and "there fell from his eyes as it were scales" (@Acts 9: 17, 18). The Lord, I believe, would be pleased if we were to ask Him to come in with that gracious touch of His and cause us to see clearly what He is doing and saying at the present time.
"*I* rebuke and discipline as many as I love". You may say, 'The Lord had not much to love in Laodicea'. I think it is a great comfort that He disciplines those He loves. He did not write them off. There was much that displeased Him -- He had to say, "I am about to spue thee out of my mouth" -- but then He says, "*I* rebuke and discipline as many as I love". Well, I am sure that if we really set ourselves to acquire these features that the Lord counsels Laodicea "to buy of him", they would give us greater ability to discern at the present time.
I would like to speak for a moment to the dear, young children. You all know the story about Jonah, and how Jehovah told him to "Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I shall bid thee" (@Jonah 3: 2). It says of the people of Nineveh that they could not "discern between their right hand and their left hand" (chapter 4: 11). If you do
{177}
not know your right hand from your left, how would you follow directions to a place or a house? But what I would say to you, dear boys and girls, is that, as you and I have come to know the Lord Jesus as our Saviour, then as we own Him as our Lord we will find that He will give us direction in our lives, that we may be here pleasing to Him.
The Lord says, "the love of the most shall grow cold" (@Matthew 24: 12); and He said to Ephesus, "thou hast left thy first love" (@Revelation 2: 4). Has our love grown cold for Christ? May it never be true of us! I trust we all long that our love for Christ should be more intense, and will remain so while we are left here on earth. Well, what are you doing for Christ? what am I doing for Christ?
In @1 Samuel 25 we read of Abigail, a beautiful type of the assembly. The assembly is here today; it is Christ's counterpart, and is to be for His pleasure at the present time, and for ever. I read the opening verse which says, "And Samuel died". You might say there was an element of stability when Samuel was alive. It says, "Samuel died; and all Israel were gathered together, and lamented him; and they buried him in his house at Ramah". As long as we are left here, there may be happenings that will test our faith, but let us not lose sight of the fact that there is stability connected with the assembly: "hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18), the Lord said.
It says of Abigail that "the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance". Not only is the assembly attractive to the Lord Jesus, but
{178}
she is marked by intelligence. Paul says, referring to the assembly, "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" (@Colossians 2: 3). It is very important that we lay hold of assembly principles at the present time. I do not think we fully realise how privileged we are to be in the light of the assembly today. One has asked, 'Why do you talk so much about the assembly? Should you not be speaking about the Lord?' Well, at the present time, the assembly is the Lord's chief interest here. So, in speaking of the assembly we are speaking of what is of much interest to Him. Wisdom and discernment are found in the assembly; divine principles, based on Scripture, are cherished there. David says, "And blessed by thy discernment, and blessed be thou".
We read in @John 21 about Peter saying, "I go to fish", and six others going with him, and "that night took nothing". The Lord had called the disciples away from fishing three and a half years previously, and they had accompanied the Lord Jesus in His pathway here: "*Ye* are they who have persevered with me in my temptations" (@Luke 22: 28). But here they had gone on an expedition -- reminding us how quickly we may get away from the Lord and revert to our old habits. It is important that we learn to arrange our activities according to the Lord's will, that we may prove the Lord's help in what we do. What a blessing results from making way for the Lord in all our occasions of gathering.
Here it was John, "that disciple whom Jesus loved", who discerned that it was the Lord: "It is the
{179}
Lord", he says. The Lord had asked, "Children, have ye anything to eat?" and then told them to "Cast the net at the right side of the ship". When they all get to land, they see "a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread" -- the Lord's provision for them. Jesus says, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken" and He dispenses bread and fish to them. Well, what a thing it is to have the joy of receiving what the Lord dispenses. Let us look for this on every occasion of gathering.
May we be exercised to be persons who characteristically desire to be able to discern what is right and pleasing to the Lord at all times, for His Name's sake.

ONE OF THE PRAYERS OF CHRIST
J. B. Catterall
We read, and we believe, the marvellous fact that Christ intercedes for us, as a living Man in the presence of God (@Romans 8: 34); but what things, we may reverently ask, does He seek for us? The object of this paper is to suggest one of these things, which will serve to illustrate the nature of His desires for us.
Our Lord, when here on earth, was marked by prayer. It must be so. Not only did He pray on specific occasions, for example, the seven recorded in the gospel of Luke, but His whole life here was summed up in such a word as, "Behold, I come ... to do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and
{180}
thy law is within my heart" (@Psalm 40: 7, 8).
When He left the earth He did not cease to intercede. True, He was no longer Himself in conditions of need, but He still interceded for His disciples who were; indeed, it is only as exalted that He fully takes up His intercessory activity as High Priest in the presence of God for us (see @Hebrews 7: 25 - 8: 2).
He assumed that His disciples would take for granted that He would continue to speak to God for them: "In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you, for the Father himself has affection for you" (@John 16: 26, 27). The Spirit, that great Gift, was given at His request: "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter" (@John 14: 16). The primary expression of life itself, in a man, is, properly, prayer to God; and of Christ we read, generally, that "in that he lives, he lives to God" (@Romans 6: 10), and specifically, as our High Priest, that He ever liveth to make intercession for them that come unto God by him (@Hebrews 7: 25).
The intercession of Christ is strikingly introduced in the middle of the challenges thrown out by Paul in @Romans 8: 31 - 39: "What shall we then say to these things? ... Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? ... who is he that condemns? It is Christ who has died, but rather has been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God". We might have thought that was the climax; but no, there is, shall we say, an unexpected addition to these words of strong assurance: "*who also*
{181}
*intercedes for us*". The chorus of triumph which fills these verses seems to pause for a moment while this softer, this more intimate note is struck, and we are not surprised that it is immediately followed by the question: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" His intercession for us implies strong desire, which is inseparable from His love; just as, in the breastplate, Aaron bore on his heart before Jehovah the names of His people (@Exodus 28: 29).
But if Christ intercedes for us now, what sort of desires find their expression therein? We can learn something about this from the desires He expressed for His disciples in the days of His life here. Let us look at one example.
"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift you as wheat; but *I* have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and *thou*, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren" (@Luke 22: 31, 32).
Even to Peter himself and the other disciples the outlook at the moment was dark; they were conscious of impending calamity. But the full trial -- the power of Satan, the hostility of the world, and, worst of all, their own inability to stand up to it -- these were only known to Jesus Himself, and in the full knowledge of it all He could pray for Peter in particular that his faith might be brought through it.
It is at the corresponding point in the fourth gospel that the Lord, after warning Peter of his approaching failure, continues, "Let not your heart be troubled; *ye believe in God, believe also on me*"
{182}
(@John 14: 1).
"That thy faith fail not". Do we not often, in our weakness, in smaller trials than Peter's, feel the need that our faith should be sustained in strength and joy? In all kinds of ways the Lord's people are under pressure from those trials which are merely personal, and affect us as they affect all men, to those more honourable afflictions which are immediately associated with the interests of Christ. How easily the question arises in our hearts, How can God love me and be supporting me if He allows this pain of body, this trial in my surroundings, natural or spiritual, to happen to me, and to remain with me? And we want to get rid of the affliction, forgetting that it is exactly by it, and through it, that we can glorify God, and glorify Him in the sheer fact of going through it with Him, and having our faith in Him sustained and strengthened through it all.
"That thy faith fail not". Does it seem a small thing to pray for? The Lord did not think so; and doubtless Peter had these words of the Lord in his mind when, many years after, he wrote in his epistle: "that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 1: 7). Not merely "your faith", but the very trial of it is precious.
"No chastening at the time seems to be matter of joy", but have we no experience of our own with God to show us that His chastening does in very fact bring to us spiritual gain, "the peaceful fruit of
{183}
righteousness to those exercised by it" (@Hebrews 12: 11)? You feel perhaps that no one else is tried quite like you. True, no one has ever been; God will give you the distinction of trying your faith in a way different in some particular from that of any one else who has ever lived, in order that, believing in God, you may be able to glorify Him in a way equally distinct. And it is to this end that the Lord intercedes for you in your trial, not that it may be removed (though in due time in mercy it may be), but that in some distinct way you may, through it, learn something not to be learnt in any other way, and be brought nearer to God, and made more available for His service. He uses the affliction to make us inquire of Him; and we can surely say from experience that such inquiries are not in vain.
"That thy faith fail not". Abraham "*found strength* in faith, giving glory to God" (@Romans 4: 20). But it is through the sense of weakness that the strength of faith is reached and maintained. We see this in the strongest men. Moses, the leader of a host of six hundred thousand men of war, seemed (to himself) to be allotted an impossible task in dealing with their apathy, their murmurings, their rebellion. His only resource was to spread out everything before God.
Sometimes Moses seems at his wit's end, and his faith wavers: "Why hast thou done evil to thy servant, and why have I not found favour in thine eyes, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? ... And if thou deal thus with me, slay me, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, that I
{184}
may not behold my wretchedness" (@Numbers 11: 10 - 15). His life was one of continual suffering; he seems constantly faced with imminent failure. But in fact his faith did not fail; "he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible" (@Hebrews 11: 27). "Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (@Deuteronomy 34:7) -- type of the clear vision of faith, and the strength it gives. And, looking back, there is recorded, not only that "the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth" (@Numbers 12: 3), but also -- a fact of which he himself had probably not been greatly conscious -- "the great terribleness that Moses had wrought in the sight of all Israel" (@Deuteronomy 34: 12).
To return to Simon Peter, the subject of our illustration. We can trace in the Acts, and in his two epistles, how the prayer of Christ for him was answered in the circumstances immediately following, as well as in his later life. We can follow him to his death, the manner of which we know in principle, though not in detail. Nothing could be more trying to a man of Simon's natural force, nothing more calculated to try his faith, than the circumstances of his death as foretold by the Lord: "when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire. But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God" (@John 21: 18, 19).
One thing more. The trial of our faith is not only for our blessing and for the praise of God, two things
{185}
always associated; it is also to be of practical use, that we may be enabled to serve our brethren. We want to see that our trial is not wasted from this point of view. "*When once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren*". What desirable fruits if we are thus 'confirmed'! And have we not found it so in actual fact? Have we not known occasions when some experience of suffering on our part has the better enabled us to help our brother or our sister? Certainly, to look at the other side, the writer has often felt that he was not likely to get much help for his soul from any one who had not known suffering.
"That thy faith fail not". Is not this one of the prayers of Christ for us? And is it not a great prayer?

DIVINELY APPOINTED MEETING PLACES
H. J. Miles
During the course of this world there have been many historic meeting places, where great issues have been settled, important transactions made and momentous covenants ratified. But God has His appointed meeting places, some preserved to us as witness of what He has accomplished in the past, some available to us for His glory and our good in the present, and some reserved for the heading up of His ways with His people and with men generally in the future.
@Psalm 85:10 speaks of the meeting place of mercy and truth, which found its fulfilment <p><b>AT THE CROSS OF CALVARY</b>,
{186}
for there, in the face of man's violation of the truth, mercy and truth met harmoniously. God must appoint the meeting place, as He only knew the magnitude of the issue and the true ground upon which it could be settled. If the meeting were upon any other ground than that of righteousness, truth must fall or mercy fail: but in the coming of Jesus we see God's great and perfect solution; and as we reach Calvary in our souls our eyes are opened to see, in Him who suffered there, that "Loving-kindness and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other".
All the claims of truth, in God's righteous judgment of sin, have been satisfied, and all the fulness of mercy, in the outgoings of God's compassion towards men, have been expressed, and the one has not been, nor could be, separated from the other. What a triumph for God that He has been able to maintain all the glory of His throne without abrogating one of the claims of truth and righteousness and at the same time to come out in the blessedness of all that He is, in mercy and truth!
On no other ground could He have to do with man, except to man's condemnation, and in no other way could the sinner, even though repenting, be brought into His favour. At the cross of Calvary was sealed, in the precious blood of Christ, the great charter of the repentant believer's liberty, that he might live before God and in His kingdom in all the acceptability of the One who "offered himself spotless to God" (@Hebrews 9: 14). No wonder then, that such
{187}
a meeting place has been cherished down the centuries in the heart-kept records of Christian truth!
Then there is the meeting place <p><b>AT THE MERCY-SEAT</b>
of which God said to Moses in @Exodus 25: 22, "there will I meet with thee, and will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat". It was there that the blood of the sin-offering was sprinkled by the high priest on the day of atonement, signifying the perfect witness, under the eye of God, of the completeness of the work of atonement. What a meeting place between God and men! It was only available typically in that day, because it was impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins, but now that Christ has come and offered Himself spotless to God, the place is available for whosoever will. God now addresses men from the mercy-seat, and invites them to draw near.
@Romans 3 bears beautiful witness to this in speaking of "the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for the shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before ... so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus" (verses 24 - 26). God is speaking to men in Christ Jesus, the mercy seat, and all who approach by the blood of Jesus find, not only forgiveness, but all the blessed unfoldings of God's disposition in Christ. It has been said, 'God has spoken in Jesus, but in Jesus God has spoken volumes'. How blessed then to draw near
{188}
and hear God's voice from off the mercy-seat, for we may meet God there as a Saviour-God!
The next divinely-appointed meeting place is reserved for those who gather together in the name of the Lord Jesus Himself. When here upon earth He gathered a few devoted hearts around Himself and gave them directions which would assure for them His presence after His departure, in <p><b>THE PLACE OF HIS APPOINTMENT</b>.
He knew how Satan would delude men by his religious artifices, until the profession of Christianity would become a medley of sectarian names and a maze of religious confusion, where even the feet and hearts of His own would be diverted from the truth, and so He left love's signpost for the simple-hearted. As sinners we may find Him, through repentance and faith, as a Saviour at God's right hand, and there, too, as individual believers we may, by the Spirit, maintain our links with Him in the various offices which He fills, but if we desire to have His presence down here in the midst of His own, it can only be in the place of His appointment -- "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18: 20).
On the mount of transfiguration, the voice from the excellent glory spoke saying, "*This* is my beloved Son: hear him" (@Mark 9: 7). Happy the hearts that, refusing all rival names and claims, have heard Him in this and, gathering together unto His Name, know His presence in their midst.
Here the pageantry of religious ritual and the
{189}
embellishments of religious art lose their charms, for the blessedness of His presence and the beauty of His Person excel all that can be graven by art and man's device. Here He captivates the hearts of those to whom He comes, instructing them in love's lessons and leading them in love's way. May every heart that knows Him find Him thus at the place of His appointment!
In @1 Thessalonians 4: 13 - 18, addressed to believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, their meeting place is stated, when the Lord Himself shall descend and His own will be caught up <p><b>TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR</b>.
What an appointment and what a prospect! Then shall we "be always with the Lord". It is the Christian's sure and certain hope -- not for better conditions in the world which has crucified the Lord of glory, but to be with Christ Jesus Himself, the One who died for them and rose again, who lives at God's right hand and is awaiting the time appointed of the Father.
The final divine appointment for those who die in their sins must not be overlooked, for they must stand before God, <p><b>AT THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</b>
where the dead, small and great, will stand before God, and will be judged according to their works (@Revelation 20: 11 - 15). No one who dies in his sins will be absent. It is a divine appointment, and the attendance of all called to it will be compulsory. Unrepentant persons may avoid meeting with God and with
{190}
Christ in this present time -- when mercy may be shown them and forgiveness received -- but there will be no hiding place for such in that day.
May no reader be left for such a meeting, but rather, by virtue of the all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ, meet with Him now in repentance and faith and so find forgiveness at His feet!

"BY THE RIVER OF GOD"
F. S. Marsh
PAUL -- the great apostle of the Gentiles -- had responded to the vision of the man of Macedonia, "concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings" (@Acts 16: 10). At the beginning of the proclamation of the gospel in Europe, it was a great movement of the Spirit of God, so it is recorded that "on the sabbath day we went outside the gate *by the river*, where it was the custom for prayer to be, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had assembled". Thus is the truth borne home upon us that every evangelical movement is to find its beginnings by the river -- under the power and influence of the Spirit of God. Peter confirms this when he speaks of those who have "declared to you the glad tidings by the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven" (@1 Peter 1: 12). The river, in this incident, speaks of the essential <p><b>POWER FOR THE WORK OF THE GOSPEL</b>.
Whether for public preaching or personal speaking, power is needed, and "power belongeth unto God"
{191}
(@Psalm 62: 11, Authorised Version). One of the features of the work of God in each soul is the implanting of evangelical desires -- a longing for the blessing of others; yet how important it is that each one should find his power and supplies in the River of God, which is full of water. What dignity, too, it gives to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, seeing that God is its *Source*, His Son Jesus Christ our Lord is its *Theme*, and the Holy Spirit of God the *Power* by whom alone it is effectual.
JOHN -- the beloved apostle -- was entrusted to unfold the great climax of the truth of the River of God. Carried away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, he records that "he shewed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb" (@Revelation 22: 1). The River in its purity is the mighty stream of <p><b>LIFE IN THE CITY OF GOD</b>.
It is to be the portion of the saints of God in the coming day of display to dwell *by the River*. The Psalmist said, "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God" (@Psalm 46: 4).
Through that day of glory, the same divine Person -- the Holy Spirit -- who has prepared the saints for the service of God; by whose activities they have been enlightened in the truth of God; who has ever been the power for the work of the gospel of God, will fill that glorious city with life -- shedding His mighty influence over it all -- until each living one, who forms part of that wonderful company, will be able to say in full measure then:
{192}
<blockquote> 'And see! the Spirit's power <br> Has ope'd the heavenly door, <br> Has brought us to that favoured hour <br> When toil shall all be o'er' (`74:5). </blockquote>
Yet today is 'the Spirit's day', with all the spiritual resources of the Holy Spirit of God now available. How important then are the exhortations: "Walk in the Spirit" (@Galatians 5: 16), and "do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have been sealed for the day of redemption" (@Ephesians 4: 30)!

THE LORD'S WILL
J. B. Stoney
@Hebrews 13: 5, 6
You must lie in the line of the Lord's will in order to enjoy His favour. This line is the testimony of the Holy Spirit, it is of Him; I used to confine it too much to testimony for Him.
We should all flourish if we had our eyes on our Sun. The flowers on the earth may teach us thus. They are so affected by their sun. Their colours are bright when they have plenty of the sun, and their fragrance is in proportion. So we should have both beauty and fragrance if the eyes of our hearts were fixed on Christ. We are generally thinking of something to do; it is work of some kind that is before us. We are looking for the work to commend us, and not for the One whom Enoch studied to please; "he pleased God" by giving Him credit for His nature, that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.

CHRIST'S FEELINGS TOWARDS THE SAINTS EXPRESSED IN PAUL
A. J. Gardiner
@2 Corinthians 13: 11 - 14; @Colossians 4: 7 - 18
We were speaking this afternoon, dear brethren, of Joseph in relation to his brethren, and all the feelings which were found with Joseph. I have read these scriptures as indicating, I believe, something of the feelings of Christ in regard of the saints of the assembly as finding expression through Paul, because every right feeling in regard of the saints has been derived from Christ.
In @Exodus 28 we have, in Aaron clothed with the garments of glory and beauty, a type of Christ in His present position and service on high as personally sustaining the whole service of God in the assembly down here on earth. If you will remember, on the skirts of the cloak of the high priest were pomegranates and bells (verses 33, 34), the pomegranates being very suggestive of the local assemblies, each pomegranate being complete in itself and yet each setting out the idea of unity in itself. Then along with the pomegranates, suggestive of the local companies in their unity and fruitfulness under the eye of God, there were golden bells, suggesting that there is not only what is for the pleasure of God in the local companies, but also there is to be testimony, the bells undoubtedly referring to that. Paul says in 1 Thessalonians, "the word of the Lord sounded out from you" (chapter 1: 8).
The remarkable thing is that all these are
{194}
presented as on the skirts of the cloak of the high priest; that is, they are all sustained and supported by the high priest personally. When you begin to think of what there is in the world today of true assembly character in all but one, at any rate, of the continents, you can understand how immense is the service of Christ in sustaining that for the pleasure of God day in and day out, and I might say night in and night out, for "he that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep" (@Psalm 121: 4).
Another thing to be remembered is that it is supported feelingly, for the people of God were carried on the high priest's shoulders according to their birth (@Exodus 28: 7 - 12), referring, I believe, to what the Lord Jesus is doing as interceding for every one of us individually at the present time. @Romans 8: 34 states that and adds, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?" (verse 35).
All finds its answer in the intercession which Christ is carrying on at the present time, and not only so, but the names of the children of Israel were borne in four rows of three on the breastplate of the High Priest (@Exodus 28: 17 - 20), the breastplate of judgment, and the four rows of three undoubtedly allude to the four camps of three tribes each in which the people of God were set around the tabernacle; that is, it refers to the saints as committed publicly to the testimony of God in their various local settings -- tribal settings, using the type -- and in that setting also, not merely in the individual needs
{195}
and pressures and testings of the saints, but in connection with the exercises which they have as seeking to move together in their respective localities, the saints are being borne up before God by the Lord Jesus continually on the breastplate of judgment, meaning that He has a perfect judgment as to the conditions that exist in every locality. He has a perfect knowledge of them, and a perfect judgment as to them; a judgment as to what is the cause of anything that is lacking or unsatisfactory; a judgment as to what is the need in each locality.
It is a great thing to have a sense that Christ is caring for the saints, but caring for them, if I may venture to use the expression, feelingly and intelligently; that is, caring for them in relation to what the thoughts of God concerning them are, and having no less desire than that there should be a complete answer to those thoughts amongst the saints. We see that in Epaphras in Colossians. He had learned from Christ, for he continued urgently in prayer that the saints at Colosse should "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (chapter 4: 12). He was not content with half measures; however far they might have attained, he wanted them to go still further, and we may rest assured, dear brethren, as knowing something of the Lord Jesus, as knowing how characteristically He is devoted to the will of God, that He will not rest content until a perfect answer to God's thoughts is found amongst His people.
Now, I have said that much by way of introduction, but also to impress us with this thought of the
{196}
feelings of Christ, and how those feelings will find expression and reproduction in those who are near to Him. That is particularly seen in Paul, for I have no doubt Paul stands out head and shoulders above anyone else in this matter of feeling for the saints. He says in 2 Corinthians, "the crowd of cares pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies" (chapter 11: 28), and at the same time it was not limited to the state of the assemblies, but his interest in the saints was individual as well; so he says further, "Who is stumbled, and I burn not?" If he heard of one stumbled soul, one young brother or sister it might be, who was stumbled, his heart burned at the thought of it, his spiritual indignation, so to speak, was awakened as he heard of even one soul amongst the saints being stumbled.
If Paul could be marked by these feelings, there is no reason why we should not be also, in our measure. I do not think it was exactly apostolic, although no doubt his position as apostle largely contributed to it, but feelings of this kind are not a matter of gift, they are a matter of being near to the Lord, and of getting an impression in nearness to Christ of what His own feelings are in regard of the saints.
So the apostle, as concluding his second letter to the Corinthians says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice". That is his final word to them. The Corinthian epistle, as we know, deals with the saints in their local settings as committed in the locality where they live to the testimony of God; whereas the Colossian saints are viewed in connection with
{197}
heavenly truth, the universal setting of the assembly, and in both settings we get the apostle's feelings in regard of the saints coming out in these verses we have read.
In writing to the Corinthians, Paul had addressed them in both epistles as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". Brethren will, I am sure, understand that in nothing I am saying am I assuming that the saints in this place, or anywhere else, moving together in the truth, claim to be the assembly of God, or can claim to be that. That would be presumption, because we represent only a fraction of the whole number of saints that there are, but in the mercy of God we have been delivered from captivity; for the church as a whole is in captivity to the world, but we are living in days in which God has wrought to deliver some of His people from captivity, and we are among those set free; that is our position.
Just as in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, those who came up from captivity were enabled of God to build the house and to set up the service of God in it; and to build the wall and dedicate it with the gates proper to it, so in this our day those saints who have been set free from what is contrary to God, are in a position -- if they will go on with the Lord and with the Spirit, and govern themselves by the truth that relates to the assembly -- to enjoy every feature of the truth, although it be only in outward smallness and weakness. Therefore we may take up humbly the thoughts of God regarding the assembly; and, indeed, dear brethren, if we do not, we are
{198}
unrighteous, for there is no other truth than the truth of the assembly that can possibly regulate saints going on together. It is a matter of positive righteousness as we seek to go on together to regulate ourselves by the light that governs the assembly.
Having said that, I return to what I was saying, that the apostle addressed both his epistles to the Corinthians to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". That is something to rejoice in, dear brethren. He says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice", the idea being that at Blenheim, or any place you like to name, where any saints are available as delivered from what is opposed to the truth, there should be in that place something that answers to the thought of God's assembly. There should be a company in the place which the Lord claims as His own, "my assembly" (@Matthew 16: 18), and which He is prepared to sustain, provided the conditions necessary are there; and in spite of all the evil that is around, in the very presence of it, that there should be what is available under the hand of Christ to maintain the service of God for His pleasure, and to maintain in the midst of the evil around a true light as to God, light as to His holiness and faithfulness, in unity amongst ourselves, and with the ability to deal with evil, if it should show itself, in a way according to God.
All these things are features of glory, things that properly belong to the assembly of God, and it is a matter to rejoice in, dear brethren, that it is open to us to have our part in these great things. The time for it will soon be gone, the opportunity will soon be
{199}
past. The days of our receiving up are near, and therefore the urgent need that we should all be of one mind, to provide under the hand of the Lord the conditions in which He can maintain the service of God and a true testimony to His name.
So the apostle says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice". In each epistle he had linked a brother with himself -- Sosthenes in the first epistle, and Timotheus in the second -- in each case calling him "the brother". That is, these two elements are always necessary if there is to be a prosperous condition of things in a local company. There must be what is authoritative on the one hand, not in the assertion of authority on the part of one not having it, but authoritative in the sense of the apostle's doctrine, and what is brotherly on the other.
Paul says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace". There is only one mind that is properly characteristic of the assembly, dear brethren. The apostle develops it in Philippians. He presents it in a most exalted form in @Philippians 2, saying, "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men" (verses 5 - 7). No reputation! A bondman's form! What a mind to shine out in One who is God, yet did not claim for Himself the glory and dignity proper to Deity, but took a bondman's form. It is possible that this mind should be in us.
{200}
You will remember how Abigail was attracted by the light of God's anointed as found here in wilderness conditions, and how David sent a message to her that he wished her to become his wife (@1 Samuel 25). That is exactly what the Lord would say to us. He is here in testimony in His people in wilderness conditions and He wants His assembly to be thoroughly united to Him in one mind and one thought; and Abigail said, "Let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord" (verse 41). She was, so to speak, of one mind with Christ who took a bondman's form. She says, 'All I want, my greatest aspiration, is to be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord'. That is the spirit in which things will prosper in any local company. How that will develop mutuality, and affection, and consideration for one another, just one or two moving in that spirit, with no other thought before them. And so she became united to David. So the apostle says, "be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you".
Then he says, "Salute one another". He is concerned about mutual feelings among the brethren. "Salute one another with a holy kiss". It is a salutation that is to be holy. One is not suggesting that it be taken up literally in an actual kiss, but whatever form the greeting may take, whether kiss or handshake, greet one another with it in holiness. Let love be expressed in the salutation. "Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you", that is, the saints at the place from which he was writing.
{201}
"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all". So he brings in the whole Godhead, beginning with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is, I believe, a subduing influence. It is a remarkable thing that he should not begin with God. One would have thought that as he was going to bring in the activity of the Godhead, he would have begun with God, but he begins with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a subduing influence. You will remember how the dew comes down from heaven, even Nebuchadnezzar was bathed with the dew of heaven. There was that subduing influence, so to speak, interwoven with God's governmental ways with that man. "His body was bathed with the dew of heaven" (@Daniel 4: 33). And so the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is a kind of subduing influence.
The apostle says in this epistle, "ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched" (@2 Corinthians 8: 9). All that is to be carried in our minds. The apostle, with great feeling, as one expressive of this grace, brings it to bear upon us. You will remember how he appeals to them, saying in the first epistle, "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings. I entreat you therefore, be my imitators" (@1 Corinthians 4: 15). How the feelings of Paul come out in that way as expressive of the feelings of Christ! "I entreat you therefore, be my
{202}
imitators". He says in that same passage, "Railed at we bless; persecuted, we suffer it; insulted, we entreat: we are become as the offscouring of the world, the refuse of all, until now" (verses 12, 13). That is what he brings to bear upon the Corinthians, so that they might have before them in himself the pattern of true Christianity; and in order that it might be strengthened, he sends Timotheus, who, he says, "is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly" (verse 17).
It is a most important thing that the assembly is to be according to one pattern. Paul, like Moses coming down from the mountain with the pattern of the tabernacle (@Exodus 32: 15), had the pattern in his mind before ministering and before coming to Corinth. He had the whole plan as a wise architect and he laid the foundation. A builder does not start to build until he has the plan. The plan is first drawn up, and then the work proceeds according to the plan, and Paul had the whole plan of the assembly as God had it in His mind; and not only did he minister the truth but he exemplified it in his ways as they are in Christ, as he says, "according as I teach everywhere in every assembly" (@1 Corinthians 4: 17). Every assembly was intended to take on the same pattern of ways as they are in Christ. He sent Timotheus into their midst as one who, by his own ways, would remind them of Paul's ways as they are in Christ.

BROTHERLY TRAITS
J. Taylor
@John 20: 17, 18; @Genesis 13: 8, 9; @Genesis 14: 13 - 16; @Genesis 45: 14, 15; @Exodus 2: 11 - 15; @Judges 1: 3 - 7, 17; @Judges 8: 18, 19
What I have before me is to seek to convey the divine idea of "brethren". This term has become very familiar to us. It has ever been so among men. Abel was the first to be called "brother" (@Genesis 4: 2), and therefore the term early entered into the language of our race and, I suppose, now occurs in connection with every branch of the human family.
But in modern times it has become familiar in a peculiar way in that it has been made the designation of a certain class of Christians. And as thus used it has been reduced from the high level of @John 20 to the level of an ordinary religious designation in Christendom. As thus reduced it is like "as a gold ring in a swine's snout", as is said in @Proverbs 11:22. My exercise tonight is to seek to lift it in our minds out of that setting into its own proper place according to God. The Lord Jesus Christ has given it a place, for He puts precious things in their own right setting. I hope that tonight, by the Lord's help, we may see a little of the setting of this precious stone, as I may so speak of it.
It is seen in @John 20 in its most exalted character. A few men known as very ordinary in this world, fishermen and the like, had been drawn to Jesus and had been His companions. On several occasions He had referred to them as His brethren, especially as His mother and brethren after the flesh sought to
{204}
assert their right to His attention. The Lord was accustomed to speak to small, as to large, companies, and @Matthew 12: 46 - 50 and @Mark 3: 31 - 35 tell us that on one such occasion His mother and brethren stood without asking to see Him. It was reported to Him, but instead of relinquishing His holy spiritual service in speaking of His Father and His Father's things, He continued speaking, and looking around on His disciples said, "Behold my mother and my brethren: for whosoever shall do the will of God, *he* is my brother, and sister and mother". He thus introduced a great moral barrier between the spiritual and the natural. He lifted the term out of the natural into its spiritual setting.
So as risen from the dead He sent a message to His disciples by Mary, saying, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". He needed not to give Mary a list of the names and addresses, for she well knew where to find them. She knew whom He had in mind. She came to the disciples and told them that "she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her". Thus we have the circle delineated, and the term "brethren" placed in its most exalted setting.
Now I want to show from the Old Testament some of the traits of brethren. By these traits we may come to know our brethren, and to scorn the applying of the term to a mere religious body. There are thousands of our "brethren" whom we do not know. It may be their fault, or ours, but they exist
{205}
nevertheless. It is for us to lay hold of the term and what it applies to, and seek out our relations. Divine love in us would lead to this search for our brethren, to our clinging to them when found, and to the laying down of our lives for them if need be.
I believe we should use the Old Testament for the detail it gives us. In the New we get divine directions and statements of doctrine; in the Old we have the definitions. Things are shown there, they are exemplified. Christianity is not simply a system of doctrines, it is also a system of principles and examples. The Lord Himself takes the lead in this, saying, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and *I* will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me" (@Matthew 11: 28, 29). He is the Model for us. The Old Testament furnishes us with designed, not accidental, illustrations given with divine care and precision.
Let us begin with Abram. The first feature of a brother seen in him is that he refuses to quarrel, he is not contentious. It is said in @1 Corinthians 11:16, "if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God". The man was ruled out. Now there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. Abram says, "I pray thee let there be no contention between me and thee ... for we are brethren". He refuses to contend. Of course you will understand that I am not here speaking of questions affecting the truth. In such cases the brother would be like the lion, and not turn away for any (@Proverbs 30: 30). If
{206}
it be a question of Christ or the truth, the brother will take a stand at all costs. But when it is a matter of land or other personal interests, or feelings, he refuses to contend. Like Mephibosheth he says, "Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house" (@2 Samuel 19: 30). Here Abram says, in effect, 'If you choose the right, I will turn to the left, or if you choose the left, I will go to the right: under no circumstances let us quarrel'.
Then Lot is captured, and Abram goes to rescue him. Lot had no claim upon Abram. In choosing the well-watered plain of Jordan, Lot had treated him in a most unbrotherly way. Like Demas he had loved this present evil world (@2 Timothy 4: 10). But Abram dwelt by the oaks of Mamre. He was not, as it were, in the world; he settled by stable things, things that abide. And he was Abram the Hebrew, the separate man. As sure as we put on the initial idea of the brother we shall be found dwelling by stable things. We "receiving a kingdom not to be shaken" (@Hebrews 12: 28). Abram lived in relation to that, and had three hundred and eighteen trained servants born in his house at his command. What headway, what progress, he made!
As we take up the exercises connected with the brother, God will see to it that we go on to greater things. But as for Lot, he could not even influence his sons-in-law, who mocked him. He had absolutely no influence. So Abram takes his life in his hands and pursues the enemy and rescues his brother. Lot did not deserve this, and hence we see here the
{207}
second great feature of the brother -- *he altogether sinks personal feelings*. His brother is of value to him, of more value than flocks and herds, though he be a worldly Christian. Abram pursues the enemy a long way, even to Hobah, on the left hand of Damascus. It was a very long way, a great undertaking for the sake of one brother. But Abram was equal to it. How easily we sometimes let our brethren slip through our fingers! "A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city" (@Proverbs 18: 19). Let us then see to it that our brethren do not get offended. Abram must have his brother even if he has to lay down his life for him, which indeed he did in principle.
Joseph is the next, representative of the brother "born for adversity" (@Proverbs 17: 17), not his own adversity, but the adversity of others. He gathers up all that had preceded him and exemplifies the idea of the brother in a more complete way than is seen in any save the Lord Himself. Joseph is a most striking type. He knew love. That is the next great thing. He was loved by his father. When he was a lad of seventeen, his father had made him a coat of many colours (@Genesis 37: 3); he came in for a peculiar expression of his affection, he was distinguished as a loved one.
There are such who stand out among the saints in this way. The apostle John was one of them: he was "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (@John 21: 20). It is a delightful thing to get into the company of one who knows love and can convey love. This is the privilege of the brother. So we find Joseph, having had keen experience of suffering at the hands of his
{208}
brethren, now meets them under the most extraordinary circumstances. He is lord of all Egypt (@Genesis 45:9), and his brethren come to him to buy corn. He knew them, but they did not know him. How many of our brethren around us we do not know. We are all typically "one man's sons" (chapter 42: 11), but are of many mothers. Joseph's brethren typify the Lord's people as found among the systems of this world. We have one common Father, but who is our mother? The mother has much to do with the upbringing of the family. Jacob's family had four mothers.
Now we find that Joseph's brethren have to confess that they were twelve brethren. They do not pretend to say, We are. They say, We "were twelve brethren ... the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not". What feelings must have arisen in their hearts as they said, "one is not" (chapter 42: 13). The ten are lined up before their brother as guilty of murder. What will the brother do under such circumstances? You will say, 'The case is hopeless'. But no; let us see what he will do. He was but an Egyptian to them, but in his heart was a deep pent-up reservoir of love towards them. He was so powerfully affected that he wept over them.
Here we have another point, love never fails. And in this most extraordinary situation it avails to bring the brethren to repentance. This is one of the greatest of its feats. Love can do it, it never fails (@1 Corinthians 13: 8). How does Joseph act? He first puts them in prison. 'A hard man', you say. But he could weep in doing it. This is love's way, the way of
{209}
wisdom. He also had the silver cup put in Benjamin's sack (chapter 44: 2). By these means he brought his brethren to repentance. Judah now says; "We have an aged father, and a child born to him in his old age, yet young; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him" (chapter 44: 20). Ah! the bold, hard, remorseless feelings are giving way to soft and tender sympathies. He says, We have a father and we have a brother. This is the result of coming into the presence of Joseph. He can serve them as none other can. And now he can make himself known to them. "He fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck". Benjamin gets the first embrace; the two brothers are brought together in the deepest affection and sympathies. "And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them". Now we have the twelve brethren set up together in the holy bonds of affection. How much this spirit is needed today -- the moral power, constancy and faithfulness to serve all the brethren in holy love!
Next let us turn to Moses. How he loved his brethren and understood what was comely amongst them. Stephen, in @Acts 7: 26, quotes him saying to those who strove together, "*Ye* are brethren, why do ye wrong one another?" We find him, though learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, mighty in words and in deeds, the great prince of Pharaoh's house, coming down to look upon the burdens of his brethren, the oppressed Hebrews. He sees an Egyptian smiting one brother. We cannot say what his
{210}
status was, he may have been just an insignificant slave or brick-maker. But he was a brother. His hands may have been hard and smeared by toiling at the brick-kiln. But he was a brother.
We read that Moses "turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand". That was one day's work. Stephen tells us that he thought they would understand that God by his hand would deliver them, but they did not (@Acts 7: 25). Our brethren do not always understand; we have need of patience in serving them. On the next day he sees two of his brethren quarrelling. Of course, one was in the wrong. Moses says, "Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?" He that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, "Who made thee ruler and judge over us?" You see he had a rebuff for his love. So he has to flee the face of Pharaoh and is exiled forty years in the land of Midian on account of love for his brethren. He laid down his life for them as did Abram. He sacrificed all for them.
Now in connection with Judah and Simeon, we find very beautiful brotherly relations existing. They portray brethren dwelling together in unity. Judah was the big influential brother, the leading tribe. He says to his brother Simeon, "Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot". So Simeon went with him. How this spirit is to be coveted in our warfare with the Canaanites, the spiritual powers of wickedness in heavenly places! If unity comes in,
{211}
the most potent power will be broken. They slay ten thousand of the enemy and find a powerful man, Adoni-bezek. They cut off his thumbs and his great toes, but they do not kill him. Why not? Because it is a question of a moral victory. He is brought to repent and realise that he as to do with God, and not merely with the brethren.
There is the power of limitation among the people of God. Unity is imperative. If it is not present, Satan will find an opening in the ranks, of which he, the shrewd enemy, will not fail to take advantage. Judah and Simeon fought side -- by-side, and God was with them. No doubt Adoni-bezek is typical of a person exercising an undue influence over the people of God. He says, "Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gleaned under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me". His power of initiative is taken away, and he has to own that God's hand is upon him. Then he is brought to Jerusalem and he dies. He will never trouble the saints again. This was a great exploit, a great moral victory.
Finally, in @Judges 8 we have what links up with @John 20. Gideon is a type of Christ. He says to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What sort of men were they?" They say, "As thou art, so were they". They were his brethren not merely in name, but also in likeness. They were typically like Christ -- "each one resembled the sons of a king". Royalty marked them. Gideon says, "They were my brethren, the sons of my mother". They did not have many mothers, like
{212}
Joseph's brethren. They were all, typically, Christians walking in the light of the assembly. As the light of the assembly stamps us, it gives us heavenly character. In human organisations there may be many true Christians; all have the same Father, but not the same mother. They take character from the human organisations to which they belong. The assembly is "our mother", Jerusalem above, which "is free" (@Galatians 4: 26). She gives to the saints a heavenly dignity and liberty. It is the maternal side imparting heavenly character like Christ. If I think of God as Father, that is the link I have with every brother. But many are also the product of human, not heavenly, systems.
So this connects with what we had at the commencement. How blessed to be greeted of the Lord in the terms of the message sent by Mary! We should look with scorn on the name "brethren" as a mere sectarian designation. Heaven abhors it. It is reducing a heavenly thing to the level of the flesh. The Lord help us to maintain it in its setting by the Spirit's power!

THE ASCENDED MAN AND HIS ASSEMBLY
J. Pellatt
@Ephesians 4: 7 - 16
Ques. What importance do you attach to the title "Son of man" in @John 3:13?
J.P. It is very beautiful how the Lord speaks of Himself, especially in John's gospel, almost
{213}
invariably as the Son of man. Indeed, there is only one instance in John of His declaring Himself fully to any one as the Son of God and that is in chapter 9: 35. But almost invariably He speaks of Himself as the Son of man. The Son of man is the Son of God, and the Son of God is the Son of man, one and the same Person, both viewing Him as Man, one in relation to God and the other in relation to man. It is very beautiful and very instructive to take account of how He is spoken of. I think there is nothing, perhaps, in all the range of Scripture that ought to demand and engage our attention and interest us as the way that Christ is spoken of.
Ques. Tell us the difference; here it is the knowledge of the Son of God, and in Peter it is the knowledge of Jesus our Lord?
J.P. Peter's line is the saints down here in relation to certain things that belong to their responsible life and path down here, and that is all covered by the expression, "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ" (@2 Peter 3:18). It is not that Peter did not know Him as the Son of God. I am sure he did, but while he does not in exact terms speak of Him in that way in his epistle, yet he does speak of Him as the "living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious" (@1 Peter 2: 4). Who is that One? That is Jesus, the Son of God; He is the living Stone, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". The Lord said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who
{214}
is in the heavens" (@Matthew 16: 16, 17).
Rem. There are four things in that verse you refer to. One is, the unity of the faith; next, "the knowledge of the Son of God"; then a full-grown man, and then the fulness of the Christ (@Ephesians 4: 13). What is your thought in connection with these four?
J.P. The full-grown man is a man who has every faculty and member developed. He is a man in whom there is nothing lacking. The saints are to arrive at the stature of a full-grown man -- that is, there is to be in them the expression and the answer to everything that characterises Him -- "at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". You see, it is a qualifying process now. With such stress laid on this point there cannot be a perfect answer to it now; that can only be answered to fully in view of the wonderful place of the assembly in relation to Christ and in relation to His filling all things ...
I think a different sense of things will come into your soul when you lay hold of the fact that what is going on now is with reference to that coming day. It will impart a heavenly dignity to everything you do here, because you are not achieving results for earth, nor for man, nor for time; you have something before you much greater than all that. You have before you the coming ages -- the administration of the fulness of times. You have before the vision of your soul Christ as the One who has ascended above the heavens and who is to fill all things, and you have the saints as united to Him.
{215}
And then we have the operation of the gifts now "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God". One has often been asked -- Is this arrival now or in the future? Well, if you speak of all the saints, it is in the future; but for you and me it ought to be now.
Rem. It is meant for all the saints now.
J.P. It is the one divine standard, for all the saints, the great ultimatum for every saint at all times, nothing less. We ought to have nothing less before us than arriving at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God.
Rem. In that way there would be the formation of the helpmeet morally.
J.P. Yes, it is so. It may seem a little difficult for our minds to take this up as applying to ourselves now, and here, though as to all saints we have to take it up in relation to the last moment.
Rem. The point is that there is a divine standard set up and we have to reach that.
J.P. Yes, it seems to me that the worse things get in an outward way, so much the more important and precious this becomes.
Rem. It is all the more needed.
J.P. It is on the principle of that wonderful statement in Isaiah, "When the adversary shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a banner against him" (@Isaiah 59: 19). Is there anything around us that seems to indicate the enemy coming in like a flood? That is the time to look for the standard, to look for the banner which the Spirit of God
{216}
has lifted up -- a divine standard, a rallying-point for the saints, when the enemy comes in like a flood. Do you think there will be more conflict? There may be, but that is not the point. The point is the divine standard. I know we are great hands for details and persons, and often, in those times when the enemy seems to be coming in, we look round at that one and the other one. But what we want is to keep our eyes on the divine standard, the divine banner. If you hear of this one or that one having gone off into a division, it is for want of this unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God.
Ques. Have you anything to say in connection with hearing the voice of Christ, because the standard that you have been referring to is brought about by the ministry of Christ through the gifts?
J.P. I think the test is what is stated here. There are three things stated in connection with the gifts. There is ministry among you --<br>Is it for the perfecting of the saints? <br>Is it with a view to the work of the ministry? <br>Is it with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ?
That is the test; it must be the test. Every man who takes any kind of a place in the way of ministry among the saints of God must come under that test.
Ques. Would you say the evangelist is for the saints?
J.P. Yes. The apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers are all in it. The test of the evangelist also is the perfecting of the
{217}
saints, the work of the ministry, the edifying of the body of Christ.
Some have got wrong ideas about evangelists. I am not an evangelist. I have been trying to preach the gospel for forty-six years, but I do not claim to be an evangelist. But one has sometimes to do the work of an evangelist, like Timothy (@2 Timothy 4: 5); a kind of maid-of-all-work. Men's idea of an evangelist now is a man thoroughly independent of every other man except himself!
Rem. That is not the unity of the faith.
J.P. No, indeed; every man's ministry, whatever his ministry may be, must come under the test. The best proof that I can give to any one that I have a gift from Christ is the fact that I so regard Christ, that I regard all that is so near and dear to Him. There could be nothing nearer to Him than His assembly -- it is His complement. It is as near to Christ as Eve was to Adam. "Ishshah" was derived from "Ish" (see footnotes *i* and *k*, @Genesis 2: 23); and so with the assembly; we are members of His body, we are quickened together with Him. That is a wonderful statement -- raised up together, made to sit down together. We could not be His body if we had not been quickened together with Him, raised up, and made to sit down in Him.
Ques. Is each one of the four gifts referred to here for the perfecting of the saints?
J.P. Every one, and for the edifying of the body. If God converts a sinner now, He converts him in view of putting that sinner in the body and building
{218}
up the body.
I can speak more feelingly, perhaps, than you can about these things. I have been a parson, and have been sent here and sent there, and have been told: 'Now, remember the great interests of our church; we want to build up our church'. Our humbug, I say now! It is *His* body. The best proof any one can give that he has got any gift from Christ is that he is concerned about Christ's body, interested in and devoted to the interests of the saints, and the ministry, and the edifying of the body of Christ.
Rem. Paul was a great evangelist: "that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (@Galatians 1: 16).
J.P. Whatever marked Christ in connection with the glad tidings, or with the church, must in some measure mark us; if not, there is something wrong. He loved the church and delivered Himself up for it (@Ephesians 5: 25).
Rem. The shepherding spirit should be in every saint.
J.P. Yes, it should be; but especially in those mentioned here as gifts given by the ascended Christ.
"The full-grown man". It is in order that we may be no longer babes, tossed and carried about -- like a little child who cannot stand very steady; you would not set it in a windy place where the wind might strike it and blow it over, though you might be able to keep your own feet there. We are exhorted to grow up in order that we may be "no longer babes,
{219}
tossed and carried about by every wind of *that* teaching which is in the sleight of men, in unprincipled cunning, with a view to systematised error".
We do well to ponder these words. Some of us have lived long enough to see saints blown over, carried about by this wind and that wind -- this or that teaching "which is in the sleight of men". "But" -- the Spirit of God always presents the other side -- "but, holding the truth in love". What a great thing that is! You do not want to hold it in anything else, do you? Well, how are you holding it? Are you holding it in a harsh, ungracious spirit, or are you holding it in love?
Love is not making friends with everybody. Love "does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth" (@1 Corinthians 13: 6). Speaking morally and spiritually, there is nothing that has such a backbone in it as love. It is not soft, gushing sentimentality. "Holding the truth in love, we may grow up to him in all things" -- that is the standard -- "who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love".
So there are two forms of edifying. There is the edification by the gifts, and there is the edification in the way just described. The saints, holding the truth in love, grow up to Him in all things, who is the Head. Then they edify themselves -- "to its self-building up in love". It is self-edification in love.
{220}
You may find a few saints here or there where there is no gift. You may ask them, Have you got any shepherds or teachers? No. Any evangelists? No. How, then, are you getting on? I know how some of them get on. Meetings are not so thick in America as they are in Great Britain in some places. But in many there is edification. They not only hold on their way, but they are being built up, they are self-edified.
May the Lord be pleased, beloved brethren, to give us the light of these things in our souls, and to give us the encouragement of them in a day like this!

HOLY EMOTIONS
R. Besley
@Mark 1: 41; @Mark 6: 34; @Mark 7: 34; @John 11: 33 - 35; @Luke 22: 44; @Hebrews 2: 9
The thought I had in reading these scriptures was to refer to the Lord's feelings. I believe the Lord had more intense feelings than anyone, and we should be like Him as having holy emotions.
But we have to distinguish in ourselves feelings of mere sentiment from spiritual emotions, or feelings. As in everything, the nearer we are to the Lord, the more we shall be like Him. The day is not far distant when we shall be wholly like Him; what a day; what a prospect, that we are going to be like Him, like Him in everything! Even the countenances of the saints, varied as they will be no doubt, may
{221}
well bear some likeness to the face of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord would have us like Him now, and I desire to dwell on the loveliness of these thoughts for the refreshing of our souls, and the delight of our hearts.
I refer first to the incident in Mark in chapter 1, where the leper appeared before the Lord, and it says He was moved with compassion. He was *moved*; it does not say He had compassion only -- He was moved with it. I understand that to mean that the deep emotions of His soul were moved; for the Lord refers to His soul, He says elsewhere, "My soul is very sorrowful" (@Matthew 26: 38).
I believe the leper represents mankind in its sinfulness. And when Jesus beheld this He was moved with compassion. The state of humanity today in the world is certainly no better. Certain features may appear in greater degree at different times, but the state, the sinful state of humanity from the fall down to now, and as long as man is here on the earth in sinfulness, is the same. When the Lord beheld the leper, it says He was moved with compassion. I understand that viewing mankind in sinfulness, we should be moved. We should not regard the need without feeling, and indeed I am sure of this, that the nearer we are to God, in that measure shall we be moved.
You may say that God has intervened in Christ. He has indeed, but the state of humanity is a spectacle that ought to move us. The Lord put forth His hand and touched the leper; not recoiling from him,
{222}
but reaching out His hand to identify Himself in grace with him. Marvellous thing, that He, the Holy One of God, the true and real Man, put out His hand to identify Himself in grace with such a state! No sooner had that hand touched the leper than the state that was there vanished; no doubt looking on to that moment when He would take it all up Himself in His death and remove it for ever from the eye of God. And ultimately He will remove evil from the universe.
As we have these feelings kindred to His own, I judge we shall put forth a hand; lifting up a holy hand. The apostle enjoins that prayer is to be made for all men, kings, rulers and those in authority. It would help us in preserving a true evangelical spirit, if we knew what it was to have sinful humanity in view, and if we were moved with compassion. If we were all putting forth a hand to pray, and if there were these holy feelings, what would God not do? They belong properly to a Christian because he is of Christ, and the thing was set forth there in Him in all its supreme loveliness.
What a thing, if in the opening of the day we looked out on the world and thought of the state of man as God's creature! Jesus looked upon him as God's creature, mutilated, indeed, and as He looked upon him He was moved with compassion. Oh! that we might know something of that, as being with Him, to have feelings that found their source in the heart of God, and expressed themselves in Him for humanity.
With regard to the next incident, He saw the
{223}
crowd, and it says He was moved with compassion "because they were as sheep not having a shepherd". I want you to observe the word the Spirit uses. It says He had compassion, He was *moved*, and as we look out on the great mass who have in more or less degree been brought into touch with Him, for that is the setting here, we shall surely be moved too. These people were in relation to Him. And as moved with compassion He taught them and He fed them. The leper came from a distance, probably having no previous link with Him at all.
I feel that the great mass of people who have been brought into touch professionally, not vitally, with Christ, are today as sheep without a shepherd. They have not got a living link with God, and we should feel for them. Divine feelings were expressed in Jesus when He was here, and divine feelings should now be expressed in us, for we are here as continuing on the earth in our measure what appeared in all its beauty and blessedness in Him.
These holy feelings of compassion, beloved, would serve a great end in softening the heart, and bringing us out of all narrowness and selfishness. We should have a heart as wide in its embrace as the heart of Christ, for we are apt to become insular, and while having an outlook as large as Christ, we should have a path as narrow as His. No one was so separate in this world as Christ, and yet no one looked out on such a wide area in the compassions of His heart as He.
He was moved! It needs prayer. It is a great
{224}
moment when the heart is spiritually moved by God. This is not human sentiment, it is spiritual feeling. We need to get an outlook, not on the side of need, for the Lord's outlook was from God, not from the side of the need. And He was moved with compassion, and He taught them and He fed them. He could feed five thousand men besides women and children.
Our compass may be small, but we should be on that line, as moved with compassion, and able to teach, and able to feed -- the person next to us perhaps as we are at work. There are scores of needy people around us. Alas! we feel our inability; largely, perhaps, because we know so little of what it is to be moved with compassion as He was.
You might say we have so little to give; what had He to give at the beginning? He has but five loaves, a loaf for a thousand, but as having recourse on God, on the eternal resources of His heart, they were fed to the full, and there was abundance to spare. There are these persons here, and in neighbouring towns, and everywhere we live, without a shepherd. And the Lord said to His disciples, "Give *ye* them to eat" (@Mark 6: 37)! It is not said that *they* had compassion; evidently they had none, for they desired that the people should be sent away. What a reproach, alas! that it should have to be said, but *He* was moved with compassion, and He taught them and He fed them.

CHRIST SITTING
W. R. Mason
@Colossians 3: 1 - 4; @Malachi 3: 1 - 4; @Mark 14: 60 - 64
These scriptures speak of the Lord Jesus as sitting: "sitting at the right hand of God", sitting "as a refiner and purifier of silver" and "sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven". It is wonderful to think of the Lord Jesus sitting. When He was with His own down here He went up into the mountain, as recorded in @Matthew 5, "and having sat down ... and, having opened his mouth, he taught them" (verse 2). It was His delight to be found sitting in the circle of His own, serving them and bringing out the great truths of God which He had come to announce. But when His work was done, then He could sit above: "Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet" (@Psalm 110: 1).
It is very interesting to notice in Scripture the things which God, prophetically, said to Christ, His beloved Son. The Psalms contain quite a number of those remarkable exchanges between divine Persons. As come into manhood, God could say to Him, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee" (@Psalm 2: 7). That was the first time that the Father could speak in that way to a Man on earth; Jesus was at that point just a Babe, yet the feelings of God go out through those words, "Thou art my Son". How the Father delighted to have One to whom He could speak thus, "*I* this day have begotten thee".
We read of God as the One who "is seated of old"
{226}
(@Psalm 55: 19). Daniel presents the Ancient of days, sitting in judgment: "thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit" (@Daniel 7: 9). I think there is great dignity in the thought of a divine Person sitting, and it is a contrast, too, to the old economy when the priest stood to do his work. There were no seats in the tabernacle; the priests just went in there every day to perform their service and come out again.
There was the day of atonement each year when the high priest went into the holiest of all; once a year he went within the veil, but there was no seat there. He came out again when he had sprinkled the blood on the mercy-seat and before it. But Jesus, "having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" (@Hebrews 1: 3). He is sitting -- a testimony to a completed work.
In Colossians, the apostle is enjoining believers to "seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God". It is an injunction to those who have been raised with the Christ. Christians are persons looked upon as risen with Christ. Reference was made this afternoon to baptism, and in it we have the figure of the believer's death with Christ, and his resurrection with Christ. We have not only been buried with Him but we have been raised with Him through faith of the working of God who raised Him from among the dead. That is what your baptism meant. You were put away according to one order, the old order of manhood that failed God; you are buried with Christ
{227}
in baptism and raised with Him, come up out of the waters again, raised with Him by faith of the working of God, into a new order of things. A whole new order of interests and pleasures for evermore is available to you. That is christian standing, properly. We are raised with the Christ as a matter of faith but soon it will be literal. All our dear brethren who are in the graves, will be raised up when Christ comes again and taken to glory with Him. But now we pass out of this world as a sphere of enjoyment, a sphere in which our hearts do not find a home. All that is left behind us; the death of Christ has cut us off from it, and we are raised with Him now because our affections have been captivated by the blessed Man who died for us, and where *He* is we want to be.
So we are raised with Him by faith and a new world has come into view which is all-absorbing. The apostle says, as it were, to the Colossians, 'This is true of you. Get on with it. Seek the things which are above; there are plenty of them. Your life would not be long enough to seek them all out'. They all relate to a glorious Man sitting at God's right hand. Redemption's work is accomplished for He has made purification of sins: "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins" (chapter 1: 14). Through Him we have the reconciliation and we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and soon He will bring about the reconciliation of all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth. All will be reconciled through the blood of His cross to the fulness of the Godhead (chapter 1: 19, 20). Now
{228}
Jesus has accomplished that work judicially. It is only a matter of time till the whole scene is brought into order again and all lawlessness dispelled from it. He is now at the right hand of God!
Oh! how blessed to be occupied with perfection. All around we see the ruin of man's world, the ruin of the race, the degradation into which it has plunged. Think of the days in which we are living when moral standards are being surrendered on every hand! Many people will not do an honest day's work for a day's pay. Pilfering, immorality, drug addiction, crime of all kinds and suicides are on the increase in the so-called civilised world, all due to man's will and the rejection of Christianity. How precious it is to have an Object outside of all this in which there is nothing but undiminished and abiding perfection, 'Divine perfection in a Man!' as we sing (`20:4). All is there where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. What wonderful things surround Him! What wonderful things He has in His keeping to administer to those who are interested! Oh! that is the great thing, to get saints interested in those things, to get their interest off the things of this world and to get their affections centred on what is at the right hand of God, where the Christ is.
What do you think Christ is interested in now? He is a very active Person, even though sitting there. He is the true Joseph, administering a whole dispensation for God and bringing in myriads of Gentiles, until the fulness of the nations be come in (@Romans 11: 25). Then He will turn His attention to His
{229}
earthly people Israel -- after they have turned to Him in repentance -- He will turn to the race from which as a Man He sprang, great David's greater Son, and He will attend to all their interests and bring them back again to all that God promised them in their great patriarchal father Abraham.
In the meantime He is greatly interested in the assembly, His body down here, and in every member of it; He has personal interest in us, beloved brethren. We are gathered here today because of the interest of this blessed Man, sitting at the right hand of God. However we came to be here, the Lord saw to it that we are here that we might be assured of His personal interest in every one of us. Sometimes even Christians lose interest in one another. Oh! God forbid that I should be disinterested in any Christian in this city. I know there are many not interested in me, but that is no excuse for my disinterest.
We must be revived in interest in everything that belongs to Christ. Can you make it better by one little bit? Can you improve it? Can you increase its happiness, its effectiveness, its availability for the Master's use? Oh! how much there is to do. The Lord would point out to us tasks to do; and what your hand finds to do, do it with your might (@Ecclesiastes 9: 10). He is sitting there, but He is surrounded by great interests. His heart is full of interest for His body here, for the house of God, its prosperity and protection; for the work of the Lord, the work of the glad tidings; for the shepherding of saints that we might all go on to full growth.
{230}
Think of the great things of the purpose of God in sonship that are in mind for the saints; the inheritance of the saints in light; the reconciliation of all things; the glory of new creation. These are all things that are above, morally above the level of this world. They could not fit into this world. Oh! let us seek them, beloved brethren. Let us give the rest of our time to seeking these precious things which relate to the heavenly Man who is sitting at the right hand of God!
The way to develop your interest is to take care of your mind. Peter tells us that our minds have loins. Did you ever think of that? Your mind has loins, that is, affections, the lower affections. Peter says, "having girded up the loins of your mind, be sober and hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace which will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 1: 13).
Paul says, "have your mind on the things that are above". It does not mean that you do not attend to your housework or your business or your school studies -- all these things have to be taken care of; but the overriding interest and occupation of your mind is to be the things above. Your affections are captivated by the Man who is there, and you have your mind on the things above; you are set, you are fixed; that is your great absorbing interest. Now all the other things will fall in line and find their rightful place, because we have to be righteous in our doings and in our walk down here and nothing is to be neglected that should be attended to; and I think
{231}
we will attend to them all the better the more we have our mind on the things above, because up there all is perfection, all is peace and calm and unalloyed joy. Oh! to have the mind occupied with a scene like that while in such a scene as we live in. How energising it is! How it helps us to overcome and to persevere in the testimony, not to lose hope, not to lose heart but to hold fast what we have that no one take our crown (@Revelation 3: 11).
Paul then says, "not on the things that are on the earth". I do not think the apostle means us to be neglectful of requisite things down here, but he is saying, 'Do not make them your object. Have your mind on the other things, the superior things'. For, he says, "Ye have died" -- that is baptism, you have died and you have been buried -- "and your life is hid with the Christ in God". That is it! Jesus is up there, dwelling in the affections of God and we are dwelling in Him. He, typically, has gone within the veil and has the names of all His saints on the breastplate and on the shoulder-pieces of the high priestly ephod, and they are there represented perpetually before the face of God. Our life is hid with Him. Jesus is thinking all the time of every saint, bearing them in His affections before God. Oh! to be in the gain of that. How it helps us to retreat from this scene of strife and turmoil, just to get in there to learn something of the warmth of the Father's heart! Jesus carries us on His breast right before the face of God. Our "life is hid with the Christ in God". Soon we will be manifested with Him, as it says here,
{232}
"When the Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall *ye* also be manifested with him in glory".
We are not in glory now; we are in bodies of humiliation in this world; we dwell in an earthly tabernacle house. Soon we shall put on the house from heaven, as it says, "a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" (@2 Corinthians 5: 1). When we have put on that blessed abode, we shall be manifested with Him in glory, and the sons of God, as they come out with Him, will make a tremendous impact on this scene. The creature shall be liberated from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God (@Romans 8: 21). That will be the effect of the appearing of the saints with Christ in glory.
Now, as to Malachi where we have, prophetically, an allusion to the way the Lord will appear in the coming day to purify His harvest, to separate the chaff from the wheat, to gather the wheat into His garner and burn the chaff with fire unquenchable (@Matthew 3: 12). Here He is spoken of as coming suddenly to His temple, and this must, as all Scripture must, have a present application to us as to the way that the Lord visits His people at the present time to purify and refine them. "The Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple". That is the greatness of Christ in His authority coming into the sphere where divine light is shining; and we are in a remarkable sphere of light in these days, beloved. The light is shining throughout Christendom, but the Lord comes into this situation in His sovereignty and
{233}
in His wisdom to purify His people. He is "the Lord whom ye seek", "the Angel of the covenant". Thank God for the Mediator of the new covenant (@Hebrews 9: 15; @Hebrews 12: 24)! How great Christ is! He has brought the love of God, and all the blessings of God, to us through His death. His death has opened up the will of the Testator, a will of unalloyed blessing, with no ifs, no conditions; it is all unconditional blessing from the divine side. God is saying, 'I will ... I will ... I will ...' They all have been unfolded in the blessings of the covenant. Christ is the Mediator. "Whom ye delight in" -- I hope this can be said of us -- "The Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in". The Father delights in Him, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3: 17). Oh! that we might find increasing delight in Him. We sometimes sing,
<blockquote> 'And to know the blessed secret <br> Of His preciousness to Thee' (`277:6). </blockquote>

CHRIST'S FEELINGS TOWARDS THE SAINTS EXPRESSED IN PAUL
A. J. Gardiner
@2 Corinthians 13: 11 - 14; @Colossians 4: 7 - 18
Then Paul brings in "the love of God" (@2 Corinthians 13: 14). The love of God is like a rock, it stands true in everything and sure for ever. Nothing can separate us from the love of God. "Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor
{234}
things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (@Romans 8: 38, 39). It is a kind of home we can all retire into. The world knows nothing of it. It belongs to the saints. The very thought of it should draw us together, and it does so, to think we have part together in these things that the world knows nothing of.
"And the communion of the Holy Spirit". We know something of the blessedness of that at a reading meeting when the Lord helps us; we are conscious of the communion of the Holy Spirit, we are partaking together happily in the things of the Spirit. The Spirit is operating and making divine things real and living amongst us, and we are partaking in it, and we are to increase in that more and more; it is proper to the assembly. The apostle says, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all". These are his feelings as expressed toward the Corinthians and toward us all in the local settings in which we are as in the presence of hades¬ gates. All these resources are available to us so that we may be rejoicing, may be of one mind, and live in peace; and we shall find that God, known as the God of love and peace, will be with us.
When we come to Colossians, the apostle is writing to the saints not viewed exactly as in a local setting, but more as holy and faithful brethren in Christ who were marked by faith in Christ Jesus and
{235}
love towards all the saints, and he introduces one after another, all marked by different spiritual features, for their encouragement.
He says, "Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-bondman in the Lord, will make known to you all that concerns me; whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he might know your state, and that he might encourage your hearts" (verses 7, 8). He is sent to them for the purpose, primarily, that he should declare to them all that concerned Paul. All this is most interesting, as showing the mutual feelings subsisting between the apostle and the saints; that he counted upon them to be interested to hear about him, and he on his part would be most interested to hear about them.
So he sends Tychicus to them, whom he commends to them as a beloved brother and faithful minister, one prepared to do anything in the service, a fellow-bondman in the Lord. How beautiful all these things are. It is a great stimulus to us, dear brethren, to be able to take account of the work of God in one another, and specially to see it in a wider way than what is merely local. By all means let us know and value one another locally. That is an important feature in binding us together; in fact I know of no other way to esteem others better than ourselves than by concentrating our attention on the work of God in each other. It is the only way to do it. We may look on someone and say, That sister is a great deal more patient than I am; and another brother is a great deal more faithful in testimony among men than I am;
{236}
and someone else is more devoted than I am. You feel these things as you look on one another and take account of the work of God in them. Paul says in @Philippians 2: 3, "in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves".
This is a most important element if we are to go on happily and unitedly, and the secret of it is to fix our attention on the work of God in one another, and if need be, to ask the Lord to open our eyes to see it. Paul speaks in this beautiful way of Tychicus. Tychicus seems, from this epistle to the Colossians and also the epistle to the Ephesians, to be one particularly near to the apostle, able to show the Colossians how Paul was getting on. And he would also ascertain for the apostle's information, how the Colossians were getting on, and further he would encourage their hearts.
Then Paul brings in Onesimus, whom he calls, "the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you". You can see how Paul is fixing his eyes on the work of God in one and another. Onesimus, the runaway slave of Philemon had been converted and brought into touch with Paul while Paul was in bonds at Rome. He belonged to Colosse, we may assume that Philemon lived at Colosse by comparing this with the epistle to Philemon. There seems to be no doubt that the two epistles were written at the same time and conveyed at the same time, probably by Onesimus himself.
So Paul says, "Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you". He had not been
{237}
that when the Colossians last saw him, but now he was to return to them as a faithful and beloved brother, "who is one of you". He would evidence amongst them the work of God who had taken up one from their very midst and converted him. We know how cheering it is when the work of God in an unlikely person in our midst comes to light in an unlikely way; how encouraging and stimulating it is to the hearts of the saints. Paul is not only ministering the truth, but bringing things to the notice of the brethren that will help to stimulate their interest in divine things, and link them on in their affections with the work of God outside their own locality as well as in it.
Then he says, "Aristarchus my fellow-captive". That is another commendation, suffering for the truth's sake with Paul. That is a great commendation. "And Mark, Barnabas's cousin, concerning whom ye have received orders, (if he come to you, receive him)". He is an evidence of recovering grace. Onesimus is expressive of the grace in the gospel to pick up an unlikely person and set him amongst the brethren, making him a faithful and beloved brother. Now, Mark, sister's son to Barnabas, is evidence of recovering grace. "(If he come to you, receive him,) and Jesus called Justus ... These are the only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me".
It is a good thing, beloved brethren, to fix our eye on the features of the work of God in one another, and on what God is doing, not only in our own
{238}
locality, but in every locality. It all helps to stimulate interest in what is going forward, and what is going forward is the truth of the assembly in all its features, and we are here for that very thing and for nothing else. When Peter confessed Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (@Matthew 16: 17). That is that God had wrought in Peter's soul and given him light as to Christ. So the Lord tells him he was blessed by reason of that fact, and that is true of every one here.
It may be that there are plenty of people we know who have no light in their souls as to Christ, and no appreciation of Him. How is it then that we have? Simply because God has operated sovereignly, and thus we can take account of ourselves as blessed, and rejoice in it. Why has He done it? After the Lord said that to Peter, He said, "*I* also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter". That is to say, You are a stone. God has not wrought in you in order that you should fritter your time away in the transient things of this life, but that you should fulfil your responsibility in relation to the assembly. That is what the Lord said to Peter, and that is what every one is to understand, that the sole reason we are here is to fill out our place in the assembly of God.
So the apostle brings forward these different features for their encouragement and joy. "And Jesus called Justus". I suppose he was one outstandingly known as righteous in all his ways, so he is surnamed
{239}
Justus. We all should be righteous, but some are outstandingly so, they have that reputation publicly, a very good feature. So it says, "who are of the circumcision. These are the only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me".
Then he comes down to a local brother. "Epaphras, who is one of you, the bondman of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God". You might say, Epaphras had a high standard before him, and he had, dear brethren, and the Lord has a high standard before Him, and God has a high standard before Him, and God is going to reach it. Let us be with Him in it. This can be filled out by any one in any locality. Epaphras was a local brother, "one of you", not exactly brought forward as an outstanding gift although a servant of Christ, and in the first chapter spoken of as a faithful minister of Christ and a beloved fellow-bondman (verse 7), but what characterised him was his earnest prayer for the saints in his own locality that they might "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God".
What is the reason for telling us this? Is it to no purpose? If I know that one brother or sister in my locality is constantly day and night praying fervently that we in that locality might stand perfect and complete in all the will of God, is it not intended that it should start an inquiry on my part as to what the will of God is for the saints, and what it means, to stand perfect and complete in it? That is what is intended,
{240}
that we should have our faces in the one direction with nothing else before us than what is perfect and complete according to all the will of God. That involves every feature of the truth of the assembly. That is the will of God for the present moment.
Then he brings in Luke: "Luke, the beloved physician, salutes you". He is one whose influence would be healing, binding, a comforting influence, a brother who always kept himself out of sight, always in the background, content to be one of the 'we' that we hear of in Acts; hiding himself behind Paul and his company, but going along with Paul and supporting him to the last, as it says in @2 Timothy 4: 11, "Luke alone is with me". He goes right through with Paul to the very end.
"Luke, the beloved physician", Paul says, "salutes you, and Demas". It is most sorrowful the way he says, "and Demas". He has nothing to say about him. Not long afterwards he writes about Demas and says, "Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age" (@2 Timothy 4: 10). Paul had to say that not long after he wrote this epistle. Here, we might safely say, Paul was sensing something of that sort, and so he says, "and Demas". He wanted to be included in the salutation and Paul includes him, but says nothing about him. It would be with sorrowful feelings that Paul added, "and Demas". There are sensibilities amongst the saints -- "the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one" (@1 Corinthians 2: 15). You can almost sense the feeling of sorrow that the apostle Paul had as he just said, "and Demas".
{241}
Then Paul says, "Salute the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly which is in his house ... And say to Archippus". First of all they are to see that this epistle is read at Laodicea, and the epistle to be sent from Laodicea is to be read at Colosse, showing the importance of intercommunication and of seeing that anything of spiritual value is passed on and circulated and shared. 'Pass on this epistle to Laodicea and see that you read the one from Laodicea'.
Then he says, "say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it". It says in @Ephesians 4: 7, "to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ". Every one has received something, whatever it is; whatever we are fitted for in relation to the testimony, take heed that we fulfil it. It would seem that Archippus had received definite gift, and the brethren were to use their influence to urge him not to fail in his responsibility regarding it.
"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul. Remember my bonds". There is this touching appeal for sympathy and affection on the part of the saints with Paul, and all that he stands for -- he stands for the truth of the assembly in relation to Christ and in relation to God, and all that enters into it. Paul stands for that, and he wants us to be thoroughly sympathetic with the heavenly truth that he ministered.
I have called attention to these two passages simply as illustrative, I believe, of the feelings of Christ
{242}
toward us as reflected in Paul. May we be stimulated to answer to His desires for us, for His name's sake.

HOLY EMOTIONS
R. Besley
@Mark 1: 41; @Mark 6: 34; @Mark 7: 34; @John 11: 33 - 35; @Luke 22: 44; @Hebrews 2: 9
Well now, passing on to the incident in @Mark 7, the man that was deaf and speechless, you will notice that it is said that he came from the coasts of Decapolis, which means 'ten cities', and I suppose may refer in Mark's gospel to the actual condition of the professing element on earth, which in a formal way carried on the work of teaching and feeding. The man was deaf, and he could not speak right; I suppose meaning that he was unable to articulate; his utterances were a confusion of unintelligent sounds. And they bring this man to the Lord, and He took him aside out of the crowd, showing how the Lord reaches an individual in the great professing mass.
We are in the days when a mass of profession has taken on christian teaching and work. The State church has presumed to take on christian teaching, as its thirty-nine articles show, and the holy ordinances -- baptism, the Lord's supper. All these things show that the teaching has been taken up professionally. That is the state of professing Christianity, and yet, alas! there is *deafness*. Those divine communications, that have come in the power of the Spirit
{243}
since Pentecost, are not heard. It is a serious matter that the great professing mass of Christians are without ability to hear ...
Now the Lord today, as He was in that day, is taking individuals aside and working in them. What a flood of light would come in if such a thing could be that there was repentance everywhere, and a turning to God. But I know that apostasy is increasing, and that it will increase until there is intensified darkness -- no hearing and no speaking according to God.
Now the Lord comes in and calls the person aside, and "he groaned". The word is *groaned*, a deeper thing than a sigh. These are His feelings. In the next chapter, when they ask for a sign, it says He groaned *deeply* (chapter 8:12, footnote *e*). Think of our precious Lord having feelings like this! I ask you, How much do we feel? It comes as a challenge to us and makes us ashamed how little we feel. It is because there is little ability to hear the communications from heaven.
Thank God, some of us know a little of what it is to receive communications from heaven, living words from on high in the power of the Spirit from an exalted Christ, the Head of the church. Where are the professing bodies drifting to? To apostasy; and in view of that state of things it says that He groaned. Oh! for such emotions amongst the saints; oh! to be given such feelings! There is a time to weep, as feeling these things in the place where His name is. That is what the Lord felt. Decapolis portrayed that in figure, the region of responsibility, ten cities.
{244}
And He groaned, and it says that He put His fingers to his ears and spat and touched his tongue. The Lord intended that there should be complete identification with the man. It is not a *hand*, but *fingers*, a detailed touch. He put *them* to those ears. Dear brethren, where are we in regard of this? what about those feelings and touch? Those who know them are those who will be used of God to release the ears of those bound with deafness. May God give us such feelings; may He work in us to produce them, so that we know what it is to groan, and to sigh, in the presence of such things.
Now further it is said that He spat and touched his tongue. He was identified with the Lord now as implying that he was hereafter to speak. And we should speak as He speaks: "If any one speak -- as oracles of God" (@1 Peter 4: 11). Such utterances should be in the lips of the Christian. What words? Not only would he speak words, but a divine pronunciation; that is a thing to be prayed for, that is what the Lord intends ... We should be among those now, and there should be these deep emotions in the soul of the believer. The Lord would help, so that others might be brought out of that terrible state of deafness ...
Do you ever get communications in the night, when the doors of heaven are opened, as it were, and He speaks to you? Do you not want to know more about it, and have a heart to feel the state of things around? May the Lord so work that we *know* something of what that groan is, so that He can take us up
{245}
and use us.
Now I pass on from that to the thought in @John 11, and I want to show what the experience of the believer is in sorrow and bereavement. This is the experience of the *believer*. It is not now professional, it is the circle of those that are His, and sorrow comes in. Sorrow comes in to us all. We *know* what the bitter sorrow of bereavement is. It might have been said that when the Lord touched the leper no one knew of the compassion of His heart, but when Mary *saw* those tears fall on His blessed face she *knew* what He felt. Jesus "was troubled" (footnote *b*, or 'shuddered'); it showed His intense feelings for His own.
I want you to understand that you have the preciousness of the Lord's sympathy in sorrow. It is not that He feels *for* you, He does that; but He does infinitely more, He feels *with* you. "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus" (verse 5). And He spoke beautifully of him; "*our* friend" (verse 11), not your friend, not mine, but our friend Lazarus. The Lord felt this bereavement, and the depth of His feelings was shown in His tears truly, but what is stated by the Spirit of God, as showing us what was in His heart, is that He groaned and shuddered. Such is the intensity of the Lord's feelings, and we should in our measure have these feelings for His bereaved and sorrowing people.
It is a terrible thing to have to face death as breaking in upon the circumstances of the people of God. It is a terrible thing to see a parent taken away,
{246}
a wife, a precious child taken away. Do we know what it is to groan for others -- to feel these things, and in presence of death to *shudder*? But you may say that the loved ones are only asleep; you may say that death is vanquished. Yes; but *death is there*. The saints are viewed as having fallen asleep, but they are also referred to as "the dead in Christ" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 16), and death is a serious thing. I am sure that the Lord would have us *feel* these things. You say, He was there "the resurrection and the life" (@John 11: 25); one word from Him and the dead would come out of the sepulchre. Yes, true; nevertheless *He* groaned and shuddered. Such were His feelings; such is the heart of the precious One we love. He is the same today, and we have His sympathy, and He would have us take in the full blessedness of it.
Now I pass from that to the passage in @Luke 22. You will note that the character of the feelings of Christ as we pass on are becoming *intensified*. He had compassion on one man, then He had compassion on the multitude, then it is said He groaned, and in the other passage in John it says He groaned and shuddered. Here, in Luke, in Gethsemane Jesus is in the presence of the power of Satan which was against Him, and the intensity of His devotion to pursue the path of the will of God. It caused Him to pray "more intently". That is a remarkable word. You might say that the Lord always prayed intently; I believe He did. There are times when we may pray with a measure of listlessness, but He always prayed intently. At this time He prayed *more* intently, and
{247}
the intensity of His feelings was shown in that His sweat "became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth".
Now there are times in the history of the believer, and there are times in the history of meetings, when Satan is directly against us. We know something of it, and it calls for intently waiting upon God in prayer. The Lord ever stands unique in this character of things, for the intensity of our feelings will never be what His were, for the attack upon Him in its volume was beyond description. His intensity of devotion to the will of God was such that He prayed more intently and His feelings were shown in this sweat as of great drops of blood. The description is wonderful; not only sweat as it were great drops of blood, but *falling down to the earth*.
There are some who seem to be the peculiar subjects of Satanic attack, and certain gatherings appear to be specially selected by the enemy. Now what are we going to do; are we going to yield, or will the depth of our feelings be expressed in intensified prayer together? We have the Lord with us as One who has passed on to the right hand of God. We have sympathy from that heart, beloved! May the Lord give us grace as having such intense feelings to stand true whatever may happen. How often disaster comes in because we give way.
Now one word more with regard to His death. Quite a remarkable word is used Hebrews; it speaks of "the *suffering* of death". It speaks of the Lord as a Person of the Godhead in manhood. It says He took a
{248}
place lower than the angels for the suffering of death.
Now I am speaking of the suffering of Christ in death. It was the moment of the intensest feelings which He had. He endured *the suffering* of death alone. You might say, He was great enough to meet it all. He was indeed! The side is given in John's gospel of what He was as a Person of the Godhead in humanity, passing into the domain of death, and it fled before Him -- He rose again!. But there is also the side *of suffering*: "for the suffering of death". We shall never fully know what He suffered in His infinite love to God and to us. We cannot form any conception of what that moment was when He entered into the suffering of death. May the sense of it exalt Him in our affections!
But there is this to be said: *we* may have to die here, and every saint knows what it is at some time in his history to feel a natural recoiling from death. I want you to understand that though the believer dies, he will never *see* death. "If any one shall keep my word, he shall never see death" (@John 8: 51). But there is the other side, and I believe every believer knows what it is to face that hour. You go in the triumph of your soul as knowing Christ risen, and by His having tasted death for you, you are on the other side of it. But if you have any fear in your heart in view of death, you have the sympathy of Christ, as having entered into the suffering of death. And when you have to pass over, if He does not come for us, He will be beside you. There is not a saint that falls asleep but the Lord is with him, and the One who
{249}
endured the suffering of death will be with you, and you will know the sympathy of the heart of Jesus. How wonderful to go out in triumph; to be taken over by Him who tasted the suffering of death Himself!
May the Lord give us to grasp these things more fully, for His own name's sake!

"TAKE HEED WHAT YE HEAR"; "TAKE HEED ... HOW YE HEAR"
J. B. Stoney
@Mark 4: 24, 25; @Luke 8: 18
It is inconceivably gracious of the blessed God, that He should so freely and fully give us His word that we may understand His mind. On the other hand, it is deplorable to see the levity with which this great favour is accepted; and yet it is as we "hear" that we receive. "For whosoever has, to him shall be given" (@Matthew 13: 12). The more fully and freely God has made know His mind, as we see in our own day, the more it is perverted by the ignorant and unbelieving, and, even when truly accepted, it is by many so qualified and humanised that it has neither edge nor weight in the soul.
In former days Aaron was to "speak for thee unto the people" (@Exodus 4: 16), and propounded the word of God at the dictation of Moses; yet we find, so little did it rule him, that while Moses was in the mount with God, Aaron was making a calf for the
{250}
people (@Exodus 32: 1 - 6).
If we look around us in Christendom, we see that man's imitation of divine work is that every candidate for the ministry must be prepared, and ordained for that sacred service. I refer to this only to show that religious man has a sense of the gravity of being a servant of God. Now, where there is more reality, and even true zeal, there is often a great lack of gravity in entering on the Lord's service. A young man of piety and zeal tries how he can preach, and if he can arrest souls, satisfies himself that he is called of God; but he may have no real idea of being "sent", or of the message. "How shall they preach unless they have been sent?" (@Romans 10: 15).
There are, as far as I see, three classes of preachers, *the first class* like Ahimaaz (@2 Samuel 18: 19 - 30) *is neither sure of being sent, nor of the message*. In general, the gospel of this class does not go beyond the superiority of Christ as a sacrifice to the Paschal lamb, or to any of the offerings under the law. Therefore the chief point of their preaching is pressing on the sinner the necessity of having Christ as a sacrifice for his sins before God; there is seldom any light as to how God has wrought from Himself. There is an idea of the atonement in the blood of Christ, but no idea of reconciliation.
Reconciliation is not taught in the Old Testament and the word 'atonement' does not occur in the New Testament. Though souls get assurance of salvation from this preaching, they do not get acceptance; it cannot lead them beyond trusting in the blood; they
{251}
try to live conscientiously, but they have not full peace; if they have seasons of joy, they have also seasons of depression, and this often goes on to the end of their lives without their making any advance. With the preachers themselves there is seldom advance, for the measure they mete is measured to themselves; and instead of their path being as "the shining light, going on and brightening until the day be fully come" (@Proverbs 4: 18), they seem to grow darker, and with really less enjoyment at the end.
With *the second class* of preachers, *the main point is pressing on their hearers the forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ*. These know justification -- they preach Christ risen as the receipt for the debt paid -- that He was "delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification" (@Romans 4: 25). Many of their converts, being justified by faith and having received the Spirit, have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. They rightly press the work of God's grace, that it is all His own work. This is objective truth, and most important in its place. It is what we must begin with, but many do not get beyond it, and if they do not, they do not enjoy the deliverance which the Spirit of God would effect in their souls if they truly sought it.
But, instead of seeking true deliverance, they assume to have it by the reckoning of faith, and that because God sees them clear from the old man in the cross, that they are clear from him themselves. Thus by this delusion they lose practically the work of the Spirit in them, and unless awakened from it, they do
{252}
not advance beyond the fact that God clears them by His own mighty grace, which is, of course, the beginning of all blessing. They read the word and find that all is theirs because they belong to Christ, but they are not in the power and enjoyment of it; they see all the purposes of God's sovereign grace, and speak of them in that way; but as far as I know they are not in the enjoyment of the condition which His grace bestows.
There is consistency in this, because if they have refused the first work of the Spirit, which is deliverance, by assuming that they have it already, they cannot advance in the work of the Spirit. They may cultivate everything that is good, and benevolent, and be very demonstrative in brotherly love, but they do not seem to increase in the enjoyment of the purpose of God for them. To know Christ as Head, is made a matter of knowledge and doctrine, instead of association with Him; and likewise the truth of union is spoken of as something to be learned, instead of being realised as led by the Spirit into union with Christ. Thus, though the start was good, they do not seem to advance; there is really no enjoyment beyond the gospel, because of the imperfect way they have apprehended the truth.

THE HEAVENLY MERCHANT
C. M. Menzies
@Matthew 13: 45
It is striking that the Lord Jesus in wondrous grace deigned to speak of Himself parabolically as a Merchant. When we think of His merchant dealings, how different from the sharp practices of this world -- all with Him would be as "current with the merchant" (@Genesis 23: 16) and weighed according to balances of equity. This Merchant came seeking goodly pearls. Solomon had enquired, "Who can find a woman of worth? for her price is far above rubies" (@Proverbs 31: 10).
In @Matthew 13 we have the answer to Solomon's question. There was One who found her and was prepared to pay that price. He paid the full price, selling all, whatever He had, to buy that pearl. Christ loved the church and delivered himself up for it (@Ephesians 5: 25). Though rich, He became poor (@2 Corinthians 8: 9). He went into all the poverty of Calvary and died on that cross of shame to pay the purchase price and secure the church for Himself.
"One pearl of great value" suggests the unity and incalculable value of the church. The Lord alone could fully appraise it, and He has paid all. We may be asked, 'Where is unity today?' Alas, we see the outward profession broken into a thousand fragments, -isms and schisms, religious bodies and national bodies, but all in some way denying the unity of that one pearl. The heavenly ideal is "one pearl". Christ's prayer that all might be perfected into one is
{254}
to be answered (@John 17: 23). The heavenly city is to come down out of the heaven from God, one precious unity -- length, breadth and height all equal (@Revelation 21: 10, 16).
The second and third chapters of Revelation give us a history of the professing church from apostolic days to the present time. Throughout this sad history of breakdown in responsibility, we find there have been overcomers. In the case of Laodicea (chapter 3: 14 - 22), the Lord is outside. There in that church is all the assumption of wealth and religiousness, but Christ is outside. He counsels them to buy His wares. He offers "gold purified by fire", "white garments" and "eye-salve". In these days of boasted wealth, true riches are with this blessed Merchant, and incorruptible gold -- tried in the fire. The One who became poor for your sake will enrich you if you do but take His counsel and buy from Him. He offers white garments to cover nakedness. If we are to walk with Christ, it is in white. There are to be no dark marks of garments spotted by the flesh. It will cost us something, but how good it is to wear a white garment purchased from Him and to know that all is right between one's heart and Christ, that we have His approval as wearing apparel bought from Him.
Then He is selling eye-salve. There is no preparation like His. He Himself offers this healing, sight-giving balm. It is He who mixed the eye-salve for the blind man -- "he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle" (@John 9: 6); the mud which speaks of His humanity; the spittle, of His essential
{255}
Being; the washing pool -- "the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent" (verse 8) -- of His having been sent by His Father. Amid the blindness of Christendom, where blind leaders of the blind bring many into the ditch, let us invest in eye-salve sold by Him, the divine Merchant, and come seeing.
"Buy the truth, and sell it not" (@Proverbs 23: 23), said Solomon. Every bit of buying we do will cost something. It will call for the displacement of all that hinders our acquisition of the truth. Then having bought, do not let us part with our purchases, but "sell it not". We learn to know true values and to pay in spiritual currency for what is of Christ, as Paul when he reckoned as loss that which he had previously counted gain, that he might win Christ (@Philippians 3: 7, 8).

THE POTTER
G. W. Ware
When I was a boy, an old potter would say, 'Do you want to see me make a vessel?' Then he would put a lump of clay in the middle of the turntable and set the wheel going. The turntable would revolve, and he would mould and fashion the clay until a vessel was seen, rapidly increasing until it had reached its utmost capacity. Then he would take out his slice, and say, 'There is your vessel'.
It was a pleasure to me at the time to see the potter make it, and I have often since said to myself, 'I am on that turntable'. The Spirit of God would be
{256}
engaged so that every day that I remain on that turntable my capacity shall be enlarged; and the day shall come when the Holy Spirit will have finished, and He will take me off the Potter's table, and I shall go to be with Christ! May the Spirit of God form us and enlarge us increasingly under His hand. "Cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, house of Israel" (@Jeremiah 18: 1 - 6).
If the Spirit of God is going to enlarge me in the things of Christ, He always brings me back first of all to what is fundamental. He does not increase the superstructure until He has developed the foundations; this is in view of coming into the assembly of God, to pour forth praises to God in accord with the spirit of Christ; and that we might join in the songs that the blessed Lord Jesus Christ raises in the midst of the assembly (@Hebrews 2: 12).

TWO OF YOU
J. Taylor
@Matthew 8: 28 - 33; @Matthew 20: 30 - 34; @Matthew 21: 1 - 7; @Matthew 18: 19, 20
I selected these four passages from Matthew because they present a scriptural feature of the use of numerals. The Lord in Matthew deals with twos. You will find that these same incidents as recorded in the other evangelists contain only one of each of the couples spoken of. Matthew has in view that the world-system has proven itself reprobate and opposed to God and therefore must be broken up morally. It is not yet broken up by external power. That will come in its own time: "at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with the angels of his power, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings" (@2 Thessalonians 1: 7, 8).
We, who believe, understand that the Lord has the power to come out and take vengeance on those who know not God. It is appalling to take account how little God is known, but ignorance of God and disobedience of the glad tidings are culpable, and the Lord Jesus will come out, as we are told, in flaming fire, with the angels of His power, to take vengeance on all who know not God and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. But, as already remarked, Matthew has not only this in view, but the break-up of the world-system for believers at the present time; hence we have in this incident of the demoniacs an illustration of this very thing. There were two of them, which suggests collective power,
{258}
and they come out of the tombs, not out of the city, as in @Luke 8, but from the area of the dead, so to say; and they were exceeding dangerous, so that no one could pass by that way.
What is to be noted here is Satan's power in a combination which interferes with the right of legitimate journeying. Satan would thus challenge the rights of God. God had sent His servants, who were ill-treated and slain, and finally He sent His Son, and Him the husbandmen killed. This terrible deed was committed at Jerusalem. When on His way to that city a Samaritan village refused Him. It is said, "they did not receive him" (@Luke 9: 53), but that is not a question of danger: it may denote hatred, but a non-reception is not in itself an attitude of violence. The violence was at Jerusalem; Satan had power there and so it had slain the prophets and finally it slew the Lord Jesus. Paul says of them, "who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have driven us out by persecution" (@1 Thessalonians 2: 15).
Now that is what God deals with, according to Matthew. He will not brook the interference of satanic power in His right of way. He must have that right of way, and so the Lord breaks up this power. Wherever there is such a combination as this, whether in the world or in the assembly, there is material for satanic interference with the divine right of way. We have, therefore, to be on our guard against combinations, against twos and threes possessed by a common feeling and interest, as influenced by some current of feeling other than what is of Christ, for this
{259}
interferes with the divine right of way.
It is a serious thing for any to be dangerous to those who are on legitimate journeys as occupied in the Lord's service. The demons recognise the Lord, but not as Lord. Satan never recognises or owns Him as such. They address Him as the Son of God, but He gave the demons no quarters in these two men; He cast them out. In doing so, He allows them to enter into the swine: "and lo, the whole herd of swine rushed down", it says, "the steep slope into the sea, and died in the waters". The danger is thus disposed of at its source, as showing the Lord's power to effectually deal with evil. As I was saying, the Lord suffered in the place of danger; where also the prophets were slain, and Paul himself was seized. So that you see there was a danger spot, the outcome of a combination in which Satan had his part.
I mention all this so that we might take to heart any disposition to partisanship, however far removed from being intentional it may be. Wherever it exists, in whatever degree or form, it makes room for Satan and interferes with the rights of God. As already stated, He sent apostles, He sent prophets; He sends evangelists, pastors and teachers, and in doing so commands the right of way, and He will have it. Any partisanship active amongst the saints becomes a dangerous spot, so that servants of God are interfered with in their service and in the carrying out of the principles of the assembly. You cannot have such service under partisan conditions, so that Matthew, in recording these things, brings in twos, and,
{260}
as the ecclesiastical evangelist, he shows how the Lord deals with evil in a collective sense.
Now in @Matthew 20 you have two blind men. They are not demoniacally possessed, but are blind. If the combination be broken up, the next thing needed is light. The question is, What am I to do? If I have been supporting a brother in a partisan way and have come to see that this is wrong; if I have been acting blindly and have exposed myself to the enemy, what am I to do now? It is not a question of demons now, far otherwise, but rather of exercise coming into the soul which brings the sense into it that you have been influenced adversely, and now you want to know what to do.
Well, evidently you must have light and direction, and what you find, first of all, is that these two men have a sense of the Lord's dignity. You may be sure that as you are released from the danger area, whatever form that may have taken, you begin to respect the authority of the Lord; and so what you find here is that the two of them say, "Have mercy on us". Notice what follows: they say, "Lord, Son of David". The men in chapter 8 did not thus address Him, for Satan will never, of himself, recognise the lordship of Christ. He may say much about Christ as the Holy One, or the Son of God, but he never recognises Him as Lord, so that these men are not in the least degree influenced by the demons. They had respect for the Lord, which is the secret of deliverance from everything. It is as subject to Him that we get the Spirit, for Peter lays down as a great
{261}
dispensational principle, that God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Christ (@Acts 5: 32).
Think what it means to receive the Holy Spirit! Everything is bound up with it: eyesight and all else is involved in the reception of the Holy Spirit. These men have respect for the authority of Christ, who is the Lord, Son of David. They cry, "Have mercy on us", and although rebuked by the crowd that they might be silent, they cried out the more, using the same words; upon which the Lord stops. Wherever there is a cry like that, whatever the need, whether collective or individual (and I am speaking now from the collective side), the Lord will stop. He was on a journey; but was at no danger spot. He had passed that in the sense of which I am speaking. If there is thus a cry of need, you may be certain of it that He will stop on His way. It is a matter of deep importance to Him, so it says, "Jesus, having stopped". The Lord was on a definite journey, blessed be His name! He was going to Jerusalem to die, but there was a cry, a collective cry, mark you, a cry as it were, from a meeting, and He stood still.
In seeking to care for the saints, I believe we often let things drift too long. There was much to deter these two men from crying out to the Lord. The multitude would have stopped them. We know this should not have been done, and how much there is to hinder today! What is needed is courage. The need exists and is felt. "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David", they cried, and He stood still. He virtually says, I am deeply interested in this cry of need.
{262}
So now, He would adjust the differences of the little companies of His people. Indeed, He has charged Himself with that service. He says, "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (chapter 18: 20). For what purpose is He there? To help them. In chapter 18 it is not so much a question of privilege but rather of support; and it comes out as the result of the cry of two. "If two of you shall agree on earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" (verse 19). You see, it is the cry of two, as representative. They know the need that exists, they ask collectively and the Lord will stand still.
Divine interest manifests itself where a genuine cry of need is uttered collectively -- "Have mercy on us", and then they tell Him what is needed. Could you tell just what is needed in your locality, if the Lord were to appear there and ask you to make a request? You see, they are constrained to do it here: "Jesus ... called them and said, What will ye that I shall do to you?" The question is addressed to them collectively. They do not ask each other what answer to give, for they know the need. There are those who know, and such are with God. They are conscious of the need, and as soon as it is expressed, the need is met. They say, "Lord" -- it is a question of His authority and the power that He has to relieve -- "that our eyes may be opened".
Applying this to complicated local conditions, exercised saints would say, We want to know what
{263}
to do in these matters; we need direction, we are like blind men. Where there is exercise, the Lord will give light. In @Mark 8: 22 - 26 we have an illustration of this. He first spat upon the blind man's eyes, having led him out of the town of Bethsaida, and asked him if he saw ought. He says, "I behold men, for I see them, as trees, walking". It describes a state in which men who are prominent are before us. It is right that you should respect those that labour: "But we beg you, brethren, to know those who labour among you, and take the lead among you in the Lord, and admonish you, and to regard them exceedingly in love on account of their work" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 12, 13); but do not regard them unduly.
The Lord laid His hands on the man's eyes the second time and he saw all things clearly. That is to say, the landscape becomes perfectly clear. You see the trees, the hills, and every object in its true proportion. So it is as regards any particular difficulty. You see its different features clearly, as the result of the second touch, which involves the reception and recognition of the Spirit. It is this which enables you to see everything in its right relation.
I now go on to @Matthew 21. As we see all things clearly, there is that which the Lord can now use. A dark and divided state of things He cannot use, whatever the outward appearance may be. He wants unity of action, and so we find the ass and the colt. As previously remarked, the two are peculiar to this gospel. The suggestion is that there are the old brothers and the young brothers; they should be a source
{264}
of strength mutually. In millennial days there shall be old men and old women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem. (See @Zechariah 8: 3 - 8.) Think of the experience that these old persons will have! And then "the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof". What an evidence of life in the old and the young. How delightful! There will be no danger on the streets then. No need of a traffic squad in that day! The boys and the girls shall be perfectly immune from danger as they play in the streets of the city.
The old men and the old women, as stated, are there, "each one with his staff in his hand for multitude of days". I can understand a boy going up to an old man in those days and asking him what happened at the beginning of that wonderful time. Oh! he would say, it was a glorious moment when the Lord Jesus came out of heaven, right down to the earth. Many boys and girls would not see that, but how glad they would be to hear the older ones tell them of it! They will gain by the older ones, for they shall have what the young ones could not have, i.e., experience. They will have seen things that the younger generation never saw, and the younger ones will, in turn, be interested to hear details about those things.
Today, the old brothers have experience, and in having this, they have what the young ones as such, cannot have. It is well to revert to old times and thus be reminded of the work of God; of how He did things then; it is the same God that works now, and
{265}
it is one work. Take, for example, @Ephesians 2: 5, 6: there it is said that He has quickened us, raised us up and made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. It is all one work, though taking hundreds of years to accomplish it, and that one work is going on today. It was going on when the old brothers and sisters of today were young men and young women. They saw it in the feature that marked it then, and can tell you of it, for divine operations take on peculiar features according to the necessity of the moment.
The disciples then find the ass tied and the colt with it. We are not told who tied the ass. I would say, in the light in which I am speaking, that the ass and the colt illustrate how we are bound by divine principles, and are held by divine restrictions. Thank God, even if no more can be said of any of us than this: They have obeyed the commandments of the Lord; and if so, the Lord has respect for us. There was the ass tied, and the colt with it. They are together, and the message was, "The Lord has need of them".
A while ago the blind men had need of Him, and He answered to their cry. Now we may say, He needs those men, for, in principle, they are identical. The two delivered from demoniacal power and the two whose eyes were opened, are, in principle, the same two who are found here, bound, as I may say, by divine principles. And, beloved friends, a most remarkable thing is that He sat upon both of them. How He did it physically, I am not prepared to say, but I do know how He does it spiritually. With the
{266}
old brother and the young brother each subject, you have a beautiful combination; and as subject to Christ, they are available to Him as a unit.
It would be extremely difficult for any man to ride on an ass and a colt at the same time, but the Lord sat upon them, to control them for His pleasure. He will not sit on the young ones separately, but will use the old and the young together. If the young brethren in a meeting are apart in spirit from their older brethren, the Lord will not use them separately. The assembly is composed of both, and the Lord will use them, or sit on them, so to say. Here He rides triumphantly into Jerusalem, answering to the scripture, "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass". Is it not worth while to surrender our wills, so as to be in unity and thus available to Christ, that He may ride triumphantly upon us into His capital? That is what He is doing at the present time: He is availing Himself of His people, as united, and using them to proclaim His rights as Lord.
Well now, I want to add a little word as to chapter 18: "if two of you"; not two demoniacs, not two blind men, nor two asses, but two of the assembly -- "two of you". The truth of the assembly had been introduced in chapter 16, as you remember, so that we can understand what two of it are like. In answering Peter, the Lord had said, "*thou* art Peter". He was Peter, which meant that he was part of the Rock. Christ is the Rock. "On this rock I will build my
{267}
assembly" (verse 18). Peter was of it, and that thought runs through. As a stone, he was durable, and it is a question now of endurance. Peter stands the test; and so you find in this eighteenth chapter, which treats of trespass, that the assembly is the final court of appeal.
In the passage read, the Lord says, "Again I say to you", meaning that the condition might arise in which the assembly as such should not be available, but you may have two of it. Not two believers simply, but "two of you", and they are agreed. What are they agreed about? You reply, Some party movement. Not at all, they belong to the assembly. They would say in the language of the psalm: "If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill" (@Psalm 137: 5). Her very dust was precious in the eyes of the remnant, and so it is with two of the assembly.
As you look abroad on the desolation of the church, you weep over it. It is in 2 Timothy we have tears, and Paul remembered them (@2 Timothy 1: 4). When you look at the desolation that exists, you weep, but nevertheless you are of the assembly, whatever its condition, and you are thinking of the rights of God in it, and so you agree concerning a matter, and you ask. Two of you may do this, any two of the assembly, and, He says, "it shall come to them". Think of the possibility of prayer! "It shall come to them from my Father". God will thus honour you, and will show that you have asked for it. The whole assembly on earth may get the blessing, but He will show that you have asked for it, "it shall come to them"; that is, those two have got their
{268}
answer, and it is known that they have got it: "it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens".
Then the Lord adds, "For where two or three". The circle becomes enlarged after prayer. You are confident; you take in another. You are now getting your answer from heaven; you needed power on earth, and have got it. One can speak experimentally of this. The Lord says: "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". He is there to support them in their deliberations. The gates of hades are not to prevail against the assembly.
It is a question of taking counsel, and the Lord is there to support us, so that the enemy is frustrated. What "two of you" ask for they will get, but the answer will come on earth in the way of increase. It will be realised in two or three gathered together in Christ's name here. The power is experienced as He is known in the midst. The presence of the Lord Jesus is no mere theory; it is a known thing, and thus nothing can overcome those who are truly gathered to His name. The way is made for them, and the purposes of God are accomplished. Two or three thus gathered are signalised by the known presence of the Lord Jesus.
That is all I have to say. The object before me was to show from these few passages how Matthew prepares for the working out of church principles, and these may be found in two or three, so we should be more concerned about the principles and the quality of the persons than about their number.
{269}
The quality is determined by the word "Peter". You must look for that quality which is akin to Christ. It must be what is of Christ. As remarked, it is more important to see that right qualities and divine principles are present than mere numbers. One would not despise the numbers, but the great thing is the quality of the persons and the principles by which they are governed. When these are according to God we are invulnerable, for the Lord Himself is with us.

CHRIST SITTING
W. R. Mason
@Colossians 3: 1 - 4; @Malachi 3: 1 - 4; @Mark 14: 60 - 64
"Who shall endure the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fullers¬ lye" (@Malachi 3: 2). That speaks to us of the Lord Jesus Himself; everything is measured by the beauty and perfection of His holy humanity. It becomes a standard, and when the Lord comes in it makes an impact on our souls -- how it shakes us up as to our shortcomings, our imperfections, our waywardness and lawlessness. All these things are discovered freshly to our hearts, the intent being that we should humble, and judge and adjust ourselves to come in line with this blessed One who loves us with a love unchanging. The fire is to remove the dross, the lye is to remove the stains so that we should be pure and holy in His sight, uncorrupted and unadulterated. It says, "he shall sit as a
{270}
refiner and purifier of silver". Now if you talk to any silversmith who understands his job, he will say, 'Yes, I must sit, I have to sit'. He has to sit and watch the fire do its work. If it does not have enough fire it will not be fully purified; if it gets too much the silver will suffer. So he sits and he watches carefully. The Lord Jesus never gives us any more discipline than we can bear. All is skilfully measured by infinite wisdom. Sometimes we think our afflictions, our discipline, are going on too long; Christ has everything measured, He is sitting watching. He is watching you and watching the discipline, and when it has done its work He will terminate it, and then the peaceful fruits of righteousness will be secured by those who have been exercised by the Father's chastening (@Hebrews 12: 11).
It is beautiful to think of the Lord in this way. This has to do with the testimonial line of truth. Colossians is more the privilege line, where He is sitting at the right hand of God with a great system of administration under His hand, endless blessings to unfold for His people, all those things above in His care. But here He is adjusting, purifying and refining. Would we not like to be a little more refined? All that coarseness of nature would be worn down and removed by His skilful operations in discipline. The stains which you have acquired through the wilderness would be removed in the fuller's lye. I think it is the way the Lord would apply the truth to our consciences and our hearts, for He is purifying the assembly by the washing of water by the word, and
{271}
the lye would be how He applies the truth to us in order that we might judge ourselves and come in line with divine thoughts.
The Lord would love us to be refined. Oh! how precious that is -- refinement of feeling, right sensibilities, refinement of intelligence. We cease to be crude in our thoughts and in our expressions and we take on the character and spirit of Christ through His skilful work. He has in mind, you see, to make us more serviceable to Himself. This work is not punitive; the Lord is not punishing His people, but working with them in discipline to make them more effective, more useful, that we may be fit for the Master's use, prepared for every good work (@2 Timothy 2: 21).
So it says, "He will purify the children of Levi". They are the workers, and there is so much work to be done. The Levites came to toil and labour at the tabernacle. A great deal of detail had to be attended to by them, and now the Lord wants to make His own more serviceable, to purge them as gold and silver, that they recognise that they have been redeemed, they are of the silver.
"And they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness". To be found in righteousness is a proper foundation for God's service. How good to be in righteousness in the last days! Can we reach it? The Spirit of God is here to help us to reach it. "Righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" is the present character of the kingdom (@Romans 14: 17). Believers are levites from this point of view. I do not think the people of God are divided into
{272}
classes of priests and levites and common persons; these are just characters which apply to all the saints. Every one is to have his work as a priest, and also as a levite, to be engaged in the Lord's work according to the measure of faith given.
"Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah". There is to be a reflection heavenward of the holy humanity of Christ. That is the oblation. What the people bring is a purified and refined product, and that is what the Lord loves to see coming into His presence, whether in our private devotions or in the meetings. He is pleased with what we have to say if it is of God.
But that is not the main thing; what He wants is the persons, persons who are purified and refined. They bring this oblation in righteousness and it says it shall "be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years". Now here are two periods alluded to, and it is my impression that the days of old would suggest, for us, the apostles¬ times.
Think of the beautiful conditions which obtained in the early Acts under the twelve and their labours! When the Spirit had just come and the disciples were fresh in the knowledge of a living Christ who had gone up from them a few days previously; and there they were speaking the great things of God and the people around them heard them speaking in their own dialect. Oh! the freshness of those days. How vital, real and living everything was to them! Then later on, as the apostle Paul got to work among the Gentiles, what beautiful fruits came to light! Those
{273}
were the days of old when the apostles laboured and brought forth first-fruits to God from amongst the Jews and the Gentiles.
But then it says, "And as in former years". I take that to mean, as regards us, not so very long ago, "former years", years which we knew formerly. God would bring us back to that character of thing. There would be that kind of mellowed humanity developed amongst the saints that is descriptive of Christ, that God is pleased with. Times that we knew twenty years ago, forty years ago, times such as the brethren knew in the last century, were the "former years" of this era in which we are. Here He is looking back to those days of old and to those former years. He is looking forward in Scripture also to the world to come, to the glory of the holy city when it comes down out of heaven from God in the day of display.
The introduction of that is what the Lord is thinking of where we read in @Mark 14: the high priest and the elders had arrayed against Him lying witnesses who could prove nothing, whose testimony did not agree. These men want the Lord to speak, but He is silent; He is not answering what is of the devil, what is untrue. The dignity of His humanity is seen in the holy silence He maintained, in the face of this provocation. But when the high priest speaks to Him as to His Person, adjured Him in a sense, He would answer the voice of adjuration. The high priest said, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" This is a beautiful title of God, as footnote *d* shows -- it was used to designate God,
{274}
'The Blessed'; and Christ was the Son of the Blessed, and Jesus does not deny this. He says, "*I* am". He is asserting his Person here, "*I* am". But more than that, He is the Son of man. He has not only come in on God's behalf to execute His purposes, but He has come in on man's behalf, too, to bring in all the blessing that God intended man to possess.
Then He says, "ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven". Beloved brethren, these are days just ahead of us. The time we are now in is a time of urgent preparation, because soon we shall see Him, and we shall be with Him too when He appears in this way. He is not telling the priests that at this point, He is just alluding to His own coming. Earlier it speaks of His coming and the holy angels with Him (@Mark 8: 38).
Here He just alludes to Himself sitting at the right hand of power and how this would be seen; even His enemies shall see this: "ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power". I think there will be an impression of the majesty of God and His power there, dealing with everything opposed to Christ and His rights. And He will be the One who will come and administer in that power. What a testimony that will be, what a witness to a universe in which there has been division of attitude to Christ. Here He is surrounded with opposers, rejecters, but there are those who have approved of Him and accepted Him; they are loyal to Him and they will be
{275}
with Him in the day of His glory. He will come with the clouds of heaven.
The chief priests and elders could not understand that; this was light beyond them, light which provoked them to wrath. The high priest rent his clothes, accused Him of blasphemy, "And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. And some began to spit upon him, and cover up his face, and buffet him" in mockery and disdain.
The Lord Jesus went forward confident in the glorious future that the Father had destined for Him, and, beloved brethren, we should be full of holy buoyancy and hope as we think of what is ahead for Christ. We live in a Christ-rejecting world at the moment, where His name is dishonoured, disowned and unwanted, but where we belong to Him. Do we not feel strangers amid a scene of treachery and hostility to Him? We ought to feel more and more strangers in this evil world.
As our loyalty to Christ increases, we should feel so outside of all down here that this hope should be brightly burning in our hearts, that the One whom we love and serve and follow is the One who is soon to be manifested and whose rights will be accorded to Him. The right hand of power will be evident; Christ will be sitting there; the kings of the earth and their armies are gathered together against Him; He will not be at all disconcerted, knowing that everything is planned and that all power in heaven and earth has been given to Him, that the Father is going to put all His enemies under His feet.
{276}
Think of the dreadful state of man's heart, the audacity of man, that the beast and the armies gather together to make war upon Him who sits upon the white horse and comes out with the armies of heaven following Him (@Revelation 19)! This puny creature on earth is audacious enough to attempt to join battle with this glorious One. Of course, there is no battle. The beast and the false prophet are taken and cast alive into the lake of fire and the rest are slain with the sword that goes out of the mouth of Him that sits on the white horse. That is the power of His word. He comes "in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might, when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed ... in that day" (@2 Thessalonians 1: 8 - 10).
Well, may God grant that no one here may be among that number who meet with everlasting destruction from His presence. Let us be among those who have received the love of the truth that we might be saved, those that believe on Him, who are committed to Him. This day of glory shall have no terrors for us; indeed, we shall be with Him in it.
How good to have this confidence in our hearts that Christ will be seen sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven to execute justice and vengeance. Jude sees it, as Enoch saw it. He prophesied, the seventh from Adam, that
{277}
the Lord would come amidst His holy myriads "to execute judgment against all; and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness, which they have wrought ungodlily, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him" (@Jude 15). Christ will come to bring it all home to their consciences and to put them into that place of perdition prepared for the devil and his angels.
Think of what this meant to the Lord when here! As confronted with these enemies, He thought of the future. We have regarded Him in Malachi as looking to the past, to the days of old and the former years; now He is looking to the future. Beloved brethren, when we are surrounded by hostile elements and opposers let us not get excited about it, let us not get chafed in our spirits, let us look forward to the day of manifestation when God will put all right; He will be the One who will execute vengeance. Vengeance belongs to Him alone, it is not for us to avenge ourselves but to accept humbly His ways, knowing that all will be put right in the due time and that we shall be with Christ when He come with the clouds of heaven.
So may our hearts be stimulated and uplifted to this blessed day of glory; in the meantime we are to be occupied with the One who is sitting at God's right hand, to be seeking the things that surround Him there, and to have our minds on those things, for His Name's sake.

"TAKE HEED WHAT YE HEAR"; "TAKE HEED ... HOW YE HEAR"
J. B. Stoney
@Mark 4: 24, 25; @Luke 8: 18
The third class of preachers begin from God: Christ, as we see in all the gospels, is the prominent Object. In Luke we find, "I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people; for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord" (@Luke 2: 10, 11). In John's gospel, John the Baptist proclaims, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world ... he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" (@John 1: 29, 33). He not only removes all that is contrary to God, but He brings in everything according to God.
We see beautifully exemplified in the thief on the cross (though there was no preacher), that he has to do not only with the work, but with the One who did the work, and he is to be in company with Him in paradise. The apostle Paul could say to the Corinthians, "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" (@1 Corinthians 2: 2). We find afterwards when he explained himself that this was the gospel of the glory of Christ which was especially committed to him (@2 Corinthians 4: 4).
The nearer you are to Him in glory the more you are assured of the righteousness that is ministered from glory. You are not only justified by faith and have peace with God, but you joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
{279}
received the reconciliation. "On whom though not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory" (@1 Peter 1: 8).
This is all through the sovereign goodness of God to you, when you appropriate it in faith; He has accepted you in the Beloved. But now you have to learn that not only has God removed everything from His own eye, but by the power of His Spirit He delivers you from the old man, and that you are in Christ, and that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" makes you "free from the law of sin and of death" (@Romans 8: 2). You have begun life in Christ, and you can say, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me" (@Galatians 2: 20). If you are established in this grace you know that Christ is formed in you, and you are then ready to apprehend the great range of His grace for you. Except as you are free of the old man, you are not in the life of Christ, and never could know Him now as the living Stone, nor as Head, nor realise your union with Him in heaven.
The great difference between this last class and the other two, is that not only is the work prominent, but Christ Himself is prominent. It is very plain that if Christ personally is before you, there must be an endless range for your heart, for you never can come to the end of Him. One portion of His grace could not satisfy; Himself alone can satisfy the heart. If you dwell on a passage of Scripture only, you get only a partial apprehension of the truth, for Christ Himself is the truth; and according as Christ Himself
{280}
is apprehended by the soul, so you impart to others; then it is true that "with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you" (@Matthew 7: 2).
In our own day when God vouchsafed to give a restoration of the knowledge of His full purpose in grace, it was seen that the first part, the certainty of our salvation, was to be appropriated by faith, which is blessedly true; it was apprehended that God in His grace transferred a believer from Adam to Christ. But subsequently it was taught, and insisted on, that not only the first part, but all the purpose of His grace for us, could be appropriated and realised by faith, which is an imperfect apprehension of the truth. The truth is that our salvation must be appropriated by faith, but as the believer is on new ground in Christ, it is only by the Holy Spirit that we can appropriate and enjoy the range of God's purpose and grow up to the Head; the Spirit only can lead us into it. Thus, by the craft of the enemy, the great goodness of God to us in this latter day has been in a great measure lost sight of, and some are asserting that they know all the purpose of God in grace without having the great blessing which would result from being practically in each step. Surely this is enough to make the Lord's warning very emphatic to us in this day, "Take heed ... how ye hear" (@Luke 8: 18).
In conclusion, I press the great contrast between the two latter classes. They both begin aright. They believe that the whole range of God's purpose is to be first apprehended by faith, and that the first step, our salvation, is appropriated by faith; that salvation
{281}
is that God in His grace transfers the believer from Adam to Christ; but the former class do not see that all the rest of the purpose of God is only known as you are in Christ by the Spirit of God. Their mistake is that they think that because salvation is appropriated by faith, all the other parts of His grace can be likewise appropriated.
For example, they assert that you get deliverance by the reckoning of faith, and do not see that you start on new ground, and therefore that your deliverance can only be in the life of Christ, and if you do not take the first step you cannot enjoy any of the rest. Hence while those who say that all can be appropriated by faith are zealous as to doctrine, they really are not in the power and blessing of what is true for them. They believe in separation to God for all the children of God, and they gather together in the name of Christ, looking for His presence, refusing human ministry, and are correct in detail according to the letter of the word, but they have not got it vitally, they have not really learned @Matthew 14; they have not crossed over to where Christ is, and they have not come to Him as the living Stone. They could not, because they are not practically in the life of Christ. They can speak clearly and interestingly of the Lord's presence in the assembly; of His being Head of the church and of our union with Him, but they are not in the enjoyment of this great position.
Now, on the other hand, those who believe that there is no deliverance, except in the life of Christ, have the unspeakable joy of being free from the law
{282}
of sin and death. They can leave everything here to join Him in the assembly; they know Him as Son over God's house, in the holiest of all; untold blessing is theirs. When they learn what it is to be dead with Him from the rudiments of the world, they are with Him in His own home, where He directs and counsels them, and finally they are led by the Spirit of God to realise their union with Him in heaven; so that they come forth in full concert with His mind, and in the greatness of His power, to act for Him here in the church and in their own house. Thus we plainly see the importance of "Take heed ... how ye hear" (@Luke 8: 18).

CHRIST'S DESIRES FOR THE CHRISTIAN
J. N. Darby
@John 17
This chapter has a very peculiar character, in that it is not the address of the Lord Jesus to His disciples even, much less to the world. It is their admission to hear Him address His Father about them. And we can easily understand that, where such a privilege is given them, we should be let into the fullest possible apprehension of the place in which He has set us.
When He spoke to the world, Christ suited Himself to their capacity; and we, in our measure, ought to seek to do the same. But when He was addressing His Father, we can naturally understand that He would speak freely of what He had on His heart
{283}
about His disciples. But still, as it concerned them (now, through grace, we have received the Spirit who communicates these things to our souls), He spoke it in the audience of the disciples, so that they should hear and know what His heart felt about them.
Let me ask you this: If we find that Christ has an interest in us, and that He is speaking to His Father, and speaking of us, of what He has on His heart for our blessing, do our hearts turn with interest to listen and to know what He feels about us? We have wretched cold hearts, it is true; nothing is worse than their deadness and indifference to God. An openly bad, vile man of the world is bad enough; but if I saw a *son* do what was wrong, and if his father went out and entreated him with all the tender affection of a father, and he did not trouble his heart about what he said, I should say there is no hope now.
Therefore, when I find this first truth, that Christ has us on His heart, and can speak to His Father about us -- that we are become the object of Their common interest; surely our hearts should turn to it. "These things", He said, "I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them" (verse 13). The character of Christ's love being perfect, was to bring us into the same blessing with Himself. It is very true, but it is not all the truth, that we are blessed *through* Christ: we are blessed *with* Him, and that was the perfection of His love. He loves us enough to have us near Him, and have us all in the perfectness of His own heart; and having opened our understandings to see what He is, and to delight in what
{284}
He is, He gives us the consciousness of His own perfect love. "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (@1 John 3: 2). If I always saw perfect blessedness before me, with the consciousness at the same time that I never should have it, that would not give comfort to my heart; but if I have a perfect object before me, with a certainty that I shall possess it, I shall be occupied with that object.
Whilst here below we have the consciousness, in looking at our blessing in Christ, that we are not perfectly like what He is; we desire it, we long to be conformed to the image of Christ. But still, if we have in any measure tasted the loveliness of Christ, what distresses the heart is that we are not like Him.
But here Christ engages the affections, and brings the heart to this point -- the consciousness that this is our place in Him before God, and that all the blessedness that He has is ours. Does it become us to say, No? Is it humbleness to be short of that, to say we are unworthy? Is God right? But it is no humbleness to refuse grace. And then, when it is seen to be such grace -- unmingled grace -- it is no humbleness to speak of not being fit to have such things. If I talk about not being *quite* worthy, there is the thought that if I were worthier I should be fit to have these blessings. Here is just where the want of humbleness is. You ought to be on the right ground with the Lord. That which enables us to have this thought and desire of being brought into the presence and blessing of God, and to be like Christ, is that all is grace. We are nothing. If we look at the glory that is before
{285}
us, it at once puts out the thought of all worthiness in ourselves.
Here, then, the Lord is just setting us in His own place upon earth. Poor feeble creatures we are for it; but He is setting us in His place on earth. "Father", he says, "as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me" (verse 24). This chapter is often spoken of as being a prayer. The half is a prayer; but, all the other part is a plain and full exposition of the ground on which He places us, beginning with His going up to heaven; and then going on to the glory which He will give us.
There is the prayer, too -- a prayer for us while we are passing through the trials and difficulties of this world. Christ gives us this place with Himself above; but He speaks while still in the world, that we might have it from His own lips in the world. It is not as taking us out of the world; but He begins it all from that starting-point, that we shall be in the glory. When He was here He did not want any witness; He was Himself the heavenly Witness; but, now He is gone, He sets His saints as His living active epistle in a world that they do not belong to any more than He did.

CONTRIBUTORS
F. S. Marsh
@Exodus 35: 21
God's intention is that all His children should be making contributions of a spiritual kind to His service; to the welfare of His assembly on earth; to the interests of Christ, and to the prosperity of the glad tidings. The understanding of this would preserve them from descending into a mere congregation, holding certain views and accustomed to meet in a particular building. It would lift them above all formal religiousness; for the holy service of God is to be supported by voluntary contributions, brought to God willingly and from the *heart*.
The Scripture in @Exodus 35 says: "*they came*"; that is a lovely expression! It is a wonderful joy to look out upon the children of God and say, "they came"! But they did not come empty-handed, or in a formal, religious manner, because it was a certain hour or a certain day: no, they came with their hearts moved, their minds occupied and their hands full! God requires that no one should appear before Him empty; the word "consecration" means 'with hands full' (cf. @Leviticus 8: 28, footnote *c*).
Let us dismiss the idea that there is nothing we can bring. There are great possibilities open to those whose hearts are moved in the direction of contributing, for the opportunities are many. If we feel that our gift is small, the Lord can enlarge what we have and honour our desire. What is needed on our side is to have hearts moved, spirits willing and hands full.
{287}
The idea of a Christian accepting all the blessings of God and settling down in them without any spiritual movement in offering Godward, or any movement in compassion towards men, is entirely contrary to the thoughts of God.
We read of the Lord Jesus, who is presented to His followers as the great Example, that He "went through all quarters doing good" (@Acts 10: 38). He served God in lowly grace, bringing light, joy and blessing to men. Thus His disciples should be on this line of contributing -- first of all, what is due to God. That which is manward and for the benefit of the people of God is to have its place, but the great primary thought is that service must be first Godward, affording Him what is acceptable and for His joy -- rendering to Him adoration, praise and worship.
We are destined to be for ever in the presence of God as worshippers; but even while here on earth, what an honour it is to bring something -- however small a contribution, according to our judgment -- which will give delight to the heart of God! Let us speak to Him of Jesus -- of His glories, His love, His Person, His work and His grace! We all have something we can bring, if there has been a work of God in our souls; some feature of Christ which has impressed us will furnish a basis to fill our hands with Christ, so that we may draw near to God.
Then the idea of contributing is to expand. The work of God calls for it; the moment calls for persons who can contribute, and who can render a
{288}
testimony (even though in obscurity) which is acceptable to God. Let us all be concerned as to what contributions we bring! We are always receiving; and we can rightly bless our God for all that He has bestowed upon us, and receive it with joy and thankfulness; but "ye have received gratuitously, *give gratuitously*" (@Matthew 10: 8)!
Let us not exclude ourselves from the holy joy of spiritual giving -- a word by the bedside to cheer some aged believer; a word of comfort to someone in sorrow; a word concerning Christ to a fellow-believer -- all these are contributions! God does not send His angels with such messages, but uses His own people; and it is delightful to hear of loving service of this kind going on in freshness.
God desires that we should all be givers in a spiritual way; let us all be concerned to be contributing to that which gives pleasure to Him, with willing hearts divinely moved and hands full of the fragrance of Christ, giving character to the service, whatever it may be. Thus, as we await the return of Christ, may we be encouraged on the line of contributing, for the Lord will enlarge our measure if we are "faithful in the least" (@Luke 16: 10).

TOGETHER
J. G. Frame
@John 11:47 - 52; @Acts 2:44; @1 Corinthians 11:18 - 20, 23 - 26; @Psalm 122:1 - 9; @Philippians 1:27 - 30
These scriptures bring before us the value of being together. Soon we "shall be caught up together ... to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 17). What a prospect that is! How blessed to have that in our hearts! But now, we are thankful for an occasion like this when we can sit down together, enjoy one another's company, and speak about what divine Persons have purposed for our blessing.
I believe it is characteristic of believers today to be together; the divine nature working in us causes us to gravitate towards one another, and it is a great and blessed matter that we should be together -- what a preservative for saints today! Satan is active to divert persons from being together to hear the Lord's word, but he will not triumph -- "hades¬ gates shall *not* prevail" against the assembly (@Matthew 16: 18). How comforting it is to know that. God will triumph in the end, and what should help us most, I believe, in these closing days, is this matter of gathering together.
That is why I read in @John 11. You will notice in verse 47 that the chief priests and the Pharisees "gathered a council", for they were perplexed at what was happening. Lazarus was raised from among the dead, and they said, "What do we? for this man does many signs ... and the Romans will
{290}
come and take away both our place and our nation". They were not concerned about God; they were concerned about their "place" and their "nation". How solemn it is to think of the activities of men at the present time. In @Psalm 2 it says, "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes plot together, against Jehovah and against his anointed: Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us!" Then it says, "He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision" (verses 2 - 4), And God says, "*I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness" (verse 6). What a triumph that is! God will have the last word. How comforting that is to our hearts.
Then Caiaphas the high priest said, "Ye know nothing nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish. But this he did not say of himself, but ... prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation" -- that is as far as the prophesy of Caiaphas went. Then it says, "and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad". It was not Caiaphas who said that (verse 52), but the Spirit of God through the evangelist John showed what the divine intent was, despite all that men and Satan were doing. God was proceeding with this word, to "gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad". What a concept that is! We would have thought perhaps that it had been sufficient to say, 'and gather them together', but no, "gather
{291}
together into one". That is, the divine mind was that we should be one in regard to these matters, just as divine Persons are one; the Lord Jesus could say, "I and the Father are one" (@John 10: 30); one in thought, purpose and counsel.
John, at the start of his gospel, speaks of those who have the right to be children of God, "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God" (chapter 1: 13). We come into that precious family, and as such are to be gathered together. I believe that gathering is going on at the present time.
It is this word "together" that affected me in relation to these scriptures. Believers are to be gathered together, and that is what God is doing in our day. The Lord Jesus is the Centre of gathering where He is in heaven, but He is not only the Centre, He is the Gatherer, He is the One who would draw our affections and centre them in Himself. I believe it is a great preservative for us in these days, to let divine love have its way with us, and to know what it is to be gathered together into one. How important that is! There is to be no question of division, but of oneness, in order that the saints might be preserved together.
What a scattering there has been, but through it all God is working to bring His people into the enjoyment of divine things that He has purposed for them. How faithful the word is that "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose" (@Romans 8: 28).
In @Acts 2 we read, "And when the day of
{292}
Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place" (verse 1). What a day that must have been, when the Spirit came, and the one hundred and twenty "were all filled with the Holy Spirit" (verse 4). That was the beginning of the present dispensation in which we are, and the saints were gathered together. I believe the Lord had to do with these people earlier: it speaks of Him having "charged the apostles ... being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them ..." (chapter 1: 2 - 4); the thought of assembling with them was to direct their minds and attention to what He was bringing in, so that they would be together to enjoy the great things that divine love had purposed for them, and for us.
We read in @Acts 2: 44, "all that believed were together"; this verse would give us to understand, I believe, that they were together in heart and mind. It is a great matter when we are together thus -- love is "the bond of perfectness" (@Colossians 3: 14); it sets the saints together in relation to one another, in view of our prospering spiritually.
That is what we find in @1 Corinthians 11. "For first", Paul says, "when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you". Now we have spoken of being gathered "together into one", and I think that being "gathered together in assembly" is a further thought; it is, you might say, how we are set in intelligence and affection to one another and to the Lord. I believe the intent of this
{293}
passage is to help us in regard to our coming together to take the Supper. Then he says, "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper". The Corinthians should have been together in an orderly way for the Lord's supper -- the Lord Himself had set it on among His own. What a triumph it is that the Supper is still being carried on week after week, all these centuries after He introduced it. What a stay the Supper has been to the lovers of the Lord Jesus, drawing their affections after Him! It is the One who has loved us who has provided the occasion whereby we can call Him to mind in the breaking of bread. How supremely great the Supper is! In Corinthians, Paul puts the Supper in its right setting, in the assembly.
As we come together "in assembly", in this dignified way, we are rightly able to celebrate the Lord's supper. Paul says, "*I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you". It was in the night in which He was delivered up that the Lord introduced the Supper. As we come together to remember Him who has been rejected, the One who is set aside here, I believe the Lord would have us to be together intelligently in relation to what would proceed in that occasion. It is important to see the distinctiveness of this precious occasion which has been preserved to saints, and by it we announce the death of the Lord, until He come. The Supper is available to believers in order to set them together intelligently in relation to Himself, as His brethren, and then there can be response in sonship to the Father, and
{294}
finally to God. What wonderful experiences flow from partaking of the Supper!
Paul says, "... until he come". He will soon come to take up His rights here in the very scene where He has been rejected and cast out. Meanwhile, I believe is pleased to see saints gathering together for His Supper, and through Him, in the Spirit's power, to worship the blessed God.
I pass on to the Psalms. @Psalm 120 to 134, as we know, are the 'Songs of degrees'. They speak of the portion of God's people as moving on towards His house, to have part in His praise. @Psalm 119, which precedes the Songs of Degrees, is a very invigorating and regulating psalm. Those who love Jehovah's testimonies and His law are the people that go up, that can have part in the spiritual exercises that are proper to the Songs of Degrees.
These psalms each have a certain meaning; and @Psalm 122, it seems to me, brings out the thought of being together. This is not only a Song of Degrees, but a psalm of David, "the sweet psalmist of Israel" (@2 Samuel 23: 1). He was the one who had to do with the service of God in his day, and this psalm leads on to @Psalm 134 where they "stand in the house of Jehovah" by night (verse 1) carrying on His service. What a holy privilege is available to us too in this day, typically the night of His rejection, to give glory to God. But in @Psalm 122, the psalmist rejoiced: "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah". It is a great privilege to be ready to go into the house of Jehovah. This
{295}
Psalm begins with the house of Jehovah and it ends with the house of Jehovah. In between there is the thought of the city and its bulwarks. We are not to be moving in an individual way, but to be desirous of moving collectively in relation to what is for the pleasure of God. God is to be known and worshipped in His house -- that is where the service of God is carried on, in the assembly.
"Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem". Think of the feeling way the psalmist says, "O Jerusalem"; how he valued what was precious to God. And we are not outside, in the world, but we are inside, "within thy gates". Then it says, "Jerusalem, which art built as a city that is compact together". Now, it is well known that the cities of this world are not compact together, they are spread out. But God's city is "compact together". What a view that is, to see the saints as "compact together"; that means, I think, that there is no room for anything to come in and divide; it is an intense expression to bring out the greatness of what God has in His city.
And then it says, "Whither the tribes go up"; well, that suggests the thought of elevation, "a testimony to Israel", and footnote *c* says, Or 'Israel's custom'. It is a good thing to have good customs. We have spoken of one already, the Lord's supper; and what flows out from it. When the Lord had introduced the Supper, it says, "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives" (@Matthew 26: 30); think of how the Lord led them out. He
{296}
established a custom, whereby we might approach and draw near to God and give Him His portion. And so it is a testimony, or a custom, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah. How our hearts should be filled with thanksgiving and praise when we think of all that God has done for us, and all the blessings that He has for us. He has a great system of blessing whereby we have been called to have part with Christ, and in the power of the Spirit, to function in His house.
Then we are to "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee". Let us keep praying for peace among the Lord's people, because the enemy is attacking. Then it says, "they shall prosper that love thee". Well, do we want to prosper spiritually? Then let us love "Jerusalem" (for us, the assembly). We are to love what God loves. What great thoughts divine Persons have in mind in relation to the assembly! "Peace be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy palaces". What a place of blessing we have been brought into in the assembly, and God would have us there joyfully, as it says, "for my brethren and companions¬ sakes I will say, Peace be within thee!". Believers form part of this wonderful company. And then it says, "Because" -- "Because of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good". We should seek the good and prosperity of all who belong to the house of God.
Well, may we encourage one another and seek to be together in relation to the enjoyment of our blessings -- valuing one another as those who belong to Christ, His brethren, His companions. What dignity
{297}
has been conferred upon believers; may we know more of what it is to be in the house of God, our hearts filled with praise and thanksgiving to Him! Surely we should have an enlarged appreciation of what is due to God and, as together with one another, have part in His service joyfully.
Philippians is an epistle, we are often reminded, that has to do with refinement; God's work is going on in souls. It says, "he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day" (chapter 1: 6); and, "it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure" (chapter 2: 13). God is completing His work in the souls of believers, He is putting the finishing touches to His work, which is soon to be displayed in glory.
Where we read in chapter 1, Paul is concerned that he might hear rightly concerning the saints, that they "stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings". What dignity is suggested in saints standing together. What great things have been committed to believers in our day. Let us labour together for their maintenance.
These Philippian saints, I believe, were very precious to Paul. He speaks of their "supplication" for him, and "the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 19), for his encouragement. And he is exhorting the Philippians: "conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ", and to be "not frightened in anything by the opposers". Let us not be afraid, beloved; let us estimate rightly what is
{298}
against us. "Hades¬ gates", the Lord said, "shall not prevail against" the assembly (@Matthew 16: 18) -- the enemy will not triumph, let us be assured. We may oft-times be fearful, but how encouraging it is to see saints standing firm in the defence of the truth.
So Paul says, "because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also". Oh! let us be prepared to suffer, beloved; let us accept it and remember that the time of reward is to come. The Lord Jesus could say, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?" (@Luke 24: 26). Let us be encouraged by that.
Paul says, "having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me". They had appreciated Paul and all that he stood for -- Paul's conflict had to do with the maintenance of what was for Christ, and he would have these Philippian saints with him in regard to these matters. Let us be prepared to face a time of suffering in view of the coming glory.
That is all I have to say, beloved, that, awaiting the coming of the Lord, we should know more of this togetherness as never before. I believe the Spirit of God is operating to that end that saints are set together, so that as together they might have part rightly in the service of God in His house, in the assembly. May God bless His word.

RENEWAL
P. H. Hardwick
@Genesis 40: 9 - 14; @Judges 15: 14 - 20; @1 Kings 6: 14, 15, 33, 34
The thought for this occasion, dear brethren, is the matter of revival, or, according to the word in the New Testament, "the washing of regeneration and the *renewal* of the Holy Spirit" (@Titus 3: 5), the word "renewal" signifying that the Spirit would bring about the feature of freshness in the saints.
While we may have, in a certain sense, the same occasions over and over again, like the Lord's supper, yet what is to mark every occasion is the freshness of life, this being one of the ways in which the Spirit is supplied, so that an occasion may, while being repeated as to its general title, yet be thoroughly living and different as compared with any one that has gone before. It is a very encouraging matter to consider, because it was to be seen in the Lord Himself; it was He who through the prophet spoke of being wakened "morning by morning" (@Isaiah 50: 4); every one of His days was fresh under the blessed awakening hand of God. No day was stale, no day was exactly like the one that had preceded it.
According to Luke's account He refers to Himself in relation to "the green tree" He says to the daughters of Jerusalem, "if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?" (@Luke 23: 31). The days of the Lord's service were the "green tree" with all that it meant, without weariness, without languishing, wearied in body it may
{300}
be, but ever fresh in the service. What a day it was when He met and graciously dealt with the woman at the well of Sychar, "Jesus therefore, being wearied", it says, "with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain" (@John 4: 6). Yet what a triumph of divine grace was secured, what a vessel!
A brother may say he was too tired to pray, too weary to take part. @John 4 is always encouraging in relation to weariness, for the Lord secured one of the finest vessels when He sat by the well "wearied with the way he had come"; it says, "as he was"! Many thoughts come into your mind as you think of this.
The Lord in the epistle to the Hebrews is spoken of as the Mediator of a *new* covenant; it speaks of what is new, not merely different from everything that has gone before, but abidingly fresh (@Hebrews 12: 24 and footnote *c*). In our links with God we are to be kept fresh, and we never weary of them and God is ever new to us, because the Mediator is always new in His service -- fresh and beautiful! This is one of the integral parts of the system, the Mount Zion system to which we have come, beginning with Mount Zion and Jerusalem; we have come to the assembly and to God and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant. The Lord Jesus is on high, never weary, there we might say, 'the Keeper of Israel' (@Psalm 121: 4, 5), and always ministering night and day fresh thoughts in regard of God.
Then one could speak of the assembly too. The persons of the assembly may become weary (and some of us do), but the assembly as such has a
{301}
power which will shine one day in all the great spirit of renewal, a thousand years of reign with Christ not wearying her in the least, nor tarnishing her glory. She is described at the end of it: "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (@Revelation 21: 2). The thousand years are but the introduction of what shall be eternally true -- she will never tarnish, she will abide. How much that means for Christ, that His bride, His wife, should never weary, should be eternally fresh!
These are the things we have part in, dear brethren, and the present desire is that we might be reminded of this feature which belongs to us. It is to take hold of us individually and no circumstances are to make any difference; circumstances of limitation and pressure are to make no difference to this because of the Holy Spirit "*poured out*". How wonderful those words are, the washing of regeneration; that is to say, there is a new kind of age and epoch in view, and we are in the light of it, and then as having the Spirit poured out lavishly upon us, we are to be renewed every day. The spirit of this renewal permeates our scriptures.
In @Genesis 40 we have men in circumstances of pressure, of limitation, and while our circumstances may not involve very drastic limitation, yet such it is. It is described here as a prison and God has in a sense put all His people in it, for we cannot do what we like nowadays! We are not in this prison on account of bad behaviour; I am not thinking of that, but of the way God has of putting His people under limitation, because He has a purpose in it, and
{302}
according to the narrative and the type we can say that the Lord Jesus draws near to us in it, with sympathetic purpose in view.
Joseph came and looked upon these prisoners; they were sad, and he asked them the reason and he elicited from them that each had had a dream. That is, I believe, God had given each man in those circumstances, an impression. These dreams are from God. The dreams of Genesis, specially in connection with Joseph, are to be understood and interpreted according to divine impressions. And as Joseph enquires of the butler, he finds he is pondering his dream; he says, "In my dream, behold, a vine was before me". Typically, Christ was before him.
It is perhaps a healthy question for us to ask whether during the several [wartime] years of limitation of various kinds, doors not opening where they used to, and the lack of liberty to do what we like, it may perhaps be asked, Have we received any impression from God in the matter?
The cup-bearer says, "a vine was before me", and not only so, but it expands and grows, it develops, meaning that it is not merely some impression of Christ, but full fruit will come from it. So this man speaks of the buds and the blossoms and the fruit and the clusters of ripe grapes. And now see what an impression God would give to this man. He says, "And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand". There would not be anything more wonderfully fresh than
{303}
that, that the grapes should yield at once something for the pleasure of God, for I doubt not that Pharaoh here represents God, and here is the man being reminded that even out of these circumstances God is going to be served, and served through what Christ brings in in impressions of His own Person as the Vine.
Now, I have no need to elaborate on that, save to ask for our pondering whether we have considered that in our circumstances of pressure, of tightening controls, we have received some impression of Christ. If so, that is hopeful, for it means that we shall begin now to have some part in ministering to God's pleasure. May I appeal to us all, dear brethren, as to this, for there are some who take no active part in the service of God -- may I just appeal that the result may be something for God on the principle of freshness.
There was no time here for the ordinary processes of winemaking, maturing and so on; the indications are of rapid growth and early full development; God is to get something *at once* and in the very circumstances where we are. The cup-bearer was free for God in the prison, and when Joseph interpreted the dream, he understood it. He understood that it was going to be a reality, and not just merely an idle tale, for in three days he *was* returned to Pharaoh and he *did* hand the cup into Pharaoh's hand. But one important thing he forgot -- that was about Joseph. We also are likely to forget Christ, it may be -- a sobering matter indeed -- but he did not
{304}
fail to have his part in that blessed service.
Now we are led to enquire the difference between the butler and the baker. The baker says, seeing this was going so well, "I also was in my dream" (verse 16). How well we recognise this feature! *I* am in my dream; I can understand that God does not get anything! A man may be the centre of his dream, in his greatness or in his smallness, but if a man is in his own dream, then God gets nothing. The baker provided nothing and he lost his life. He lost spiritually. We may say the cupbearer represents the *heart* man, the baker the *head* man.
There is a word there for us, dear brethren, in relation to reviving spiritually so that we may give God what He has in mind. The idea of the cup goes right through into the Lord's supper and is a great thought. It means that persons are satisfied. It is called the cup of the Lord in the Lord's supper (@1 Corinthians 10: 21), and it is, amongst other things, to bring in this great feature of satisfaction, so that being engaged with such a portion we want nothing else. What we partake of in the liberty and joy of the love of Christ is to completely satisfy us.
Now, this is but one portion of what belongs to this great subject. Some need recovery, and I am thinking of people who need recovery out of wrong links, wrong associations; I think of Ephraim. If you read through a certain part of the prophecy of Hosea you would say at one point, Ephraim is beyond recovery, for God said, "Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone" (@Hosea 4: 17). And it has to be said
{305}
of some that they are not recoverable; they are lost. Paul says, "if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled *in those that are lost*" (@2 Corinthians 4: 3). Very solemn word! But happily we find that Ephraim is not as far gone as that; it is as if the heart of God could not really leave him alone.
The prophet exhorts Ephraim in the last chapter of the prophecy, saying to His people, "Take with you words" (@Hosea 14: 2). I expect that is the difficulty with some, they cannot find the words that belong to repentance and recovery. "Take with you words". Ephraim will do it and have finished with idols. They are not now going to bring literal calves to offer to idols, but calves of their lips to God. Ephraim is a recovered man.
Is there anyone here who needs recovering in a special way? Bring with you words, acceptable words, to God, and bring the calves of your lips, "the fruit of the lips confessing his name" (@Hebrews 13: 15). What a marvellous recovery it is. Ephraim says, "What have I to do any more with idols" (@Hosea 14: 8). Ephraim is a recovered man when he says that. God says, "I answer him, and I will observe him". God is not finished with him. It is going on, for God does not take things for granted. God says, "I will observe him"; I will look at him, I will watch how he is getting on.
Then Ephraim speaks again, "I am like a green fir tree", in all the reality of revival in life before God. Then God has the last word: "From me is thy fruit found!" not from idols, but *from Me*! Do we
{306}
want help in regard of coming out of wrong associations? As long as we remain in them, whatever they are, there will be no fruit for God, but as we leave them and act for God, He says, "from me", as if God would say, 'Now I can help you'.
The green fir tree is there reminding us of the greenness and freshness of manhood in a recovered person, and there is nothing like it. They tell us that a broken bone, set properly and healed, is stronger than ever it was. What a word for a recovered person, to forsake his idols, to "Take words" and come to God. Such a person is possibly the freshest person in a locality, a mighty encouragement indeed.

"HE MAKES HIS SUN RISE"
J. B. Crosland
@Matthew 5: 44 - 48
The gospel calls in no uncertain tones for a humble and a contrite spirit, yet at the same time it offers us nobility, and that in an almost inconceivable degree.
This chapter, which begins with "Blessed are the poor in spirit", closes with an amazing exhortation to be like God, and to be like Him in respect of that which we should have thought particularly beyond our reach.
To the material earth, the sun is the great source of light and warmth, of life and well-being. More and more we are learning the influence of its rays on health and happiness in ways hitherto unsuspected.
{307}
In the passage before us our Lord couples the sun with the rain (itself not unconnected with the sun's activities) and takes the two together as a standing illustration of the impartial liberality of God. And then He invites His disciples to be like that!
The prospect of being wealthy enough, royal enough, to afford such liberality must appeal to every generous mind, and certainly the proposal to place men in this position was worthy of the One by whom it was brought to us, and through whom alone it can be realized.
We expect others to give to us, to do good to us; we are content to be beggars before the world, like the impotent man at the Beautiful gate asking alms of those who passed by (@Acts 3: 2). We do not realise that happiness is to be found in the opposite direction, in being wealthy, and able to give to others, to forgive others, to be a blessing to others.
Of course, only a nobleman could do this. But then the gospel comes proposing to make us noblemen; nay, more, to make us very sons of the King.
The word of God to Abraham was, "I will ... bless thee ... and thou shalt be a blessing" (@Genesis 12: 2). Obedient to the call of God, he left his country and his father's house; but if he was a stranger and a pilgrim, he showed again and again that he was wonderfully well off. With noble generosity, and a heart free from care, he could leave to Lot the choice of the best fields (chapter 13: 9); and, later, he could arm his household to rescue Lot from the captivity into which his coveted prosperity had led him
{308}
(chapter 14: 14 - 16). To the king of Sodom's offer, "Give me the souls, and take the property for thyself", he could afford to reply that the source of his wealth was God: "I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah, the most high God, possessor of heavens and earth, if from a thread even to a sandal-thong ... I take anything ... ... that thou mayest not say, I have made Abram rich" (@Genesis 14: 21 - 23). Truly Abraham was a nobleman.
"It is more blessed to give than to receive" (@Acts 20: 35). It is true that many men do not seem to think so; and we must admit that, whether in a material or a spiritual sense, we cannot give except in so far as we have received. "Ye have received gratuitously, give gratuitously" (@Matthew 10: 8). Here, indeed, is the crux of the matter, for the beginning of all blessedness is to receive *from God*, and this beginning only begins when we come before God confessedly empty-handed.
<blockquote> 'Nothing in my hand I bring' (`396:3). </blockquote>
<blockquote> 'Just as I am -- without one plea, <br> But that Thy blood was shed for me' (`446:1). </blockquote>
"O God have compassion on me, the sinner ... I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that other. For ... he that humbles himself shall be exalted" (@Luke 18: 13, 14).
But if, in repentance and faith, we have thus
{309}
come to God, we receive from Him; heaven's stores, through Christ, are opened to us; the grace of God is ours, and Christ, who has died for us and is risen again, becomes to us the Source of life, our Bread from heaven. Linked with Him by His Spirit, we find in His death our great lesson-book; in His pathway on earth, our example; in His present position of power and glory, the encouragement of our hearts and the assurance of what shall be. "I am ... the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages" (@Revelation 1: 17, 18).
Persons are more than things, and our wealth lies in personal relations; in the love of God (do we really take in the stupendous truth that *God loves us*?) and in the unfailing grace of Christ, who has loved us even unto death, and who "is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them" (@Hebrews 7: 25). The resources thus made ours, we may on our side draw out hourly by prayer, the prayer of faith.
It will not bear thinking of for a moment that God, who is love, and whose are all things, could have intended us to be poverty-stricken in the things that make life worth living. To give is the delight of God; He so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son (@John 3: 16); He "affords us all things richly for our enjoyment" (@1 Timothy 6: 17) "If therefore *ye*, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall the Father who is of heaven give *the Holy Spirit* to them that ask him?" (@Luke 11: 13). "He who, yea, has not spared
{310}
his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?" (@Romans 8: 32).
And, in turn, God "loves a cheerful giver" (@2 Corinthians 9: 7), one (in measure) like Himself. Peter had known what it was to be brought low, but in the power of Christ he could give superbly: "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee: *In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk*" (@Acts 3: 6). Paul, too, in that same power was "poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things" (@2 Corinthians 6: 10).
However poor we may be in this world's goods, we may be rich enough to give liberally. The best gifts are spiritual gifts; but material gifts are fitting symbols, and, be they but two mites, will not pass unseen by the divinely discerning eye. "Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all; for all these out of their abundance have cast into the gifts of God; but she out of her need has cast in all the living which she had" (@Luke 21: 3, 4). Have we cast anything like that into the offerings of God?
<blockquote> 'What can I give Him, <br> Poor as I am? <br> If I were a shepherd <br> I would bring a lamb. <br> If I were a wise man <br> I would do my part -- <br> Yet what I can I give Him, <br> Give my heart'. </blockquote>
{311}
If it is a question of yielding to others in our daily life, we are to do it, not because we are too poor to resist, but because we are rich enough to be able to afford it. Only in the sense of being well-off -- of a grateful receiving from God -- can the royal law be carried out, the royal priesthood exercised, "that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light" (@1 Peter 2: 9). This is the royal character of the kingdom of heaven, even in its present conditions of tribulation and patience. It belongs to the "poor in spirit"; theirs is the kingdom of heaven. As the Lord says to the persecuted Smyrna, "I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich" (@Revelation 2: 9).
The new things that medical men are telling us about the wonderful curative effect of the sun's rays, bring vividly home the untold loss that we must suffer by spreading between ourselves and the sun a pall of smoke above our towns and cities, thanks to the activity of our chimneys. The sun's rays are there, they have come millions of miles to reach us, but by our own habits we shut them out at our very doors.
So the grace of God has been brought near to us in Christ. But the barriers are on our side, the pall of smoke from our own hearts, our insensibility, our unbelief, may prevent us from letting in His rays. Yet the sun shines still; not only to the penitent "younger son" is the love of God told out, but to the elder also, as yet hard, callous and self-righteous, the gracious appeal is repeated: "Child, *thou* art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine" (@Luke 15: 31).
{312}
Again let it be said, it is the urgent desire of God to bless us, and to make us a blessing. "In the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow *rivers of living water*. But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" (@John 7: 37 - 39). But now Jesus is glorified, having tasted "death for every thing" (@Hebrews 2: 9); the Spirit has been given to bear witness to Christ and to link our souls with Him, in order that we might freely receive and freely give, even rivers of living water.
Have we received this wealth? And are we using it? Now is the time. In heaven there will be no poor; to be rich, and a giver, will no longer be a distinction; the opportunity of being "light in the Lord" (@Ephesians 5: 8) amid surrounding darkness, will be past. It is in this present time, surrounded as we are by spiritual poverty, that the offer of wealth, of grace, the grace of God, comes to us with its full force and power. Our life here is but a moment, but it is a unique moment, in which, if our hearts are open to the light from heaven, we may learn wonderful things; how to be abased and how to abound; "both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation" (@Philippians 4: 12); how to receive and how to give.

{313}
THE "INN" AND THE "HOME"
J. Revell
@Luke 10: 33 - 35; @Luke 15: 5, 6
These two portions of scripture are well known as describing the way in which the grace of God has acted toward *us*. In chapter 10 it is the *inn*, the roadside inn -- the place for the stranger. In chapter 15 it is the place called *home* (Authorised Version). By these expressions the Lord indicates that He leaves us strangers where He was a Stranger, and He gives us to know as our home the place which is home to Him. Thus, though the character of the places be very different, both show us how perfectly identified we are with Him in the thoughts of God.
The expression in chapter 10 gains force from what has gone before. The seventy disciples returned to Jesus full of joy, because even the devils were subject to them through His name. It was the display of divine power setting aside in a measure the power of Satan here upon earth. He speaks to them of the complete overthrow of Satan's power, and further, tells of power which He will give to enable them to tread unhurt the path of His will: "Yet", He adds, "in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rather rejoice, because your names are written in the heavens" (@Luke 10: 20). It is at that moment that He rejoices in spirit, and, turning to His Father, the word comes from His lips which corresponds with the end of @Matthew 11; He stands there, though rejected by men, as the One known of the Father, and knowing Him, and the Revealer of Him to whom He
{314}
will. He goes on to say, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see" (verse 23). It is not now a question of power displayed here upon the earth, but of the blessedness which is the portion of His own in having with them the Revealer of the Father.
Then, at once, taking occasion by the question of the lawyer, He depicts in the most graphic way the ruin of the Jew, the most privileged man here upon earth. It was ruin which was irretrievable and hopeless as far as the earth was concerned. Nothing that had been set up on earth, even by the institution of God, could reach the need; the priest and Levite passed by. But when He speaks of "a certain Samaritan", we understand that He speaks of Himself; He hides Himself under this figure. He was a Stranger in virtue of the place from which He came, and man gave Him no place here.
This stranger crosses the path of the needy traveller, coming not by chance, as did the priest and the Levite, but "journeying". We see how, in the deep compassion of His heart, He binds up the wounds, pouring in the oil and wine, and then, setting him on His own beast, He brings him to an inn and takes care of him. He not only meets the depth of his need, but, from the time of his complete ruin, up to the moment when he sees His face again, He fully provides for him. "Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt expend more, *I* will render to thee on my coming back". He puts him under the shelter of the roadside inn, and whatever his need may be, he is cared for at the sole expense of his Benefactor. We
{315}
can think of that man in peace as to all his need. His heart is attached to the One who has so wondrously wrought for him, and he is longing to see Him again. In every way he is constituted a stranger here. The One who has met his need does not re-instate him in Jerusalem, or bring him to any place which he can call home, but simply to the shelter of the inn, with the hope of His coming again.
Then, further, it is not only that his need is met, but His own way of doing it attracts the heart to Himself. That peculiar touch, and the sight of the face of that heavenly Stranger, morally constitutes the one who has gazed upon it a stranger here on earth.
Now! do we understand the grace which gives us no home here where Jesus had none? Our need is fully met in the place where it is manifest; we are fully provided for, until the moment of seeing His face; countless mercies flow to us, and for everything we are indebted to Him; yet it is but the shelter of an inn He gives us here, not a home.
In chapter 15, we have the fulness of His grace. The key to the chapter no doubt is in its beginning. The religious men of the day reproached Him, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them". It was perfectly true, so far as it went, but it was short of the truth. We should never expect a perfect exposition of the grace of God from its adversaries. They might see the grace and yet despise Him in whom it was expressed. He shows the full, blessed truth. He not only receives sinners, but He seeks
{316}
after that which was lost "until he find it". He did eat with sinners here upon earth as the expression of grace; but that grace brings them to eat with Himself. Thus in both points He goes far beyond their statement.
His far-reaching grace thus goes after that which is lost, "*until he find it*". But when found, to what place does He bring it? To that which is called "home"! "And when he cometh *home*" (Authorised Version). There is no setting it down until in the very place where He Himself abides. It is the place which is *home* to Him, where He ever rests in divine affections; to that place He brings the objects of His love. The latter part of the chapter continues the story in its own way; the Father's love, His kisses, the perfect fitness for His own house, which He bestows, and the soul set in all the deep eternal joy of the Father's presence.
On the one hand we have our place of strangership set forth in the roadside inn; on the other, the character of the home to which the blessed Lord brings us. Every heart that loves Him through grace, would desire no home here -- not even Jerusalem -- where He had none. We own the grace which gives us part in His heavenly strangership here, as it gives us to have our one true, blessed home where He is, in all the affections of the Father's heart.
May God in His infinite grace teach us these things more deeply!

"THE LIGHT OF LIFE"
E. J. McBride
@John 8: 10 - 12; @John 9: 1 - 3; @John 10: 11; @John 11: 25; @John 12: 3
I wanted to speak as simply as I could of the effect of divine light in the soul. I do not know if we are sufficiently alive to the immense privilege of having light in the soul -- light as to God. We as Christians have all been affected by the peculiar grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. @Titus 2: 11 tells us that "the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared", and the appearing of that grace here in this world has saved the situation for God. I have no doubt that, as the effect of that grace having appeared, God will be able to look round in the day to come and see everywhere a vast system of things saved absolutely and entirely from sin and from Satan's power. A scene, indeed, as wholly and entirely saved as if the ruthless hand of Satan, and the base foot of Satan, had never been there at all.
Now think what an immense thing it would be for you if that light broke into your soul! God has secured a system of things in which there is not a trace of sin, without or within. I would connect that light with the second stoop of Jesus in @John 8. What a profound effect was to result from that stoop! The Calvary stoop comes first -- that closes up the whole question of sin and condemnation, so that the scene is cleared for God; and then you get another stoop which brings in the full light of God, all that was in the heart of God for His own pleasure. The result of the second stoop is that Jesus is found alone, and the
{318}
woman standing there. That blessed Person -- the Object of supreme complacency to God -- the Son of God, is found there with that woman.
A very serious point was at stake. There was a woman taken in the act of sin, and she is found alone with the full light of God in all its blessedness there in Jesus! He says to her, "Has no one condemned thee?" And she says, "No one, sir". No, for the cross has swept every one out of the universe.
The cross is the limitations of a man; no man can pass the cross. Hence Paul says to the Corinthians that he was determined to preach among them nothing save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified (@1 Corinthians 2: 2), so that the unhindered light of God might come out, man swept out of sight and God brought into full view. It was that light, the light of God, in which the woman stood, and the Lord says to her, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more". Think of it! No condemnation, but able to stand in the full light of God.
You can understand something of the extraordinary effect that would have on the soul of the woman. The overwhelming blessedness of it! What, never going to sin again? No, the light of God has so operated that there is a woman on earth who is as happy as if she were in heaven already. There is no condemnation for a soul who has accepted the cross. She had lived a history of condemnation; she was self-condemned, and the pangs of sin are quite enough without any other condemnation when one is brought into the light of God. So the Lord says,
{319}
"Neither do I condemn thee" -- the condemnation question is all over, the cross has met all that, and you shall go, and sin no more for ever. We sometimes sing:
<blockquote> 'That we as like Thee might become, <br> As we unlike had been'. </blockquote>
I wonder if we believe it? Like *Him* in all His blessedness -- His peerlessness!
The ark is a most wonderful figure in Scripture (@Exodus 25: 10 - 22). There was that golden box holding the testimony of God, and over it the cherubim of glory gazing down upon it. What, in type, did they see there? The rights of God absolutely vindicated in a Man! Everything maintained in integrity; the rights of God maintained in a Man who never sinned, who knew no sin. Have you got that light in your soul? Perhaps you may say, How can it come to pass that that woman shall never sin again? Well, you have got to look at the person in a totally different light. Do not raise the question of your state, or of your parentage -- "no condemnation" has settled all that, that question is over; but *that* is not the light for the moment. The situation now is that God is operating in the souls of believers, in the youngest and the oldest, to bring about what is for His own glory, something that is as unsinful as Christ. Think of it, that is what God is doing today.
The man in chapter 9: 1 was without a ray of light, he was blind; and he had not a penny of his

own, he was a beggar; a blind beggar. That is the kind of person in whom God begins His operations. He waits till the due time has come, for if there was one ray of light or strength left in us we should say that helped the situation, but when we are "without strength" then it is God's "due time" (@Romans 5: 6), and He begins to work. So this blind man was a fit subject for the operations of God.
When Jacob left his father's house he lighted on a certain place, we read, and took a stone and laid himself down to sleep, and he had a dream (@Genesis 28: 10 - 15). Where did it come from? from the operations of God. When that man fell asleep, God, as it were, said, I will suggest in a dream what I am going to do with him. We might have expected Him to solve his exercises for him, overrule his failures, help him out of his difficulties. But no, God says, I will use those very things to manifest *My work*. What a wonderful Operator God is! What wonderful work is His! That is what God would impress on us; He would bring us to know *Himself*.
