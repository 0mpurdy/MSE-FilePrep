THE HYMN BOOK REVISION 1951
Although the possibility of another revision of the Hymn Book had been in the minds of some brethren since the establishment of the ministry as to the Person of the Holy Spirit, and of the liberty which the brethren were enjoying in speaking to Him, it did not take any very concrete form until the close of a meeting in London with Mr. James Taylor in July, 1950¦. The reference then to the "hymn" in @Matthew 26: 30 gave the opportunity for enquiry to be made as to the comeliness of introducing hymns to the Spirit. The lack of any such in the existing hymn book was evident, and it was remarked that if the service of God required them, the Lord would undoubtedly help the brethren to add them. It was also indicated that many of the brethren felt the time had come to seek help from the Lord to fill out the service of God by singing to the Spirit.
About three weeks later, a goodly number of brothers, drawn from all parts of the British Isles and including as many as were available from overseas, came together at Teddington to confer on the matter. It was evident that the brethren were of one mind as to the desirability of revising the Hymn Book, and Mr. A. E. Myles agreed to take on the responsibility for the work in answer to the wishes of the brethren. Provision was made at that time for new hymns of any kind to be considered
¦See "Readings in Matthew's Gospel " (Volume 183) page 214.
{3}
and certain suggestions were made as to the type felt to be needed, in addition to those addressed to the Holy Spirit.
The work proceeded forthwith, and it soon became evident, from the extensive correspondence received as to the existing hymns, that there was sufficient exercise among the brethren to justify a complete revision of the book. It was, therefore, decided that all subsequent work should proceed with this in view.
For the next few months the work continued daily, various brethren frequently being invited to help. On two or three occasions larger gatherings were held so that the brethren could be informed about the progress of the work, and express their judgment as to some of the many new hymns submitted.
The preliminary work was completed by the end of January, 1951, and in that month Mr. Myles went to America with the intention of going through the provisionally-selected hymns -new and old-in detail with Mr. Taylor. The discussion on the hymns took place in a series of meetings in New York, extending over several months, at which one or two other brothers were usually present. In May, 1951, when the task was finished, save for various details, Mr. Myles was taken very seriously ill with a stroke and was unable to contribute further to the work. The responsibility for carrying the service through to completion, as well as attending to other matters connected with the revision, was therefore taken Over by others.
{4}
One of the outstanding features of the revision has been the direction in which the help of God has been particularly manifest. While the exercise as to the revision largely arose through the desire to have hymns addressed to the Holy Spirit-and many choice hymns of this type have been received-they have been fewer in number than those addressed to the other divine Persons. This has been taken to indicate the mind of the Spirit that, even in the matter of the Hymn Book, He would not have us make too much of Himself, as He is here in relation to the Father and the Son. The fact that manifest help has been given in hymns composed to the Father and to God is rather striking in view of the comments at the time of the 1932 revision. It was said then:
<blockquote>"In view of the abundant light, instruction and grace God has so graciously ministered to His people during the last one hundred years, it has to be owned that (excepting those by J.N.D. and a few others) the hymns composed in response are not in quality such as might have been reasonably expected; the paucity of hymns suitable for the worship of the Father in the assembly is especially to be noted. The exercise entering into the present revision may lead to more depth of spiritual feeling, intelligence and ability for poetic compositions, so that what is desired may yet be forthcoming. May God grant it!" </blockquote>
In connection with the number of hymns addressed to each of the divine Persons it has been borne in mind that Scripture presents the Father as supreme in the Economy, and both the Son and the Spirit as serving in relation
{5}
to that supremacy, the Son having the second place and the Spirit the third place. It was felt that this order should be reflected, in some way, in the number of worshipful hymns addressed to each. The book would be considered out of balance if, for example, it contained more worshipful hymns to the Lord Jesus than to the Father. It has also been thought that the recognition of the relative places of the Persons of the Godhead in the Economy is essential before the worship of God Himself (embracing all three Persons made known under the one Name, according to @Matthew 28) can be taken up intelligently, and that real power in the souls of the saints is needed if God Himself is to be the Object of worship in the assembly. There are, however, a number of new hymns provided addressed to God having the three Persons in mind. A few of these contain a verse to each of the Persons severally and then the last verse gathers up the great truth that God is One, thus giving us the fullest sense in which we can have Deity before our minds. Since it was a matter of considerable exercise in the 1932 revision to exclude hymns having a verse addressed to the Father, then one to the Lord, and again a verse to the Father (this being spoken of as "oscillation" ) it is understandable that questions have been raised as to whether the inclusion of hymns of the type just referred to represents any departure from our understanding of the truth governing procedure in the service of God. It has been in mind, however, that there should
{6}
be no regression on this matter, the two apparently conflicting thoughts being reconciled by an understanding of the oneness of Deity. The essential equality of the Persons of the Godhead is always maintained and only adds lustre and glory to the relative positions in which each may be viewed separately. It is never contemplated that we, in any sense, go beyond the economy in our relations with divine Persons, but it is felt that the blessed Spirit is helping us now into a greater understanding of the worship of God Himself, the title being used in its fullest sense, that is as including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In the light of this and according to the help and liberty which the Spirit may afford at the time, it is thought to be in order to address an expression of worship to each Person at the highest point in the service of God. If, as recognising the supremacy of the Father and then the glorious greatness of God Himself, we are to be helped to devote an increasing amount of time to that part of the service, then the additional hymns of this character should be particularly valuable. May we not humbly feel that they have been brought into the book under the influence of the Spirit in view of the saints being led by Him into a fuller knowledge of the blessedness of God Himself?
The recognition of the oneness of the Godhead brought under critical review certain expressions which may attribute something to one divine Person to the exclusion of the others. This largely centred in the use of the word "alone"
{7}
which occurs with surprising frequency in the old book. In the light of the oneness of the Godhead, it is hardly right to sing:--
<blockquote>"O wondrous Saviour! Jesus, Lord, <br>Worthy *alone* to be adored!" </blockquote>
or
<blockquote>"Thou, the Lamb, *alone* art worthy". </blockquote>
In these two cases, as in many others, it has only been necessary to make a slight alteration in the wording to guard this point of doctrine. For a similar reason, we might hesitate now to say: "Jesus! our only joy art Thou" or, "Thou alone remainest when all else is gone". Such expressions, in many time-honoured hymns, have a certain sentimental value, but they can hardly remain when examined in the light of the truth the Spirit is now bringing before the saints. On the other hand, there are several instances where it is perfectly correct to attach the word "alone" to the work of one of the Persons of the Godhead. For example:--
<blockquote>"Thou, Lord, to death's domain, <br>Didst go *alone*". </blockquote>
and
<blockquote>"*Alone* He bare the cross, *Alone* its grief sustained;" </blockquote>
These are beautifully true and choice expressions which bring out the unique glory of the Son as the one who has died for us. The word "alone" may clearly also be applied when the greatness of God Himself is before the soul as, for example:--
<blockquote>"To God -- *alone*, <br>Dwelling in uncreated light". </blockquote>
{8}
It is felt that the careful checking of this point throughout the book will not only help the brethren into a greater appreciation of the oneness of the Godhead, but it will serve to bring out the distinctive glory connected with the manhood of Christ.
The question of the relative positions which divine Persons have taken in the Economy has been very particularly borne in mind in examining hymns addressed either entirely or in part to the Holy Spirit. It came out distinctly in the discussion which took place on the occasion of the Teddington meeting,¦ that while Deity is as full in the Holy Spirit as in the other Persons of the Godhead, yet He has been pleased to take certain positions to augment the service to both the Father and the Son, and this should be in our minds when addressing Him. This led to much helpful enquiry as to the most suitable title by which the Spirit might be addressed in hymns, particularly those intended for use in the service of God. For example, where the Spirit is helping us in relation to our approach to the Father, such titles as "Spirit of Adoption" or "Spirit of the Father" seem particularly appropriate. If the Spirit is viewed separately, in His own distinctive glory, then the titles "the Spirit" or "the Holy Spirit" are suitable, but in that way He is viewed as taking the third place in the Economy. In view of the help which has been afforded in recognising the *upward* trend in the service of God on the Lord's Day morning, it would seem
¦See J.T.¬s ministry, Volume 183, page 280.
{9}
that worshipful hymns to the Spirit by *Himself*, should have their place *early* in the service; although, on the other hand, the recognition of the Spirit's place in the Deity would indicate the rightness of ascribing praise to Him along with the Father and the Son in the worship of God at the *end* of the service. An understanding of what has been called the Spirit's "augmentary" service has helped much and has given liberty for Him to be addressed at any time, the manner of address being in keeping with the subject in mind at that time. For example, hymns will be found which bring out the Spirit's "augmentary" service in relation to the Lord's Supper. These are of such a character that they do not detract from the truth that it is the *Lord's* Supper, but rather that our consciousness of the Spirit, at that moment, is that He is helping us in relation to the Lord Jesus.
The service of the Spirit in relation more to our wilderness needs, has also been in mind and a good many hymns have been composed on this line. Such hymns make use of the titles "Spirit of Truth", "Comforter", "Guide", and so on, and these will serve very happily for use at Reading meetings, Prayer meetings, and other occasions during the week. The understanding that the Spirit is in charge of divine interests in the assembly has been recognised in hymns intended for use when the brethren are together in relation to matters of care. In all this work, the great variety of glories attaching to the blessed Person of the
{10}
Holy Spirit have come very prominently to light and it is believed that the use of these hymns will result in His having a greater place in the minds and affections of the saints. No doubt, the Spirit Himself will afford the needed help in the use of hymns addressed to Himself, but an attempt has been made in the Hymn Book to provide what is thought to be suitable for all phases of assembly service.
In connection with other phases of the service of God, it will be noticed that quite a number of hymns addressed to the Lord Jesus have been included bringing in the responses of His brethren and also marital response and the thought of the assembly's union with Christ. It has been felt by many for some time that in view of the help which has been given on Paul's ministry and the service of God, hymns of this type have been lacking. It is hoped that this lack has now been met, and that the brethren will find a suitable variety of hymns for use in this part of the service, and particularly such as will enrich what is uniquely for the heart of Christ.
One further matter should be referred to in connection with hymns for use in the service of God and that is those which might express response to God according to @Ephesians 3: 21: "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus" and @Hebrews 2: 12
"In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". Much enquiry into the truth took place in connection with such hymns, particularly as to the way in which the assembly is
{11}
presented in Scripture and it was felt that when the assembly is viewed *femininely* it is always as in relation to Christ and not as in relation to the Father-the reference to the assembly in @Ephesians 3 being that of a *vessel* in which glory to God eternally will be secured.
It has been thought that we need one or two more hymns for use at burials and particularly such as would bring in the great hope of the rapture as well as the truth of the resurrection. In connection with hymns which touch on the portion of those who have fallen asleep through Jesus, it was noted how little detail on this subject is given in Scripture and how easy it is for the mind to form impressions which really have no scriptural foundation. Hymn 37 in the old book, although much loved and used, was not felt to be free from criticism or to have very much positive truth in it; indeed it had been the subject of much discussion at the time of the 1932 revision, and it has now been omitted. There are several fresh hymns to take its place which bring in the thoughts indicated above and keep accurately to the teaching of Scripture.
Reference should now be made to an exercise which was voiced at the time of the Teddington meeting, namely that brethren all over the world walking in the truth should, *in principle*, be singing the same hymns. Although it was evident that this would involve many practical difficulties, it was certainly thought to be a right exercise and one involving an important principle, namely that we are all to be governed
{12}
by the truth and by an assembly outlook, these features meeting all differences of nationality and language. It would also be a positive movement on the lines of endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit. The beloved brethren on the Continent expressed themselves as in sympathy with the suggestion.
A large number of hymns, written in many different languages, was carefully and prayerfully considered and where there was felt to be a hymn of real quality an attempt was made to put a translation of it into English poetry. The help of the Holy Spirit has unquestionably been proved in this matter, and in the revised English Hymn Book the brethren will find approximately fifty hymns which had originally been written in other languages. It has been realised that a complete translation of all the hymns in the new English book (which has been happily spoken of as an "assembly book" ) would be well-nigh impossible, and provision has been made for "equivalent" hymns in the various languages. These will be hymns sufficiently similar in theme to be taken instead of translations, thereby reducing the amount of work involved. It is clear that the number of hymns to be translated and the number to be regarded as "equivalent" can only be decided upon by the brethren handling the work in the respective countries, and it is felt that they will undoubtedly be guided in this by the help afforded by the Holy Spirit as the work proceeds, but in view of the valuable teaching in many of the hymns (especially those for use in
{13}
the service of God) our dear brethren have been encouraged to translate as many of the hymns as possible, taking whatever time may be needed to do it. The prayers of the brethren may well be directed to God on their behalf that they may be greatly helped in all this labour of love at the present time. It is a source of encouragement and thanksgiving that already they are speaking of experiencing distinct help in the work of translation.
The introduction of a considerable number of the new types of hymns-long desired by the brethren-and the exercise to include a goodly number of hymns written in other languages are two reasons which have contributed to the omissions from the old book. A very few hymns have been deleted because they are now felt to be questionable as to doctrine, more have been deleted because time has shown that they are rarely used, but most of the deletions have been made because it has been felt that there were now others of richer quality available. It was particularly thought that the Holy Spirit had given ability to many brothers and sisters, able to write hymns from an *assembly* outlook, as they themselves were happily walking in the light of it, and that we should avail ourselves of these. Such were felt to have a distinctive value at the present time and it is believed that as they are taken up with spiritual exercise their use will substantially enrich the service of song in the assembly. It is a fact to be recorded that well over two thousand new compositions were submitted in
{14}
view of this revision, which gives some indication of the body of exercise which the desire to enrich the service of God has aroused, and this has doubtless been pleasing to Him.
In addition to the large number of new hymns submitted, a careful search has been made among the poetical writings of Mr. Bevir, Mr. Chater, Mr. Pellatt and others who have had an honoured place in the testimony, to see if there was anything which might be drawn upon. Some good hymns have come out of this search and are included in the book. It may be that the Spirit has reserved them for use at this time and the brethren will, no doubt, judge as to their spiritual quality and suitability for this purpose. Mr. Darby's writings have again been scrutinized, for his hymns are gladly recognised as being outstanding, and it is thought that we should have everything of his that we can possibly use. It is a striking fact that despite all the help and adjustment which the saints have continually been receiving on the service of God, Mr. Darby's hymns remain in their distinctiveness. During the three revisions of the book that have now taken place since his departure to be with Christ, practically seventy years ago, the substance of his hymns has hardly been touched. This illustrates a feeling that the personality of an author cannot be entirely dissociated from his hymn and this has been borne in mind generally. In this connection it has been observed that in the first offerings in Scripture-those of Cain and Abel-Jehovah is specifically said to take
{15}
account of the offerer as well as the offering. See @Genesis 4: 4, 5.
The suggestion was made by several that there was need for more gospel hymns, particularly those of an appealing type, and many well-known hymns were mentioned. These were all considered but many of them were felt to be unsuitable in that they contained so little positive truth and sometimes no reference at all to the work of Christ in any aspect. In selecting the gospel hymns it was in mind that fullest room should be made to express the compassions of God and the longing of our hearts to secure souls, but that the dignity of the book should not be lowered by introducing anything which was beneath the proper level of Christianity. Any gospel hymn in our book should be such as could be put alongside of the most exalted hymn that v e have to God. Several fresh gospel hymns have, however, been included, both new and old, and the level of some of the existing ones has been raised by the addition of a verse or two having particularly in mind to introduce some reference to the Holy Spirit. The gospel hymns are no longer grouped in a separate section at the end of the book as this arrangement tends to give the appearance that the gospel is one thing and the assembly another, whereas, from the viewpoint of the whole truth, they are one matter.
It is thought that the following brief comments on some of the hymns separately and especially the reasons for the changes which
{16}
have been made in many of the old ones will be of interest and possible value to the brethren. Changes which occur many times and which have already been referred to in a general way (such as those occasioned by the word "alone" ) are not included.
The numbers used below are those from the new book, but the old numbers, where they differ from the new, are given in brackets afterwards to facilitate comparisons being made.
<b>Hymn 6.</b> The expression "*half* so dear", as in the original last line of verse 1, was rather a poor comparison and has been changed. Also, in verse 2, the idea of "tracing" the path seems to be more suitably connected with us than with God.
<b>Hymn 13. </b> The order of the verses has been changed and the old first verse has been deleted for reasons given earlier in this paper. Furthermore, the expression "The shadow dwelt on Calv'ry's tree" was not felt to be strong enough. There was more than "shadow" then; hence the alteration in verse 3.
<b>Hymn 35. </b> The last verse has been changed because worship in the service of God was thought to be more from controlled vessels which are filled by the Spirit and then poured out, rather than the idea of what overflows. This is a different thought from that of our satisfaction suggested in the expression "my cup runneth over" in Psalm 23. It is for the same reason that the change has been made in verse 2 of 41 (42) and in verse 3 of 151.
<b>Hymn 45 (305). </b> The word "flowed" in verse 1 replaces the word "drawn", because the latter tends to make the shedding of that precious blood appear too much the act of another. The soldier's spear was but the instrument, the flowing of the blood was the great witness of divine love.
{17}
<b>Hymn 59. </b> The voice from out of the cloud was of Him, not to Him as at the baptism; hence the small change in verse 2.
<b>Hymn 60 (56). </b> The word "Abba" (originally in verse 1) is only used by the Lord in holy intimacy in direct address to the Father. It is really the intensification of the title "Father" and it is not thought to be a suitable word to use in a general sense by itself. When used by us, according to Romans 8: 15, it is also as directly addressing the Father, and its use in this way as in verse 2 and 3 of 450 (131) is not questioned.
<b>Hymn 77 (171). </b> The last half of verse 1 has been adjusted to connect the love of Christ with His death and not to confine it, as in the old version, to Bethlehem's manger.
<b>Hymn 79. </b> The eighth verse is new to this hymn, although it has been in the old book as verse 3 of 77. It was written by Mr. Darby and seems to fit most suitably at the close of this choice hymn of his.
<b>Hymn 85. </b> The new verses added are all from J.N.D.¬s book of "Spiritual Songs".
<b>Hymn 87. </b> The verses frequently used in the service of God have been deleted and grouped together as a separate hymn, i.e. 88.
<b>Hymn 94 (62). </b> Some have questioned the bringing in of what is future (as in verse 5: "Where sons at home *shall be*" ) when, by the Spirit's power, we are already enjoying the position of sonship. It has been felt, however, that it is perfectly in order to do this, the Spirit being "the earnest of our inheritance". The thought of the glory of divine power that will soon give us the position in actuality can certainly have a place in our praises now. For this same reason, no change has been made in verse 5 of 135.
<b>Hymn 102 (309). </b> The Lord's blood was shed for our cleansing and redemption, but Scripture connects the idea of ransom with *Himself*, e.g. 1 Timothy 2: 6. This
{18}
accounts for the change in line 3 of the chorus. It also accounts for a similar change in verse 4 of 344 (374). An attempt has been made throughout the Gospel hymns to preserve the distinction Scripture makes between "sin" and "sins". Forgiveness, or atonement (which is the idea of a covering) is connected with "sins", but "sin", the root principle, is not forgiven, it is always judged. (See footnote in J.N.D.¬s Translation to Romans 5: 12 and compare Romans 4: 7 with Romans 8:3.) These relatively small changes serve to illustrate an exercise which has been in mind throughout the whole of this revision, and that is that in considering hymns which may be suitable the very *"words* of God" should be before us (see 1 Chronicles 25: 5 - 7) and the help of the Holy Spirit has continually been sought to this end.
<b>Hymn 109 (new book only). </b> Enquiry has been raised as to whether the striving of the Spirit applies at the present time, it being connected in Scripture with the days of Noah. It was thought, however, that although the Spirit's service now may be peculiarly connected with the testimony of the Christ, we could not exclude the idea of His striving with men from His present activities.
<b>Hymn 119. </b> The alteration in verse 3 has been made lest the Lord's place as Man in the Father's affections should appear to be connected with His position in Deity "ere time began".
<b>Hymn 131 (new book only). </b> It will be of interest that this hymn by Daniel Otsing was written in 1917, about the time of the Russian Revolution. He subsequently suffered much persecution in that country and in 1936, at the age of 86, he was banished to Siberia, where he died one year later.
<b>Hymn 136. </b> According to John 1: 18, the Father's bosom is the Lord's present place, that verse being written after His ascension. This accounts for the changes in the last two lines of verse 1.
{19}
<b>Hymn 137. </b> Alterations have been made in several hymns, intended for use in the service of God, where both the Lord Jesus and the Father were addressed in the same hymn, since these were liable to lead the brethren on before they were ready. It has also been in mind in this Revision to avoid, as far as possible, the necessity of dividing hymns up and giving out separate verses. In this particular case, the old fifth verse has, therefore, been deleted and it appears by itself as Hymn 243.
<b>Hymn 145 (140). </b> The expression "God makes no more delay" as originally in verse 2, implies that there had previously been a delay and this hardly seems a right word to apply to the extension, in divine wisdom, of the present dispensation.
<b>Hymn 148 (121). </b> The change in the last line of verse 2 guards the truth that the taking of a bondman's form, according to Philippians 2: 7, is the Lord's own action. He was not *made* a bondman.
<b>Hymn 166. </b> The old rendering of the second line of verse 2 tended to overlook the service of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. Further, many have felt that the original last line of this hymn was rather weak, although the linking of "watching" with "prayer" is, of course, scriptural. This thought is not retained in the present version, but the hymn finishes in a less awkward manner.
<b>Hymn 171 (109). </b> The slight change in verse 2 has been made for the same reason as that given elsewhere in connection with the word "alone". The love of Jesus is certainly above all *earthly* love, but it seems happier not to use expressions which permit of comparative thoughts between Divine Persons.
<b>Hymn 172. </b> While natural links are only provisional, and cannot be compared with the spiritual and eternal links that we have in, and with, Christ, it was felt that the original rendering of verse 3 went too far. It seems hardly right to speak of the mercies which God Himself has given to us (and which
{20}
we receive, from His hand) as being "but dross", nor the closest of nature's ties as being "but loss".
<b>Hymn 187 (335). </b> The fact that the Lord died *before* His blood was shed has necessitated a few corrections in some of the hymns where the two thoughts have been brought together. In addition to verse 2 of this hymn, similar changes have been made in 227, verse 4, and 423 (351), verse 2.
<b>Hymn 190. </b> Three more verses from J.N.D.¬s poem, "The Man of Sorrows" have been added to this hymn. Existing hymns already composed from other verses of this poem (originally 193 and 232) have now been brought together and appear consecutively as 188, 189 and 190, the order of the verses throughout the three hymns corresponding roughly with that of the original poem.
<b>Hymn 191 (126). </b> This hymn has acquired a certain distinction during the last few years as it was the only one which even approached the thought of response to the Spirit. For this reason there has been a desire to retain it, but it has needed considerable revision to make it compared with other worshipful hymns addressed to God. In particular, verse 1 has been changed to the thought of sonship rather than that of children.
<b>Hymn 202 (323). </b> The old second verse has been deleted as the hymn was so long. The old fourth verse of 216 (353) has gone for the same reason.
<b>Hymn 224 (214). </b> The alteration of the expression "love's full fountain" in verse 4, will serve to illustrate a point raised frequently during the revision and which has occasioned small changes in many hymns, and that is the personification of "love". Although 1 Corinthians 13 permits this in a limited way, an examination of the hymns reveals how extensively the thought has entered into the minds of hymn-writers, and how frequently phrases such as "love's home", "love's realm", "love's plan", "love's embrace" and so on, are found in our
{21}
hymns. In many cases they have a certain poetical appeal and have, no doubt, been used, and liked, for this reason, but the constant repetition of them unconsciously takes the mind away from the Persons themselves. Scripture clearly states that "God is love" and that "love is of God", but it would not be right to assume that the words are interchangeable. While, therefore, the use of any of the above phrases by itself would not be questioned, the accumulation of them is questionable and for this reason many have been deleted or altered.
<b>Hymn 226 (187). </b> Despite some criticism, the word "covenant" has been retained in verse 4. It does not say "*new* covenant", nor is this inferred, and while the hymn was originally written to be sung in the service of God, it is now felt to be more suitable for general purposes.
<b>Hymn 233. </b> The word "unchanged" has deliberately been introduced in verse 4 as a stronger word than "remains".
<b>Hymn 247. </b> Two fresh verses of J.N.D.¬s have been added to the original verse 1 of this hymn, while the remaining verses now form a separate hymn, i.e. 249.
<b>Hymn 248 (328). </b> An attempt has been made to keep Gospel hymns *with choruses* to a minimum. They tend to make a hymn, over long, and if they are just repetition of words having little additional substance (which is frequently the case) they may detract from the body of the hymn. The well-known tune can still be sung to this hymn quite suitably without its chorus, or tunes of 11.11.11.11 metre can now be used. The shortening of the hymn by the omission of the chorus has permitted a new verse to be added, bringing in the gift of Holy Spirit.
<b>Hymn 259. </b> While it is not questioned that the love of Christ as witnessed in *suffering will* have a place in our praises eternally, it is thought that the change in the last verse will be generally approved.
{22}
<b>Hymn 266 and 280 (277). </b> The old hymn 277 has been divided up into two parts and a new verse of J.N.D.¬s added to one of them, i.e. 266. The small change in verse 3 of this hymn (originally verse 5) to bring in a reference to the Spirit, will not pass unnoticed. The verses as they now stand are rich in suggestions of the blessed harmony marking the activities of divine Persons within the Economy, and the affections existing between Them. The first three verses of the old 277 are retained as 280 and the single word changed in the first line has been made purely for indexing purposes to avoid confusion with 266.
<b>Hymn 276 and 291 (177). </b> The old hymn 177 has been divided up so as to permit the sequence of events as they will take place to be followed. 291 refers to the appearing and then to Israel's part, while 276 is a separate ascription from the bride now in anticipation of that day.
<b>Hymn 285 (163). </b> We do not know that we shall say "He died that we might live" *eternally*, but we certainly and gladly say it *now* ; hence the change in verse 3, line 4.
<b>Hymn 293. </b> The verses of this very choice hymn have been rearranged to present a somewhat more continuous sequence of thoughts working up to the climax of God's eternal rest.
<b>Hymn 294 (258). </b> The word "die" has been introduced into verse 4 as more scriptural than "pass", and to avoid any resemblance to the common and unscriptural expression "passed away".
<b>Hymn 303 (296). </b> It is thought that the serviceability of this hymn will be increased by the alteration made in the last verse, so that the hymn is now one addressed entirely to the Lord.
<b>Hymn 304 (88). </b> The old fourth verse has been omitted because it was not thought to be accurate to connect the idea of "crowning" with the form of God. Crowning is the act of another and the Lord is crowned as Man.
{23}
<b>Hymn 325 (226). </b> Some question having been raised as to whether we are at liberty to speak of what was in the Lord's thoughts when He was dying, verse 2, has been altered. In addition to guarding this matter, the alterations introduce the truth that the Lord's brethren (as in John 20: 17) are the fruit of His death.
<b>Hymn 357 (371). </b> The new verse 2 brings in the sovereign action of the Spirit in new birth, a matter very rarely touched on in the hymns (see also 18, verse 2).
<b>Hymn 370 (186). </b> The alteration to the last verse of this hymn affords another illustration of the exercise to introduce references to the service of the Holy Spirit where they appear to be somewhat lacking.
<b>Hymn 375 (289). </b> The original first line of this hymn, although having a certain grandeur, has been questioned and it has, therefore, been altered and the assembly title "Lord Jesus" introduced.
<b>Hymn 423 (351). </b> The expressions as to being on the breast of Jesus and in His bosom are felt to be special to John and ought not to be generally extended; hence the change in verse 5.
<b>Hymn 444 (243). </b> While recognising Paul's word in Romans 7: 18: "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell" it is thought to be going too far to say that no good can be found in creatures, as they are God's handiwork. This accounts for the change in verse 3, which has also permitted a more positive statement to be introduced.
<b>Hymn 458 (368). </b> verse 3 has been carefully reviewed lest it should appear to indicate that the Lord's blood is literally in heaven. It was felt, however, that the present wording is a permissible moral expression and implies that the value and efficacy of that blood are continually before God.
<b>Hymn 461 (20). </b> The original fourth verse has been deleted as some of the expressions in it were not thought to be sufficiently reverent.
{24}
<b>Hymn 463 (239). </b> Since this hymn bears directly upon the Lord's Supper, the references to the covenant of God and heart of God have been deleted.
<b>Hymn 464 (229). </b> The original two verses finished with the thought that the graces of Christ were brought through death to resurrection. While this is not questioned in the least, and the truth of the resurrection is recognised as the moral basis of everything, it is felt that the reference to the wider display of those glories will be appreciated. The new third verse has been added from the same original hymn by Mr. Champney.
<b>Hymn 472 (138). </b> The sixth verse in the old hymn has been deleted because the singing of it involuntarily tends to lead on to the Father, whereas the theme of the other verses suggests that the hymn has its use early after the Supper.
<b>Hymn 479 (249). </b> The original fourth verse has been deleted, not in any sense because it is inaccurate, but the early verses link directly with the Lord's Supper and our position in the scene where He died. In the light of this we may regard the Lord either as feelingly near to us as in the scene of testimony according to Matthew 28: 20, or as coming to us according to John 14: 18. The bringing in of His position of exaltation at this point (blessedly true as it is) tends to detract from the other thoughts.
