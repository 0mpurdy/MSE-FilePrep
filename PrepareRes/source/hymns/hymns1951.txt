W. COWPER (1731-1800) Adapted, C.M.
|1|
Of all the Gifts Thy love bestows,
Thou Giver of all good!
E'en heav'n itself no richer knows
Than the Redeemer's blood
|2|
Faith, too, that trusts the blood through grace,
From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.
|3|
We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more;
To Thee our all we owe;
The precious Saviour, and the power
That makes Him precious too.
{2}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884) Adapted, 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Father, 'twas Thy love that knew us
Earth's foundation long before;
That same love to Jesus drew us
By its sweet constraining power,
And hath made us
Sons before Thee evermore.
|2|
Now that changeless love enfolds us,
All its wealth on us bestows;
While its power unchanging holds us
In a holy calm repose.
God and Father,
Unto Thee our worship flows.
{3}
E. J. BOYT, L.M.
|1|
As Head, O God, exalted Thou,
Riches and glory are of Thee;
Thou rulest over all in love,
And in that love Thy sons are free.
|2|
Now in Thy hand is power and might,
Thy Spirit makes all great and strong;
So we as strengthened thus for Thee,
Now praise Thy glorious name in song.
|3|
Thy glorious Name! A hush divine
Falls on our spirits as we sing.
God -- Father, Son and Holy Ghost --
To Thee our worship now we bring.
{4}
MISS A. M. HARDING, 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
Thine is the love, Lord, that draws us together,
Guiding our steps from the wilderness ways;
Soon face to face we'll adore Thee for ever,
Now our glad hearts would be filled with Thy praise.
|2|
While for this moment, O Lord, we have waited,
Oft has the Comforter spoken of Thee;
Now with love's treasure our spirits are freighted,
Bowed at Thy feet, and the fragrance set free.
|3|
For us, Lord Jesus, thyself Thou hast given;
Suff'rings unfathomed for us hast thou known;
Now, in accord with the homage of heaven,
Rises a song from the hearts of Thine own.
|4|
Jesus, Lord Jesus, we love and adore Thee;
Glorious Thy Name, all our praises above;
Peerless Thy beauty, we wait now before Thee,
Hushed are our spirits, at rest in Thy love.
{5}
MRS. H. A. BERG, 10.10.4.10.10.4.
|1|
Father of glory, Thine is now the praise,
As in the light of heav'n's unclouded rays
We lift our song.
The glory of a past eternal plan,
The glory of a love ere time began,
To Thee belong.
|2|
We glory in the thought that Thou wast there
Before there was a creature formed to share
Thy heart of love;
And worship at the mighty, sovereign thought,
The counsel that Thy Son, O God, has brought
From realms above.
|3|
To fill Thy heart this counsel were evolved;
On Him the working out of all devolved,
Through pathways sore.
What part have we as brought into this place,
Encompassed by illimitable grace,
But to adore?
|4|
We worship Thee, O God, as we divine
That thou art richer by this act of Thine --
This sovereign will;
For, added to the riches that were then,
Thou hast secured a company of men
Thy house to fill.
{6}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), C.M.
|1|
Jesus! How much Thy Name unfolds
To every opened ear!
The pardoned sinner's memory holds
No other name so dear.
|2|
That Name encircles every grace
That God as Man could show;
Thus only could we fully trace
A life divine below.
|3|
Jesus -- it speaks a life of love,
Of sorrows meekly borne;
It tells of sympathy above,
Whatever makes us mourn.
|4|
Jesus, the One who knew not sin,
Made sin to make us just;
Thou gav'st Thyself our love to win,
Our full confiding trust.
|5|
The mention of Thy Name shall bow
Our hearts to worship Thee;
The chiefest of ten thousand Thou,
Whose love has set us free.
{7}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, in Thee we taste the sweetness
Of the Tree of Life above;
Taste its own eternal meetness
For the heav'nly land we love.
|2|
In eternal counsels purposed,
Food of heav'nly life to be;
Fresh and ever new are yielded
Fruits of life on that blest Tree.
|3|
Varied fruits of richest flavour
Offers still the Tree divine;
One itself, the same for ever,
Every precious fruit is Thine;
|4|
Fruits that now our souls have tasted
By the Spirit from above,
While through desert lands we've hasted;
Fruits of perfect, endless love.
{8}
E. RUBIE, 6.6.6.5.6.6.6.5.
|1|
Our Father, we praise Thee,
Thou source of all blessing;
The Son has revealed Thee
In fulness of light.
We joy in Thy presence,
We worship before Thee
In love and, all blameless,
In holiness bright.
|2|
Blest Son, we adore Thee,
Unique is Thy glory!
Thy greatness exceedeth
Our worthiest lays.
Thyself Thou hast given,
We know Thee now risen,
A Man in the heaven
Receiving our praise.
|3|
O Spirit most holy,
Our homage we render;
From Christ and the Father
Thou camest below.
Thy presence and pleasure
We honour and treasure,
As giv'n without measure,
God's wealth to bestow.
|4|
O God we acknowledge
Thy greatness, Thy glory,
For of Thee are all things
On earth and in heav'n.
How vast is Thy fulness!
Majestic Thy splendour!
We bless Thee, we worship;
Amen and Amen!
{9}
E. PERRONET (1726-1792), C.M.
|1|
All hail the power of Jesus' Name!
Before Him prostrate fall;
With one accord His praise proclaim,
And crown Him Lord of all.
|2|
Ye saints redeemed from Adam's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.
|3|
Tell forth the only Name that's giv'n
On which we now may call,
The Name adored by hosts in heav'n,
And crown Him Lord of all.
|4|
In glory all the ransomed throng
Soon at His feet shall fall;
Join in the blest eternal song,
And crown Him Lord of all.
{10}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 6.5.11.6.5.11.
|1|
For ever with Thee, Lord,
And like Thee to be,
For ever with Thee, at Thy coming again;
We'll live in Thy grace, Lord,
We'll gaze on Thy face,
When finished our race, at Thy coming again.
|2|
The traits of that face, Lord,
Once marred through Thy grace,
With joy we shall trace at Thy coming again;
With Thee evermore, Lord,
Our hearts will adore,
Our sorrow be o'er at Thy coming again.
|3|
We'll sit on Thy throne, Lord,
Confessed as Thine own,
Of all to be known at Thy coming again.
But glory on high, Lord,
Is not like being nigh,
When all is gone by, at Thy coming again.
{11}
J. CONDER (1789-1855) Adapted, 8.6.8.6.8.8.
|1|
Thou art the blest incarnate Word,
The Father's only Son,
God manifest, God seen and heard,
The heav'n's beloved One;
The Lamb of God, exalted Lord,
Worthy art Thou to be adored!
|2|
In Thee most perfectly expressed
The Father's self doth shine:
Thou of full Deity possessed,
Eternally divine.
With Thee before the Father's face,
We celebrate His boundless grace.
|3|
Image of th' Infinite Unseen,
Whose Being none can know;
Brightness of light no eye hath seen,
God's love revealed below;
The light of love has shone in Thee,
And in that love our souls are free.
|4|
The higher myst'ries of Thy fame
The creature's grasp transcend;
The Father only (glorious claim!)
The Son can comprehend.
The sweetness of that name of love
The Spirit gives us now to prove.
|5|
Yet loving Thee, on whom His love
Ineffable doth rest,
Our hearts are led to Him above,
And we with Thee are blest.
The Father's Name Thou hast declared,
The Father's love with Thee is shared.
|6|
Of the vast universe of bliss
The centre Thou and Sun;
Th' eternal theme of praise is this,
That God's beloved Son
Fills all that scene, where God alone
In His own rest is fully known.
{12}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
Sing without ceasing, sing
The Saviour's present grace,
How all things shine in light divine
For those who've seen His face.
|2|
He's gone within the veil,
For us that place has won;
In Him we stand, a heav'nly band,
Where He Himself is gone.
|3|
There all's unsullied light,
Our hearts let in its rays;
And heav'nly light makes all things bright,
Seen in that blissful gaze.
|4|
Such here on earth we are,
Though we in weakness roam;
Our place on high, God's self so nigh,
His presence is our home.
|5|
And stayed by joy divine,
As hireling fills his day,
Through scenes of strife and desert life
We tread in peace our way.
|6|
That way is upward still,
Where life and glory are;
Our rest's above, in perfect love
The glory we shall share.
|7|
For ever with the Lord,
For ever like Him then,
We'll see His face in that blest place,
Our Father's house in heav'n.
{13}
MRS. G. HELYAR, L.M.
|1|
Lord, on the throne Thy love's the same
As once upon Thy cross of shame;
In lowliness Thou cam'st to die,
Thou livest now for us on high.
|2|
We see Thee there, the Lamb once slain;
Thy loss was our eternal gain;
We see Thee crowned with glory now,
No shade on Thy victorious brow.
|3|
The darkness shadowed Calv'ry's tree,
But now thine unveiled face we see;
Praise be to God for that blest word,
That "Thou remainest," blessed Lord!
|4|
Yes! "Thou remainest": sea and land,
E'en heav'n, shall pass, but Thou shalt stand;
Undimmed Thy radiancy appears,
Changeless through all the changing years.
{14}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hark! ten thousand voices crying
"Lamb of God!" with one accord;
Thousand thousand saints replying
Wake at once the echoing chord.
|2|
Praise the Lamb! -- the chorus waking,
All in heav'n together throng;
Loud and far, each tongue partaking,
Rolls around the endless song.
|3|
Grateful incense this, ascending
Ever to the Father's throne;
Every knee to Jesus bending,
All the mind in heav'n is one.
|4|
All the Father's counsels claiming
Equal honours to the Son;
All the Son's effulgence beaming
Makes the Father's glory known.
|5|
By the Spirit all pervading,
Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,
Crowned with light and joy unfading,
Hail Him as the great "I AM".
|6|
Joyful now the wide creation
Rests in undisturbed repose,
Blest in Jesus' full salvation,
Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.
|7|
Hark! still louder swells the singing,
As the notes are heard again;
Through creation's vault is ringing
Joy's response, Amen! Amen!
{15}
UNKNOWN from French, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Father of lights, to Thee our hearts we lift
In thanks for every good and perfect gift;
Thou lovest still -- as we approach Thy throne --
Our prayers to answer, and to bless Thine own.
|2|
Father of mercies, Thou from day to day
Dost comfort and sustain us on our way;
We praise Thee that Thou givest us below,
The depth and fulness of Thy love to know.
|3|
O Holy Father, may Thy Name be blest!
Thy chosen ones in Thee may safely rest,
Since by Thy power and with Thy presence near,
Kept in Christ Jesus, they have nought to fear.
|4|
Father of glory, who art ever wise,
How wondrous are Thy counsels in our eyes!
How vast the heritage that Thou dost see
For ever in the saints secured for Thee!
|5|
Father, we thank Thee and we bless Thy Name;
To Thee we voice our praise with one acclaim;
Thy love and grace, surpassing every need,
The deepest longings of our hearts exceed.
{16}
E. H. CHATER, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
The Saviour, Jesus, who is He?
The mighty God, a Man become!
A Saviour now for such as we,
To bring to God the wand'rers home.
His blood was shed upon the tree,
To cleanse from sin and make us free.
|2|
In this poor world thou'lt find no rest;
Then from Thy fruitless strivings cease!
Thou'lt find it in the Saviour blest,
There shall Thy soul have perfect peace.
The Saviour, Jesus, who is He?
The One who gave Himself for me!
{17}
A E MYLES, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Art thou lonely, heavy laden?
Has thy heart despondent grown?
Seems thy path to lead in darkness,
Where no ray of hope is known?
|2|
Hast thou heard of never thirsting,
Living waters, springing wells,
Streams of everlasting gladness,
Joy wherein no sadness dwells?
|3|
Wilt thou turn e'en now to Jesus,
Find in Him each longing stilled?
God invites thee, we beseech thee;
Why remain with heart unfilled?
|4|
Once on Calv'ry's cross He suffered,
Once He died and bled for thee;
Made atonement, bore the judgement,
And believing, thou art free --
|5|
Free to live to serve the Saviour,
By the Holy Spirit sealed,
Joying in that love so precious,
Which in death He has revealed;
|6|
Waiting for that call from heaven
Calling all for whom He died,
Raising dead and changing living --
Thus His heart is satisfied.
|7|
Taken up to be with Jesus
In the Father's house above;
With the ransomed hosts in glory,
Living in the Father's love.
{18}
E. A. LEE, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
Blest Holy Spirit, Thou, divine,
Unseen, yet known to us through grace,
Our Comforter and Guide until
We see our Saviour face to face:
His wondrous love, well known through Thee,
Has set our longing spirits free.
|2|
We bow and own Thy sovereign will,
Which prompted first our hearts to yield;
Blest impulse giv'n when born anew
By power divine, which Thou didst wield;
That power springs up in life by Thee,
And moves our souls responsively.
|3|
As with us, blessed Spirit, now,
Thou dost reveal the depths of love
Which eye nor ear hath seen nor heard,
The things prepared by God above.
In glad response we sing to Thee;
With joy we praise exultingly!
{19}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), S.M.
|1|
"All things are ready," Come!
Come to the supper spread;
Come, rich and poor; come, old and young,
Come, and be richly fed.
|2|
"All things are ready," Come!
O make no vain excuse;
No yoke of oxen, wife or field,
Instead of Jesus choose.
|3|
"All things are ready," Come!
The invitation's giv'n
Through Him who now in glory sits
At God's right hand in heav'n.
|4|
"All things are ready," Come!
The door is open wide;
O feast upon the love of God,
For Christ His Son has died!
|5|
"All things are ready," Come!
All hindrance is removed,
And God commends His wondrous love
In Christ so fully proved.
|6|
"All things are ready," Come!
Tomorrow may not be;
O sinner, come, the Saviour waits
This hour to welcome thee!
{20}
E. L. BEVIR, 4.8.4.8.8.
|1|
To God -- alone
Dwelling in uncreated light,
Who hast unknown
Immortal Being beyond sight --
Honour and everlasting might!
|2|
Yet though our eyes
May not behold The Deity --
So broadly lies
The gulf between all else and Thee --
We Thy revealed glories see!
|3|
By faith we see
Jesus with highest honour crowned,
And majesty
Divine and human, without bound,
Filling with joy all heav'n around!
|4|
In Him revealed
Thy counsel, ere the world began;
Nought is concealed,
O God, of all Thy wondrous plan,
Divine perfection in a Man!
|5|
Blest Potentate,
Thou, Lord of lords and sovereign King,
Shalt reign in state;
All nations shall Christ's glory sing,
To Him their gifts and treasure bring!
{21}
A. C. CRAIG, 7.7.7.7.
|1|
Holy Comforter divine,
Fullest honour now is Thine;
Godhead glory Thine own sphere,
Though in lowly service here.
|2|
Patient, gracious is Thy love,
Linking hearts to Christ above,
Filling them with holy joy --
Praising Him their blest employ.
|3|
For the Father and the Son
Is Thy blessed service done;
Their own glory to secure,
All God's purpose to assure.
{22}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
How bright, there above, is the mercy of God!
And void of all guilt, and clear of all sin,
Are my conscience and heart, through my Saviour's blood:
Not a cloud above -- not a spot within.
|2|
Christ died! then I'm clean: not a spot within.
God's mercy and love! not a cloud above.
'Tis the Spirit, through faith, thus triumphs o'er sin:
Not a cloud above -- not a spot within.
{23}
J. HART (1712-1768), 8.8.8.8.
|1|
How good is the God we adore,
Our faithful unchangeable Friend,
Whose love is as great as His power,
And knows neither measure nor end.
|2|
'Tis Jesus, the First and the Last,
Whose Spirit shall guide us safe home;
We'll praise Him for all that is past,
And trust Him for all that's to come.
{24}
S. W. GANDY (d. 1851), S.M.
|1|
His be the Victor's name,
Who fought the fight alone;
Triumphant saints no honour claim,
His conquest was their own.
|2|
Through weakness and defeat
He won the meed and crown;
Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
In being trodden down.
|3|
He Satan's power laid low;
Made sin, sin's reign o'erthrew;
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,
And death by dying slew.
|4|
Bless, bless the Conqueror slain,
Slain in His victory;
Who lived, who died, who lives again
In glorious majesty.
{25}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Father, Thy name our souls would bless,
As children taught by grace,
Lift up our hearts in righteousness
And joy before Thy face.
|2|
Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st,
Though high above our praise;
Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st
In heav'n's unclouded rays.
|3|
There in the purpose of Thy love
Our place is now prepared,
As sons with Him who is above,
Who all our sorrows shared.
|4|
Absent as yet, we rest in hope,
treading the desert path,
Waiting for Him who takes us up
Beyond the power of death.
|5|
O Holy Father, keep us here
In that blest Name of love,
Walking before Thee without fear,
Till all be joy above.
{26}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Father, thy love our portion is,
As sons, like Christ, with Thee;
O who can tell of love like this,
So sovereign, full and free?
|2|
His Father Thou, and ours through grace,
We taste the same delight;
Blest in the brightness of Thy face,
In heav'n's unclouded light.
|3|
Unchanging glory fills the place
Where Jesus dwells on high,
But brighter joy our spirits trace
With Him, for ever nigh!
|4|
Eternal ages shall declare
The riches of Thy grace,
To those who with Thy Son shall share
A son's eternal place.
|5|
Father, Thy love, the source of all,
Sweeter than all it gives,
Shines on us now without recall,
And lasts while Jesus lives.
|6|
We joy in Thee, Thy holy love
Our endless portion is --
Like Thine own Son, with Him above,
In brightest heav'nly bliss.
{27}
E. WILLIAMS, 8.5.8.5.
|1|
Lord, we do not ask the question,
Where abidest Thou?
Well we know where Thou art dwelling,
Well we know it now.
|2|
Thou abidest in the bosom
Of the Father's love;
In that love for ever living --
Love, all thought above.
|3|
And we know that Thou wouldst have us
Ever dwell with Thee:
In that holy, heav'nly circle,
Home of liberty.
|4|
Lord, we thank Thee, this our portion
While we wait for Thee:
Now to live in love unbounded,
And eternally.
|5|
Hold our hearts, O Lord, we pray Thee,
By and in Thy love,
Till we dwell with Thee in glory
Evermore above.
{28}
J. BAKEWELL (1721-1819), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hail! Thou once despised Jesus;
Praises loudly now we sing;
Thou didst suffer, Lord, to save us,
Nigh to God Thine own to bring.
Hail! once lowly Man of sorrows,
Bearer of our grief and shame;
Graced in Thee by God's own favour,
Life we have in Thy blest Name.
|2|
Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory,
There in majesty divine,
There in heav'n our hearts accord Thee
Every honour that is Thine;
Now for us in patience waiting,
With Thy loved ones all to share:
We that joy anticipating
Till in glory we appear.
|3|
Soon we shall, as come to glory,
Thy transcendent grace relate,
Gladly sing th' amazing story
Of Thy dying love so great.
In that blessed contemplation
We for evermore shall dwell,
Praise with deepest adoration
Love that none below can tell.
{29}
E. L. BEVIR, 6.4.6.4.6.4.6.4.
|1|
Jesus, our Lord, our all,
To Thee we cling;
Keep us (while empires fall)
Under Thy wing.
Saviour, to Thee we pray,
Knowing Thy Name;
Yesterday and today
Ever the Same!
|2|
Quickly the moments flee,
Passing away;
One thousand years to Thee
Are as one day.
Changeless Thy majesty,
Wondrous Thy Name;
Through all eternity
Thou art the Same!
|3|
Maker of worlds of old,
The starry sky;
Thou shalt their glories fold,
And lay them by.
Yet Thy years never fail,
Endless Thy fame;
Thy mighty power we hail,
Thou art the Same!
{30}
MISS L. BARNETT, 6.6.8.4.
|1|
The heart of God is love;
That love extends to Thee,
For Jesus, His own Son, has died
To set us free.
|2|
Thy God is not far off;
E'en now in graciousness
Thou'lt find Him waiting at Thy side,
Thy soul to bless.
|3|
Jesus, the Lord, has died --
Has judgment borne for sin;
Nothing remains to hinder now
Thine ent'ring in.
|4|
The Holy Spirit giv'n
Can fill thy heart indeed;
Blest source within of living grace
For all Thy need.
|5|
Canst thou remain away
From such a scene of bliss,
And God the father's changeless love
For ever miss?
|6|
The favour of God's house
Stands open now to Thee,
The Father's tender love to know
Eternally!
{31}
M. COSIDO from Spanish, 12.11.12.11.
|1|
A while, yes, a very short while now of waiting,
And then will our Lord come to call us away;
With prayer and with fasting then let us be watching,
For -- well do we know it -- He will not delay.
|2|
With voice of archangel, from heaven descending,
With great acclamation and trumpet of God,
To us shall the One whom our hearts are awaiting,
That very same Jesus, appear in the cloud.
|3|
We know that the saints who in Christ have been sleeping,
By God's mighty power from sleep shall awake;
We shall not before them be caught up to heaven,
But Christ all His loved ones together shall take.
|4|
Revealed to our sight in Thy glorious descending,
Lord Jesus, Thou shalt to Thy lovers appear;
And then shalt Thou take us to heaven rejoicing,
Eternally with Thee Thy glories to share.
{32}
W. C. BOOTH, S.M.
|1|
O blessed holy One,
Thou comforter divine,
Our hearts unite to render Thee
The honour that is thine.
|2|
Constrain us now to be
Submissive to Thy voice;
To grieve Thee not, on Thee depend,
And in Thy light rejoice.
|3|
Thus would we seek to move,
Blest Spirit, in Thy power;
By grace and strength which Thou dost give,
Sustained through every hour.
|4|
Thou Holy One from heav'n,
Our Helper here below,
From worshipful and thankful hearts
To Thee our praises flow.
{33}
E. L. BEVIR, 6.4.6.4.6.4.6.4.
|1|
Come, Prince of Peace, for now
The sands are run!
The root of David Thou,
Yet David's Son;
Man of the Father's choice,
Faithful and tried.
"Come!" saith the Spirit's voice,
"Come!" saith the bride.
|2|
To Him who sits above,
Far over all,
Rises the voice of love,
That eager call
From the vast desert dry,
Here where He died:
"Come!" 'tis the Spirit's cry,
"Come!" saith the bride.
|3|
Darkness is o'er in part,
Clouds pass away.
Shine on the longing heart,
Bright Star of Day,
Calling Thy spouse on high
Close to Thy side!
"Come!" 'tis the Spirit's cry,
"Come!" saith the bride.
{34}
J. MOLINES from French, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O God for ever blest, o'er all supreme,
Our praises rise to Thee, our endless theme;
Clothed with the worth of Christ before Thy face,
As brought to Thee by Him, we know our place.
|2|
All things in heav'n and earth proceed from Thee;
In Christ Thy glories infinite we see.
O holy God, we are through Him alone
For evermore accepted as Thine own!
|3|
From all eternity Thy sovereign love
Had purposed we this cloudless joy should prove;
Now, by the Spirit's power, we have our part
In the complacent rest of Thine own heart.
|4|
Thy wondrous plan, secured in counsels wise,
Reveals Thy glorious day before our eyes.
To Thee, the God of light and love, we sing,
And filled with Thee, our hearts their homage bring.
{35}
E. RUBIE, C.M.
|1|
O God of love, how measureless
Thy thoughts to us are shown!
More precious they than tongue can tell,
Their fulness none have known.
|2|
We can but bless Thee for the light
In which Thou art revealed,
The favour of Thy countenance
To those Thy love has sealed.
|3|
We boast in Thee, Thou source of good,
Thy glory fills our sight;
Now reconciled through Jesus' death,
We praise with great delight.
|4|
Our heart are filled with holy joy,
And in Thy praise outpour;
And, Father, by the Spirit now
We worship and adore.
{36}
J. MONTGOMERY (1771-1854), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
When to the time appointed
The rolling years shall run,
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.
|2|
The heav'ns, which now conceal Him
In counsels deep and wise,
In glory shall reveal Him
To our rejoicing eyes;
He, who with hands uplifted
Went from the earth below,
Shall come again all gifted
His blessing to bestow.
|3|
He shall come down like showers
Upon the new-mown grass,
And joy and hope, like flowers,
Spring up where He doth pass;
Before Him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.
|4|
Kings shall fall down before Him
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing.
Outstretched His wide dominion
O'er river, sea and shore,
Far as the eagle's pinion
Or dove's light wing can soar.
{37}
J. PELLATT, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
"In Christ Jesus" -- new creation,
We are graced in God's own Son;
Filled our hearts with exultation,
Praise unbounded has begun.
|2|
Things unseen and yet eternal
Fill the vision of our soul,
While the heav'nly scenes supernal
Through th' eternal ages roll.
|3|
This -- the Spirit's realm of glory --
We rejoice in even now;
'Tis a blissful, endless story.
Now to Thee, O God, we bow.
|4|
"All things new," our eyes look upward,
Old things now have passed away;
Eager looking onward, homeward,
Dawned has God's eternal day!
{38}
J. WATSON Adapted, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Blessed God, above creation,
Infinite, inscrutable,
Thou in light, beyond relation,
Unapproachable dost dwell.
|2|
When Thou dost behold in heaven
And on earth the things that are,
It is said, Thyself Thou humblest --
O Thy grace beyond compare!
|3|
Who to Thee hath given counsel?
Who Thy mind hath ever known?
Not to any Thou accountest
Of the things that are Thine own.
|4|
But the glory of Thy greatness
Finds in love its counterpart:
Jesus' death th' eternal witness
To the feelings of Thy heart.
|5|
Wonder of the incarnation!
Thou art now in Christ revealed.
Universal adoration
Be its everlasting yield!
{39}
J. NEWTON (1725-1807), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
May the grace of Christ our Saviour,
And the Father's boundless love,
With the Holy Spirit's favour,
Rest upon us from above.
Thus may we abide in union
With each other and the Lord,
And possess, in sweet communion,
Joys which earth can ne'er afford.
{40}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 8.6.8.8.6.8.8.
|1|
"Look unto Me!" the Saviour cries;
Behold, upon the tree
The Holy One, a Victim, dies --
The Lamb of God, a Sacrifice;
A mighty Saviour He!
God's love in fulness there made known
When Jesus did for sins atone.
|2|
O solemn hour! O hour alone,
In solitary might,
When God the Father's only Son,
As Man for sinners to atone,
Expires -- amazing sight!
The Lord of glory crucified --
The Lord of life Himself has died!
|3|
Worthy of death, O God, we were,
That vengeance was our due.
In grace Thy spotless Lamb did bear,
Himself, our sins while hanging there;
Justice our surety slew.
With Him, our Surety, we have died,
When He for us was crucified.
|4|
Quickened with Him in life divine,
Raised with Him from the dead:
His own (and all His own are Thine)
Shall with Him in His glories shine,
Our blessed living Head!
We, who were worthy but to die,
Are by His precious blood made nigh.
{41}
P. ELLIS, 8.5.8.5.8.5.8.5.
|1|
Lord, together Thee recalling,
Turn we now to praise;
Thankful hearts, Thy Name adoring,
Sweetest song can raise.
Thou hast loved us, Thou hast bought us,
Thou hast made us free;
Hearts and voices blend in singing,
Glory unto Thee.
|2|
Thine the cost and Thine the suff'ring,
Thine the cross and shame;
Ours the never-ending blessing
Through Thy precious Name.
Thine the fruit now of the travail
Of Thy soul to see;
Thus delighting in Thy praises,
Sing we now to Thee.
{42}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
Jesus, our Saviour, we gladly adore Thee,
Joyfully Thee as our Lord do we own;
Blest in Thy presence we worship before Thee,
Thou who art worthy to sit on the throne.
|2|
How hast Thou triumphed, and triumphed with glory!
Battled death's forces, rolled back every wave!
Can we refrain then from telling the story,
How Thou art Victor o'er death and the grave?
|3|
"Lord, what is man?" we would break forth exclaiming;
Jesus, the crowned One, the Lamb that was slain!
Joyful we own Thee, Thy praises proclaiming;
Death Thou hast vanquished by rising again.
|4|
"Lord, what is man?" Yes, with deep adoration,
Gladly prolong we this wonderful theme;
Jesus, divine One, Thou Head of creation,
Head of Thy church and o'er all things supreme!
{43}
J KENT (1766-1843), S.M.
|1|
What cheering words are these! --
Their sweetness who can tell? --
In time and to eternal days
'Tis with believers well!
|2|
In every state secure,
Watched by the Saviour's eye
'Tis well with them should life endure,
And well if called to die;
|3|
Well in affliction's ways,
Or on the mount with God;
Well when they joy, and sing, and praise,
Or buffet with the flood.
|4|
'Tis well when joys arise,
'Tis well when sorrows flow,
Or darkness seems to veil the skies,
And strong temptations grow.
|5|
'Tis well when on the mount
They feast and joy in love;
And 'tis as well, in God's account,
When they the furnace prove.
|6|
But, above all, how well
When Jesus speaks the word,
And, at the trumpet's sounding swell,
They rise to meet their Lord!
{44}
A. G. DOUGHTY, 8.8.8.6.
|1|
Lord Jesus Christ, in all Thy grace,
God's glory radiant in Thy face,
Who once didst take the sinner's place --
To Thee, my Lord, I come.
|2|
Now where Thou art, God's blessed Son,
In heights of glory Thou hast won
In virtue of Thy work well done --
To Thee, my Lord, I come.
|3|
To know Thee there in all Thy love,
Seated in highest heights above,
Who once in death that love didst prove --
To Thee, my Lord, I come.
|4|
Just as Thou art in glory bright,
Centre of heaven's courts of light,
Worthy of honour, power and might --
To Thee, my Lord, I come.
|5|
Lord, from myself I gladly turn,
In Thee God's grace and love to learn;
For Thou wilt not the weakest spurn!
To Thee, my Lord, I come.
{45}
W. TROTTER (d. 1865), C.M.
|1|
Behold the Lamb, whose precious blood
Flowed from His riven side;
The power to make our peace with God,
Nor let one spot abide.
|2|
The dying thief beheld that Lamb
Expiring by his side,
And proved the value of the Name
Of Jesus crucified.
|3|
His soul, by virtue of the blood,
To paradise received,
Redemption's earliest trophy stood,
From sin and death retrieved.
|4|
We, too, the cleansing power have known
Of Christ's atoning blood,
By grace have learnt His Name to own,
By whom we're brought to God.
|5|
To Him, then, let our songs ascend,
Who stooped in grace so low;
To Christ, the Lamb, the sinner's Friend,
Let ceaseless praises flow.
{46}
J. T. ELLIS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Jesus is a glorious Saviour,
Theme of heav'ns eternal song;
Peace He offers thee, and pardon.
Wilt thou now to Him belong?
|2|
Is Thy heart oppressed with sorrow
In the world where death is rife?
One who knows and understands thee,
Bids thee come -- in Him is life.
|3|
He would turn Thee from sin's pleasures,
Where no lasting joy is found;
Set before thee hidden treasures,
Grace that would to thee abound.
|4|
Ere thy heart commenced its beating,
Or thine eyes beheld the light,
Love divine for men was planning
Happiness in glory bright.
|5|
Even though thy sins condemn thee,
Graver still thy sinful state;
He who knows it died to save thee,
Bore sin's load in all its weight.
|6|
Now He lives a Man in heaven,
Glory-crowned at God's right hand,
Waiting now to save and bless thee,
Wide outstretched His gracious hand.
{47}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Blest Lord, Thou spakest! 'twas Thy voice
That led our hearts to Thee;
That drew us to that better choice,
Where grace has set us free.
|2|
Thou wouldest that we should rejoice,
And walk by faith below;
Enough, that we have heard Thy voice,
And learned Thy love's deep woe --
|3|
Thy glory, Lord: this living waste
To us no rest can give;
Our path is on with earnest haste,
Lord, in Thy rest to live.
|4|
Our happiness, O Lord, with Thee
Is long laid up in store,
For that blest day when Thee we'll see,
And conflict will be o'er.
|5|
Yes, love divine in Thee we know;
The Father's glories soon
Shall burst upon our ravished view,
Thyself our joy and crown.
|6|
Soon shall we see Thee as Thou art,
O hope for ever blest!
Thou'lt call us, in our heav'nly part,
The Father's house, to rest.
|7|
O rest ineffable, divine,
the rest of God above,
Where we shall ever see Thee shine,
Our joy, eternal love!
{48}
E. CARREN from Swedish, 5.5.4.5.5.4.
|1|
O how inscrutable,
Yea, how unsearchable
Art Thou, O God!
Now lowly bowing,
Thy greatness owning,
We praise and laud.
|2|
Thy Son beloved
Knew in its fulness
That heart of Thine.
He has declared Thee
And here revealed Thee
In love divine.
|3|
In adoration,
Deep contemplation,
We turn to Thee;
In Christ before Thee
We shall adore Thee
Eternally!
{49}
L A CAMPION, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, in Thy love rejoicing,
Unto Thee our praise we bring;
Son's affections freely voicing,
Loving Thee, to Thee we sing.
Fruit of Thy blest Son's devotion
To His God and Father's will,
Now our hearts, with deep emotion,
Would Thine ear with praises fill.
|2|
Every heart is bowed before Thee,
Thou our God and Father art!
Loved by Thee, our hearts adore Thee,
Joying in our blessed part;
Through the riches of Thy glory,
By Thy Spirit sing with might;
Apprehending now love's story,
Breadth and length and depth and height.
|3|
In the many sons before Thee
Who Thy glorious Name adore,
Father, Unto Thee be glory
Even now and evermore!
We are bowed in adoration,
As before Thy face we fall:
Wondrous, blessed consummation --
Thou, O God, art all in all!
{50}
J N DARBY, 6.4.6.4.
|1|
O Lord, 'tis sweet the thought
That Thou art mine;
But brighter still the joy
That I am Thine!
|2|
Thine own, O Lord, the fruit,
The cherished fruit
Of Thine all-perfect love!
No passing root
|3|
Of evil e'er will dim
Thy cloudless rays;
But a full heart pour forth
Thine endless praise!
|4|
O joy supreme and full,
Where sunless day
Sheds forth, with light divine,
Its cloudless ray!
{51}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, Thy love's unbounded,
So sweet, so full, so free;
My soul is all transported
Whene'er I think of Thee!
|2|
Yet, Lord, alas! what weakness
Within myself I find;
No infant's changing pleasure
Is like my wand'ring mind.
|3|
And yet Thy love's unchanging,
And doth recall my heart
To joy in all its brightness,
The peace its beams impart.
|4|
Yet sure, if in Thy presence
My soul still constant were,
Mine eye would, more familiar,
Its brighter glories bear.
|5|
And thus Thy deep perfections
Much better should I know,
And with adoring fervour
In this Thy nature grow.
|6|
Still sweet 'tis to discover,
If clouds have dimmed my sight,
When passed, eternal Lover,
Towards me, as e'er, Thou'rt bright.
|7|
O keep my soul, then, Jesus,
Abiding still with Thee,
And, if I wander, teach me
Soon back to Thee to flee;
|8|
That all Thy gracious favour
May to my soul be known;
And, versed in this Thy goodness,
My hopes Thyself shalt crown.
{52}
P. VAN DEN BERG from Dutch, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
We sing to Thee, blest Spirit,
As moved by light divine
In realms of wondrous counsel,
Where Jesus' glories shine.
We praise with hearts adoring,
In heav'nly places blest;
Fruit of eternal purpose,
Where now in joy we rest.
|2|
We praise Thee, glorious Father,
As objects of Thy grace,
Who by Thy Spirit's power
Are now before Thy face:
Thy sons marked out for glory --
Known from eternity --
With Christ Thy Well-beloved,
Object supreme to Thee.
|3|
Who else but Thee, O Father,
Could in Thine only Son
So bless us with Thy Spirit,
And have us for Thine own?
Soon shall we be for ever
With Christ in glory; then
We'll shine in His blest image
Eternally, Amen!
{53}
MISS M LUCAS, 10.10.10.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
Jesus is calling you, will you not come?
Cease from your labours, the work has been done!
Peace has been made on the cross by His blood;
Why not accept it, seek pardon from God.
|2|
What could you do that the Lord has not done?
What could you give, for your sins to atone?
Think you that God would have spared not His Son
If by a creature the work could be done?
|3|
Why not accept the free offer of grace?
Down at the feet of the Lord take your place;
Claim now the pardon He loves to bestow,
Knowing from Him every blessing doth flow.
|4|
Come to the Saviour. Why should you delay?
Still 'tis a moment of favour today.
Blessing is offered through faith in God's Son;
Now He is calling you. Will you not come?
{54}
J. NEWTON (1725-1807), C.M.
|1|
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away His fear.
|2|
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
It calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.
|3|
Blest Name! the rock on which we build,
Our shield and hiding place;
Our never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.
|4|
Jesus! our Saviour, Shepherd, Friend,
Thou Prophet, Priest, and King,
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
Accept the praise we bring.
|5|
Weak is the effort of our heart,
And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
We'll praise Thee as we ought.
|6|
Till then we would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And triumph in Thy blessed Name
Which quells the power of death.
{55}
P. GERHARDT (1607-1676) from German, S.M.
|1|
Through waves, through clouds and storms,
God gently clears the way;
We wait His time; so shall the night
Soon end in blissful day.
|2|
He everywhere hath sway,
And all things serve His might;
His every act pure blessing is,
His path unsullied light.
|3|
When He makes bare His arm,
Who shall His work withstand?
When He His people's cause defends,
Who then shall stay His hand?
|4|
We leave it to Himself
To choose and to command;
With wonder filled, we soon shall see
How wise, how strong His hand!
|5|
We comprehend Him not,
Yet earth and heaven tell,
God sits as sovereign on the throne,
And ruleth all things well.
{56}
C R BOSWOOD, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Blessed God, in adoration
Now Thy work we contemplate;
All of Thee-a new creation --
Holy and inviolate.
|2|
Ended now time's toil and travail,
Love's full purpose is complete;
Thou dost rest, for every detail
With Christ's fulness is replete.
|3|
Evil's challenge, long permitted --
Met by Thy supremacy --
In Thy ways was wisely fitted
To display the Trinity.
|4|
So again burst forth our praises
As fresh wonders thrill our sight;
Limitless the beauteous phases,
Ever new and ever bright!
{57}
T H REYNOLDS (1830-1930), C.M.
|1|
Blest God and Father, in Thy sight
We bow and own Thy grace;
We worship in Thy glorious light,
Which shines in Jesus' face.
|2|
He fills Thy presence; fully known
His worth alone to Thee;
But in our hearts Thy light hath shone,
In love that sets us free.
|3|
The glories of His work we bring,
Thee glorified we see;
His deep perfections gladly sing,
And tell them forth to Thee.
|4|
With great delight His Name we praise,
Blest Father, in Thine ear,
And songs of joy and triumph raise,
As sons to Thee brought near.
{58}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), L.M.
|1|
Lord, we are Thine, bought by Thy blood,
Once the poor guilty slaves of sin;
But Thou redeemedst us to God,
And mad'st Thy Spirit dwell within.
|2|
Lord, we are Thine, Thy claims we own;
Ourselves to Thee we'd wholly give;
O may our hearts Thyself enthrone,
And let us to Thy glory live!
|3|
Here let us each Thy mind display,
In all Thy gracious image shine;
And haste that long expected day
When Thou shalt own that we are Thine.
{59}
T H REYNOLDS (1830-1930), L.M.
|1|
O God, Thou dost engage our hearts
With Christ, Thy well-beloved Son;
Thy love a holy joy imparts,
A joy which He for us hath won.
|2|
Of Him Thy voice from out the cloud
Once spake Thy deep, Thy full delight;
And now, without a veil to shroud,
In Him shines forth Thy glory bright.
|3|
Our God we bless Thee, Father Thou
Of Him, Thy well-beloved Son;
As blest in Him before Thee bow,
And joy in all Thy love has done.
{60}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, how blest our journey,
Though here on earth we roam,
Who in the Father's favour
Now find our spirits' home:
For where Thou now art sitting
By faith we've found repose,
Free to look up to heaven,
Since our blest Head arose.
|2|
In spirit there already,
Soon we ourselves shall be
In soul and body perfect,
All glorified, with Thee.
Thy Father's love sustains us
Along the thorny way;
Thy Father's house, the dwelling
Made ready for that day.
|3|
The Comforter, now present,
Assures us of Thy love;
He is the blessed Earnest
Of glory there above;
The river of God's pleasure
Is what sustains us now,
Till Thy new Name's imprinted
On every sinless brow.
|4|
Lord, we await Thy glory;
We have no home but there,
Where all Thine own together
Thy joy with Thee shall share.
No place can fully please us
Where Thou, O Lord, art not;
In Thee, and with Thee, ever
Is found, by grace, our lot.
{61}
F. D. WATERFALL, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O God, the great "I AM," we worship Thee
For Thine amazing gift to set men free!
Redemption's work has lifted every load,
Secured a princely people for their God.
|2|
We trace Thy counsels deep ere worlds began,
And see Thine own great thoughts in making man.
Thy sovereign will has wrought to set all free,
To bring in life and joy and liberty.
|3|
No tear-filled eyes then left to chill the joy
Of new creation's bliss without alloy!
All grief by Thy blest service there removed;
O God of love, Thy love so fully proved!
|4|
Each heart then filled by Thy transcendent love,
Its song outpours to Thee, O God, above;
Joins in the gladsome theme through endless days,
To magnify Thyself in ceaseless praise.
|5|
How choice the notes that rise responsively,
In Thine abode throughout eternity!
The vast extent of the created sphere
Rejoices, knowing Thou, O God, art near.
|6|
To Thee, then all in all, full praise will ring,
For of Thine own will men their tribute bring;
All things created by and for Thy will,
Thou dost, O God, in power each vessel fill.
{62}
A. P. BODMAN, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
God of the universe,
What hast Thou wrought!
Sphere full of love and praise
Passing all thought!
While endless days endure,
Christ and the church secure
Answer to purpose sure --
What Thou hast sought!
|2|
We praise and worship Thee
For what Thou art,
Thy love and blessedness
Filling each heart.
Blest in Christ consciously,
Glory eternally
In the assembly be
Thy joyful part.
{63}
B G HARDINGHAM (1894-1973), 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise
With all Thine own,
And in Thy presence sound a note of praise
To Thee thus known;
Brought nigh, brought home to Thee -- O wondrous grace,
That gives us now, with Thine own Son our place.
|2|
How deep the holy joy that fills that scene
E'en now begun!
Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen
In Christ the Son;
As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,
He leads the praise of those Thy love has blest.
|3|
He leads the praise, how precious to Thine ear
The song He sings!
How precious, too, to Thee how near how dear --
Are those He brings
To share His place: 'twas thus that Thou did'st plan;
As loving Him before the world began.
{64}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
O bright and blessed scenes,
Where sin can never come;
Whose sight our longing spirit weans
From earth, where yet we roam.
|2|
And can we call our home
Our Father's house on high,
The rest of God our rest to come
Our place of liberty?
|3|
Yes! in that light unstained
Our stainless souls shall live;
Our hearts' deep longings more than gained
When God His rest shall give.
|4|
His presence there, my soul
Its rest, its joy untold
Shall find, when endless ages roll,
And time shall ne'er grow old.
|5|
Like Jesus in that place
Of light and love supreme,
Once Man of sorrows, full of grace,
Heav'n's blest and endless theme.
|6|
O love supreme and bright,
Good to the feeblest heart,
That gives us now as heav'nly light
What soon shall be our part!
{65}
MISS H. K. BURLINGHAM (1842-1901) Adapted, S.M.
|1|
'Tis not far off -- the hour
When Christ will claim His own;
We soon shall hear that voice of power;
The Lord Himself shall come!
|2|
The days are passing by,
The years flow on apace;
Lord Jesus, Thy return draws nigh,
We long to see Thy face.
|3|
Eternal in the heav'ns
Is our prepared abode --
Radiant and pure, in light divine,
The building of our God.
|4|
Then rest, divinely sweet,
Our pilgrim feet shall know;
And through that blest eternity
What tides of praise shall flow!
|5|
In patience, Lord, we wait
For Thee to take us home;
Fulfil to us Thy gracious word.
Lord Jesus, quickly come!
{66}
MISS C. THOMPSON (1822-1909), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O gracious God, Thy pleasure
Is in Thy Christ made known,
And tells the boundless measure
Of blessing for Thine own.
He has Thy presence entered,
As Man in heav'n is known;
In Him Thy glory's centred,
In Him Thy purpose shown.
|2|
And O what love is beaming
Refulgent in that face!
What blessed light is streaming
From that most glorious place!
Both love and light proclaiming
What Thou, the Father, art,
And wondrous grace revealing,
With Thine own Son, our part.
|3|
Thou source of every blessing!
Thou spring of all delight!
Thy Name with joy confessing
Let all the saints unite!
Each heart its praise outpouring
To Thee all praise above,
Each voice in strains adoring
Re-echoes -- "God is love."
{67}
A. CARRUTHERS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
We bless Thee, God and Father,
We joy before Thy face;
Beyond dark death for ever,
We share Thy Son's blest place.
He lives a Man before Thee
In cloudless light above,
In Thine unbounded favour,
Thine everlasting love.
|2|
His Father and our Father,
His God and ours Thou art;
And He is Thy beloved,
The gladness of Thy heart.
We're His, in joy He brings us
To share His part and place,
To know Thy love and favour,
The shining of Thy face.
|3|
Thy love that now enfolds us
Can ne'er wax cold or dim;
In Him that love doth centre,
And we are loved in Him.
In Him Thy love and glory
Find their eternal rest;
The many sons -- His brethren --
In Him, how near, how blest!
{68}
E. L. BEVIR, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
O Lord of glory, who couldst leave
The height supreme in death to lie,
What tongue shall sing, what heart conceive
The love divine that made Thee die?
Bought with a price, for ever Thine,
We bless Thee for Thy stoop divine.
|2|
But ris'n, the Firstborn from the dead,
Triumphant hast Thou entered in;
The glorious Man, the living Head,
Thrice worthy Thou our hearts to win!
In Thy blest face all glories shine,
And there we gaze on love divine.
{69}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), S.M.
|1|
O blessed living Lord,
Engage our hearts with Thee,
And strike within the answ'ring chord
To love so rich and free.
|2|
To know Thy loving heart,
And cleave to Thy blest side;
To gaze upon Thee where Thou art,
And in Thy love abide;
|3|
To walk with Thee below,
And learn Thy holy ways;
Each day more to Thy stature grow,
To Thine eternal praise --
|4|
Be this our whole desire --
Thyself our object here:
The goal to which our hearts aspire,
To meet Thee in the air.
{70}
D. H. ARIS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thou blessed Holy Spirit,
Thy comfort is our stay;
Throughout our pilgrim journey
Thy help attends our way;
And now, as thus assembled,
Our souls with fervour glow;
We would enjoy Thy service,
Thy gracious presence know.
|2|
Assured, we come with boldness
Before the throne of grace,
Knowing the One who serveth
In that exalted place.
Thus would our hearts in quietness
Express their deep desires,
And find in these sweet moments
A strength that never tires.
{71}
G. GILPIN, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O God of grace, our Father,
All praise we give to Thee;
'Tis in Thy sovereign favour
All blessedness we see;
There only is the fountain
Whence living waters flow,
Which like a glorious river
Still gladden as they go.
|2|
As Thine Thou didst foreknow us
From all eternity;
Thy chosen, loved ones, ever
Kept present to Thine eye;
And when was come the moment,
Thou, calling by Thy grace,
Didst gently, firmly draw us
Each from his hiding-place.
|3|
Thy word, Thyself reflecting,
Doth sanctify by truth,
Still leading on Thy loved ones
With gentle, heav'nly growth.
Thus still the work proceedeth
(The work begun by grace)
In each, made meet, yet training,
To dwell before Thy face.
{72}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
Our God whom we have known,
Well known in Jesus' love,
Rests in the blessing of His own
Before Himself above.
|2|
Our God the centre is,
His presence fills that land,
And countless myriads, owned as His,
Round Him adoring stand.
|3|
Glory supreme is there,
Glory that shines through all;
More precious still that love to share
As those that love did call.
|4|
Like Jesus! Grace supreme!
Like Him before Thy face;
Like Him, to know that glory beam
Unhindered, face to face!
{73}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Come! hear the gospel sound,
"Yet there is room!"
It tells to all around,
"Yet there is room!"
Though guilty, now draw near;
Though vile, you need not fear;
With joy you now may hear,
"Yet there is room!"
|2|
God's love in Christ we see --
"Yet there is room!"
Greater it could not be --
"Yet there is room!"
His only Son He gave,
He's righteous now to save
All who on Him believe;
"Yet there is room!"
|3|
All things are ready: Come!
"Yet there is room!"
Christ everything hath done:
"Yet there is room!"
His work is now complete;
Before the mercy seat,
A Saviour-God you'll meet:
"Yet there is room!"
|4|
God's house is filling fast,
"Yet there is room!"
Some guest will be the last,
"Yet there is room!"
Yes! soon salvation's day
To you may pass away,
Then grace no more will say
"Yet there is room!"
{74}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
Rest of the saints above,
Jerusalem of God!
Who, in thy palaces of love,
That golden street have trod,
|2|
To us thy joy to tell?
Those courts secure from ill,
Where God Himself vouchsafes to dwell,
And every bosom fill.
|3|
Who shall to us that joy
Of saint-thronged courts declare;
Tell of that constant sweet employ
Our spirits long to share?
|4|
And see! the Spirit's power
Has ope'd the heav'nly door,
Has brought us to that favoured hour
When toil shall all be o'er.
|5|
That rest, secure from ill,
No cloud of grief e'er stains;
Unfailing praise each heart doth fill,
And love eternal reigns.
|6|
God and the Lamb shall there
The light and temple be,
And radiant hosts for ever share
The unveiled mystery!
|7|
There only to adore,
Our souls their strength shall find;
Their life, their joy for evermore,
By sight, nor sense, defined.
{75}
W. LAWRENCE, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
Jesus, our Lord, thy worthiness we sing,
Thy peerless fame.
Our sacrifice of praise to Thee we bring,
And bless Thy Name.
Thy glories fill our vision with delight,
And heart and voice to honour Thee unite.
|2|
Yet wider praise in Zion waits for Thee,
Her Lord and King;
Creation too, in rest and liberty,
Shall tribute bring;
Both heav'n and earth shall Thy dominion own,
And every tongue confess Thee Lord alone.
|3|
More blessed still -- Thine own peculiar joy
Thy saints shall be,
Who then shall find their constant blest employ
In praising Thee;
And with Thee, Lord, Thy glory shall behold,
While love delights its wonders to unfold.
{76}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee,
Stranger hands no more impede;
Pass thou on, His hand protects thee --
Strength that has the captive freed.
|2|
Is the wilderness before thee,
Desert lands where drought abides?
Heav'nly springs shall there restore thee,
Fresh from God's exhaustless tides.
|3|
Light divine surrounds thy going,
God Himself shall mark thy way;
Secret blessings, richly flowing,
Lead to everlasting day.
|4|
God, thine everlasting portion,
Feeds thee with the mighty's meat;
Price of Egypt's hard extortion,
Egypt's food no more to eat.
|5|
Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures?
God in secret thee shall keep,
There unfold His hidden treasures,
There His love's exhaustless deep.
|6|
In the desert God will teach thee
What the God that thou hast found --
Patient, gracious, powerful, holy;
All His grace shall there abound.
|7|
On to Canaan's rest still wending,
E'en thy wants and woes shall bring
Suited grace from high descending;
Thou shalt taste of mercy's spring.
|8|
Though thy way be long and dreary,
Eagle strength He'll still renew;
Garments fresh and foot unweary
Tell how God hath brought thee through.
|9|
When to Canaan's long-loved dwelling
Love divine thy foot shall bring,
There with shouts of triumph swelling,
Zion's songs in rest to sing;
|10|
There no stranger-God shall meet thee --
Stranger thou in courts above! --
He, who to His rest shall greet thee,
Greets thee with a well known love.
{77}
UNKNOWN, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, we love to trace Thy footprints
Here amidst the desert sand,
Ponder o'er Thy path of suffering --
Wondrous heart and healing hand;
See Thy stoop to Bethlehem's manger,
Hear Thee still the raging wave,
Learn Thy love in all its fulness
At the cross and in the grave.
|2|
Lord, we bow in adoration
As we watch that stream of love;
Find its mighty tide still flowing
From Thee now as crowned above.
'Tis a love no heart can fathom,
Which to us Thou dost unfold,
Inexhaustible and boundless --
Wondrous theme that ne'er grows old.
{78}
R C CHAPMAN (1803-1902), 7.7.7.7.
|1|
King of glory, set on high,
Girt with strength and majesty,
We Thy holy Name confess,
Thee with adoration bless.
|2|
Jesus, mighty Son of god,
Wondrous gift on man bestowed:
Many crowns are on Thy head,
Glorious Firstborn from the dead!
|3|
Gladly, Lord, we bow the knee,
By the Father's just decree,
To His own anointed One,
To His well-beloved Son.
{79}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
God and the Lamb -- 'tis well
I know that source divine
Of joy and love no tongue can tell,
Yet know that all is mine.
|2|
The Lamb is there, my soul,
Where God Himself doth rest
In love divine diffused through all,
With Him supremely blest.
|3|
There on the hidden bread
Of Christ, once humbled here --
God's treasured store -- for ever fed,
His love my soul shall cheer.
|4|
Called by that secret name
Of undisclosed delight
(Blest answer to reproach and shame),
Graved on the stone of white.
|5|
There in effulgence bright,
Saviour and Guide, with Thee
I'll walk, and in Thy heav'nly light
Whiter my robe shall be.
|6|
There, in th' unsullied way
Which His own hand hath dressed,
My feet press on, where brightest day
Shines forth on all the Rest.
|7|
But who that glorious blaze
Of living light shall tell,
Where all His brightness God displays,
And the Lamb's glories dwell?
|8|
There with unwearied gaze
Our eyes on Him we'll rest,
And satisfy with endless praise
Our hearts supremely blest.
{80}
P. W. DOLTON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Jesus Lord, we love Thee,
Thy Name by us adored;
No other name more worthy,
We own no other lord;
For Thou cam'st down from glory
God's holy will to do,
All righteousness fulfilling --
The Holy and the True.
|2|
As when on earth Thou drewest
Thine own around Thee, Lord,
To learn Thy love's sweet story,
To hear Thy blessed word,
So now, O Lord, we gather
Unto Thy precious Name;
Thy love's appeal and greatness
Our hearts' affections claim.
{81}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
O Lord, Thy glory we behold,
Though not with mortal eyes;
That glory on the Father's throne
No human sight descries.
|2|
'Tis thence -- now Thou art gone on high,
Redemption's work complete --
The Spirit brings Thy glory nigh
To those who for Thee wait.
|3|
'Tis not for human eye to see,
Nor human ear to hear,
Nor heart conceive what it may be,
Or bring the prospect near.
|4|
And we our great Forerunner see
In all His glory there;
Yet not ashamed with such as we,
As Firstborn, all to share.
|5|
The new creation's stainless joy
Gleams through the present gloom;
That world of bliss without alloy,
The saints' eternal home.
{82}
L A CAMPION, 10.10.10.10.10.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus, 'tis our joy Thyself to bless,
As now Thou tell'st our hearts of all Thy love.
That love that once in death Thou didst express,
Remained unchanged when Thou didst go above;
And now that love in all its power is known,
As Thou dost take Thy place amongst Thine own.
|2|
This place is Thine, O Lord, and Thine alone,
Blest lover of Thy church, who for her died!
For now, as ris'n and living Thou art known
And loved by her whom Thou hast made Thy bride;
Secured for Thee in bonds of love divine,
To be for Thee, O Lord, for she is Thine.
|3|
And Thou art hers! What wondrous bliss, O Lord,
This place of nearness to Thyself to know:
And being loved by Thee, with one accord
We give Thee now our love's responsive flow.
The altogether lovely One thou art,
Supreme, Thou blessed Bridegroom, to our heart!
{83}
H. P. WELLS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the wondrous joy of dwelling,
Father, in Thy house above!
Every feature Christ reflecting,
And Thine own surpassing love.
|2|
Thoughts divine conceived in purpose,
There fulfilled for Thy delight;
All that shone in Christ, once humbled,
There expands in glory's light.
|3|
By the Spirit's power is strengthened
Every eye on Him to gaze;
Every view of Him unfolding
Wakes fresh bursts of joyful praise!
|4|
Every circle gathered round Thee
Yields of Christ some beauteous ray;
And for Thy delight and pleasure
Shines throughout th' eternal day.
|5|
There Thy love o'er all transcendent
Shall for ever find its rest;
While each heart, its joy outpouring,
In that love is ever blest.
{84}
T. WILLEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus, gladly do our lips express
Our hearts' deep sense of all Thy worthiness;
Thou risen One, the Holy and the True,
We give Thee now the praise so justly due.
|2|
We bless Thee, Lord, Thou lov'st to take Thy place
Amongst Thine own, who taste Thy boundless grace;
'Tis thus we know Thee as Thou'rt known above
In heav'nly glory -- home of perfect love.
|3|
Thou giv'st us, Lord, once more to taste down here
The joy Thy presence brings, its warmth and cheer;
With great delight we 'neath Thy shadow rest;
Thy fruit is sweet to those Thy love has blest.
|4|
Thou wast alone, till like the precious grain
In death Thou layest but didst rise again;
And in Thy risen life a countless host
Are "All of one" with Thee, Thy joy and boast.
{85}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.8.11.8.
|1|
There is rest for the weary soul --
There is rest in the Saviour's love;
There is rest in the grace that has made us whole,
And that seeketh out those who rove.
|2|
There is rest in the tender love
That has trodden our path below;
That has found us a place in the realms above,
But can now all our sorrows know.
|3|
There is rest in the calming grace
That flows out from those realms above;
O what rest in the thought -- we shall see His face,
Who has giv'n us to know His love!
|4|
There is rest in the midst of grief --
For His grief was the proof of love;
O 'tis sweet in that love now to find relief,
When the sorrows of earth we prove.
|5|
There is rest in the Saviour's heart,
Who would never turn grief away:
But has found, in what sin once had made our part,
The domain of His love's display.
|6|
There is rest in the blessed yoke,
And in proving no will but His,
While we learn from His path, and the words He spoke,
What that patience of Jesus is!
|7|
So where Jesus has gone before
Is the path which we have to tread;
And it leads to the rest where all sorrow's o'er --
To the place where His steps have led.
{86}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), 8.4.8.4.8.8.8.4.
|1|
Through the love of God our Saviour,
All will be well;
Free and changeless is His favour,
All, all is well.
Mighty is the power that healed us,
Precious is the grace that sealed us,
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us:
All must be well.
|2|
Though we pass through tribulation,
All will be well;
Ours is such a full salvation,
All, all is well.
Happy still in God confiding;
Fruitful, if in Christ abiding;
Steadfast, through the Spirit's guiding:
All must be well.
|3|
We expect a bright tomorrow;
All will be well.
Faith can sing through days of sorrow,
All, all is well.
On our Father's love relying,
Jesus every need supplying,
Or in living, or in dying,
All must be well.
{87}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), L.M.
|1|
Father, Thy sovereign love has sought
Captives to sin, gone far from Thee;
The work that Thine own Son hath wrought
Has brought us back in peace and free.
|2|
And now, as sons before Thy face,
With joyful steps the path we tread,
Which leads us on to that blest place
Prepared for us by Christ our Head.
|3|
O keep us, Love divine, near Thee,
That we our nothingness may know,
And ever to Thy glory be
Walking in faith while here below.
{88}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), L.M.
|1|
Thou gav'st us Father, in Thy love,
To Christ to bring us home to Thee,
Suited to Thine own thoughts above,
As sons like Him, with Him to be
|2|
In Thine own house. There love divine
Fills the bright courts with cloudless joy;
But 'tis the love that made us Thine
Fills all that house without alloy.
|3|
O boundless grace! What fills with joy
Unmingled all that enter there,
God's nature, love without alloy,
Our hearts are giv'n e'en now to share.
|4|
God's righteousness with glory bright,
Which with its radiance fills that sphere --
E'en Christ, of God the power and light --
Our title is that light to share.
|5|
O Mind divine, so must it be
That glory all belongs to God!
O Love divine, that did decree
We should be part, through Jesus' blood.
{89}
A. H. GRIFFITHS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest Spirit of adoption,
Thy power is with us now,
As we approach the Father
Before His face to bow.
'Tis Thy delight to bring us
To this most blessed place,
Where access to the Father
Is ours, through Christ's own grace.
|2|
Most blest is this our portion
Which now, by Thee, we know,
As first of all the fam'lies
In heav'n or earth below:
For in this place of favour
There e'er ascends by Thee,
Eternal praise and worship
From sons for ever free.
|3|
And unto Thee, blest Spirit,
Our praises now we sing,
And, by Thee, to the Father
Our glad response we bring;
For we, in Christ's own nearness
Before the Father's face,
Enjoy the wondrous favour
Of the Beloved's place.
{90}
A. BECKER from German, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God and Father, we respond anew
To love in Christ revealed, and praise Thy Name.
He did Thy will; and, for the joy in view,
Endured the cross, despising all the shame.
|2|
He midst His brethren strikes the note of praise;
We hear His song, our hearts responsive swell;
And on this day when He His voice doth raise,
In spirit enter where we soon shall dwell.
|3|
He, who in death for us lay in the earth,
Who hid within His heart all Thou hadst willed,
Is glorified -- Thine answer to His worth --
The One who fully Thy desire fulfilled.
|4|
Chosen in Him, Thy well-beloved Son,
We have our part in joy before Thy face;
Predestined, ere this world had yet begun,
For that blest world, where all bespeaks Thy grace,
|5|
Thy counsel, God and Father, now we see --
Thy heart desiring love's responsive song;
And thus Thou didst design that there should be
A Firstborn One, supreme amid the throng:
|6|
Sons loved and loving, who Thy house shall fill,
Our endless portion there in love to be;
Each with some trait of Him who loves so well,
For Thy delight and joy eternally.
{91}
A. P. BODMAN, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
God the unchangeable,
Ever the Same;
Thou self-existent One,
Boundless Thy fame!
Glorious Thy majesty,
Gladly we worship Thee;
Wondrous economy --
Triune "The Name."
{92}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), S.M.
|1|
What raised the wondrous thought,
Or who did it suggest,
That we, the church, to glory brought,
Should with the Son be blest?
|2|
O God, the thought was Thine,
Thine only could it be,
Fruit of the wisdom, love divine,
Peculiar unto Thee.
|3|
For, sure, no other mind,
For thoughts so bold, so free,
Greatness or strength could ever find;
Thine only could it be.
|4|
The motives, too, Thine own,
The plan, the counsel, Thine;
Made for Thy Son, bone of His bone,
In glory bright to shine.
|5|
O God, with great delight
Thy wondrous thought we see;
Upon His throne, in glory bright,
The bride of Christ shall be.
|6|
Sealed with the Holy Ghost,
We triumph in that love;
Thy wondrous thought has made our boast,
Glory with Christ above!
{93}
E. DENNY (1796-1889), C.M.
|1|
Hope of the waiting pilgrim's heart,
Light of the coming day,
Arise, and with Thy morning beams
Chase all our griefs away!
|2|
Come, blessed Lord! bid every shore
And answering island sing
The praises of Thy royal name,
And own Thee as their King.
|3|
Bid the whole earth, responsive now
To the bright world above,
Break forth in rapturous strains of joy
In memory of Thy love.
|4|
O Lord, Thy fair creation groans,
The air, the earth, the sea,
In unison with all our hearts,
And calls aloud for Thee.
|5|
Thine was the cross, with all its fruits
Of grace and peace divine;
Be Thine the crown of glory now,
The palm of vict'ry Thine!
{94}
H. ALIEN, C.M.
|1|
Father, Thine own unbounded love
Has reached us through Thy Son;
We now are one with Him above;
Eternity's begun.
|2|
As thus before Thee without blame,
In Him who lives we live;
Our spirits rise to bless Thy Name,
And holy worship give.
|3|
The praises led by Thy Beloved
Delight Thy holy ear;
And we, with hearts divinely moved,
Rejoice that praise to share.
|4|
Father, Thy love our portion is;
Thou gav'st us to Thy Son,
For Thine own glory and for His,
Made like that blessed One.
|5|
In that bright scene of cloudless light,
Where sons at home shall be,
With Him we'll share that glory bright
And ever joy in Thee.
{95}
J HAUSSMAN, 7.4.7.4.7.4.7.4.
|1|
Take Thou our hand, Lord Jesus,
Thou knowest best;
Guide us at last, blest Saviour,
To God's own rest.
We cannot tread without Thee
The pathway true;
We need Thee near, whatever
We say or do.
|2|
Our feeble hearts, in mercy,
Do Thou sustain,
And keep them calm and peaceful
Through joy and pain.
Let us be often sitting
At Thy blest feet;
To be at home with Thee, Lord,
Is comfort sweet.
|3|
Though here we are not conscious
Of all Thy might,
Still to the goal Thou leadest
On through the night.
So take our hand, Lord Jesus,
Be Thou our Guide,
Till we, made blest and perfect,
Are glorified.
{96}
J. CLARK, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
Our God and Father, we delight to share,
With Christ our part;
Thy mighty love in purpose brought us near,
And bows our heart.
O love divine! How wondrous is Thy will
That myriad sons that blessed scene should fill!
|2|
Then, blessed God, Thou all in all shalt be,
In tranquil rest;
New heav'ns and earth, from thraldom ever free,
Where all is blest.
Christ and the church Thy glory will display
Where Thou dost dwell through that eternal day.
{97}
A. H. GRIFFITHS, C.M.
|1|
O Holy Spirit of our God,
May Thy blest voice be heard,
As we, assembled, seek again
Help from the sacred word.
|2|
Thy voice, so true and constant, speaks
In tones of faithful love,
Conveying to th' assemblies here
The mind of heav'n above.
|3|
Thy grace we know that freely serves
In every needed hour,
Sustaining still each faithful few
With fresh supplies of power.
|4|
Thy joy is e'er afresh to show
The things of Christ above,
To stimulate our hearts anew
With touches of His love.
|5|
Thy presence here with saints on earth
Makes our glad hearts rejoice;
Blest Comforter, Thou speakest still!
Grant us to hear Thy voice.
{98}
F. H. PARROT from French, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
To us Thou comest, faithful to Thy word;
Thou dost not leave Thine own as orphans here.
"Peace unto you," Thou sayest, blessed Lord;
The glorious morn has ris'n our hearts to cheer.
|2|
And now Thou joyest in Thy saints, O Lord;
Thy banner over us is endless love.
We praise Thee, for Thy presence doth afford
A foretaste of unclouded bliss above.
{99}
MRS. A. M. HAYWARD, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus, Thou by whom the worlds were made,
As holy Babe wast in a manger laid;
Yet did angelic hosts Thy title own,
And highest glory give to God alone.
|2|
Thy lowly pathway grace and truth displayed,
But wicked hands Thy brow with thorns arrayed;
Now glory-crowned, blest answer to Thy shame,
Thy saints with joy Thy worthiness acclaim.
|3|
To win Thy bride what depths of woe were Thine,
Scorned and betrayed, beset by powers malign!
Thy pierced hands, Thy riven side revealed
The strength of love that by Thy death was sealed.
|4|
Most blessed Lord, fain would we learn of Thee
To fill our part, yea, more like Thee to be;
With purpose fixed, Thy path our happy choice,
Thyself our all, until we hear Thy voice.
{100}
J. H. EAMES, 12.13.12.10.
|1|
Holy, holy holy! Blessed God, we praise Thee;
From eternity Thou art, to Thee all glory be!
O what strains adoring, from Thy saints outpouring!
Worship and praise we render unto Thee.
|2|
Holy, holy, holy! of Thine own we give Thee;
Thou art evermore the Same, in power and majesty;
Greatness all transcending, glory never ending,
All, all is Thine, Thine only could it be.
|3|
Holy, holy, holy! worshipping before Thee,
Lifting holy hands on high, our place Thy sanctuary;
Love in its own dwelling, every voice is telling
Of glory known, yet wondrous mystery.
|4|
Holy, holy, holy! hearts and voices blending;
To eternity Thou art! a rev'rent note we raise.
Hear the song unending from Thy sons ascending!
Our glorious God, to Thee be all the praise!
{101}
UNKNOWN, C.M.
|1|
The mighty God who dwelt in light
Unreached by mortal eye,
As Man came forth the foe to fight,
And won the victory.
|2|
In perfect light was sin laid bare,
And met its utmost due,
While perfect love in triumph there
Revealed salvation too.
|3|
Who but the sinless One could be
Sin-off'ring meet for God?
And who in heaven or earth but He
Could cleanse me with His blood?
|4|
To save the sinner Jesus came,
To set the captive free;
And now my willing lips proclaim
What He hath done for me.
|5|
His finished work is all my trust,
And now He lives above,
Eternal proof that God is just
In all this way of love.
|6|
Delivered from the wrath to come,
I soon shall see His face;
And praise, in God's eternal home,
The glory of His grace.
{102}
H. WREFORD, 8.7.8.7. DACTYLIC, CHORUS 5.7.8.7.
|1|
Christ is the Saviour of sinners,
Christ is the Saviour for me;
Long I was chained in sin's darkness,
Now by His grace I am free.
|2|
Saviour of sinners,
Saviour of sinners like me,
Giving Himself as a ransom --
This is the Saviour for me.
|3|
Now I can say I am pardoned,
Happy and justified, free,
Saved by my blessed Redeemer --
This is the Saviour for me.
|4|
Just as I was He received me,
Seeking from judgment to flee;
Now there is no condemnation --
This is the Saviour for me.
|5|
Loved with a love that's unchanging,
Blessed with all blessings so free,
How shall I tell out His praises!
This is the Saviour for me.
|6|
Soon shall the glory be dawning,
Then, when His face I shall see,
Sing, O my soul, in thy gladness,
This is the Saviour for me!
{103}
T. KELLY (1769-1855) Adapted, 8.8.8.8.
|1|
We'll sing of the Shepherd that died,
That died for the sake of the flock;
His love to the utmost was tried,
But firmly endured as a rock.
|2|
What love from this Shepherd did flow,
When in care for the sheep He was led
To stand between them and the foe,
And lay down His life in their stead!
|3|
Our song then for ever shall be
Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus;
No subject's more glorious than He,
No theme more affecting to us.
|4|
Of Him and His love will we sing,
His praises our tongues shall employ,
Till heavenly anthems we bring
In yonder bright regions of joy.
{104}
P. F. HILLER (1699-1769) from German, 8.7.8.7.8.7.7.
|1|
We wait for Thee, O Son of God,
And long for Thine appearing;
"A little while" -- Thou'lt come, O Lord,
Thy waiting people cheering.
Thus hast Thou said; we lift the head
In joyful expectation,
For Thou wilt bring salvation.
|2|
We wait for Thee, content to share
In patience, days of trial;
So meekly Thou the cross didst bear,
Our sin, reproach, denial.
How should not we receive with Thee
The cup of shame and sorrow,
Until the promised morrow?
|3|
We wait for Thee, for Thou, e'en here,
Hast won our hearts' affection;
In spirit still we find Thee near,
Our solace and protection.
In cloudless light and glory bright,
We soon with joy shall greet Thee,
And in the air shall meet Thee.
|4|
We wait for Thee -- Thou wilt arise,
Whilst hope her watch is keeping;
Forgotten then in glad surprise
Shall be our years of weeping.
Our hearts beat high, the dawn is nigh
That ends our pilgrim story
In Thine eternal glory.
{105}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Glory, glory everlasting
Be to Him who bore the cross,
Who redeemed our souls by tasting
Death, the death deserved by us.
Spread His glory,
Who redeemed His people thus!
|2|
His is love, 'tis love unbounded,
Without measure, without end;
Human thought is here confounded,
'Tis too vast to comprehend.
Praise the Saviour!
Magnify the sinner's Friend!
|3|
While we tell the wondrous story
Of the Saviour's cross and shame,
Sing we, everlasting glory
Be to God and to the Lamb.
Hallelujah!
Give ye glory to His Name!
{106}
R ROBINSON (1735-1790), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace!
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for ceaseless songs of praise.
|2|
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand'ring from the ways of God;
He to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.
|3|
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
|4|
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to grieve the One I love;
Yet Thou, Lord, hast deigned to seal it
With Thy Spirit from above.
|5|
Rescued thus from sin and danger,
Purchased by the Saviour's blood,
May I walk on earth a stranger,
As a son and heir of God.
{107}
S. MEDLEY (1738-1799), L.M.
|1|
Awake, each saint, in joyful lays,
To sing the great Redeemer's praise;
He justly claims a song from thee:
His loving kindness, O how free!
|2|
He saw us ruined in the fall,
Yet loved us notwithstanding all;
He saved us from our lost estate:
His loving kindness, O how great!
|3|
Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,
Though earth and hell our way oppose,
He safely leads His saints along:
His loving kindness, O how strong!
|4|
When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gathered thick and thundered loud.
He by His church has always stood:
His loving kindness, O how good!
|5|
Soon He will call us hence away
To the bright realms of endless day;
There shall we with Himself above
His loving kindness ever prove.
{108}
W. B. HARRIS, L.M.
|1|
O Holy Spirit, Thee we bless,
Thy Person and Thy power confess;
Equal in Godhead glory Thou,
To Thee our souls in worship bow.
|2|
In love and perfect unity,
One of the hallowed Trinity,
God's blest design Thou dost promote;
To Thee our praises we devote.
|3|
With saints on earth now pleased to dwell,
The Comforter, blest springing Well:
Thou Holy One from heav'n sent down,
How great, how glorious, Thy renown!
|4|
We worship in Thy presence thus,
Rejoicing that Thou art with us.
O heav'nly foretaste here below
Of nearness we shall ever know!
{109}
R. G. FEAR, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Blest Holy Spirit, Thou
Who strivest here with men,
We seek Thy service now,
That Thou might'st show again
A demonstration of God's power,
To crown the service of this hour.
|2|
Because of who Thou art,
There is no mystery
Within the human heart --
'Tis all laid bare to thee;
And Thou dost with unerring skill
Expose its depths, subdue its will.
|3|
O may God's word anew
Move every soul today;
May nought obscure our view,
Or catch the seed away;
And let Thy voice be clearly heard
As Thou dost clothe the spoken word.
|4|
Soon shall this service cease,
Thy patient toil be o'er;
The harvest's full increase
Be God's for evermore,
When Thy great work, in secret might,
Has brought the treasure all to light.
{110}
MRS G R COWELL, 13.13.13.13.(7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.)
|1|
The darkest hour, Lord Jesus, that rolled o'er Thy blest head
Called forth the sweetest fragrance that e'er on earth was shed
That cup so full so bitter -- the wormwood and the gall --
Directly from Thy Father Thou didst accept it all.
|2|
What perfect meek submission! -- Thy will, not Mine be done --
Obedience full, unquestioned: perfection of a Son!
Thus prostrate there before Him, Thy sweat as drops of blood --
And so to be the Victim, the spotless Lamb of God!
|3|
Yet Thou, O holy Suff'rer, couldst "Abba, Father!" cry,
Through all Thy woe abiding in sonship's perfect tie.
O glorious heav'nly Leader, perfect through suff'ring Thou;
Captain of our salvation! With rev'rent hearts we bow.
|4|
Thou hast Thyself, Lord Jesus, our hearts' affection gained.
How can we give Thee comfort for what Thou hast sustained?
Entire and full devotion alone can worthy be,
Till, love to love responsive, Thy glorious face we see.
{111}
UNKNOWN from French, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
'Tis the truest joy and blessing
Jesus as our Lord to know,
Here to yield Him full allegiance,
Follow in His steps below.
|2|
With a perfect love He loves us,
Nought its ceaseless flow can stay;
For His pleasure He has bought us,
He Himself is ours for aye.
|3|
Never shall His love, so faithful,
Of our needs forgetful be:
'Tis a source that never faileth,
Inexhaustible and free.
|4|
If He claims our hearts' affections
Unreserved as His own,
'Tis because of love unchanging,
That in Him was first made known.
{112}
A. P. CECIL (1841-1889), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Trembling soul, behold Thy Saviour,
Seated on the father's throne;
Object of God's highest favour,
See Him, God's beloved Son!
|2|
Once on earth in Bethlehem's manger,
As a holy Babe, He lay;
God come down, a heav'nly Stranger,
Love to sinners to display.
|3|
Sinner, see thy God beside thee,
In a servant's form come near,
Sitting, walking, talking with thee!
Sinai's mount no longer fear.
|4|
Onward still to Calv'ry moving,
Onward still He treads His way,
God the Father's will fulfilling,
Love to sinners to display.
|5|
Hearken to the wondrous story --
Jesus died and rose for thee;
God in heav'n now waits to save thee,
And, believing, thou art free.
{113}
A. P. GIPPS, 11.10.11.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus, come, Thy saints for Thee are waiting,
To see Thy face and be with Thee at home;
E'en now our endless bliss anticipating,
With all our hearts we say, "Lord Jesus, come!"
|2|
Lord Jesus, come, our hearts for Thee are longing,
To share Thy joy in those bright courts above,
Where Thou wilt have Thy saints around Thee thronging,
In all the blessed fulness of Thy love.
|3|
Lord Jesus, come; with hearts and voices blending,
Soon shall we praise Thee in Thy Father's home;
Soon shall we sing the new song, never ending,
But now we sing to Thee, "Lord Jesus, come!"
{114}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, source of every grace,
Glorious in light divine,
Soon shall we see Thee face to face,
And in that glory shine;
|2|
Be ever with Thee, hear Thy voice,
Unhindered then shall taste
The love which doth our hearts rejoice,
Though absent in this waste.
|3|
In peaceful wonder we adore
The thoughts of love divine,
Which in that world, for evermore,
Unite our lot with Thine.
{115}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), S.M.
|1|
Lead on, almighty Lord,
Lead on to victory;
Encouraged by Thy blessed word,
With joy we follow Thee.
|2|
We follow Thee, our Guide,
Who didst salvation bring;
We follow Thee, through grace supplied
From heav'n's eternal spring:
|3|
Till, of the prize possessed,
We hear of war no more,
And, O sweet thought! for ever rest
On yonder peaceful shore.
{116}
MRS. A. M. FENNELL, L.M.
|1|
Blest God and father, we confess
We every grace derive from Thee,
And from Thy well-beloved Son
Whose death secured our liberty.
|2|
The Holy Spirit's power reveals
The things that to our peace belong;
No element can now intrude,
Nor jarring notes disturb our song.
|3|
How may we rise to Thy vast thoughts,
Or apprehend Thy sovereign will --
The grace that sets our souls on high,
And love that brings us nearer still?
|4|
Embraced in Thine unchanging love,
Its holy stimulus doth serve
To wake our richest songs of praise,
And claim our hearts without reserve.
|5|
O wondrous sphere! 'Tis vibrant now
With one resounding note of joy
From many sons who worship Thee --
Eternity's serene employ.
|6|
Absorbed in favour all divine
Conferred on those of high estate,
Our hearts, surrend'ring unto Thee,
Are lost in love so full, so great.
{117}
A. G. DOUGHTY, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, in past and distant ages,
Long before the ken of man,
Ere creation's words were spoken,
Or the heav'ns and earth began,
Thou wast there in all Thy glory --
Blessed Lord, we bow the knee --
Dwelling then in love unbounded:
Homage now we render Thee.
|2|
What that love no thought can fathom;
Nor can human lips define
Those relationships eternal,
All inscrutable, divine!
But, in time, Thou wouldst in manhood
Here the Name of God declare,
In a wondrous, blest relation
Which Thou couldst with others share.
|3|
All His will Thou hast accomplished,
All the work He gave Thee, done;
One in thought, in plan and purpose,
He the Father, Thou the Son.
But on resurrection's morning,
To Thine own Thou didst declare
That Thy Father was their Father,
And His love they now might share.
{118}
J. F. GARLAND, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit --
Ever One.
|2|
As we view the vast creation,
Planned with wondrous skill,
So our minds would move to worship,
And be still.
|3|
But, our God, how great Thy yearning
To have sons who love
In Thy house e'en now to praise Thee,
Then above!
|4|
'Twas Thy thought in revelation,
To present to men
Secrets of Thine own affections,
Theirs to win.
|5|
So in Christ, through His redemption
(Vanquished evil powers!),
Thou hast brought, in new creation,
Worshippers!
|6|
Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit --
Ever One.
{119}
MISS N. VERGETTE, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God and father, we draw near to Thee
In all the worth of Thy beloved Son;
All Thou hast e'er desired from man we see
In Him, Thy Christ, Thine own anointed One.
|2|
No thought of His e'er moved apart from Thine;
Each holy footstep gave Thee fresh delight;
Perfect expression of Thy will divine
Thou hadst in Him -- come forth from glory bright.
|3|
Thou ever lovedst Him -- ere time began
He was beside Thee -- one in all Thou art;
In Godhead counsel one, in that vast plan
In which Thou wouldst make known to men Thy heart.
|4|
And now Thou lov'st Him, for Himself He gave --
Theme of our song when time shall cease to be;
Laid down His life that Thou, O God, shouldst have
Fruit of Thy love in sons who worship Thee.
{120}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), L.M.
|1|
Father, in Thine eternal power,
Thy grace and majesty divine,
No soul, in this weak mortal hour,
Can grasp the glory that is Thine!
|2|
E'en in its thoughts of boundless grace
It leaves us all far, far behind;
The love that gives with Christ a place
Surpasses our poor feeble mind!
|3|
And yet that love is not unknown
To those who have the Saviour seen;
Nor strange to those He calls His own,
Pilgrims in scenes where He has been.
|4|
In Him Thy perfect love revealed
Has led our hearts that love to trace,
Where nothing of that love's concealed,
But meets us in our lowly place.
|5|
And here we walk as sons, through grace,
A Father's love our present joy;
Sons in the brightness of Thy face
Find rest no sorrows can destroy!
{121}
C W COOPER, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
To Thee, O gracious Spirit,
Our thankful hearts we raise;
Thy Person and Thy service
Call forth a song of praise.
Thou who wast sent from heaven
Dost every glory know,
Yet now we have Thee with us,
Serving in grace below.
|2|
The endless joy of sonship
Through Thee we apprehend;
With Christ before the Father,
By Thee doth praise ascend.
From glory unto glory
We're changed by power divine.
Blest Spirit of adoption,
Glory and praise be Thine!
{122}
J. G. DECK, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest Lord, Thy love's unbounded,
So full, so vast, so free!
Our thoughts are all transported
Whene'er we think of Thee:
For us Thou cam'st from heaven,
For us Thou, Lord, didst die,
That, purchased and forgiven,
We might ascend on high.
|2|
But O the hope of being
For ever with Thee, Lord,
The joyful hope of seeing
Thy face, for us so marred!
It fills our hearts with comfort,
It fills our lips with praise,
So that amidst our sorrow
A joyful song we raise.
|3|
O Lamb of God, we thank Thee,
We bless Thy holy Name
For love that made Thee willing
To bear our sin and shame.
And now Thy love is waiting
Thy saints like Thee to raise;
Firstborn of many brethren,
To Thee we give our praise!
|4|
O by Thy love constrain us,
And fix our hearts on Thee;
Let nothing henceforth pain us,
But that which paineth Thee;
Our joy, our blest endeavour,
Through suff'ring, conflict, shame,
To serve Thee, gracious Saviour,
And magnify Thy Name.
{123}
A. J. WIGGINTON, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
God waits in grace with hands outstretched to bless --
Glad news from heav'n!
Mercy dispensed in perfect righteousness,
Sinners forgiv'n!
Repentance only, God requires from man,
And faith in Christ, His well-beloved Son.
|2|
This priceless favour you may now embrace;
'Tis offered free,
Since Jesus suffered in the sinner's place
On Calv'ry's tree;
Blest sinless One! for us He sin was made,
Redemption's price by precious blood was paid.
|3|
Unsparing judgment, in that dark, lone hour,
In love He bore;
Laid down His life, destroyed death's fearful power;
His work is o'er!
Atonement made, God fully satisfied,
The mighty Saviour's ris'n and glorified.
|4|
God's secret things, long treasured up in heav'n,
In Christ are shown;
Peace, sonship, joy, the Holy Spirit giv'n,
Through Him are known.
God's word obey, these wondrous blessings share --
The Spirit's comfort, guidance, love and care.
{124}
MISS A. E. PRICE (1838-1919), C.M.
|1|
Jesus, our Lord, Thou Morning Star,
How well we know Thy Name!
Jesus, the Lord, the Crucified,
In glory still the same.
|2|
Jesus, the One who left the throne
To save a ruined race,
Thy love and lowliness still shine
Upon Thy glorious face.
|3|
Jesus, the One who trod the earth,
The lowly, subject One,
Obedience unto death was Thine,
God's well-beloved Son!
|4|
Jesus, what memories thrill our hearts
Of Thy blest footprints here,
While now to heav'n our eyes we turn
And gaze upon Thee there!
|5|
Jesus, our Saviour, quickly come,
That we may with Thee be;
Heav'n's morning breaks and glory dawns
When Thy blest face we see.
{125}
D. T. HOLDING, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Praise to Thee, our God, belongeth,
Worship from the creature Thine;
Thou art mighty, glorious ever,
Great in majesty divine!
Unapproachable Thy dwelling
In the light that none could know,
Yet Thy works aloud proclaim Thee,
Thine eternal power show.
|2|
Far flung heavens cannot bound Thee,
Though Thy glory they declare;
Earth but serves Thee for a footstool,
Framed with skill that none can share.
O how good then is Thy mercy,
Now our portion to embrace;
Wonderful Thy patience, goodness,
Vast the riches of Thy grace!
|3|
From eternal ages onward
To the ages yet unknown
Thou art God, unchanged, unchanging,
And immortal art alone.
Ever just are all Thy dealings,
Perfect wisdom marks Thy way;
Righteousness attends upon Thee,
Truth before Thee holdeth sway.
|4|
And through all, Thy blessed nature --
Love, eternal and divine --
Shines in universal blessing,
Waking praises rightly Thine.
Thou dost dwell amid the praises
Gladly yielded unto Thee:
In th' assembly in Christ Jesus
Glory to Thee ever be!
{126}
J. EARL, 8.6.8.6.8.8.
|1|
Our God, we bless Thee, glorious source
Of light and love divine;
From Thee all blessing emanates,
The power, the greatness Thine;
Father of every family,
Supreme in love's economy.
|2|
Exalted, Thou, as Head o'er all;
Majestic is Thy seat!
Thy glorious Name our souls revere,
And worship, as is meet.
Complacent in Thy love, we see
All things made subject unto Thee.
|3|
We thus anticipate Thy day,
Thou King of ages blest,
When all shall know Thy glorious sway,
And love shall be at rest.
Th' eternal scene then filled by Thee --
Thou all in all shalt ever be.
{127}
W. R. MASON, C.M.
|1|
O wilt thou to the Saviour come?
This hour He waits for thee,
To cleanse Thy conscience, fill Thy heart,
Thy captive soul set free.
|2|
Let not Thy sins keep thee away,
Since on the cross He died;
And from the dead was raised that we
Might now be justified.
|3|
O see Him there at God's right hand,
Made Lord and Christ above!
Redemption's finished work ensures
That thou His grace canst prove.
|4|
Whate'er thy need He'll meet it now,
In Him thou canst confide;
Take from His hand the blessing free,
And in His love abide.
|5|
The Holy Spirit, too, He'll give,
To fill Thy heart with joy,
To fill thy life with power divine,
Thy lips with praise employ.
|6|
And when to glory thou art come,
The joys that thou hast found
Will make, while endless ages roll,
The heav'ns with praise resound.
{128}
G. H. S. PRICE, 6.4.6.4.
|1|
Come, for the Father's love
For thee doth shine;
All that our God would give
Now may be thine.
|2|
Christ died upon the cross
That peace divine
By virtue of His blood
Might now be thine.
|3|
Then would the Spirit shed,
In rays benign,
The love of God within
That heart of thine.
|4|
Our hearts are longing too,
As they combine
To plead that all this joy
May now be thine.
|5|
Let not the message pass,
Nor it decline;
Else what is now so near
May ne'er be thine.
|6|
Come, yield to Christ as Lord,
Own Him as thine;
Then thou wilt gladly say,
Yes, all is mine!
{129}
A. P. BODMAN, 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
"Thou art that God" to the ages eternal,
Loved and adored by blest myriads of men!
Feeling the warmth of affections paternal,
Fam'lies predestined shall fill earth and heav'n.
|2|
Strengthened with might by the Father's own Spirit,
We now by faith hold the Christ in our heart;
Thus apprehending a sphere without limit,
Love of the Christ passing knowledge our part.
|3|
God, Thou are able to fill to Thy fulness
Hearts which are stirred by this wonderful theme;
In the assembly, now blest in Christ Jesus,
Be to Thee endlessly glory supreme!
{130}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
"Come unto Me -- and I will give you rest";
What blessed words to weary ones addressed!
They come from Him who knew the depth of woe,
And felt for sinners as none here below.
|2|
"Come unto Me," yes, come in all your sin!
Through Jesus' blood the vile may enter in,
May come to God who knows their guilt and need,
Assured the blood was shed for them indeed.
|3|
"Come unto Me," the blessed Son of God
Thus told on earth, in every step He trod,
The heart of Him who is in nature love,
And is inviting men that love to prove.
|4|
"Come unto Me," yes, God Himself says, Come!
He sees afar, and runs to welcome home
Unworthy sinners, who have nought to plead
But God's own love and their exceeding need.
|5|
"Come unto Me," O blessed open door!
For those who but for Christ had hoped no more;
O love of God! told out in full extent,
When Jesus to those depths of darkness went.
{131}
D. OTSING from Russian, 9.8.9.8.9.8.9.8.
|1|
O Lord, with our ears and hearts open,
Awaiting Thy shout would we be,
The summons that calls us to heaven,
For ever to be Lord, with Thee.
Thy word and Thy Spirit, blest Lover,
The earnest, are giv'n to Thy bride;
Thou'rt near to faith's vision, O Saviour,
But soon she will be at Thy side.
|2|
O come then, Lord Jesus, we're watching!
And take now Thy spouse home to Thee!
Thine absence awakens deep yearning,
The bride her loved Bridegroom to see.
Thy heart, O Lord Jesus, is throbbing
With love deep, eternal, we know;
Our hearts in response, with love's burning,
Await Thee, with lamps all aglow.
|3|
The Spirit and bride are united
In saying, "Come," Lord, yea, come soon!
Throughout the long night she has waited
To see Thee, her faithful Bridegroom.
Gross darkness the earth doth now cover,
And night like a pall shrouds the land;
Thy flock is still here, Shepherd Lover,
The sheep Thou hast kept by Thy hand.
|4|
Midst darkness faith clearly sees beaming
The light of Thy coming afar;
We watch for the dawn of the morning,
And hail Thee, the bright Morning Star.
The word of Thy patience we're keeping,
Thy radiancy draws us apart --
A beacon us heav'nward attracting --
To meet Thee, the Hope of our heart!
{132}
MISS F. T. WIGRAM (1831-1871), S.M.
|1|
The person of the Christ,
Enfolding every grace,
Once slain, but now alive again,
In heav'n demands our praise.
|2|
Gladly of Him we sing,
Since we with Him are dead;
Our life is hid with Christ in God,
In Christ the church's Head.
|3|
The heav'ns are opened now,
Sound it through earth abroad!
And we, by faith, in heav'n behold
Jesus the Christ our Lord.
{133}
G. H. S. PRICE, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the wonder of the moment!
God outshining from above
To secure a scene of glory,
All responsive to His love.
Thoughts eternal are unfolded;
Now, in time, their wealth expressed,
For the men that he had purposed
Should with Christ, the Son, be blessed.
|2|
But the objects of that favour
Were in chains of bondage bound;
Guilty sinners must be ransomed,
And the lost must needs be found.
Love was thus in mercy seeking
Satan's captives from the fall,
And the wonder of the story --
Jesus died to save them all!
|3|
Thus that work in all it's glory
Every thought of God maintains,
While His grace o'er all has triumphed,
And through righteousness now reigns.
Here the Spirit too bears witness
To the truth that all is done.
O the wonder of the moment --
God outshining in His Son!
{134}
J. EARL, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
We sing to Thee, Lord Jesus,
We own Thy claims supreme;
The greatness of Thy person,
Our all-engaging theme:
The glory of Thy manhood,
The charm of Thine own grace.
Attracted by Thy beauty,
We yield to Thine embrace.
|2|
How fair is Thy companion!
How pleasing in Thy sight!
To be Thy joy for ever,
Object of Thy delight;
Fruit of Thine own blest service,
For whom Thou gav'st Thy life;
The answer to Thy suff'rings,
Thy glory, Lord, Thy wife!
|3|
The joyous consummation
Of union, Lord, with Thee!
As of Thee, like Thee, for Thee,
Now and eternally;
In wifely understanding
A comfort to Thy heart --
God's answer to Thy longings,
Thy like, Thy counterpart!
{135}
I. FLEMING, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Thee we praise, our God and Father,
Thou Thy love hast shown;
Ere the world was, Thou didst choose us
For Thine own.
|2|
Thou Thine only Son hast given,
Thou art glorified,
For, in love to bring us near Thee,
He has died.
|3|
By the Spirit now indwelling
We with Christ have part;
Father! we Thy sons now call Thee,
From our heart.
|4|
Love divine our present portion,
Heaven's choicest store;
Thee we worship, God and Father,
Thee adore!
|5|
Soon in Thine own house around Thee
Still our praise shall swell;
Sons before Thee ever joying
We shall dwell.
|6|
For His praise who glorified Thee
We like Him shall be;
Firstborn He of many brethren
Praising Thee.
{136}
T. WILLEY, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, spring and source of blessing,
Grateful praise to Thee we bring;
Objects of Thy sovereign favour,
Gladly of Thy love we sing;
Love that found its full expression
In Thy well-beloved Son,
Who, now dwelling in Thy bosom,
Has Thy love made fully known.
|2|
Thine eternal, gracious purpose
Now to us in Christ is shown,
Purpose fraught with richest blessing
For the sons Thou hadst foreknown.
Brought to rest within the circle
Where love's treasures are displayed,
There we drink the living waters,
Taste the joys that never fade.
|3|
Brought to know Thy Well-beloved,
Drawn to Him in boundless grace --
Thine effulgence, love and glory
Shining in His blessed face --
We adore Thee, God and Father,
May Thy Name exalted be!
Praise and worship we would render
Now as in eternity.
{137}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
We praise Thee, Lord, blest source of deepest joy,
Responsive to Thy voice of holy love;
Thou living spring of bliss without alloy,
Bright inlet to the light of heav'n above!
|2|
We praise Thee, Lord, for in Thy blessed face
God's glory shines for us without a veil;
And now Thou leadest us in righteous grace
To that blest place where praises never fail.
|3|
We live of Thee, we've heard Thy quick'ning voice
Speaking of love beyond all human thought --
Thy Father's love, in which we now rejoice,
As those in spirit to Thy Father brought.
|4|
Thou hast made known the father, whom we've seen
In Thy blest Person -- infinite delight!
Yea, it suffices, though we here but glean
Some foretaste of His love, till all be light.
{138}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), L.M.
|1|
A holy Father's constant care
Keeps watch, with an unwearying eye,
To see what fruits His children bear --
Fruits that may suit their calling high;
|2|
Takes ever knowledge of our state:
What dims communion with His love,
Might check our growth, or separate
Our hearts from what's revealed above.
|3|
O wondrous love! that ne'er forgets
The objects of its tender care;
May chasten still, while sin besets,
To warn and guard them where they are;
|4|
Yet ne'er forgets, but feeds them still
With tokens of His tender love;
Will keep till, freed from every ill,
They find their rest with Him above.
|5|
O wondrous, infinite, divine!
Keep near, our souls, to that blest place
Where all those heav'nly glories shine,
Which suit the brightness of His face.
|6|
O lowliness, how feebly known,
That meets the grace that gave the Son!
That waits to serve Him as His own,
Till grace, what grace began, shall crown!
{139}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 9.9.9.9.
|1|
This world is a wilderness wide;
We have nothing to seek nor to choose;
We've no thought in the waste to abide;
We have nought to regret nor to lose.
|2|
For the Lord has Himself gone before;
He has marked out the path that we tread;
It's as sure as the love we adore;
We have nothing to fear nor to dread.
|3|
For the path where our Saviour has gone
Has led up to His Father and God,
To the place where He's now on the throne;
And His strength shall be ours on the road.
|4|
And with Him shall our rest be on high,
When in holiness bright we sit down,
In the joy of His love ever nigh,
In the peace that His presence shall crown.
|5|
'Tis the treasure we've found in His love
That has made us now pilgrims below;
And 'tis there, when we reach Him above,
As we're known, all His fulness we'll know.
|6|
And our Saviour! 'tis Thee from on high
We await till the time Thou shalt come,
To take those Thou hast led by Thine eye
To Thyself in Thy heavenly home.
|7|
Until then, 'tis the path Thou hast trod
Our delight and our comfort shall be;
We're content with Thy staff and Thy rod,
Till with Thee all Thy glory we see.
{140}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), C.M.
|1|
"Praise ye the Lord," again, again,
The Spirit strikes the chord;
Nor toucheth He our hearts in vain:
We praise, we praise the Lord.
|2|
Rejoice in Him, ye saints, again,
The Spirit speaks the word;
And faith takes up the happy strain:
Our joy is in the Lord.
|3|
For ever be the glory giv'n
O Lamb of God, to Thee!
Thyself, O Lord, on earth, in heav'n,
Our theme of joy shalt be.
{141}
E. CARREN from Swedish, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
God and Father, source of glory,
High above our praise art Thou;
Yet in Christ Thou hast declared
Love that makes our spirits bow.
|2|
From eternity 'twas purposed
Thou shouldst have this rich delight,
Hearts to swell Thy praise for ever,
Sons to worship in Thy sight.
|3|
Thou didst sanctify and send Him,
All Thy counsels to make good --
Him who knew Thine earnest longing,
And Thy feelings understood.
|4|
He no service thought too lowly,
And no sacrifice too great
To secure Thy plan so holy,
And its objects extricate.
|5|
Now Thy love has found its answer,
All Thy thoughts secured and sealed;
And the sons Thou hast been seeking
Their eternal tribute yield.
{142}
MRS. C. M HANDS, L.M.
|1|
Lord, for Thine interests we would care,
Thyself our living Head in heav'n;
Soon we shall in Thy glory share
With Thee, to whom all power is giv'n.
|2|
Spirit of truth, sustain us now,
Grant us Thy mind, our thoughts control;
The One who lifts a standard, Thou,
When evil like a flood doth roll.
|3|
Lord, we would seek to do Thee good,
With wifely feelings here below;
Stand for Thee where Thou once hast stood,
E'en here on earth Thy features show.
|4|
Lord, Thou dost in Thy church confide,
That Thou shalt have no lack of spoil;
Thyself our strength, Thy word our guide,
We know 'tis not in vain, our toil.
|5|
Firm in Thy work may we abide,
Faithful to Thee may we remain,
Till Thou shalt take us to Thy side,
And with Thy church come forth to reign.
{143}
J. PELLATT, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God, from Thy blest heart and mind has spread
The heav'nly light of wisdom all divine,
That we might know in Christ, our living Head,
That which shall e'er all other light outshine.
|2|
And wider still, that to the powers above,
Through the assembly, might be now made known
All-various wisdom of that searchless love,
That yet shall bind the universe in one.
|3|
Before Thee, Father, we would bow our knees,
That, strengthened by Thy Spirit, Christ may dwell
Within our hearts; and by the love that sees
That all-divine domain, Thy praise we tell.
|4|
O love well-known, surpassing all our thought,
Love of the Christ, the climax of all good!
Into eternal sunshine we are brought,
Filled unto all the fulness of our God.
{144}
J. PELLATT, C.M.D.
|1|
In that bright home of love divine,
The Father's house on high,
There the full rays of glory shine
In Him who stooped to die.
And we shall share that home above
Which He for us has won,
As now we share His Father's love
With Him, the first-born Son.
|2|
We shall be with Him where He is,
For such is His desire;
We shall behold His glory bright --
The sight shall bliss inspire!
The Father's everlasting love
Shall shine before our gaze
In Him, transcending all above,
Throughout eternal days.
{145}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, our hearts are waiting
That loud triumphant cry,
Which wakes the saints now sleeping,
And to Thee brings them nigh;
When we, with them ascending,
Shall meet Thee in the air,
To gaze upon Thy glory,
And all Thy likeness bear.
|2|
O hour for which in patience
Thou'rt waiting through the night,
Till all Thy saints are gathered,
And brought into the light!
Then, then, the church completed,
God maketh no delay;
O Lord, with shouts of triumph
We pass into the day.
|3|
O hour of richest blessing!
When brought to Thee so nigh,
To be Thy joy for ever,
And dwell with Thee on high;
To rest in all that brightness,
And ever there abide;
To find Thy heart delighting
In us, Thy heav'nly bride.
|4|
O blessed, coming Saviour,
Speak then the joyous word,
To which our hearts shall answer,
"For ever with the Lord."
And then with Thee, blest Saviour,
We evermore shall be,
In deepest, fullest blessing,
For ever one with Thee.
{146}
C. W. COOPER, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest Spirit, as assembled,
For power and grace we yearn,
For help and understanding
The depths of God to learn.
The saints Thou art uniting
In faith, in hope, in love,
'Mid scenes of conflict guiding
T'ward that bright rest above.
|2|
The truth Thou art unfolding;
Attentive would we be;
As subject to Thy leading,
What heav'nly light we see!
We value all Thy service,
Thou blest, unfailing Spring;
Our hearts, with joy and gladness,
To Thee responsive sing.
{147}
MISS A. S. ORMSBY, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Come! -- 'tis Jesus gently calling --
Ye with care and toil opprest,
With your guilt, howe'er appalling,
Come, and I will give you rest.
On the cross He once has suffered,
There by Him the work was done;
And the word by God now uttered
To each weary soul is -- Come!
|2|
Come! -- the Father's house stands open,
With its love and light and song;
And returning to that Father,
All to you may now belong.
From sin's distant land of famine,
Toiling 'neath the mid-day sun,
To a Father's house of plenty,
And a Father's welcome, Come!
|3|
Come! -- for night is gath'ring quickly
O'er this world's fast fleeting day;
If you linger in the darkness,
You will surely miss your way.
From the world and its delusion --
Now our voices rise as one,
While we give God's invitation;
Heav'n itself re-echoes -- Come!
{148}
B G HARDINGHAM, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, how our souls adore
That perfect love of Thine!
We'd sing its sweetness o'er and o'er,
Immeasurable, divine.
|2|
We think of Thee, God's blessed Son,
Whom heav'nly hosts revere,
Girding Thyself to serve Thine own,
A lowly Bondman here.
|3|
What deep affections moved Thee here,
As Thou didst seek Thy bride,
Joy of Thine heart, to Thee how dear!
Love could not be denied.
|4|
Thou gavest all that love could give,
The goodly pearl to gain;
Thou gav'st Thy life that we might live,
And Thou Thy bride obtain.
|5|
Fruit of that wondrous love of Thine,
We praise, we worship Thee;
Thy love unsearchable, divine,
Our endless song shall be.
{149}
MRS V GOULD, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, we are gathered now
Once more to Thy blest Name;
What joy and gladness fill our hearts
As we Thyself acclaim!
|2|
We sing to Thee, blest Spirit, too;
Thy service, O how great!
Thou wouldst our hearts unite as one,
Christ's love to contemplate.
|3|
Thus, blessed Lord, with thoughts of Thee
Our hearts expectant glow;
And fresh impressions of Thy love
Make grateful praises flow.
{150}
J. REVELL (d. 1900), C.M.D.
|1|
Jesus our Lord, of Thee, the King,
Our song shall ever be;
Our tribute now we gladly bring
To offer unto Thee.
Thine hand hath ope'd these lips once dumb,
To sound Thy praise abroad;
To sing of Thee whilst travelling home
Along the barren road.
|2|
Men sing aloud the praise of man,
The creature of a day,
Whose little life is as a span,
Whose glory fades away.
Of Thee our song, God's blessed Son,
In Thee we make our boast --
Th' eternal, changeless, blessed One,
Theme of the ransomed host.
|3|
Creation's work in every land,
Adorned and beautified,
Is marred by man's ungrateful hand,
Where Thou wast crucified.
This makes the earth, bright though it seem,
A desert waste to us;
No home can we the place esteem
Which served our Saviour thus.
|4|
Lord Jesus, here we wait for Thee,
And as we wait we sing.
E'en now the Morning Star we see
Of earth's rejected King.
Ours then the nobler song to raise,
Before Thine own blest face,
And spend eternity in praise
With Thee, in that bright place.
{151}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, when we think of Thee,
Of all Thy love and grace,
Our spirits long and fain would see
Thy beauty, face to face.
|2|
And though the wilderness we tread,
A barren, thirsty ground,
With thorns and briars overspread,
Where foes and snares abound;
|3|
Yet in Thy love such depths we see,
Our souls well forth in praise --
Content ourselves, while, Lord, to Thee
A joyful song we raise.
|4|
Our Lord, our Life, our rest, our Shield,
Our Rock, our Food, our Light;
Each thought of Thee doth constant yield
Unchanging, fresh delight.
|5|
Blest Saviour, keep our spirits stayed,
Hard following after Thee,
Till we, in robes of white arrayed,
Thy face in glory see.
{152}
A CUTTING, 10.8.10.7.8.13.
|1|
Down from the glory came God's blessed Son,
Lost ones to save, lost ones to save;
Went into death and the victory won,
Triumphant rose from the grave --
Mighty to save! mighty to save!
Now in the glory He's able and willing to save.
|2|
Sin's bitter judgement He bore on the tree,
Dying to save, dying to save;
So that the sinner might justly go free,
His precious blood Jesus gave,
Sinners to save! sinners to save!
Now He is righteously able the guilty to save.
|3|
Sinner, God bids you on Jesus believe,
Now while you may, now while you may;
Peace and salvation through Him you'll receive;
Do not, O do not delay!
Haste thee away! haste thee away!
Infinite love waits to welcome the sinner today.
{153}
G A LUCAS, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thy suff'ring love, Lord Jesus,
Our hearts delight to trace;
The love that sought and claimed us,
In strong yet tender grace.
|2|
We think of Thy devotion,
Thy blest obedience rare;
Thy holy, deep emotion,
Thy grief that none could share.
|3|
Thus to our hearts Thou speakest;
Blest Lord, we hear Thy voice;
We know its charm, its sweetness,
And in Thy love rejoice.
|4|
We wait the consummation
Of love's own work divine,
And now in adoration
We joy that we are Thine.
{154}
L. G. MILNER, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Thou, Lord, to death's domain
Didst go alone.
Death had on Thee no claim,
Thou sinless One!
He who had death's dread power
Met Thee in that dark hour:
Vanquished by Thee his power,
By Thee alone.
|2|
But Thou hast burst the grave,
Risen art Thou;
Death could not Thee enslave,
Death had to bow!
Victorious hast Thou come
Out of the darksome tomb,
Broken the bands of gloom:
Beyond death now.
|3|
What mighty triumphs, Lord,
Thou didst achieve!
What fruitfulness doth God
From Thee receive!
Out of Thy death has sprung
A wondrous living throng:
All, all to Thee belong,
And in Thee live.
|4|
Firstborn of all Thou art,
Lowly we bow;
Chief in Thy Father's heart --
Chief to us now.
Thou art indeed supreme,
Our great eternal theme,
Worthy of all esteem:
Worthy art Thou!
{155}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 8.5.8.5.8.5.8.5.
|1|
Blessed Lord, our hallelujahs
Now to Thee we raise;
Never could we fully utter
All Thy worth and praise.
Praise the Lamb! yes, Thou art worthy,
Who didst shed Thy blood
To redeem Thy saints and make us
Kings and priests to God.
|2|
Yes, we praise Thee, for Thou lov'st us;
And we bless Thee, Lord,
For the peace and joy and gladness
Which Thou dost afford.
Hallelujah! Thou, Lord Jesus,
Canst not cease to love;
Thine we are, and Thine for ever,
One with Thee above.
|3|
Praise the Lord! Yes, hallelujah!
Who would hush the song?
Join with saints from every nation,
Every tribe and tongue.
Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy,
Sweet eternal strain!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord! Amen.
{156}
R. H. GRACE, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, Thou hast drawn our hearts,
That we might near Thee be;
Thy bride, the object of Thy love --
We thus are one with Thee.
|2|
O wondrous joy in union found,
Thou all in all to us!
Thy holy love fills every heart --
Thy joy to have it thus.
|3|
To be for Thee, O Lord, what bliss
No human tongue can tell!
The movements of such love as this
Responsive songs impel.
|4|
O Lord, we gladly worship Thee,
Blest Son of God Thou art;
Thy beauty and Thy matchless worth
Enrapture every heart.
|5|
Blest Spirit, too, we worship Thee;
Thou art in us the power
To know Christ's love and serve Him thus,
Responsive in this hour.
{157}
M. W. BIGGS, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
We worship Thee, O God,
And praise Thy matchless grace;
Our adoration bring,
And bow before Thy face.
Thy Son hath brought Thy love to light;
In songs of joy we now unite.
|2|
Accepted in Thy Son,
We "Abba, Father!" cry;
Through Him Thy love is known,
In Him we are brought nigh.
With rev'rence and with love we bow
To Thee, O God, our Father Thou!
{158}
P. LYON, L.M.
|1|
Blest Spirit, Comforter divine,
We seek Thy gracious help this hour;
Give us to hear Thy voice benign,
Cause us afresh to prove Thy power.
|2|
Searcher of depths, the depths of God,
Dispenser Thou of heaven's store;
To us, our Guide, fresh grace afford,
As love's domain our hearts explore.
|3|
With every thought by Thee controlled,
The truth's pure light would we pursue,
As Thou, blest Spirit, dost unfold
Eternal glories to our view.
{159}
C DIX, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
"Come unto me," ye weary,
"And I will give you rest."
O blessed voice of Jesus
Which comes to hearts opprest!
It tells of full redemption,
From sin a full release,
Of life which hath no ending,
Of pardon, grace and peace.
|2|
"Come unto Me," ye wand'rers,
And I will give you light.
O loving voice of Jesus
Which comes to cheer the night!
To hearts opprest with sadness,
Which sin has led astray,
He brings eternal gladness:
Why will you say Him, nay?
|3|
For whosoever cometh,
I will not cast him out.
O welcome voice, Lord Jesus,
Which drives away our doubt!
Which calls us, very sinners --
Unworthy though we be
Of love so free and boundless --
To come, blest Lord, to Thee.
{160}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 6.4.6.4.
|1|
O bright and blessed hope!
When shall it be
That we His face, long loved,
Revealed shall see?
|2|
O when, without a cloud,
His features trace,
Whose faithful love so long
We've known in grace;
|3|
That love itself enjoy,
Which, ever true,
Did in our feeble path
Its work pursue?
|4|
O Jesus! not unknown,
Thy love shall fill
The heart in which Thou dwell'st,
And shalt dwell still.
|5|
Still, Lord, to see Thy face,
Thy voice to hear;
To know Thy present love,
For ever near;
|6|
To gaze upon Thyself
So faithful known,
Long proved in secret help
With Thee alone;
|7|
To see that love, content,
On us flow forth,
For ever Thy delight,
Clothed with Thy worth!
|8|
Nor what is next Thy heart
Can we forget;
Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee
In glory met.
|9|
Perfect in comeliness
Before Thy face,
Th' eternal witness, all,
Of Thine own grace;
|10|
Together then their songs
Of endless praise,
With one harmonious voice,
In joy they'll raise!
{161}
C. A. COATES (1862-1945), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Son of God, with joy we view Thee
Of God's love the object meet;
While, Lord Jesus Christ, 'tis through Thee
All our blessing is complete.
|2|
As Thy brethren now we hail Thee,
Firstborn of a heav'nly race;
He who has with glory crowned Thee
Called us to this blessed place.
|3|
From the triumph and the glory
Of Thy rest in love divine,
Comes to us the wondrous story,
How God's purpose made us Thine;
|4|
How by dying Thou hast freed us
From the man of sin and shame,
That, unhindered, Thou mightst lead us
Now to know Thy Father's name.
|5|
And, responsive to Thy longing,
We would now abide in love;
Know Thy joy, as those belonging
To Thyself in heav'n above.
|6|
Thus in holy adoration
At Thy feet our hearts would bow,
Who hast brought, in new creation,
Sons of God before Him now.
|7|
And a song is sweetly thrilling
Every heart within the shrine:
Music which God's ear is filling,
Notes which could be only Thine.
{162}
S P TREGELLES, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, Thou whose loving heart
Still for Thy saints doth care,
We shall behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy full image bear.
|2|
Thy love sustains us by the way,
While pilgrims here below;
Thou dost, O Saviour, day by day,
Thy suited grace bestow.
|3|
But O the more we learn of Thee,
And Thy rich mercy prove,
The more we long Thy face to see,
And fully prove Thy love.
|4|
Then shine, Thou bright and Morning Star,
We wait for Thee to come
And take, from sin and grief afar,
Thy blood-bought people home.
{163}
J. PELLATT, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
"Yet a little while," Thou'rt coming!
All Thine own this promise share;
Patience waits, while love is yearning
For Thy presence in the air.
Sleeping ones will rise immortal,
And the living changed shall be
When, caught up through glory's portal,
We our blessed Saviour see.
|2|
As Thou art in heav'nly glory,
Thine own image we shall bear --
Blessed climax of love's story --
And Thy throne and kingdom share.
O what bliss -- eternal pleasure --
With Thee evermore to be!
Filled with joy beyond all measure
When Thy glorious face we see!
{164}
A. E. BARNES, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
We need Thee, Lord; thus have we come together;
Dark is the night in all the world around;
Thy love supreme has called and drawn us hither,
We in the circle of Thine own are found.
|2|
Now, whilst we wait for Thee to come, Lord Jesus,
Assembled here, remembering Thee we show
Thy death, the bread and cup to all the witness
Of love so great, that sets our hearts aglow.
|3|
We ponder, Lord, that stoop from heav'nly glory,
Mark all the wondrous grace that brought Thee low;
Steadfast Thy face, Thou wentest on to Calv'ry,
E'en into death, that we Thy love might know.
|4|
We praise Thee, Lord! O'er death and grave triumphant,
Free art Thou now from every hostile foe;
Void is the tomb, Thyself no longer straitened;
Free now to us Thy love's great thoughts to show.
{165}
UNKNOWN from German, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Blessed Lord, in love unceasing
Thou dost live to intercede;
Till Thou comest, Thou art serving
All Thine own in time of need.
Wonderful and gracious service,
Love that bears us all the way
On Thine arm, until we enter
On that glorious, endless day!
|2|
Thou appearest for Thy brethren,
Till the pilgrim path is done;
Never can we be forgotten,
Thou wilt guide us safely home.
What though storms may rage against us?
Nought can part us from Thy love!
Well we know Thy hands uplifted --
Thou art on the throne above.
{166}
W. LAWRENCE, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
From scenes of conflict, burden, grief and care,
To Thy blest presence, Lord, we now repair;
Thy shadow here provides a calm retreat,
Where sympathies divine our frailty meet.
|2|
To Thee the cause of every sigh is known,
Thou who hast borne our every grief alone;
Unspoken fears, and questions hard to solve,
Before the rays of heav'nly light dissolve.
|3|
Thy well-proved love our confidence inspires
To count upon the grace that never tires;
So would we make Thine interests, Lord, our care,
And with thanksgiving wait on Thee in prayer.
{167}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
"A little while" -- the Lord shall come,
And we shall journey here no more;
He'll take us to His Father's home,
Where He for us is gone before,
To dwell with Him, to see His face,
And sing the glories of His grace.
|2|
"A little while" -- He'll come again;
Let us the precious hours redeem;
No more to grieve and give Him pain,
Our joy to serve and follow Him.
Watching and ready may we be,
As those that wait their Lord to see.
|3|
"A little while" -- 'twill soon be past;
Why should we shun the promised cross?
O let us in His footsteps haste,
Counting for Him all else but loss!
For how will recompense His smile
The suff'rings of this "little while!"
|4|
"A little while" -- come, Saviour, come!
For Thee Thy saints have tarried long;
O take Thy waiting pilgrims home,
To sing the new eternal song,
To see Thy glory, and to be
In everything conformed to Thee!
{168}
A. H. GRIFFITHS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
The persons of the Godhead,
In wondrous concord, planned
A universe of glory,
Beyond the changing sand
Of time -- where men immortal,
Should dwell in radiant light;
And creature with Creator,
In His own realm delight.
|2|
From out those mighty counsels
What treasures have been shown!
God's choicest thoughts in purpose,
Before the worlds were known --
That we, in Christ, before Him,
Should share the Son's blest place;
Enjoy, in cloudless favour,
The riches of His grace.
|3|
And soon this sonship glory --
Secured in wisdom's way --
Shall be our endless portion
In that eternal day.
So to our God responsive
Our voices now we raise;
To Father, Son and Spirit
Be everlasting praise!
{169}
MRS. K. W SANDELL-BERG (1832-1903) from Swedish, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Christ is risen! Hallelujah!
Where, O death, thy victory?
He is risen and ascended
Far above all mortal eye.
|2|
He is risen, who has suffered;
All sin's weight for us He bore.
He is risen and He liveth
Even now for evermore.
|3|
He is risen! glorious message
From the angel to His own;
Now the sepulchre is empty,
And He's seated on the throne.
|4|
He is risen! O how precious
Was that lonely Corn of Wheat!
Once in death, but now in glory,
Thousands like Him, for Him meet.
|5|
He is risen! glorious Firstfruits,
First-begotten from the dead!
Thus to be to His assembly
Over all things now as Head.
{170}
P. H. HARDWICK, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Blessed God, with Christ before Thee
We approach, in love set free;
The assembly in Christ Jesus
Bringeth glory unto Thee.
|2|
This -- the product of Thy counsels,
Rich with heav'nly beauties dressed,
Formed to praise throughout the ages --
In Thy presence is at rest.
|3|
Vessel filled e'en to Thy fulness,
And replete with radiance bright,
In Thine own domain of glory
Fills Thy heart with deep delight.
{171}
J. G. DECK, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Jesus! That name is love,
Jesus, our Lord!
Jesus, all names above,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou, Lord, our all must be;
Nothing that's good have we,
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!
|2|
As Son of man it was,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou gav'st Thy life for us,
Jesus, our Lord!
Great was indeed Thy love,
All earthly loves above;
Love Thou didst dearly prove,
Jesus, our Lord!
|3|
Righteous alone in Thee,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou all our boast shalt be,
Jesus, our Lord!
Now unto God brought near,
His love dispels all fear;
Thy voice with joy we hear,
Jesus, our Lord!
|4|
Soon Thou wilt come again,
Jesus, the Lord!
Full joy our portion then,
Jesus, our Lord!
When Thine own face we see,
Then shall we like Thee be,
Then evermore with Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!
{172}
J. HUTTON (1715-1795), C.M.
|1|
O teach us more of Thy blest ways,
Thou holy Lamb of God!
And fix and root us in Thy grace,
As those redeemed by blood.
|2|
O tell us often of Thy love,
Of all Thy grief and pain;
And let our hearts with joy confess
That thence comes all our gain.
|3|
For this, O may we freely count
Vain things of earth but dross;
The dearest object of our love,
Apart from Thee, but loss.
|4|
Engrave this deeply on our hearts
With an eternal pen,
That we may, in a fuller way,
Return Thy love again.
{173}
F. D. WATERFALL, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thou dwellest now, O God, midst fragrant praise
Resulting from Thine own great work and ways;
Th' assembly in Christ Jesus -- ever blest,
And filled to all Thy fulness -- is at rest.
|2|
In the Beloved favour now is known
By her whom Christ can call with joy His own;
For whom in love He gave Himself -- His bride --
To be with Him in glory, by His side:
|3|
Radiant in glory, shining in her place -
As held by Christ her Head - with heav'nly grace;
Furnished with wisdom and consummate skill
To render songs of praise, Thine ear to fill.
|4|
Perpetual freshness marks th' eternal day,
Abiding peace, joy ne'er to fade away;
Off'rings for God are in abundance brought,
Willing response for all that Thou hast wrought.
|5|
Mighty, O God, Thine acts, glorious Thy Name!
Majesty, splendour Thine - a lasting fame
And might: but 'tis th' assembly's joy to know
Thy love, which causes now full praise to flow.
{174}
C. A. BERNSTEIN (1672-1699), S.M.
|1|
O patient, spotless One,
Our hearts in meekness train
To bear Thy yoke, and learn from Thee,
That we may rest obtain.
|2|
Jesus! Thou art enough
The mind and heart to fill;
Thy patient life -- to calm the soul;
Thy love -- its fear dispel.
|3|
O fix our earnest gaze
So wholly, Lord, on Thee,
That, with Thy beauty occupied,
We elsewhere none may see.
{175}
MISS H. K. BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 11.11.11.11. TROCHAIC
|1|
Everlasting glory unto Jesus be!
Sing aloud the story of His victory!
How He left the splendour of His home on high,
Came in love so tender, on the cross to die.
|2|
Yes! He came from heaven, suffered in our stead;
Praise to Him be given, Firstborn from the dead!
Jesus, meek and lowly, came the lost to save;
He, the Victim holy, triumphed o'er the grave.
|3|
Christ is Lord of glory, sing we now today.
Tell abroad the story; own His rightful sway!
Sing aloud, and never cease to spread His fame;
Triumph, now and ever, in the Saviour's name.
{176}
J. HART (1712-1768), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
Open wide stands mercy's door;
Jesus ready waits to save you,
Full of pity, love and power:
He is able,
He is willing, doubt no more.
|2|
Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him:
This He gives you,
'Tis the Spirit's rising beam.
|3|
Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
Lost and ruined by the fall;
If you tarry till you're better,
You will never come at all:
Not the righteous,
Sinners Jesus came to call.
{177}
MRS. S. HEDMAN from Swedish, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Father, in Thy love unbounded,
Thou hast called us sons;
Chosen ere the world was founded,
Thy beloved ones.
|2|
Thine own Son, the joy of heaven,
In Thy bosom dwells;
Grace on grace so richly given,
All Thy favour tells.
|3|
Freely rests Thy love upon Him,
Thy beloved One;
And with joy we now acclaim Him,
Jesus Christ, the Son.
|4|
Thus Thy purpose great, unchanging,
Perfected we see;
Through Thy counsel, Thine arranging,
Praise ascends to Thee.
|5|
O Thy love! Its wondrous story
Stirs our hearts to song;
Worship, honour, praise and glory
All to Thee belong!
{178}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Blest father, infinite in grace,
Source of eternal joy,
Thou lead'st our hearts to that blest place
Where rest's without alloy.
|2|
There will Thy love find perfect rest,
Where all around in bliss,
Where all in Thee supremely blest,
Thy praise their service is.
|3|
Eternal love their portion is,
Where love has found its rest;
And, filled with Thee, the constant mind
Eternally is blest.
|4|
There Christ, the centre of the throng,
Shall in His glory shine,
But not an eye those hosts among
But sees His glory Thine.
|5|
Thy counsels too in all Thine own,
Fulfilled by power divine,
Spread wide the glory of Thy throne,
Where all in glory shine.
|6|
Yet deeper, if a calmer, joy
The Father's love shall raise,
And every heart find sweet employ
In His eternal praise.
|7|
Nor is its sweetness now unknown,
Well proved in what it's done;
Our Father's love with joy we own,
Revealed in Christ the Son.
{179}
J. TAYLOR, 3RD, L.M.
|1|
O praise the Saviour for His love,
To take one to Himself above!
These blessed words our hearts suffice --
"Today -- with Me -- in paradise."
|2|
He knows His sheep, they hear His voice,
Are owned by Him, His sovereign choice.
Then praise Him, God's beloved Son,
Who has o'er death the vict'ry won!
|3|
How better far than earth's rewards!
In life or death we are the Lord's!
Despite aught Satan could contrive,
In Christ shall all be made alive.
|4|
And "Jesus wept"! such feelings shown
For one He loved and called His own!
The love of God exceeds our boast,
In Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
|5|
Yes! God will bring them: every ear
The Lord's assembling shout shall hear.
They'll rise, and we with them shall be
Caught up to dwell, O Lord, with Thee.
|6|
In purpose, called, now justified,
Conformed to Thee -- thus glorified,
And gathered round Thyself adored,
We'll be for ever with Thee, Lord!
{180}
T. PORTER, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
O Lord, how blest -- as day by day
We pass along our pilgrim way --
To know that we are Thine!
Thine, through redemption's precious blood,
Which cleansed, which brought us nigh to God
In righteousness divine.
|2|
Thine, ever Thine -- to be with Thee,
For where Thou art Thine own must be;
Love will not be alone;
Love's resting-place together shared
By Thee by those Thou hast declared
Through grace to be Thine own.
|3|
O Lord, in meek and godly fear
To follow and to serve Thee here
Do Thou our hearts incline;
To be for Thee where Thou hast been,
Until we reach Thee in that scene
Where Thou wilt own us Thine.
|4|
Lord, may we always own Thy claim,
And, overcoming in Thy Name,
From earthliness be free;
And by the daily manna fed,
Renewed in strength, the path we'd tread
Which leads us up to Thee.
{181}
E. WILLIAMS, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Glory, Lord, is Thine for ever,
Ever blest -- Thou art the Son!
Great the glory Thou art given,
And the glory Thou hast won;
Great the glory and the splendour
Of the holy, heav'nly place;
Wonderful the Godhead glory
Shining, Saviour, in Thy face!
|2|
Lord of glory, Thou didst enter
This dark world of sin and woe;
Great Thy glory that was witnessed
By Thine own while here below.
Thou didst die, and now we praise Thee
In Thy glory, Lord, above;
For in death Thou hast declared
All the fulness of God's love.
|3|
Yes, we see Thee crowned with glory,
Highest honour to Thee giv'n;
But Thy glory, all transcending,
Is the light that shines in heav'n.
Thou art greater, glorious Saviour,
Than the glory Thou hast won;
Thee -- the great "I AM" -- we worship,
Mighty God, Eternal One!
{182}
MRS. D. PALLISTER, 8.8.4.8.8.4.
|1|
We bless Thee, Holy Spirit, Thou
To whom our hearts adoring bow;
We praise Thy Name
As those whose sins are all forgiv'n,
Whose glorious Lord is Christ in heav'n,
Thy joy His fame.
|2|
We marvel at Thy lowly grace,
That Thou shouldst come to take Thy place
In us to dwell --
To undertake in all our need,
To comfort and to intercede:
All must be well!
|3|
We thank Thee for Thy faithful love,
Preparing us to dwell above
In that bright sphere.
Blest Spirit, hast Thy gracious work,
That not a spot may hidden lurk;
Let all be clear.
|4|
Let not our light be burning dim;
Cause all the saints to cry to Him,
Lord Jesus, Come!
His voice we'll hear, His face we'll see,
As, rising, changed, and still with Thee,
We reach our home.
{183}
B. ISHAM, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
O springing Well, Thou source of living joy
To Thee we sing;
With joyful hearts our tongues we now employ,
Our praises bring.
For Thou, the Comforter, in service still,
Our gladdened hearts with thoughts of Christ dost fill.
|2|
Thou speakest oft of Him, the One we love,
His glories fair;
So, that we long to be with Him above,
That glory share.
Yea, be with Him in His own resting-place,
Eternal trophies of His love and grace.
|3|
O blessed Lord, Thou fillest all that scene,
The centre Thou.
God's glory in Thy blessed face is seen;
To Thee we bow.
With yearning hearts for Thee to take us home,
We with the Spirit call for Thee to come.
{184}
MRS. J. S. PIGOTT Adapted, 8.7.8.5.
|1|
Now in simple faith, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thy blessed face;
And Thy changeless, loving favour
Gives me certain peace;
|2|
Satisfies my deepest longings,
Meets the need of every hour;
All my fears dispels for ever
By Thy wondrous power.
|3|
Lord, be Thou my comfort ever;
Saviour, I would claim Thee mine;
For Thy richest love and blessing
Give me joy divine.
|4|
Splendour of eternal glory,
Spring of peace art Thou to me;
Keep me still Thy grace enjoying
Till Thy face I see.
|5|
O how great Thy loving-kindness,
Vaster, broader than the sea!
O how marvellous the blessings
Now bestowed on me!
|6|
Who can tell the wondrous measure
Of the love upon me poured?
And my certainty of promise
Is Thyself, O Lord!
{185}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
"Thou art the Same," our one, unchanging God,
Who sittest high above the angry flood;
With Thee for refuge, and with Thee for strength,
We shall, though fierce the storm, reach home at length.
|2|
If on the road we find a vale of tears,
A scene of sorrow and disturbing fears,
'Tis joy to know the time cannot be long
Ere all is changed, and sadness turn to song.
|3|
We must give thanks, though deep the sorrow here,
For 'tis in grief that Thou dost draw so near;
Dost touch Thy people in Thine own sweet way,
And turn their night of weeping into day.
|4|
O what a God! How can we sing Thy praise?
The hymn's too great for our poor hearts to raise.
And yet we must our adoration bring;
Thy Spirit lifts us up, and makes us sing.
{186}
J. C. TOZER, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, Thy person far transcendeth
Creature mind to comprehend;
But in manhood's form Thou camest,
Theme of praise that ne'er shall end.
|2|
Here the Son, Thy Father loving,
Thou didst in His will delight;
Of His heart the Well-beloved,
O how pleasing in His sight!
|3|
One in all eternal counsels,
Thoughts divine Thou hast made known,
That there should be men made like Thee --
Those whom Thou canst call Thine own.
|4|
Thus in holy, blest communion,
Known in bonds so full and deep,
Drawn together, Lord, so near Thee
Thou our hearts in love dost keep.
|5|
And, rejoicing in such favour,
Praise to Thee we gladly bring;
By the Spirit's power sustained,
Of Thy glory now we sing.
{187}
J. G. SMALL (1817-1888), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7. IAMBIC
|1|
I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him.
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which nought can sever;
For I am His and He is mine
For ever and for ever.
|2|
I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!
He died, He bled to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me.
Nought that I have mine own I call,
I hold it for the Giver;
My heart, my strength, my life, my all
Are His, and His for ever.
|3|
I've found a Friend, O such a Friend,
So kind, and true, and tender!
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!
From Him who loves me now so well,
What power my soul shall sever?
Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?
No! I am His for ever.
{188}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.
|1|
We see Thee, Lord of glory,
Descending from above,
And learn the wondrous story
Of God come down in love.
|2|
Thus cradled in a manger,
We see Thee, Jesus, there,
A houseless, homeless Stranger,
Our sorrows all to share.
|3|
O strange yet fit beginning
Of all that life of woe,
In which Thy grace was winning
Poor man his God to know!
|4|
O love, all thought surpassing!
That Thou shouldst with us be,
Nor yet in triumph passing,
But human infancy!
|5|
We gaze upon Thy weakness --
The manger and the cross;
We love Thee for Thy meekness
Through suff'ring, pain and loss.
|6|
We see the Godhead glory
Shine through that human veil,
And, willing, hear the story
Of love that's come to heal.
{189}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, amid corruption,
Where hatred did abound,
Thy path of true perfection
Was light on all around.
|2|
In scorn, neglect reviling,
Thy patient grace stood fast,
Man's malice unavailing
To move Thy heart to haste.
|3|
O'er all, Thy perfect goodness
Rose blessedly divine;
Poor hearts opprest with sadness
Found ever rest in Thine.
|4|
The strong man in his armour
Thou mettest in Thy grace,
Didst spoil the mighty charmer
Of our unhappy race.
|5|
Disease, and death, and demon,
All fled before Thy word,
As darkness, the dominion
Of day's returning lord!
|6|
Love, that made Thee a mourner
In this sad world of woe,
Proved wretched man a scorner
Of grace that brought Thee low.
|7|
O Lord, Thy love's sweet savour
Shone forth in every deed,
And showed God's loving favour
To every soul in need.
{190}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, Thy wondrous story
Our inmost soul doth move,
And, ending in the glory,
We trace Thy path of love.
|2|
No eye was found to pity,
No heart to bear Thy woe,
But shame, and scorn, and spitting:
None cared Thy Name to know.
|3|
O day of greatest sorrow,
Day of unfathomed grief!
When Thou didst taste the horror
Of wrath without relief.
|4|
Thus, with all grief acquainted,
Blest Man of sorrows here,
Thy love, by ill untainted,
To death Thy feet did bear.
|5|
In death, obedience yielding
To God Thy Father's will,
Love still its power was wielding
To meet all human ill.
|6|
But, O divine Sojourner,
Midst man's unfathomed ill,
Love that made Thee a mourner,
It is not man's to tell!
|7|
We worship when we see Thee
In all Thy sorrowing path;
We long soon to be with Thee
Who bore for us the wrath!
|8|
Come then, expected Saviour;
Thou Man of sorrows, Come!
Almighty, blest Deliv'rer,
And take us to Thee -- home.
{191}
J. MONTGOMERY (1771-1854) Adapted, 7.7.7.7.
|1|
Father, praise to Thee we give;
In Thy favour now we live;
Joying in Thy holy love,
And the light from heav'n above.
|2|
Praise to Thee, O Lord, we bring,
Christ the Prophet, Priest and King;
Glad we raise our sweetest strain
To the Lamb that once was slain.
|3|
Praise to Thee, the Holy Ghost,
Sent from heav'n at Pentecost;
'Tis through Thee that now we live,
And our praises freely give.
|4|
Blest our portion. thus to be
Glorying, blessed God, in Thee;
Thou our voices lov'st to hear,
Sonship's songs delight Thine ear.
{192}
MISS F. J. ELWOOD, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
We love, Lord Jesus, to recall
Thyself, for Thou hast giv'n Thine all
For us on Calv'ry's tree.
To Thee in thankfulness we turn,
With souls that glow, with hearts that yearn
Thy glory, Lord, to see.
|2|
Lost in Thy love, Thy death we deem
Our point of severance from this scene
Where man Thy rights did spurn;
To us earth stands in shadow now,
'Tis but Thy grave and ours, till Thou,
Lord Jesus, shalt return.
|3|
No earth bound prospect would we know,
But stand expectant while we show
Thy death as years roll on.
Thy perfect love our strength shall be
To hold in faith and constancy
The ground that Thou hast won.
{193}
N. B. STEWART, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, we rejoice that Thou
Shouldst find in us delight;
As sanctified, Thy brethren now
Are precious in Thy sight.
|2|
Thy love all distance must remove,
And draw us near to Thee;
And by the Spirit now we prove
The love that sets us free.
|3|
Thy many brethren gladly own
The Firstborn's place is Thine;
Its rights belong to Thee alone,
And there Thy glories shine.
|4|
Thou dost our hearts as one unite
To own Thee, Lord, supreme;
Thy beauties fill our raptured sight,
Thyself our glorious theme.
{194}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 11.11.11.11.
|1|
The night is far spent, and the day is at hand;
No sign to be looked for; the Star's in the sky.
Rejoice then, ye saints, 'tis your Lord's own command;
Rejoice, for the coming of Jesus draws nigh.
|2|
How bright then that day when the Saviour appears!
How welcome to those who have shared in His cross!
A crown incorruptible then will be theirs,
A rich compensation for suff'ring and loss.
|3|
No loss in this world can compare with that day,
With glory that then will from heav'n be revealed.
The Saviour is coming, His people may say,
Our Lord whom we look for, our Sun and our Shield.
|4|
Lord, kindle within us a holy desire,
Like that which was found in Thy people of old.
Who tasted Thy love, and whose hearts were on fire,
While waiting, in patience, Thy face to behold.
{195}
MISS F. T. WIGRAM (1831-1871), L.M.
|1|
Worthy of homage and of praise,
Worthy by all to be adored,
Exhaustless theme of heav'nly lays,
Thou, Thou art worthy, Jesus, lord!
|2|
To Thee e'en now our song we raise,
Though sure the tribute mean must prove;
No mortal tongue can tell Thy ways,
So full of life, and light, and love.
|3|
Yet, Saviour, Thou shalt have full praise;
We soon shall meet Thee on the cloud;
We soon shall see Thee face to face,
In glory praising as we would.
{196}
A. H. GRIFFITHS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
It is through Thee, blest Spirit,
And in Thy power, that we
Draw nigh unto the Father
In sonship's liberty;
For we by Thee now strengthened,
And filled with holy love,
Partake of feelings suited
To sonship's place above.
|2|
Thus unto Thee, our Father,
A song e'en now ascends
Which, sung by the Beloved,
All other songs transcends.
It is in holy splendour
Thy sons in worship bow;
With deepest joy we praise Thee,
Our God, our Father Thou!
{197}
H. McMULLAN, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
We joy in Thee, blest Spirit,
Who dost sustain us here
As those who shall inherit
With Christ, in His own sphere.
|2|
The days are dark and dreary
Through which by Thee we're led;
Thy strength supports the weary
Their heav'nly way to tread.
|3|
Thus onward to the glory,
By Thee we're led through grace,
And learn the wondrous story
Of our eternal place.
|4|
There peace and joy and glory
Pervade God's rest for aye,
Where nought from Him shall sever
Through His eternal day.
{198}
S P TREGELLES, S.M.
|1|
"One Spirit," glorious Lord!
O blessed, wondrous word!
What heav'nly light, what power divine,
Doth that sweet word afford!
|2|
No longer now alone,
Thou'rt risen from the dead;
Thou dost Thy church to Thee unite,
Thyself th' ascended Head.
|3|
With deepest joy, O Lord,
We see Thee glorified,
And know that Thou dost love Thy church,
Thy body and Thy bride.
|4|
Now one with Thee above,
With Thee for ever blest,
Soon shalt Thou take us to Thy side,
Where love shall be at rest.
{199}
C. C. ELLIOTT, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus Christ, our living Head,
How bright Thy glories shine!
Unique in Thy humanity:
Eternally divine.
|2|
Thou wast before created things,
Of all the Author Thou;
Upholder of the universe,
To Thee as God we bow.
|3|
The creature mind, howe'er sublime,
Thine Essence cannot know,
Yet we, to Thee, in majesty,
With reverence bend low.
|4|
But in Thy manhood's glorious state
Our thankful hearts rejoice;
For of Thy body, Lord, are we,
Of love divine the choice.
|5|
Great source of wisdom, power and food,
All riches from Thee flow;
Thou on Thy church, Thy fulness here,
All treasure dost bestow.
|6|
So unto Thee, our glorious Head,
Our tribute now we bring;
In nearness, by the Spirit's power,
In heav'nly measures sing.
{200}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Jesus, precious Saviour,
O when wilt Thou return?
Our hearts, with woe familiar,
To Thee, our Master turn.
|2|
Our woe is Thine, Lord Jesus;
Our joy is in Thy love;
But woe and joy all lead us
To Thee in heav'n above.
|3|
To Thee we look, Lord Jesus,
To Thee whose love we know;
We wait the power that frees us
From bondage, sin and woe.
|4|
We look for Thine appearing,
Thy presence here to bless;
We greet the day that's nearing,
When all this woe shall cease.
|5|
But O for us, blest Saviour,
How brighter far the lot,
To be with Thee for ever,
Where evil enters not!
|6|
To see Thee who hast loved us,
Then face to face above,
Whose grace at first had moved us
To taste and know Thy love!
|7|
With Thee, O Lord, for ever
Our souls shall be content;
Nor act, nor thought shall ever
Full joy with Thee prevent.
|8|
Thy Father's perfect favour
Our dwelling place shall be;
And all His glory ever
Shine forth on us through Thee.
|9|
O come then soon, Lord Jesus,
In patience still we wait --
Await the power that frees us --
Our longed-for heav'nly seat.
{201}
A. P. CECIL (1841-1889), S.M.
|1|
Thou Holy one and True,
Our hearts in Thee confide,
And in the circle of Thy love
As brethren we abide.
|2|
Teach us that Name to own,
Whilst waiting, Lord, for Thee;
Unholiness and sin to shun,
From all untruth to flee.
|3|
In Thee the Father rests,
His own anointed One;
In Thee He ever finds delight,
His well-beloved Son.
|4|
In Thee we find delight,
Firstborn 'mongst brethren Thou;
To Thy blest Name, O Lord, we cling,
To Thy sure word we bow.
{202}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 11.10.11.10.9.11.
|1|
Hark! hark! the voice of Christ, the sinner's Saviour,
In glory seated on His father's throne,
Telling of love and everlasting favour
For sinners far from God, by sin undone.
Message of Jesus, message of love,
Telling of welcome to that bright home above!
|2|
Blest words! they speak to us of God's salvation,
Worked out by Christ alone upon the cross,
Who by His blood redeems from every nation,
And saves His people from eternal loss.
Message of Jesus, message of love,
Telling of welcome to that bright home above!
|3|
Soon Jesus' voice of love may cease appealing,
And, to your loss, the door of mercy close;
Spurn not the voice of Him with heart so feeling,
Who proved His love by dying for His foes.
Message of Jesus, message of love,
Telling of welcome to that bright home above!
{203}
A. O. R. LABETT, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O Lord, as now we gather to Thy Name
Here in the scene of Thy reproach and shame,
Our minds are filled with precious thoughts of Thee,
And of Thy word, This do, remember me.
|2|
We view these emblems and would Thee recall,
The One who in Thy love hast giv'n Thine all;
Such wondrous giving that we fain would be
Yielded in mind and heart, O Lord, to Thee.
|3|
O blessed Spirit, Thou who giv'st us power
To leave all else and share in this blest hour,
Thee would we praise in joyful liberty,
As we delight in Christ adoringly.
|4|
So now, O Lord, our willing voices raise
A song of love, rejoicing in Thy praise;
Our hearts exult in thankfulness to Thee,
For Thine almighty love has set us free.
{204}
T KELLY, 7.7.7.7.
|1|
Lord, accept our gladsome song;
Power and praise to Thee belong;
We would all Thy grace record,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!
|2|
Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop,
Thence is all Thy people's hope;
Thou wast poor, that we might be
Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.
|3|
When we think of love like this,
Joy and shame our hearts possess:
Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus:
Shame, for such returns from us.
|4|
Yet we hope the day to see
When, from every hindrance free,
When, to Thee in glory brought,
We shall serve Thee as we ought.
{205}
ANONYMOUS, 6.6.8.4.
|1|
O Jesus, Lamb of God,
Who, us to save from loss,
Didst taste the bitter cup of death
Upon the cross!
|2|
Most merciful High Priest,
Our Saviour, Shepherd, Friend,
'Tis in Thy faithful love we trust
Until the end.
|3|
Thou wilt our souls sustain,
Our Guide and Strength wilt be,
Until in glory, Lord, above,
Thy face we see.
{206}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Where the saints in glory thronging,
Where they feed on life's blest Tree --
There is stilled each earnest longing,
Satisfied our souls shall be.
|2|
Safety -- where no foe approaches;
Rest -- where toil shall be no more;
Joy -- whereon no grief encroaches;
Peace -- where strife shall all be o'er:
|3|
Where deceiver ne'er can enter,
Sin-soiled feet have never trod;
Free, our peaceful feet may venture
In the paradise of God.
|4|
Drink of life's perennial river,
Feed on life's perennial food,
Christ, the fruit of life and Giver --
Safe through His redeeming blood.
|5|
Object of eternal pleasure,
Perfect in Thy work divine!
Lord of glory! without measure
Worship, joy and praise are Thine.
{207}
MISS J. E. GRESSWELL, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Blest God and Father, we respond to Thee,
Thy sons, brought near with Christ, before Thy face
In perfect love and holy liberty;
No cloud to dim the glory of this place.
|2|
Our Father Thou, whom Jesus has revealed,
His Father whom He loves, His glory Thine;
He, Thine eternal joy, Himself did yield
To bring to pass Thy thoughts of love divine.
|3|
Thy heart, our God, made known -- all, all is told!
The glory of Thy love all time before,
The Spirit to our hearts doth now unfold,
And moves our souls to worship and adore.
|4|
O circle of affections all divine,
The foretaste of eternity's bright scene,
Where all the glories of Thy love shall shine
In everlasting joy, and peace serene!
{208}
A. W. G. TURNER, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
God is sending out the message
Of His wondrous love and grace,
Sends it from the highest glory,
Radiant in the Saviour's face.
O this precious light is telling
God's full favour now to man;
From the glory it is streaming --
Ne'er such news since time began!
|2|
God has full delight in Jesus,
Brightest glory He has won;
He has died, and through His dying
All God's pleasure will be done.
O what blessing in believing
In the One who came to die,
And the glorious light receiving
Of God's Son enthroned on high!
|3|
God has given all to Jesus,
All shall prosper in His hand;
Every knee shall bow to Jesus,
All obey God's own command.
Come, then, trust this peerless Saviour,
Prove the riches of His grace;
Live for ever in God's favour
As it shines in Jesus face!
{209}
MISS J. E. GRESSWELL, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O Lord, it is Thyself; none, none but Thee,
Could so call forth response from every heart;
The love that stood the test of Calv'ry's tree
Doth to our longing souls fresh joy impart.
|2|
That precious love, Lord Jesus, so well known,
Awakens songs of joy and praise to Thee.
We love Thee, Lord, Thy holy claim we own;
And, by the Spirit moved, we worship Thee.
|3|
O holy Comforter from realms above,
Strengthened by Thee, our souls would apprehend
The height and depth of Christ's surpassing love,
The love no creature mind can comprehend.
{210}
W. F. LLOYD (1791-1853), S.M.
|1|
Our times are in Thy hand;
Father we wish them there;
Our life, our souls, our all, we leave
Entirely to Thy care.
|2|
Our times are in Thy hand;
Whatever they may be,
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.
|3|
Our times are in Thy hand;
Why should we doubt or fear?
A Father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.
|4|
Our times are in Thy hand;
Jesus, once crucified,
Now leads His own with tender care,
Our Shepherd, Guard and Guide.
|5|
Our times are in Thy hand;
Christ is our Advocate!
No creature power from love divine
Our souls can separate.
|6|
Our times are in Thy hand;
We'd always trust in Thee,
Till we have left this weary land,
And all Thy glory see.
{211}
G. GUSTAFSSON from Swedish, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
God and Father, we Thy children
Would in meekness hear Thy word;
Undistracted, hearts responsive,
As Thy Spirit strikes the chord;
All Thy mind we would be learning,
As the desert path we trace;
Thine we are, and would be leaning
Ever on Thy boundless grace.
|2|
Still the Spirit is unfolding
Heights of glory Thou hast giv'n,
And our eyes by faith are seeing
Christ at Thy right hand in heav'n;
As on earth His path was trodden,
Ever subject to Thy will,
As the Man of all Thy counsels,
Who the universe will fill.
|3|
When with joy we thus behold Him,
When His greatness fills our sight,
Gladly we His rights acknowledge,
Object blest of heav'n's delight.
Then our hearts bow down before Him,
This world's glory waxeth dim;
Every hindrance then must vanish,
All be subject unto Him.
|4|
God our Father, Thee we worship,
Praise Thee evermore that Thou
Leadest us in triumph, telling
All Thy boundless love e'en now.
May we therefore still be learning,
In Thy word Thy counsels trace,
Till the day that Thou displayest
All the glory of Thy grace!
{212}
E H CHATER, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest Saviour in the glory,
Who gav'st Thyself for me,
I'm Thine, O wondrous story,
Thine to eternity!
Now pleasures for a season
No longer joy afford,
For lo! I'm all enraptured
With Christ my risen Lord.
|2|
Jesus, my Lord and Saviour,
My joy, my peace, and crown,
My soul with deepest homage
Would all Thy glory own!
And worship, honour, blessing,
Ascribe, blest Lord, to Thee --
The Man in highest glory
Who gav'st Thyself for me.
{213}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
In hope we lift our wishful, longing eyes,
Waiting to see the glorious Sun arise;
How bright, how gladsome will His advent be
When He shines forth in radiant majesty!
|2|
How will our eyes to see His face delight,
Whose love has cheered us through the darksome night!
How will our ears drink in His well-known voice,
Whose faintest whisper makes our souls rejoice!
|3|
No stain within, no foes or snares around;
No jarring notes shall there discordant sound;
All pure without, all pure within the breast;
No thorns to wound, no toil to mar our rest.
|4|
If here on earth the thoughts of Jesus' love
Lift our poor hearts this weary world above:
If even here the taste of heav'nly springs
So cheers the spirit that the pilgrim sings:--
|5|
What will the sunshine of His glory prove!
What the unmingled fulness of His love!
What hallelujahs will His presence raise!
What but one loud eternal burst of praise!
{214}
D. T. HOLDING, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
To Thee, blest Holy Spirit,
We render homage now;
Before Thy holy Person
Adoringly we bow.
|2|
For Thou hast e'er a glory
Beyond the sphere of time
And creature understanding,
In Deity sublime.
|3|
Unseen, Thou seest all things,
Great power and wisdom Thine.
God's treasured store dispensing,
Thou searchest depths divine.
|4|
The right is Thine, blest Spirit,
To act as Thou dost will,
Though human vessels using
Thy purpose to fulfil.
|5|
How worthy Thou of worship
In Godhead majesty!
We gladly bring our praises
To offer unto Thee.
{215}
E. DENNY (1796-1889), C.M.
|1|
Hope of our hearts, O Lord, art Thou,
The glorious Star of day;
Thou wilt shine forth, and chase the night
With all our tears away.
|2|
No resting place we seek on earth,
No loveliness we see;
Our eye is on the crown above,
Prepared for us by Thee.
|3|
But, blessed Lord, however bright
The crown of joy above,
What is it to the brighter hope
Of dwelling in Thy love?
|4|
There near Thy heart upon the throne,
Thy cherished bride shall see
What grace was in the suff'ring Lamb,
Who died to make us free.
{216}
R. D. EDWARDS, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.7.7.
|1|
O the love of God is boundless,
Perfect, causeless, full and free!
Doubts have vanished, fears are groundless,
Now I know that love to me.
Love, the source of all my blessing,
Love that set itself on me;
Love that gave the spotless Victim,
Love told out at Calvary.
'Tis love displayed by Jesus,
When alone at Calvary.
|2|
O the cross of Christ is wondrous!
There I learn God's heart to me;
Midst the silent deep'ning darkness,
"God is light" I also see.
Holy claims of justice finding
Full expression in that scene,
Light and love alike are telling
What yon woe and suff'rings mean.
My guilt was borne by Jesus
When in darkness on the tree.
|3|
O the sight in heav'n is glorious!
Man in righteousness is there;
Once the Victim, now victorious,
Jesus lives in glory fair!
Him, who met the claims of glory
And the need of ruined man
On the cross -- O wondrous story! --
God has set at His right hand.
How rightly crowned is Jesus,
He who once atonement made!
{217}
ANONYMOUS, 9.9.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Why unbelieving? Why wilt thou spurn
Love that so gently pleads thy return?
Come, ere thy fleeting day
Fades into night away;
Now mercy's call obey:
To Jesus come.
|2|
Why not, believing, come to the Lord?
Trust in the Saviour, doubt not His word.
Think, 'twas for Thee He died;
Think of Him crucified!
Now to the glorified,
To Jesus come.
|3|
Why unbelieving? Thou canst be blest,
Jesus will pardon, He'll give thee rest.
Why wilt thou longer wait?
Haste to the open gate;
Come, ere it be too late,
To Jesus come!
{218}
D. LINDBERG from Swedish, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
O Thou blessed Holy Spirit,
Now our praise we sing to Thee.
Heaven's joys, which Thou hast taught us,
Will abide eternally.
|2|
As we contemplate Thy glory
In Thy lowly service here,
We would bow our hearts in homage,
And Thy Deity revere.
|3|
O we wonder at Thy patience!
Precious is Thy presence here;
Spirit, Thou, of truth, who leadest
Into God's eternal sphere.
{219}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,
Come, ye laden, come to Me;
I have rest and peace to offer,
Rest, thou labouring one, for thee.
|2|
Yes, though high in heav'nly glory,
Still the Saviour calls to thee;
Faith can hear His gracious accents --
Come, ye laden, come to Me!
|3|
Life is found alone in Jesus,
Only there 'tis offered thee;
Offered without price or money,
'Tis the gift of God sent free.
|4|
Soon that voice will cease its calling;
Now it speaks, and speaks to thee;
Wilt thou heed the gracious message,
To the Lord for refuge flee?
{220}
MISS F. R. HAVERGAL (1836-1879), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
I could not do without Thee,
O Saviour of the lost,
Whose precious blood redeemed me
At such tremendous cost!
Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
Thy precious blood must be
My only hope and comfort,
My glory and my plea!
|2|
Why will you do without Him?
Is He not kind indeed?
Did He not die to save you?
Is He not all you need?
Do you not want a Saviour?
Do you not want a Friend?
One who will love you freely,
And love you to the end?
|3|
Why will you do without Him?
The word of God is true:
The world to doom is passing,
And you are passing too.
It may be no tomorrow
Shall dawn on you or me;
Why will you risk the peril
Of lost eternity?
|4|
But with Him -- O with Jesus!
Are any words so blest?
With Jesus, joy unending,
And everlasting rest!
With Jesus -- hearts now empty
Filled with His perfect love;
His perfect peace each moment,
Till perfect bliss above.
|5|
Why will you do without Him?
He calls, and calls again --
"Come unto Me!" Why linger?
O, shall He call in vain?
He wants to have you with Him;
Do you not want Him too?
You cannot do without Him,
And He wants -- even you.
{221}
S. MCCALLUM, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Jerusalem, the holy,
Whose builder is her God,
Resplendent with His glory
Her shining spreads abroad;
Descending out of heaven
To fill with Christ in grace,
In blest administration,
As bride and wife, her place!
|2|
Jerusalem, eternal!
The city of Christ's God,
Thine origin celestial,
Thou art His blest abode;
Thy beauty all adorning
For Him whose bride Thou art,
To fill with joy unfading,
With Christ, thine endless part!
|3|
O residence of glory!
God's tabernacle then,
Where He -- O wondrous story --
Doth dwell so near to men;
Where new creation's splendour
Doth hold our raptured gaze,
Kept by the Spirit's power,
And moved by Christ to praise!
|4|
The Father, source of glory --
The Son, the centre blest --
The Spirit all pervading --
The Fulness pleased, at rest!
O God supreme, we bless Thee,
And praise Thy glorious Name,
For of Thee, through Thee, for Thee
Are all things now, Amen.
{222}
S. DAVIES (1723-1761), 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
Great God of wonders! all Thy ways
Are wondrous, matchless, and divine;
But the blest triumphs of Thy grace --
Most marvellous! -- unrivalled shine.
Who is a pardoning God like Thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
|2|
Sins of such horror to forgive,
Such guilty, daring ones to spare --
This is Thy grand prerogative,
And none can in that honour share.
Pardon, O God, is only Thine;
Mercy and grace are all divine.
|3|
In wonder lost, with trembling joy
We hail the pardon of our God;
Pardon for sins of deepest dye,
A pardon traced in Jesus' blood.
To pardon thus is Thine alone;
Mercy and grace are both Thine own.
|4|
Soon shall this strange, this wondrous grace,
This perfect miracle of love,
Fill the wide earth, while sweeter praise
Sounds its own note in heav'n above.
Who is a pardoning God like Thee?
Or who has grace so rich, so free?
{223}
S. P. TREGELLES, C.M.
|1|
'Tis sweet to think of those at rest,
Who sleep in Christ the Lord,
Whose spirits now with Him are blest,
According to His word.
|2|
They once were pilgrims here with us;
Through Jesus now they sleep;
And we for them, though sorrowing thus,
As hopeless cannot weep.
|3|
We cannot linger o'er the tomb,
The resurrection day
To faith shines bright beyond its gloom,
Christ's glory to display.
|4|
How bright the resurrection morn
On all the saints will break!
The Lord Himself will then return,
His ransomed hosts to take.
|5|
Our Lord Himself we then shall see,
Whose blood for us was shed;
With Him for ever we shall be,
Made like our glorious Head.
{224}
VON DER KAMMER, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
To Thee, O Lord, we bring our note of praise,
Who barest here for us the cross of shame;
What grief Thou knewest on that day of days,
When curse and death on Thee, the Victim came!
|2|
How great Thy grace! no mind of man can grasp
The love told out in suff'ring on the tree --
Love that has gathered now within its clasp
Those once far off, but now brought home to Thee.
|3|
How wonderful that love made manifest
In Thee! its fulness told -- so that the heart,
Touched by Thy kindness, finds in Thee its rest,
And lost in Thee, adoring, knows its part.
|4|
There to our hearts Thy rich unmeasured grace,
And Thine own love in all its depths revealed,
Call forth from every mouth Thine endless praise,
And willing lips their heart-felt homage yield.
{225}
T. PORTER, S.M.
|1|
O scenes of heavenly joy!
The Father's house above;
Where cloudless peace without alloy
Fills all that home of love.
|2|
The Father's full delight
Is centred in the Son;
And countless tongues in heav'n unite
To tell what He hath done.
|3|
The Father made us meet
With saints in light to dwell;
And now we chant His praises sweet,
Whose love we know so well.
|4|
E'en now we taste the love,
And know the mighty power,
By which we'll rise to realms above
When waiting time is o'er.
|5|
There glory bright and fair
Shines with celestial beam;
For He who suffered once is there,
Its centre and its theme.
|6|
The Lamb enthroned shall there
Engage each raptured heart;
While myriad saints Christ's likeness bear,
And have with Him their part.
|7|
Praise Him again, again!
For us the cross He bore;
Now all is Yea, and all Amen,
In Him for evermore.
{226}
T. ROFE, 8.7.8.7. IAMBIC
|1|
Our God we bless Thee for Thy love
Made manifest in Jesus;
We praise Thy Name, that by His death
Thy love from bondage frees us.
|2|
The darkness and the distance gone,
No longer room for sadness;
Love's disposition now made known,
Thy saints are filled with gladness.
|3|
Thine attributes, O God, are seen
In Jesus crowned with glory,
And in our hearts Thy praises ring
As with Him now before Thee.
|4|
A people formed to show Thy praise,
From every tongue and nation,
And, in the nearness of Thy love,
In covenant relation.
|5|
Thy willing people, formed in love
From which no power shall sever,
With great delight, with holy hands,
We'd serve Thee thus for ever.
{227}
Dr ROSSIER (1835-1928), C.M.
|1|
Lord, e'en to death Thy love could go,
A death of shame and loss,
To vanquish for us every foe,
And break the strong man's force.
|2|
O what a load was Thine to bear
Alone in that dark hour!
Sin's weight in all its terror there,
God's wrath and Satan's power!
|3|
The storm that burst o'er Thy blest head
Is hushed for ever now,
And rest divine is ours instead,
Whilst glory crowns Thy brow.
|4|
Within the Father's house on high
We soon shall sing Thy praise;
But here, where Thou, O Lord, didst die,
We learn that song to raise.
{228}
UNKNOWN from French, S.M.D.
|1|
All through this desert dry
My path His footsteps trace,
And He doth all my need supply
In this sad, empty place.
Up to the father there
Doth He attract my heart --
Doth make this earth a desert drear,
And draw me quite apart.
|2|
In Christ I find repose,
Nor follow Him in vain;
My soul no loss nor sorrow knows
When He Himself's my gain.
Though long and hard the road,
Faith's eyes are on the goal;
He uses trials for my good,
And thus preserves my soul.
|3|
Thus joyful, bright and free,
I take the heav'nly road;
My soul vibrates with melody,
My song is ever -- God!
To Thee I have recourse
When sorrow fills my soul;
Thy staff and rod are my resource,
To comfort and console.
|4|
O what amazing grace
To know Thee here below!
To this great end Thy steps I trace,
And onward, upward go.
Thy face I soon shall see,
O mighty Saviour, there;
I have in Thee full victory,
And shall Thy glory share.
{229}
H. G. SPAFFORD, 11.8.11.9.
|1|
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea-billows roll,
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.
|2|
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
|3|
My sins -- O the bliss of this glorious thought --
My sins -- not in part but the whole --
Were borne on the cross, and are gone evermore.
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
|4|
O Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal.
O voice of archangel! O trumpet of God!
Blessed hope! blessed rest of my soul!
{230}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), C.M.
|1|
O Lord, when we the path retrace
Which Thou on earth hast trod,
To man Thy wondrous love and grace,
Thy faithfulness to God:--
|2|
Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
'Mid darkness only light,
Thou didst Thy Father's name confess,
And in His will delight;
|3|
Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,
Or Suff'ring, shame and loss,
Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,
Led only to the cross;
|4|
Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
Proved stronger than the grave;
Though man in hatred pierced Thy side,
Thy blood love's answer gave:--
|5|
We wonder at Thy lowly mind,
And fain would like Thee be,
And all our rest and pleasure find
In learning, Lord, of Thee.
{231}
C. C. ELLIOTT, 7.7.7.7.
|1|
Father, to Thy gracious throne
We draw nigh in all our need,
In the Name of Him alone
Who for us in heav'n doth plead.
|2|
May Thy holy Name be praised
Now on earth as 'tis in heav'n;
May Thy glory high be raised,
Unto Thee all worship giv'n.
|3|
Here on earth beset by foes,
Well beloved by Christ her Head,
May Thy church in love's repose.
Her appointed journey tread.
|4|
May the Christ dwell in our heart,
Known in love past human ken:
Joying in our heav'nly part,
Counsel deep and vast for men.
|5|
May we here our strength renew,
Mount with eagle's wings above,
Run the race with Him in view,
Faint not here, but walk in love.
{232}
C. DEAYTON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Hark to the message sounding
Out from the throne above,
Telling of grace abounding,
Telling of perfect love.
Hark to the wondrous story,
Redemption's price is paid;
Jesus is crowned with glory,
Both Lord and Christ is made.
|2|
None other name is given,
Jesus alone can save;
In love He came from heaven,
Himself a ransom gave.
In Him was grace abounding,
He paid in full the price;
O love immense, astounding,
O wondrous sacrifice!
|3|
The Spirit now bears witness
To Christ enthroned on high:
Redemption's work accomplished
By Him who came to die.
And now, in accents tender,
The Saviour speaks today;
Be wise, to Him surrender;
His gracious call obey!
{233}
T H REYNOLDS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Jesus, Lord, we've come together
In the bonds of Thine own love;
Thou hast drawn our footsteps hither,
Its deep meaning now to prove.
|2|
In such bonds the world around us --
Full of conflict, foes and strife --
Has no place, since love has bound us
In one fellowship of life.
|3|
Here together we recall Thee,
In these emblems hear Thy voice;
Never more can grief befall Thee;
Thou art risen, we rejoice.
|4|
But Thy love's unchanged that entered
Into death to make us Thine;
In that death all love was centred --
O the depths of love divine!
|5|
Thou dost make us taste the blessing,
Soon to fill a world of bliss;
And we bless Thy Name, confessing
Thine own love our portion is.
|6|
Sweet it is to sit before Thee,
Sweet to hear Thy blessed voice,
Sweet to worship and adore Thee,
While our hearts in Thee rejoice.
{234}
C. MULLER from German, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O Lord, we joy that Thou art glory-crowned,
Who by Thy death to God hast brought us nigh;
In Thee alone is our forgiveness found,
And everlasting praises rise on high.
|2|
We praise Thee, for Thou didst in death lay down
Thy precious life, an off'ring once for all;
For ever cleansed by blood, our joy and crown
We owe to Thee, and thus before Thee fall.
|3|
We bless Thee, glorious Lord; Thou risen art;
And we, set free from sin and death, rejoice
To know in Thee, in life, our endless part,
As with adoring thoughts our praise we voice.
|4|
Soon Thou art coming, Lord; we wait for Thee!
Soon all Thine own shall meet Thee in the air,
And we shall dwell with Thee eternally,
All changed, and like to Thee, Thy place to share.
{235}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
We'll praise Thee, glorious Lord,
Who died to set us free;
No earthly songs can joy afford
Like heav'nly melody.
|2|
Love that no suff'ring stayed
We'll praise -- true love divine;
Love that for us atonement made,
Love that has made us Thine.
|3|
Love in Thy lonely life
Of sorrow here below;
Thy words of grace, with mercy rife,
Make grateful praises flow.
|4|
Love, that on death's dark vale
Its sweetest odours spread,
Where sin o'er all seemed to prevail,
Redemption's glory shed.
|5|
And now we see Thee ris'n,
Who once for us hast died,
Seated above the highest heav'n:
The Father's Glorified.
|6|
Jesus, we wait for Thee,
With Thee to have our part;
What can full joy and blessing be
But being where Thou art!
|7|
Soon wilt Thou take Thy throne,
Thy foes Thy footstool made,
And bring us with Thee as Thine own,
In glory love displayed.
{236}
MISS H. K. BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 7.7.7.7.
|1|
God in mercy sent His Son
To a world by sin undone;
Jesus Christ was crucified,
'Twas for sinners Jesus died.
|2|
O the glory of the grace,
Shining in the Saviour's face!
Telling sinners from above,
"God is light" and "God is love."
|3|
Sin and death no more shall reign,
Jesus died and lives again;
In the glory's highest height
See Him, God's supreme delight!
|4|
All who in His Name believe
Everlasting life receive;
Lord of all is Jesus now,
Every knee to Him must bow.
|5|
Christ the Lord will come again,
He who suffered once will reign;
Every tongue at last will bring
Tribute to the heav'nly King.
{237}
A ANGUS, L.M.
|1|
O love divine! which had its source,
Our blessed God, in Thee alone;
When time had fully run its course,
Thy Son came forth to make it known.
|2|
Sent forth from Thee, Thy words to speak,
Anointed, to fulfil Thy will;
Thy Holy One, alone unique,
With great delight Thy heart did fill.
|3|
That fragrant life, in death's domain
Laid down, devoted to Thy will;
As Firstborn now He lives again,
With many sons Thy house to fill.
|4|
Father, we praise Thy glorious Name,
Knowing the joy that fills Thy heart,
To have us holy, without blame
In Him, our blest and endless part.
{238}
G. A. LUCAS, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God, we raise to Thee a song of praise,
As blest before Thee now in Christ Thy Son;
And, resting in Thy love, before our gaze
Thy glory shines resplendent through that One.
|2|
Who could to Thee give counsel, know Thy mind?
Or trace Thy ways, planned with unmeasured skill?
Who fathom depths of mercy, or who find
Where first began the counsel of Thy will?
|3|
Thy will -- by which we're sanctified, made meet,
Through the great sacrifice of Christ our Lord;
And sealed by Him -- the glorious Paraclete --
By whom, through Christ, Thou'rt worshipped and adored.
|4|
We worship Thee, our God, supreme, the Same,
Who dwell'st in light beyond all mortal ken:
For of Thee, through Thee, and for Thy great Name
Are all things, and the glory Thine, Amen.
{239}
A. E. MAYO, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Christ did for sins atone,
And on the cross He bled;
Forgiveness may be known,
Because His blood was shed
To free Thee from the bonds of sin,
And give Thee peace and joy within.
|2|
His face He firmly set,
And all the road He trod,
Till justice had been met
Before a holy God,
Who now is free, at such a cost,
To offer mercy to the lost.
|3|
But O, His suff'rings o'er,
He lives in glory there;
Alive to die no more,
He waits with us to share
His Father's house -- that home so bright --
Th' eternal day without a night.
{240}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Himself He could not save,
He on the cross must die,
Or mercy could not come
To ruined sinners nigh;
Yes, Jesus' precious blood must flow,
That sinners might forgiveness know.
|2|
Himself He could not save,
For justice must be done;
Our sins' full weight must fall
Upon the sinless One;
For nothing less could God accept
In payment of that fearful debt.
|3|
Himself He could not save,
For He the Surety stood
For all who now rely
Upon His precious blood;
He bore sin's penalty so dread,
When on the cross His blood was shed.
|4|
Himself He could not save,
Love's stream too deeply flowed;
In love Himself He gave,
To pay the debt we owed.
Obedience to His father's will
And love to Him did all fulfil.
|5|
And now exalted high,
A Prince and Saviour He,
That sinners might draw nigh
And drink of mercy free,
Of mercy now so richly shed,
For Jesus liveth who was dead.
{241}
W. R. MASON, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O God, Thou source of endless bliss and joy,
Thy praise and worship our full hearts employ,
As, with the Firstborn, we Thy sons now see
The glory that is Thine eternally.
|2|
Relationship sublime for creature man!
Thine own blest Spirit giv'n -- O wondrous plan
To have near Thee with Christ, who for them died,
Suited to Thine own thoughts, men glorified!
|3|
How blest Thy grand conceived economy!
Yet Thou dost dwell, in Thine own majesty,
In realms of light where foot has never trod --
The high and lofty, the eternal God!
{242}
E H CHATER, L.M.
|1|
Lord, perfect love in Thee I see,
For Thou didst give Thyself for me;
On Calv'ry, sinless, Thou hast died,
My precious Saviour crucified!
|2|
Worthy, O Lord, art Thou alone,
Who didst for souls by blood atone;
The Lamb who bore the judgement stroke,
And all the power of Satan broke.
|3|
For me, e'en me, sin's wretched slave,
Thou gav'st Thyself, blest Lord, to save,
That I might Thy bright glory share:
Such wondrous love, beyond compare!
|4|
The Prince of Life, Thou livest now,
Worthy that all to Thee should bow;
All-glorious now upon God's throne,
And worthy to be crowned alone!
|5|
And waiting, Lord, to see Thy face,
I now would magnify Thy grace;
Lay at Thy feet myself, my all,
Until I hear Thy triumph call.
|6|
O joyous hope, to share with Thee
Love's fruits on high eternally --
Thee mine, and I, Lord Jesus, Thine
Where cloudless light shall ever shine!
{243}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Father, Thou lovest! favour all divine,
A cloudless favour rests upon us here;
Thy face shines on us as it still doth shine
On Thy blest Son, whose image we shall bear.
{244}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
It is not with uncertain step
We tread our desert way;
A well-known voice has called us up
To everlasting day --
|2|
The voice of Him who here has trod
Alone the trackless way
(And marked the road which leads to God)
Where once we, lost, did stray.
|3|
He leaves us not alone to trace
Our path across the waste;
But leads us still, with living grace,
Homeward, whereto we haste.
|4|
See! open stands the heav'nly door,
Whence glory shines below,
To light the way He's gone before,
The coming bliss to show.
|5|
In patience then we tread the road --
Our faith and courage tried --
And trust the love which bears each load,
Our hearts from grief to hide.
{245}
H. BONAR (1808-1889), C.M.D.
|1|
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.
|2|
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
Behold, I freely give
The living water -- thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live.
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.
|3|
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
I am this dark world's Light;
Look unto Me: Thy morn shall rise
And all Thy day be bright.
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk
Till travelling days are done.
{246}
E. J. HEMMINGS, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
To Thee, blest Spirit, now we bring our praise;
Sent from above to serve us here below,
That we may grow in grace and heav'nly ways,
And all the depths of love divine may know.
|2|
The glories of our Lord Thou lov'st to tell
And we, responding, yield ourselves to Thee;
What wondrous grace that Thou shouldst in us dwell,
And in Thy love with us for ever be!
|3|
Thou art our Guide when all is dark around;
The truth made known, a lamp unto our feet;
Our rest, our peace, our joy through Thee is found,
Till face to face our glorious Head we meet.
|4|
We look for Him to come, the time is nigh;
The bride with earnest longing nears her home,
To be with Him, adorned for Him on high;
Her voice, with Thine united, utters, "Come!"
{247}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
And is it so, we shall be like Thy Son?
Is this the grace which He for us has won?
Father of glory! Thought beyond all thought!
In glory to His own blest likeness brought.
|2|
And yet it must be so! A perfect state
To meet Christ's perfect love -- this we await;
The Spirit's hopes, desires, in us inwrought,
Our present joy -- with living blessings fraught.
|3|
The heart is satisfied, can ask no more;
All thought of self is now for ever o'er!
Christ, its unmingled Object, fills the heart
In blest adoring love -- its endless part.
{248}
R D EDWARDS, 11.11.11.11.
|1|
How sweet is the story of God's boundless love,
That brought His blest Son from the glory above!
Who died in our stead upon Calvary's tree,
Obtaining redemption that we might be free.
|2|
How wondrous the story! the claims of the throne
Were met by the blood which for guilt did atone;
The judgement of sin has been borne by the Son,
Who glorified God in the work He has done.
|3|
How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned!
How rightly His Name above others is owned!
Yes, Jesus the Saviour, the glory-crowned Lord,
Is worthy by all to be ever adored.
|4|
How great is the gift that the Father now gives
To him who obeys and on Jesus believes!
The Spirit, who filleth the heart with God's love,
Himself the blest Earnest of glory above.
{249}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O Jesus, Lord, who loved us like to Thee?
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see
Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,
Thy saints the prize and travail of Thy soul.
|2|
Yet it must be, Thy love had not its rest
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;
That love that gives not as the world, but shares
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.
|3|
Nor we alone, Thy loved ones all, complete,
In glory round Thee there with joy shall meet;
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord:
Object supreme of all, by all adored.
{250}
E. H. CHATER, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thy will, O Lord, be done, whate'er the cost
To us, who but for Thee had still been lost;
For Thou hast set us free Thy will to do,
And Thou art set in love to bring us through.
|2|
Thy will be done! It is Thy heart's desire
For all Thine own. O may we never tire
Daily therein to find our souls' delight,
As we pursue our path through this dark night.
|3|
Thy will be done! Thy holy will, so blest;
Surely for us 'tis Thine own path of rest,
To follow Thee and bear Thy yoke in love,
Till called by Thee to yon blest realms above.
|4|
Thy will be done; we'd wholly live to Thee,
Till God shall take us home with Thee to be;
To ever dwell in love unmeasured, deep,
Whether we hear Thy call, or fall asleep.
{251}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), L.M.
|1|
Lord, we rejoice that Thou art gone
To sit upon Thy Father's throne;
Thy path of shame and suff'ring o'er,
Thy heart shall grieve and mourn no more.
|2|
With joy our wond'ring hearts retrace
Thy ways on earth of power and grace;
We sit as learners at Thy feet,
Thy words than honey far more sweet.
|3|
We gaze with wonder at Thy cross,
With all its suff'ring, shame and loss,
Where Thou for us wast crucified,
And, for our sins, a victim died.
|4|
We love to look within the tomb,
Robbed by Thy death of all its gloom;
The stone for ever rolled away:
Thy death the power of death did slay.
|5|
We joy to see Thee, Lord, arise
Triumphant through the opening skies,
And hear all heav'n united own
Thee worthy to ascend the throne.
|6|
Lord, now we wait for Thee to come,
And take us to Thy Father's home;
What everlasting joy 'twill be
To live eternally with Thee!
{252}
MRS G R COWELL, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
O blessed God, what wonder hast Thou wrought!
We worship Thee,
As in the light of Thine own matchless thought
Our part we see.
Brought nigh, so nigh, we could not nearer be
Than with Thy Christ, as one eternally.
|2|
'Twas not Thy thought the Man alone should be
But -- to Thy praise --
The mystery for ever hid in Thee
Crowns all Thy ways.
For Thou hast formed -- blest answer to His heart
The church, His like, His glorious counterpart.
|3|
No longer twain, but one with Christ her head,
His cherished bride;
His Spirit to her giv'n, His influence shed,
His wealth supplied.
Our God, 'tis in this vessel without peer
He hymns to Thee the praise Thou lov'st to hear.
|4|
'Tis here Thy Spirit, blessed God, doth rest;
Thy heart doth find
In this, th' abode of Thine own holiness --
Thy Christ enshrined --
An answer full, while ever unto Thee
Glory and homage flow eternally.
{253}
H. P. WELLS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hast thou heard God's wondrous message,
In His call of love to Thee?
Wouldst Thou turn from such entreaty,
Urged with gracious constancy?
|2|
Once, yea twice, He may have spoken,
As He waits Thy heart to win;
Waits to fill thy soul with gladness,
Free thee from thy load of sin.
|3|
Now He calls again -- O hearken!
He may never call thee more;
Wilt Thou, canst thou spurn the message,
And His patient grace ignore?
|4|
Turn thee now to Him, repenting;
Jesus as Thy Lord confess;
And, embracing Him as Saviour,
Joys untold thou shalt possess.
{254}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Lord, to our souls Thy light is ever pure,
And brings from heav'n what Thou alone canst give;
Yea, brings Thyself, the revelation sure
Of heav'n's eternal bliss: in Thee we live!
|2|
We bless Thee, Lord! Of Thee our song shall speak --
Poor and unworthy strains, yet still of Thee.
Come, fill our souls! This blessing would we seek,
To dwell in love, and God our dwelling be.
|3|
Be Thou with us! Let no distracting thought
Intrude to hide from us that heav'nly light.
Be Thou our strength! Let not what Thou hast brought
Be chased by idle nature's poor delight.
|4|
Be Thou our all! Thy love can fill the soul --
That love that soars beyond all creature thought;
In spirit bring where endless praises roll,
And fill our longing hearts till there we're brought.
{255}
S. CHAREYRE from French, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God, for ever may Thy Name be blest,
For Thou dost give us now to share Thy rest.
To head up all in One was Thy great thought,
And dwell with those in whom Thy grace has wrought.
|2|
Love flows unhindered and our hearts are free;
Fresh notes of praise arise in song to Thee;
And strains of worship that shall never end,
As fragrant incense to Thyself ascend.
|3|
Thy glory bright, Thy majesty divine,
Resplendent in the face of Jesus shine.
Before Thee bowed, with joy our souls adore,
And give Thee praise and blessing evermore.
|4|
The sovereign, changeless, living God, art Thou;
Thy radiant glory rests upon us now.
Revealed in Christ Thy wondrous plan we see,
That Thou for ever all in all shouldst be.
{256}
MISS A. NAESSETH, 6.4.6.4.
|1|
O Jesus, Lord, we long
Thy face to see,
To be for evermore
At home with Thee.
|2|
No more to grieve Thy heart
By failure sore,
But join Thee where Thou art,
The journey o'er.
|3|
O Lord, what joy will fill
Thy heart of love
To have Thine own with Thee
In heav'n above!
|4|
To loose the bands of death,
And thence set free
The bodies of Thine own,
Redeemed by Thee!
|5|
To see Thy bride at last
In Thee complete,
Of Thy soul's travail deep,
Fruition sweet!
|6|
Thy kin is she, O Lord,
And one with Thee,
To be for Thy delight
Eternally.
|7|
Rejoicing in Thy joy,
With one accord
Spirit and bride say, "Come!"
O Jesus, Lord!
{257}
T E PURDOM, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour Thou,
With joy we worship Thee;
We know Thou hast redeemed us
By dying on the tree.
|2|
We know the love that brought Thee down,
Down from that bliss on high;
To give Thyself, Thine all, for us,
On Calv'ry's cross to die.
|3|
Our Saviour Jesus -- Lord Thou art,
Eternal is Thy love;
Eternal too our songs of praise
When with Thee, Lord, above.
|4|
E'en now we praise the grace divine,
The love that shines in Thee;
The rich one Thou -- for us made poor,
By death to set us free.
|5|
O what a theme of praise art Thou,
Thy cross, Thy work, Thy word!
We ne'er shall fathom all Thy love,
Thou living blessed Lord!
{258}
L. G. MILNER, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
O Lord, Thy face was set,
Set steadfastly,
Till God's full claims should yet
Accomplished be.
Where men God's rights withheld,
Thine offering excelled:
What odours choice He smelled,
So rich in Thee!
|2|
Yet onward still to go,
On to the cross;
Drink deep that cup of woe,
Of grief and loss.
All from Thee then did flee,
And on th' accursed tree
God hid His face from thee,
Truly alone!
|3|
Blessed and glorious Man,
Thy lowly stoop
Compassed God's wondrous plan --
Redemption's scope.
All that God's holy mind
Has sought in man to find,
All that His love designed,
Secured by Thee!
{259}
M. W. BIGGS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thou art, O Lord, the centre
Of that vast world of bliss,
Where nought of sin can enter,
Where joy eternal is;
God's love that world pervadeth,
There Thou dost all things fill;
For Thou art Head, who suff'redst
God's counsels to fulfil.
|2|
All fulness of the Godhead,
Lord Jesus, dwells in Thee;
Thou rightly art exalted;
To Thee all glory be!
Above all heav'ns ascended,
Thou hast, O Lord, Thy seat;
Thou art the Head of all things,
In Thee we are complete.
|3|
Thou art our Head in glory,
In Thee our place we see;
Thy church, to Thee united,
Is ever one with Thee.
We hail Thee, Lord, ascended,
As Man now made supreme;
Thy Person and Thy glories
Shall be our endless theme.
{260}
I. FLEMING, 6.6.8.6.6.8.
|1|
God, from His throne on high,
Gave His own Son to die,
His only Son, in wondrous grace,
That sinners blest might be;
From Satan's power set free;
And dwell in love before His face.
|2|
From heav'n the Saviour came,
Jesus, His precious name,
The mighty One, of all things Lord;
Lost, sinful man to save,
To triumph o'er the grave,
And bring the wand'rer home to God.
|3|
He heals the sin-distrest;
The weary come for rest;
And old and young may learn His love.
To Him they gladly press,
He every one doth bless,
And one and all His goodness prove.
|4|
Then onward to the cross,
Through toil, and grief, and loss,
The Man of sorrows wends His way;
To sheathe the judgment sword,
The wrath He there endured,
And now is crowned in brightest day.
|5|
Come to Him, sinner, come!
Nor longer from Him roam;
Come as you are in all your sin;
Sad, guilty, helpless, lost,
Tried, troubled, tempest-tossed, --
By Christ, the door, now enter in.
{261}
S. MCCALLUM, 8.8.8.8.6.
|1|
Blest Spirit, we would sing to Thee,
Thou source of life and liberty;
Springs of refreshing we have known,
Sent here from heav'n; Thy grace we own,
O Gift unspeakable!
|2|
Thy precious service sheds abroad
Within our hearts the love of God;
Among the many led by Thee
We find our part in liberty,
Marked as the sons of God.
|3|
By Thee, through Christ we now draw near,
With Him in glory to appear;
The double portion we enjoy;
By Thee we would our lips employ,
And "Abba, Father!" cry.
{262}
G W FRASER (1830-1896), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
In deep eternal counsel,
Before the world was made,
Before its deep foundations
On nothingness were laid,
God purposed us for blessing,
And chose us in His Son,
To Him to be conformed,
When here our course was run.
|2|
And when the day of glory
Shall burst upon this scene,
Dispelling all the darkness
Which deep'ning still had been;
O then He'll come in brightness,
Whom every eye shall see,
Arrayed in power and glory,
And we shall with Him be.
|3|
For He, who left His glory
To die upon the tree,
Will soon complete the story,
And we, His saints shall be
Conformed to His image;
As known, we then shall know,
And with abiding fervour
Our ceaseless praise shall flow.
{263}
C W COOPER, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, around Thee are Thy brethren,
Of Thy death the fruit and spoil;
Now is o'er the night of weeping,
Now forgotten is Thy toil.
With delight dost Thou behold us;
Thy companions, Lord, are we,
Sanctified and of Thy kindred --
To Thyself the glory be!
|2|
Firstborn, Thou, of all creation,
Honours high to Thee belong;
Forth from death hast come triumphant,
Firstborn of a heav'nly throng.
Worthy of all adoration,
Gladly, Lord, Thy praise we sing;
To Thee, chiefest of ten thousand,
Worship, honour, now we bring.
{264}
H. J. MIDDLETON, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Blessed Spirit of adoption,
Now to Thee a note we raise:
Thou art with us in the service,
And art in us in the praise.
By Thy presence moved in spirit,
And in sonship's holy grace,
We have access to the Father,
Held through Christ in that blest place.
|2|
God our Father, Thee we worship,
Own the glory of Thy grace;
Joying in Thy sovereign purpose
That with Christ should be our place.
Abba, Father! He who knows Thee
Has Thy Name to us declared;
And Thy love for Him unchanging,
By Thy many sons is shared.
{265}
MARY SHECKLETON (1827-1883), 10.10.10.10.4.
|1|
It passeth knowledge -- wondrous love of Thine!
Lord Jesus! Saviour! yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth and everlasting strength,
Know more and more.
|2|
It passeth telling! that blest love of Thine,
Lord Jesus! Saviour! yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners far and near
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.
|3|
It passeth praises! that great love of Thine,
Lord Jesus! Saviour! yet this heart of mine
Would sing a love so rich, so full, so free,
Which brought a rebel sinner, like to me,
Nigh unto God.
|4|
O fill me, Jesus Saviour, with Thy love;
Lead, lead me to the living fount above!
Thither may I in simple faith draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.
|5|
Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face we see,
When on Thy lofty throne we sit with Thee,
Then of Thy love in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Our lips shall sing.
{266}
E. H. CHATER, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
God and Father, we adore Thee,
For the Son, Thine image bright,
In whom all Thy holy nature
Dawned on our once hopeless night.
|2|
All Thy glory shines transcendent
In the person of the Son,
Jesus Christ, Thy Well-beloved,
Who redemption's glory won.
|3|
By the Spirit we behold Him,
Object of Thy heart's deep love;
Boundless theme of adoration
In that scene of joy above.
|4|
In Thy grace Thou now hast called us
Sharers of Thy joy to be
And to know the blessed secret
Of His preciousness to Thee.
{267}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.

I am not told to labour
To put away my sin;
So foolish, weak, and helpless,
I never could begin.
But blessed truth -- I know it --
Though ruined by the fall,
Christ for my soul hath suffered,
Yes, Christ has done it all!
|2|
And if I now would seek Him --
In love He sought for me,
When far from Him I wandered
In sin and misery;
He ope'd my ears, and gave me
To listen to His call;
He sought me, and He found me,
Yes, Christ has done it all!
|3|
And now I cannot please Him
In aught I say or do,
Unless He daily help me
His glory to pursue;
Still helpless and still feeble,
On His strong arm I fall,
My strength in pressing onward --
Yes, Christ must do it all!
|4|
And when in heav'nly glory
My ransomed soul shall be,
From sin and all pollution
For ever, ever free,
My soul shall then still praise Him,
And loud His grace extol --
Thou hast Thyself redeemed me;
Yes, Thou hast done it all!
{268}
MRS. H. B. BURR, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Assembled here, O Lord,
And gathered to Thy Name,
We trace Thy path of love,
Thy worthiness acclaim --
Thou who in love couldst stoop so low;
Till Thou dost come Thy death we show.
|2|
Our hearts are moved, blest Lord,
As occupied with Thee;
We hear afresh Thy word,
This do, remember Me.
With all Thine own, as thus set free,
We gladly now respond to Thee.
{269}
W. M. BROWN, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Jesus, Lord, Thy grace has called us
From this barren world apart;
Thou with living bread dost feed us;
Thou our Lord and Teacher art.
|2|
Lord and Christ we gladly own Thee,
Every need by Thee supplied;
Good and faithful Shepherd, keep us,
By the flowing waters guide.
|3|
Subject to Thy Spirit's leading,
May our hearts respond to Thee;
In the holy shrine enquiring,
Grant us, Lord, Thy face to see.
{270}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
And shall we see Thy face,
And hear Thy heav'nly voice,
Well known to us in present grace?
Well may our hearts rejoice!
|2|
With Thee in garments white,
Lord Jesus, we shall walk;
And, spotless in that heav'nly light,
Of all Thy suff'rings talk.
|3|
Close to Thy trusted side,
In fellowship divine;
No cloud, no distance, e'er shall hide
Glories that then shall shine.
|4|
Fruit of Thy boundless love,
That gave Thyself for us;
For ever we shall with Thee prove
That Thou still lovest thus.
|5|
And we love Thee, blest Lord,
E'en now, though feeble here;
Thy sorrow and Thy cross record
What makes us know Thee near.
|6|
We wait to see Thee, Lord;
Yet now within our hearts
Thou dwell'st in love that doth afford
The joy *that* love imparts.
|7|
Yet still we wait for Thee,
To see thee as Thou art;
Be with Thee, like Thee, Lord, and free
To love with all our heart.
{271}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), C.M.
|1|
Our God is light: and though we go
Across a trackless wild,
Jesus, Thy footsteps ever show
The path for every child.
|2|
At every step afresh we prove
How surely Thou dost guide,
In faithful and forbearing love
Which never turns aside.
|3|
Thou weariest not, most gracious Lord,
Though we may weary grow;
In season, the sustaining word
Thou giv'st our hearts to know.
|4|
Death's bitter waters met our thirst,
But Thou didst make them sweet;
Then on our gladdened vision burst
God's shady, cool retreat.
|5|
The manna and the springing well
Suffice for every need;
And Eshcol's grapes the story tell
Of where Thy path doth lead.
{272}
I. WATTS (1674-1748), L.M.
|1|
When I behold the wondrous cross
On which the Lord of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
|2|
Far be the thought that I should boast,
Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I'd sacrifice them at His word.
|3|
There from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flowed mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
|4|
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an off'ring far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all!
{273}
L. H. FARRELL, 11.11.11.11.
|1|
How wondrous a Saviour is God's blessed Son!
How great and eternal the work He has done!
God's glory maintained by His death on the tree,
While mercy flows freely to you and to me.
|2|
How free is the pardon His blood has procured!
How blessed the welcome His Name has ensured
To all who confess Him their Saviour and Lord --
Now brought into favour, believing His word.
|3|
On Calvary see Him who died in our stead,
In glory behold Him exalted as Head;
God's wrath He endured on Calvary's tree,
By weakness and dying the Victor was He.
|4|
The Spirit has come from a glorified Lord,
Is given to those who obey God's own word;
Receiving this blessing, we live in God's love,
E'en now upon earth and for ever above.
{274}
MRS. A. DENT, 4.6.8.8.4.
|1|
Lord Jesus, come,
And take Thy rightful place
As Son of man, of all the theme!
Come, Lord, to reign o'er all supreme,
Lord Jesus, come!
|2|
Lord Jesus, come!
The Man of sorrows once,
The Man of patience waiting now,
The Man of joy, for ever, Thou:
Come, Saviour, come!
|3|
Lord Jesus, come,
That, lost in Thee, our souls
May bow and worship and adore,
In Thy blest presence evermore:
Lord Jesus, come!
|4|
Lord Jesus, come!
And let Thy glory shine,
That quickly these changed bodies may
Each one reflect a living ray:
Lord Jesus, come!
|5|
Lord Jesus, come!
Let every knee bow down,
And every tongue to Thee confess,
The Lord of all come forth to bless:
Lord Jesus, come!
|6|
Spirit and bride
With longing voice, say, Come!
Yea, Lord, Thy word from that bright home
Is, Surely, I will quickly come!
E'en so, Lord, come!
{275}
E. H. CHATER, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
All men have sinned and short of glory come;
The Scripture saith, None righteous, no not one!
No hope hath man, deceived and far from God,
Guilty and lost, exposed to judgment's rod.
|2|
One Mediator, Christ, 'twixt God and men,
Who on the tree once died, and rose again:
No other name but His can sinners save --
Jesus, who rose triumphant o'er the grave.
|3|
Forgiveness now is preached through Him who died,
The Lord of glory who was crucified.
All who in heart to Him repentant bow
Are brought to God, their sins are pardoned now.
|4|
From imputation free, for ever clear,
By God Himself discharged, in grace brought near:
Christ's finished work has met our every need;
Free from all condemnation, free indeed!
|5|
Sealed by the Spirit till redemption's day,
Sealed till the Bridegroom takes His bride away,
We Christ await: He will not reign alone,
But take the church, His bride, to share His throne.
|6|
Watching and waiting, Jesus soon to see,
We look with joy up there with Him to be,
Who, though unseen, is by His own adored --
Their glorious Saviour, Jesus Christ the Lord!
{276}
C. WESLEY (1707-1788) Adapted, 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
'Tis Thy heav'nly bride and Spirit
Jesus, Lord, that bid Thee come,
All the glory to inherit
And to take Thy people home.
All creation
Travails, groans, till Thou shalt come.
|2|
Yea! Amen! let all adore Thee,
High on Thine exalted throne;
Saviour, take the power and glory,
Claim the kingdoms for Thine own.
Come, Lord Jesus!
Hallelujah! Come, Lord, come!
{277}
W. R. MASON, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus Christ, to thee a song we raise,
Both heart and voice uniting in Thy praise.
Thine excellence and glory fill our sight;
To Thee be honour, majesty and might!
|2|
What love from Thee to Thine assembly flows!
What nearness sweet and full she ever knows!
Her joy complete in knowing that Thy heart
Is satisfied in Thy blest counterpart.
|3|
Bone of Thy bones, flesh of Thy flesh, the bride
Can take her place in glory at Thy side,
In love's complacency -- no distance known --
To her Thou'rt Head o'er all things, glorious One!
|4|
We joy with Thee, blest Spirit, for Thy part
In bringing us to Christ, joy of His heart;
His saints, the church, His fulness, jewel rare,
Made competent His glory bright to share.
{278}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), C.M.
|1|
Saviour, we long to follow Thee,
Do Thou our hearts prepare
To count all else, whate'er it be,
Unworthy of our care.
|2|
We are not now our own, but Thine,
The purchase of Thy blood,
And made, by grace and love divine,
The sons and heirs of God.
|3|
Thy Spirit, too, the present seal
Of all the Father's love,
Dwells in us now and doth reveal
The glorious rest above.
|4|
Thy life is now beyond the grave;
Our souls Thou hast set free;
Life, strength and grace in thee we have,
And we are one with Thee.
|5|
O teach us so Thy power to know,
As risen, Lord, with Thee,
That we may own, while here below,
Thyself our life to be.
{279}
BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX (1091-1153), C.M.
|1|
Jesus! the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills the breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see
And in Thy presence rest.
|2|
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,
O Saviour of mankind!
|3|
O hope of every contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who ask how kind Thou art,
How good to those who seek!
|4|
But what to those who find? Ah! this
Nor tongue nor pen can show;
The love of Jesus, what it is,
None but His loved ones know.
|5|
Jesus! our present joy art Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
In Thee be all our glory now,
As through eternity.
{280}
E. H. CHATER, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
God and Father, we adore Thee,
Now revealed in Christ the Son,
Joying in Thy holy presence
Through the work that He has done.
|2|
Filled with praise we bow before Thee;
Thou art evermore the Same;
With adoring hearts we bless Thee,
Magnify Thy holy Name.
|3|
Worship, honour, praise and glory,
Would we render unto Thee;
Heights unsearched and depths unfathomed
In Thy wondrous love we see.
{281}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884) Adapted, L.M.
|1|
Jesus, my Saviour! Thou art mine,
The Father's gift of love divine;
What Thou hast done, and what Thou art,
Are now the portion of my heart.
|2|
Poor, feeble, failing, as I am,
I now can glory in Thy Name;
Now cleansed by thy most precious blood,
And counted righteous by Thy God.
|3|
Thy fulness, Lord, is now for me,
All my fresh springs are hid in Thee;
In Thee I live; while I confess
I nothing am, yet all possess.
|4|
O Saviour, teach me to abide
Close sheltered at Thy trusted side,
Each hour receiving grace on grace,
Until I see Thee face to face.
{282}
E. H. CHATER, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
God gave His Son for sinners;
Christ died upon the tree;
My soul is filled with wonder
As now His grace I see!
Shout, shout aloud, ye saved ones,
And spread abroad His fame!
Praise ye the glorious Saviour,
Give honour to His Name.
|2|
Give unto Him the glory,
Who, in His wondrous love,
Brought us so great salvation
From yon high courts above.
Jesus our Lord has triumphed;
Salvation free is mine.
Let every soul adore Him,
Saved by His grace divine.
|3|
Washed in His blood most precious,
Lift up your hearts in praise
Now, all ye heirs of glory,
And to eternal days.
Shout, shout aloud, ye saved ones,
And spread abroad His fame!
Praise ye the glorious Saviour,
Give honour to His Name.
{283}
W. C. POWELL, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
As in Thy presence, Lord, our spirits free,
Thy brethren now respond with joy to Thee;
We answer to Thy call in kinship's place,
And near to Thee we know Thine own embrace.
|2|
"My brethren" -- Lord, these precious words are Thine.
What glorious thoughts now flow in light divine,
As, in this nearness, yielding Thee Thy joy,
We raise our song to Thee -- our blest employ!
|3|
We worship Thee, blest Lord; our souls would move
With joy to answer to Thy precious love.
We taste of heav'nly joys with Thee -- how blest!
Thine own heart satisfied, our hearts at rest.
{284}
E. H. CHATER, 8.8.8.8.4.4.6.
|1|
Have you not heard the joyful sound?
Glad tidings through the world resound --
Of pardon, peace, salvation free,
God's blessed way of liberty.
His word believe,
His Son receive,
Who died for such as we.
|2|
Thy footsteps haste! the day draws near
When Christless souls shall quake and fear.
Here is a refuge open wide,
Salvation now in Him who died.
His blood was shed;
Raised from the dead,
He now is glorified.
|3|
O why not then in Christ confide?
If works could save, would He have died?
Now hearken to His blessed cry,
"'Tis finished!" He is crowned on high.
To Him now look
Who judgment took,
And on His work rely.
|4|
Henceforth art thou for glory meet,
By blood made nigh, in Christ complete;
And thus to walk before His face,
Blessed in the riches of His grace;
To praise Him now
With all who bow,
A happy, heav'nly race.
{285}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
What rich eternal bursts of praise
Shall fill yon courts through endless days,
When time shall cease to be!
Round and around the notes shall swell,
As each redeemed one joins to tell
Thy love, so vast and free.
|2|
Each shall the Saviour's likeness bear,
A royal crown each brow shall wear,
And robes unsullied white.
The everlasting song shall be
To Thee, O Lamb of God, to thee,
'Mid scenes of purest light.
|3|
Our joy unhindered then with Thee,
Our eyes undimmed Thy glory see,
Whilst worthy praise we give.
As we await that cloudless day,
Our burning hearts with rapture say
He died that we might live!
{286}
R. D. EDWARDS Adapted, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
I love to sing of Jesus,
The story all so true,
To me most sweet and precious,
The old but ever new.
He came from brightest glory,
From radiant courts on high;
How matchless is the story
Of Him who came to die!
|2|
'Twas there my Saviour suffered,
And tasted death for me;
Yes, there the work He finished,
That sets me ever free --
My sins all laid upon Him,
The wrath and judgment borne,
The power of Satan broken,
In Jesus' death of scorn.
|3|
And now the Lord is risen,
His pain and travail o'er;
Seated in highest heaven
Alive, to die no more.
And by the Holy Spirit
He gives me, here below,
Rich blessings to inherit,
The love of God to know.
|4|
'Tis life and wondrous favour
To live e'en now to God
Through Him, the glorious Saviour
Who shed His precious blood;
And soon He's coming for me,
To take me home above,
Where still I'll sing the story
Of Jesus and His love.
{287}
C. WESLEY (1707-1788) Adapted, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Jesus! life-giving sound,
The joy of earth and heav'n;
No other help is found,
No other name is giv'n
In which the sons of men can boast,
Than His who seeks and saves the lost.
|2|
His Name the sinner hears
And is from guilt set free;
'Tis music in his ears,
'Tis life and victory;
His heart o'erflows with sacred joy,
And songs of praise his lips employ.
|3|
Jesus! all praise above;
We sing Thy blessed Name,
We sing Thy dying love,
Thy rising power proclaim:
But soon, to give Thee worthy praise,
Both heav'n and earth their songs shall raise.
{288}
UNKNOWN from French, L.M.
|1|
Our hearts Thou dost console, O Lord,
Thou who affordest heav'nly light;
Thy Spirit speaks to us Thy word,
And dwells with us throughout the night.
|2|
Thy voice, O Lord, is near at hand;
The Spirit gives us access free;
He helps us here to understand,
And moves our hearts with thoughts of Thee.
|3|
The memory of Thy wondrous love
Thine own still treasure here below;
While in this waste, from heav'n above
Thy glory and Thy grace we know.
|4|
Thine is the world of life, where more
By far than Eshcol's grapes is found:
Refreshment, strength, from Thy vast store
We have, despite the barren ground.
|5|
But soon the Spirit's gentle grace
In service shall completed be;
And we in light, and face to face --
Thou Holy One -- shall speak to Thee.
{289}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lamb of God, still keep us
Close to Thy pierced side;
'Tis only there in safety
And peace we can abide;
With foes and snares around us,
And lusts and fears within,
The grace that sought and found us
Alone can keep us clean.
|2|
'Tis only in Thee hiding
We feel ourselves secure;
Only in Thee abiding
The conflict can endure;
Thine arm the vict'ry gaineth
O'er every hateful foe;
Thy love our hearts sustaineth
In all their cares and woe.
|3|
Soon shall our eyes behold Thee
With rapture, face to face;
And, resting there in glory,
We'll sing Thy power and grace;
Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
The wonders of Thy love,
Shall be the endless story
Of all Thy saints above.
{290}
W. LAWRENCE, 10.7.10.7. CHORUS 11.7.11.7.
|1|
Jesus lingers still, 'tis for you He waits,
And He's waited for you long;
He waits that heav'n, with its fadeless joy,
May yet to you belong.
|2|
Come and welcome, welcome whosoever will,
'Tis the Saviour's gracious call;
He is able, willing, waiting now to save;
Simply trust Him, that is all.
|3|
Though your wayward feet have wandered far,
And you're deeply sunk in sin,
Yet in patient grace now the Saviour waits
Your weary heart to win.
|4|
Though His gracious call you have oft refused,
And He's sought your trust in vain,
Yet with love unchanged by cold neglect
He is seeking you again.
|5|
O surrender now, yield to love divine,
Jesus lingers for you still;
While in grace He says, "Come unto me,"
Let your answer be, I will!
{291}
C. WESLEY (1707-1788) Adapted, 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Lo! He comes, from heav'n descending,
Once for guilty sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train.
Hallelujah!
Jesus comes, and comes to reign.
|2|
See the Saviour, long expected,
Now in solemn pomp appear!
And His saints, by man rejected,
All His heav'nly glory share.
Hallelujah!
See the Son of God appear!
|3|
Lo! The tokens of His passion,
Though in glory, still He bears;
Cause of endless exultation
To His ransomed worshippers.
Hallelujah!
Christ, the Lamb of God, appears!
|4|
Israel's race shall then behold Him,
Full of grace and majesty;
Though they set at nought and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
They in glory
Shall their great Messiah see.
{292}
W. R. MASON, 8.6.8.6.8.8.
|1|
O God, supreme in majesty,
In wisdom, love and might,
Alone in immortality
And unapproached light,
To Thee both heart and voice we raise:
To Thee be honour, power and praise.
|2|
The whole vast scene of glory bright,
So pleasing unto Thee,
Subsists entire for Thy delight
For all eternity!
What mind sublime could this conceive!
What power divine could all achieve!
|3|
With wonder filled, sustained and blest,
We joy before Thy face;
The many sons who share Thy rest
Extol Thy glorious grace!
God all in all, we worship Thee,
Supreme, adored eternally.
{293}
C. A. COATES (1862-1945), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thy grace, O Lord, that measured once the deep
Of Calv'ry's woe, to seek and save Thy sheep,
Has touched our hearts and made them long for Thee,
Thyself our treasure and our all to be.
|2|
Thy beauties, Lord, Thy holy precious worth,
Surpassing far the deepest joys of earth,
Attract our hearts -- our joy Thy constant love,
Thyself our object in those scenes above.
|3|
Thy fulness, Lord, of light and love divine,
No thought can grasp, nor human mind define.
The whole vast scene of glory will display
That fulness in a quickly-coming day.
|4|
Thy glory, Lord, at God's right hand above,
Supreme of all in that blest scene of love,
In sonship tells our hearts their wondrous place,
In Thee accepted by the Father's grace.
|5|
When all things filled by Thee are wholly blest,
And God's deep love eternally shall rest
In that which ever speaks to Him of Thee,
Thy greatness, Lord, the universe shall see.
{294}
MISS J. WICKENS, L.M.
|1|
O Lord, how long ere we shall see
The night before Thy shining flee?
With hearts subdued we wait the dawn
Of God's eternal, tearless morn.
|2|
We hail that hour when, freed from thrall --
The bondage caused by Adam's fall --
With glorious bodies like Thine own,
We'll meet for ever round Thy throne.
|3|
Past death, past sin with all its woes,
O'erthrown for ever all our foes;
Hope lifts our hearts to that blest day,
And takes from death its sting away.
|4|
Thy servants die: O grant it, Lord,
That we, who have their teaching stored
Within our hearts, may now step forth
To fill the ranks with heav'nly worth.
|5|
Grant unto us who still remain
To walk before Thee without stain,
To serve Thy church with faithful love,
Until we too are called above.
{295}
J. KLEYLEIN from German, 7.7.7.7.7.7.
|1|
Holy Spirit, gift divine,
Praise and thanks be ever Thine.
Thou dost guide us here below;
Christ, our life, through Thee we know.
What a joy it is to be,
Blessed Spirit, here with Thee!
|2|
As to follow Thee we learn,
So Thy wisdom we discern;
Thou dost, all our journey through,
Teach us what to say and do;
To our minds the thoughts divine
Clear and plain before us shine.
|3|
Holy Spirit, Thee we bless;
Comforter Thou art to us!
Death o'ershadows all the scene,
But on Thy support we lean.
Thou dost bring the glory nigh,
Help our faith to look on high.
|4|
All that Christ in love has giv'n,
All the Father's wealth from heav'n,
Richly through Thy service flow;
Help divine through Thee we know.
Leader Thou, the desert through --
Thanks to Thee is ever due!
{296}
E. H. CHATER, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Blest Son of God, Thou holy One above,
In whom both love and light with truth combine;
Seated and crowned in yonder world of love,
In Thy blest face we see God's glory shine.
|2|
We bless Thee for the love which brought Thee down
From Godhead glory to the cross of woe!
Thou who on earth as Man didst win renown,
For Thou by death didst Satan's power lay low.
|3|
Thy cross, blest Lord! what unsearched depths of love
Are told, when God's sharp judgment-sword awoke!
And, darkness all around, from Him above
On Thee, O Saviour, fell the dreadful stroke!
|4|
"'Tis finished!" See the Father glorified,
Whose glory claimed Thee from the gloomy grave!
Exalted we behold Thee at His side,
The crowned Victor, mighty now to save.
|5|
Through grace our hearts are bowed before Thee now,
We gladly honour Thee with one accord;
But soon before Thee every knee shall bow,
And tongue confess Thee, Jesus Christ, as Lord.
{297}
D. G. SAMUELS, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
Blest Father, by Thy Son, and Spirit's power,
We praise Thy Name,
As we rejoice in this all-glorious hour,
And Thee acclaim.
In heav'n we soon shall dwell; 'tis now our place
In Christ, that glorious Man, before Thy face.
|2|
We praise Thee, Jesus, Lord, enthroned above,
Thou who hast died.
God's glorious Son, Thou hast through suffering love
Secured Thy bride.
Now in assembly praise Thou'rt glorified,
And Thine own heart of love is satisfied.
|3|
O Holy Spirit, Thee we worship now,
Thou who didst move
As God Himself, to cause our hearts to bow,
In sovereign love;
And moved afresh by Thee in heart and soul,
We own Thy power and Thee as God extol.
|4|
Thou in Thyself, O God, art all supreme,
All else above:
But the unfoldings of Thy heav'nly scheme
Reveal Thy love!
Blest, holy Trinity -- what light divine
In Father, Son, and Holy Spirit shine!
{298}
M. W. BIGGS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, we treasure with affection
All Thy path of sorrow here,
And those closing scenes of anguish
To our hearts Thyself endear.
|2|
Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus,
Deeper far than thought can reach;
Grief intense and suff'rings holy,
Far beyond all tongues to teach.
|3|
None could follow there, blest Saviour,
When Thou didst for sins atone;
For those suff'rings, deep, unfathomed,
Were, Lord Jesus, Thine alone!
|4|
Thou didst measure then sin's distance,
Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine;
Man-betrayed, by God forsaken;
Thus we learn Thy love divine!
{299}
MRS. M. CARLSSON-CARREN from Swedish, L.M.
|1|
What will it be with God to dwell,
And there to gaze on Jesus' face!
To meet the One we've known so well
As Priest and Saviour -- in that place!
|2|
Before Christ's judgment seat to stand,
With Him look back on all the way;
To learn the meaning, at His hand,
Of every deed in every day!
|3|
Clearer than ever shall we see
The grace which God our Saviour showed,
The love that led so faithfully
Along the pathless desert road.
|4|
What blessedness when time is o'er,
To find that love had all-sufficed,
As there upon the heav'nly shore
We reach the day of Jesus Christ!
{300}
MISS H. M. RAIKES, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Spirit of God, to Thee we bow in praise,
For Thou art God, the ever holy One:
One with the Father and the Son, Thy ways
Are merged with Theirs in all that has been done.
|2|
Thou didst Thyself, in feelings all sublime,
To hover o'er the scene of waste come down,
Before God made the vast expanse in time,
To work out all His great designs in man.
|3|
And when at length the Son on earth did stand,
Swift Thy descent in love to mark Him out;
Thenceforth to be the power of His hand,
E'en to the off'ring of Himself to God.
|4|
And now in lowlier stoop and tireless love,
Thou from th' ascended Christ to us hast come,
To open to our view the things above,
And guide and lead a heav'nly people home.
{301}
A. C. S. PRICE, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, Thy matchless glory
Has stirred in every heart
A longing now to yield Thee
Thine own most treasured part.
|2|
And thus the answering praises
Of myriads sanctified
All merge in perfect oneness,
Responding as Thy bride.
|3|
This joy Thou long hast waited,
But now with raptured gaze
Thy bride adoring greets Thee,
Her lips employed in praise.
|4|
All fair art Thou, Lord Jesus,
Th' assembly too all fair;
Embraced in sweet seclusion,
And wholly restful there.
|5|
O wondrous is God's purpose!
As Man Thou hast a bride,
One with Thee now in glory,
And Thou art satisfied.
|6|
And Lord, as thus made ready --
The Spirit giving power --
We answer gladly to Thee,
In this most blessed hour.
{302}
MISS C. THOMPSON (1822-1909), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Gazing on thee, Lord, in glory,
While our hearts in worship bow,
There we read the wondrous story
Of the cross, its shame and woe.
|2|
Every mark of dark dishonour
Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow,
All the depths of Thy heart's sorrow
Told in answ'ring glory now.
|3|
On that cross alone, forsaken,
Where no pitying eye was found;
Now to God's right hand exalted,
With Thy praise the heav'ns resound.
|4|
Did Thy God e'en then forsake Thee,
Hide His face from Thy deep need!
In Thy face, once marred and smitten,
All His glory now we read.
|5|
Gazing on it we adore Thee,
Blessed, precious, holy Lord!
Thou, the Lamb, art ever worthy!
This be earth's and heav'n's accord.
{303}
G. C. PEARSE, 8.7.8.7.4.4.7. IAMBIC
|1|
Lord Jesus, 'tis our deepest joy
To contemplate Thy glory:
Who dwelt in light supremely bright,
But stooped to tell the story
Of love divine,
That e'er shall shine
In hearts which now adore Thee.
|2|
Equality in Godhead Thine,
Thou wouldst no reputation;
But take in grace a servant's place,
In lowly incarnation.
O wondrous sight,
God's great delight,
Blest theme of adoration!
|3|
To Calv'ry's death Thy blessed feet
Moved in humiliation;
Thy Father's will Thou wouldst fulfil,
Thy joy His revelation.
Endured the cross,
Sustained all loss,
God's love in declaration.
|4|
O Lord, we raise our song of praise,
Thy Name with joy confessing;
We wait the day when Thy blest sway
Shall fill the earth with blessing;
When all shall own
Thine is the throne,
Thy glory thus expressing.
{304}
J. STENNETT (1663-1713) Adapted, C.M.
|1|
O blessed Saviour, is Thy love
So great, so full, so free?
Fain would we have our souls, our hearts,
Our minds engaged with Thee.
|2|
We love Thee for the glorious worth
Which in Thyself we see;
We love Thee for that shameful cross,
Endured so patiently.
|3|
No greater love can man display
Than for His friends to die;
Thus faithful to Thine own wast Thou:
What love with Thine can vie?
|4|
Thou like Thy brethren wouldst become,
And here a Suff'rer be;
In flesh and blood Thou didst partake,
Through death to set us free.
|5|
As man, O Lord, it was not good
That Thou alone shouldst be;
Fruit of Thy death, Thou hast secured
Companions meet for Thee.
|6|
O Lord, we treasure in our souls
The memory of Thy love;
And ever shall Thy Name to us
A grateful odour prove.
{305}
J. JAY, 8.7.8.7.7.7.
|1|
God our Father, we Thy children
Seek Thy help this favoured hour;
Cover us with Thy protection;
Manifest Thy mighty power.
God and Father, bless us now,
As before Thy throne we bow.
|2|
Here we meet and wait before thee,
Drawn together through Thy grace;
Every interest precious to Thee
Finding in our hearts a place.
God our Father, bless us now,
As before Thy face we bow.
{306}
ADAPTED, L.M.
|1|
Blest Spirit, Thou art ever One
With both the Father and the Son;
In realms of uncreated light,
Co-equal Thou in glory bright.
|2|
Thou hadst Thy place in counsel there,
Didst all God's purpose fully share;
And in that holy, sovereign will
Thine own blest part Thou dost fulfil.
|3|
O glorious, blest economy --
The Father and the Son and Thee --
Profound and wondrous mystery!
Glory to God for ever be!
{307}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), S.M.
|1|
O what a debt we owe
To Him who shed His blood,
And cleansed our souls, and gave us power
To stand before His God!
|2|
Saviour and Lord, we own
The riches of Thy grace;
For we can call Thy God, our God,
Can bow before His face.
|3|
Thy Father, too, above,
We worship as our own,
Who gave with Thee the Spirit's cry
To us, His sons foreknown.
{308}
J. SWAIN (1761-1796), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
On earth the song begins,
In heav'n more sweet and loud:
To Him who cleansed our sins
By His atoning blood,
To Him, we sing in joyful strain,
Be honour, power and praise, Amen.
|2|
Alone He bore the cross,
Alone its grief sustained;
His was the shame and loss,
And He the vict'ry gained;
The mighty work was all His own,
Though we shall share His glorious throne.
{309}
W. M. BROWN, C.M.
|1|
O God, Thy glory shines supreme;
How perfect is Thy love!
Transcending e'en our highest thoughts,
Our praises far above!
|2|
Thou spakest, and creation rose --
Eternal Godhead Thine!
Great source of life, Thy wondrous works
Express Thy power divine.
|3|
Thy ways, how just and wise and true,
Though ever past our ken!
We bless Thee for Thy matchless grace
That found delight in men.
|4|
More blessed still, Thy heart made known
In Him who came to die,
In Jesus Christ Thy Son, who lives
For ever now on high.
|5|
Thy counsels planned in ages past
In Him are now complete;
Before Thy face with Him we stand,
For glory ever meet.
|6|
Father, to Thee all glory be,
All honour, power and praise!
With hearts at rest in Thine own love,
Our song to Thee we raise.
{310}
H. F. NUNNERLEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God and Father, we would now proclaim
With sacred joy the wonders of Thy Name;
Thy perfect love our inmost fear has stilled,
And every heart with peace divine has filled.
|2|
The glorious worth of Thine own Son we bring,
And His renown with adoration sing --
Jesus the Christ, who stooped in grace so low,
That we Thy love in all its wealth might know.
|3|
Father, our hearts are filled, and Thee we praise --
Thou sovereign fount of joy through endless days!
Now brought to Thee and by Thy Spirit led,
We worship Thee through Christ, our blessed Head.
{311}
O. L. BARNES, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Though deep, O Lord, our sorrow
When earthly ties are rent,
We wait the glorious morrow
When earth's last day is spent;
To see Thee, Lord, in glory
With all Thy loved ones there,
At home - O wondrous story!
God's endless rest to share.
|2|
There we shall see the answer
To all Thy grief and shame;
For ever then in nearness
We'll magnify Thy Name.
But now Thy love sustains us,
Sore though the hour of grief;
What solace, O Lord Jesus
In Thee to find relief!
|3|
As resting in Thy will, Lord,
We prove Thy wondrous love;
The Spirit's power and comfort
Lift our poor hearts above,
Beyond earth's mortal dwelling,
To yonder glory bright,
Where endless anthems swelling
Shall soon our hearts delight.
{312}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
How great, O God, our portion in Thy love,
And with Thy Christ in Thine own realms above,
Before Thyself -- our God -- in perfect rest,
In Thine eternal presence ever blest!
|2|
O wondrous thought of Thine, that we should be
At home, O God, in all that suiteth Thee!
Where all is of and for Thyself alone,
And finds its glorious centre in Thy Son.
|3|
And to Thy love, O God, we answer now,
As in assembly we before Thee bow;
And worship Thee, the Father, through Thy Son,
With all Thy saints and, by the Spirit, one.
|4|
'Tis by Thy gift, our Father, we are His,
That we may be with Him and where He is,
In whom Thou dost Thy precious thoughts unfold,
As in Himself Thy glory we behold.
|5|
Beholding it, we worship and adore!
The more we learn Thy love, we love the more!
"Thou art that God," adoring hearts exclaim,
And glory, glory, glory in Thy Name.
{313}
MISS S. M. WALKER (1816-1878), 8.8.4.8.8.4.
|1|
O wondrous Saviour! Jesus, Lord,
Worthy art Thou to be adored!
We worship now.
So perfect in Thy matchless grace,
So spotless, pure in all Thy ways!
To Thee we bow.
|2|
In Thee all human graces blend,
And to Thy Father did ascend
As incense rare;
Fragrant to Him Thou ever art,
Source of rejoicing to His heart,
Most sweet and fair.
|3|
Fairer than all the sons of men,
Beyond all praise of tongue or pen,
Thou peerless One!
Our hearts well forth in praise to Thee,
Our object through eternity,
God's glorious Son.
{314}
MRS. S. HEDMAN from Swedish, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O God and Father, we our praises bring,
For who more worthy of our praise could be
Than Thou, who seekest worshippers who sing
In spirit and in truth adoringly!
|2|
All worlds Thou hast created by the Son,
All things are held by His unmeasured power;
Yet we approach Thee in that glorious One:
What cause for worship in this holy hour!
|3|
'Tis He who leads us in this blessed sphere,
And sings in the assembly unto Thee;
What joy to Him that we should thus be near
As suited and in perfect liberty!
|4|
Here we unite, our song of joy is one!
And Thou, O God, art fully satisfied.
Amidst the praises led by Christ, Thy Son,
Thou hast a dwelling ever to abide.
{315}
BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thy head once full of bruises,
So full of pain and scorn,
'Mid other sore abuses
Mocked with a crown of thorn --
Thy head, once bowed and wounded
On the accursed tree,
Is now, O Lord, surrounded
With highest majesty.
|2|
Thy countenance transcendent --
O life-creating Sun
To worlds on Thee dependant!-
Was bruised and spit upon.
O Lord, what Thee tormented
Was our sins heavy load;
We had the debt augmented
Which Thou didst pay in blood.
|3|
We give Thee thanks unfeigned,
O Saviour, Friend in need!
For what Thy soul sustained
When Thou for us didst bleed.
Grant us to lean unshaken
Upon Thy faithfulness,
Until, to glory taken,
We see Thee face to face.
{316}
MRS C. M. HANDS, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O God, with joy Thy thoughts of love we trace
To Thine own purpose ere the world began,
That the assembly should, before Thy face,
United be to Christ, the heavn'ly Man.
|2|
Spirit of God, Thy heart is satisfied;
Thy patient work complete, Thou hast Thy yield
Of joy to see the Bridegroom and the bride --
The myst'ry of the ages -- now revealed.
|3|
As led by Christ, her glorious, living Head,
Praise in the church ascends, O God, to Thee;
And like a precious stone her light is shed.
Glory to Thee, in Him, shall ever be!
{317}
E. DENNY (1796-1889), C.M.
|1|
O Lord, the bright and blessed hope,
That's cheered us through the past,
Of full eternal rest with Thee,
Will be fulfilled at last.
|2|
Undazzled by the glorious light
Which shines upon Thy face,
We'll see Thee then without a cloud --
Brought there through boundless grace.
|3|
Praise, endless praise, alone becomes
That bright and blessed place,
Where every eye beholds unveiled
The riches of Thy grace.
|4|
Past conflict then: O Lord 'tis ours
Through everlasting days
To sing our song of vict'ry there,
And only live to praise.
{318}
F. H. PARROT from French, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
For us, O Lord, Thou camest from on high,
And from the manger to the cross didst go;
Through suff'ring Thou didst win the victory,
And on the tree Thou barest all our woe.
|2|
Unfathomed anguish, and distress untold,
From Thy heart's object turned Thee not away;
Grief, e'en to death, upon Thy spirit rolled:
Thou chosest still, blest Saviour, to obey.
|3|
Thy life laid down, our sorrows Thou didst bear,
A priceless off'ring all our thoughts above!
Thou gav'st Thyself in grace beyond compare,
Reserving nothing save the right to love.
|4|
But joy now reigns, Thy suff'rings all are o'er;
Lord, Thou art ris'n, enthroned in glory bright;
And Thy redeemed ones know for evermore
Thy peace and love, unchanging, infinite!
|5|
Unquenched by death, eternal, still the same,
Living and ever precious is Thy love!
Soon Thou shalt come Thy ransomed saints to claim,
To be with Thee for evermore above.
{319}
MISS E. MASON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Father, Thy sons before Thee
Discern with hallowed sight
Those holy, deep affections,
Expressing Thy delight
In Him, Thy Well-beloved,
Fulness of all Thou art,
Who, by His wondrous dying,
Revealed, O God, Thy heart.
{320}
R. D. EDWARDS, 11.11.11.11.
|1|
O come to the Saviour, He's calling today;
How long wilt thou linger? His voice now obey.
He's speaking from heaven in love to thy soul;
His blood He has given; wilt thou be made whole?
|2|
The Father is calling; His language is, Come!
His rich grace is bringing the wanderers home;
His heart is delighting the lost ones to bless;
His love is inviting the weary to rest.
|3|
No need now to labour, the work has been done;
To be in God's favour, believe on the Son!
Christ's death has secured salvation so free;
The cross He endured for you and for me.
|4|
The Saviour is coming for all who believe,
From heaven descending His own to receive.
O sinner, confess Him, the throne-seated Lord;
And thou shalt be with Him where He is adored.
{321}
H. P. WELLS, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Wilt Thou yield to love's entreaty?
Canst Thou turn away
From the God who marks Thy goings
Every day?
|2|
Dost Thou feel that Thou hast wandered,
And ignored His love?
Listen to the wondrous message
From above.
|3|
From sin's burden He would free Thee,
Satisfy Thy heart;
And with love's embrace receive thee,
As thou art.
|4|
No reproach, no condemnation,
Does He hold for Thee;
Grace has met the claims of justice
Righteously.
|5|
When thy journey all is over,
Thou with Christ above
Shalt for ever be a trophy
Of His love.
{322}
E. CARREN from Swedish, L.M.
|1|
"Behold the Man!" O blessed Lord,
These words evoke an answering chord;
We see Thee on the path below,
That led the way to Calv'ry's woe.
|2|
A King, despite a crown of thorn!
Man's violent hatred meekly borne;
Despised, O Lord, and left alone,
Thou, the rejected Corner-stone!
|3|
Betrayed, denied, forsaken there,
The guilt of many Thou didst bear;
Didst for transgressors intercede,
Blest answer to the sinner's need!
|4|
O holy Saviour, Thou didst die,
And for us in the grave didst lie!
But now in triumph Thou art gone
To sit upon the Father's throne.
|5|
O Lord, eternally to praise
Our voices now we gladly raise;
In one loud anthem we combine
To celebrate such love as Thine!
{323}
F. WOMPRA, C.M.
|1|
Blest Comforter, Thou holy One,
Abiding with us here,
Sent by the Father in His love:
This thought our souls doth cheer.
|2|
With us and in us, for we love
The Son, the glorious One,
Who asked that Thou shouldst with us be
When He Himself had gone.
|3|
He is the Way, the Truth, the Life;
Spirit of truth art Thou.
How precious then our portion here
To know Thy guidance now!
|4|
To know Thee, too, in presence near,
That we sustained might be
In this dark world that knows Thee not,
For Thee it cannot see.
|5|
We now would seek that present help
Thou wouldst to us afford;
For Thou art here, thyself so great,
To glorify our Lord.
{324}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909) Adapted, 8.8.8.8.
|1|
We speak of the grace of our God,
So boundless, so rich, and so free;
But what will it profit Thy soul
Unless 'tis relied on by thee?
|2|
We speak of salvation and love,
By the Father in Jesus made known;
But, if thou wouldst live unto God,
By faith thou must make it thine own.
|3|
We speak of the Saviour's great Name,
By which God can sinners receive;
Yet still art thou lost and undone
Unless in that Name thou'lt believe.
|4|
We speak of the blood of the lamb,
Which frees from pollution and sin;
But its virtues by thee must be proved,
Or thou wilt be ever unclean.
|5|
We speak of the glory to come,
Of the heavens so bright and so fair;
But, unless thou'lt in Jesus believe,
Thou wilt not, thou canst not be there.
{325}
H F NUNNERLEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O glorious Lord! what thoughts Thy mind did fill,
When from Thy God Thou cam'st to do His will!
How deep, indeed, the joy that filled Thy heart --
That myriad sons with Thee should find their part!
|2|
Thy brethren, Lord, Thine own and one with Thee,
Fruit of Thy death, exult Thy joy to be;
In sonship's place and glory ever blest,
With Thee before Thy God in His own rest.
|3|
O blessed Lord, what treasured thoughts unfold
In light divine, as we Thy face behold!
Now on our view unbounded glories break,
That speak Thy fame and songs eternal wake.
{326}
J. WATSON, C.M.
|1|
Lord, it has touched our hearts that Thou
Shouldst now for us provide
A rich occasion, Thee to know,
Where Thou hast been denied.
|2|
Thy grace, O Lord, has furnished now
A blessed, calm retreat;
Thy saints assembled gladly bow,
And here Thyself would greet.
|3|
Acknowledging Thy love's own claim,
The Spirit giving power,
As gathered to Thy precious Name,
We bless Thee for this hour.
|4|
The love that gave Thyself for us
Forgotten cannot be;
Its fresh appeal -- a joy to those
Who now remember Thee.
{327}
C. T. LAMBERT, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Our joyful hallelujahs
To Thee, O God, we raise!
We antedate the chorus
Of universal praise.
We own Thy glorious greatness,
For Thou art Head o'er all;
In holy adoration
Before Thee now we fall.
|2|
Thou art the God of glory,
Thy dwelling purest light;
We praise Thee in Thy splendour,
Thy majesty and might!
To Thee be glory ever,
For all things are of Thee,
Through Thee, O God, and for Thee,
To all eternity.
{328}
C. WESLEY (1707-1788), 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
Our hearts delight in Christ, and long
Their glorious matter to declare.
Of Thee we make our loftier song,
We cannot from Thy praise forbear.
Our ready tongues make haste to sing
The glories of the heav'nly King.
|2|
Fairer than all the earth-born race,
Perfect in comliness Thou art;
Replenished are Thy lips with grace,
And full of love Thy tender heart.
God ever blest! we bow the knee,
And own all fulness dwells in Thee.
|3|
Be Thou the object bright and fair
To fill and satisfy the heart;
Our hope to meet thee in the air,
And nevermore from Thee to part;
So may we undistracted be
To follow, serve, and wait for Thee.
{329}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), C.M.
|1|
Well may we sing, with triumph sing,
The great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of the living God,
Revealed in Jesus' face!
|2|
The love of God it was that sought
From sin to set us free;
That gave the Son, whose precious blood
Has wrought our liberty.
|3|
In Him we read the Father's love,
And find eternal peace;
We meet in Him a Saviour God,
And fear and terror cease.
|4|
Then gladly sing and sound abroad
The great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of the living God,
The riches of His grace!
{330}
MISS E. MASON, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, Thine own love and glory
In the hearts of sons are found;
Through the gracious Spirit's guiding,
Holy joy and truth abound.
|2|
All the greatness of Thy purpose,
And perfection of Thy ways,
Will secure a vast creation,
Satisfied -- through endless days.
|3|
Now Thy love, O God is radiant,
And communion is enjoyed;
Here adoring worship floweth --
Love and peace rest unalloyed.
{331}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 8.6.8.4.
|1|
'Twas not for our great love to Thee
That Thou didst send Thy Son;
That spring of love, O God, we see
In Thee alone.
|2|
What love, Lord Jesus, brought Thee down
Our hardened hearts to win,
To be despised and spit upon,
And bear our sin!
|3|
The sins of many Thou didst bear,
Of all who look to Thee,
When God, Thy God, forsook Thee there,
On Calv'ry's tree.
|4|
"'Tis finished!" loud triumphant cry
Ere Thou didst yield Thy breath!
The veil was rent, and God draws nigh
To us, through death.
|5|
That glorious resurrection morn
Bids doubts for ever cease;
For far and wide the news is borne
Of perfect peace.
|6|
Yes. peace! since every claim is met,
Lord Jesus, by Thy blood,
And Thou, our peace, art ris'n, and set
On high by God.
|7|
Thy grace, O Lord, alone revealed
That wondrous heart of Thine;
We thank Thee, and ourselves we yield
To love divine.
{332}
A. MCGRATH, C.M.
|1|
Amidst all tribulations sore
We know the power of God,
And in our hearts, blest Spirit, Thou
His love hast shed abroad.
|2|
Thou art our blessed Comforter,
From with the Father come --
Art with us now and e'er wilt be,
O blessed Holy One!
|3|
What sweet communion! Yes, 'tis ours
Thy presence here to know,
To fill our hearts with Christ above,
His glories bright to show.
|4|
If in Christ's name we are reproached,
And Satan's power molests,
Spirit of glory and of God --
Thy power upon us rests.
|5|
Soon shall that day of gladness dawn,
And we our Saviour meet;
Thy present work and service o'er,
Thou blessed Paraclete!
{333}
H. BONAR (1808-1889), S.M.
|1|
We hear the words of love,
We gaze upon the blood,
We see the mighty Sacrifice,
And we have peace with God.
|2|
'Tis everlasting peace,
Sure as Jehovah's Name;
'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
For evermore the same.
|3|
Our love is oft-times low,
Our joy still ebbs and flows;
But peace with Him remains the same;
No change Jehovah knows.
|4|
We change -- He changes not,
Though changing years roll by;
His love, not ours, the resting-place,
We on His truth rely.
|5|
The cross still stands unchanged,
Though heav'n is now His home;
The mighty stone is rolled away,
For He has left the tomb.
|6|
We know He liveth now
At God's right hand above;
We know the throne on which He sits,
We know His truth and love.
{334}
E. H. CHATER, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
In light unclouded dwells the mighty God,
His glory all creation doth proclaim;
A Spirit -- love and light, the Holy One --
Who is, who was, who is to come, the Same!
|2|
The only glorious, the eternal God,
Who ever lived before beginnings were!
All heaven's constellations pale before
The glory of the One who set them there!
|3|
The Triune God, almighty, yet unseen;
The ever holy, holy, holy One
Whose word existence to creation gave,
When dwelling in eternity alone!
|4|
What joy it is to contemplate Thyself
In Christ revealed, the everlasting God!
To learn Thy wisdom, search Thy matchless grace;
To worship Thee, as saints redeemed by blood!
|5|
To see Thy glory in the face of Christ,
And without let enjoy -- in heav'n above,
In realms of cloudless light and joy and peace --
Thine own unending, changeless, perfect love!
{335}
E. H. CHATER, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, Thy ways are past our searching,
Infinite Thy holy mind!
Thou dost break earth's links asunder,
To Thyself our souls dost bind.
|2|
By the cords of love Thou drawest
Each blest object of Thy grace;
Thou wilt daily keep us near Thee,
Till in heav'n we see Thy face.
|3|
Many foes surround our footsteps;
None shall mar our joy in Thee!
Soon will change earth's toil and sorrow
For a bright eternity.
|4|
We would trust Thee without seeing,
Knowing that Thy way is best;
Dark or bright, in Thee confiding,
Shall our hearts find peace and rest.
{336}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, L.M.
|1|
Blest God and Father, source of joy
For all Thine own in sonship's place,
Our songs of praise arise to Thee --
We worship now before Thy face.
|2|
Thy Spirit doth our hearts sustain,
As we through Christ are near to Thee;
Thy holy love fills every heart,
And in Thy presence blest are we.
|3|
Thou in Thy wondrous love hast planned
That we with Christ should have our part,
And share that home of glory bright
With Him who fills with joy Thy heart.
|4|
O blessed home, where Thou dost dwell
In holy love and glory bright!
Near Thee, Thy love rests on us now,
And we in Christ are Thy delight.
|5|
Blest in Thy presence -- glorious place --
With joy we hymn Thyself on high.
O God of love, our song we raise,
And "Father" by the Spirit cry.
{337}
E. C. BURR, C.M.
|1|
Blest Holy Spirit, Comforter --
Though here in mystery --
Thy lowly service does not hide
Thy place in Deity:
|2|
Thy Person all inscrutable --
Yet pleased with us to be --
Thy presence infinitely blest!
As God we worship Thee.
{338}
G. GUSTAFSSON from Swedish, C.M.
|1|
The Lord is coming; lift your heads!
Ye ransomed saints, rejoice!
Soon shall we meet Him in the air,
And answer to His voice.
|2|
The Lord is coming; faith gives place
To actuality,
This mortal swallowed up by life
In immortality.
|3|
The Lord is coming; what delight
Our hearts anticipate!
The glory of that blessed sight
We eagerly await.
|4|
Yea, Lord, Thou comest -- hope how blest!
Thy call we soon shall hear;
And then in glory shall Thy bride
With Thee, the King, appear.
{339}
G. GUSTAFSSON from Swedish, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
Lord, in Thy supper now we see
The tokens of Thy matchless love!
Not death itself could stronger be
Than those affections Thou didst prove.
Thy peace, Thy joy Thou bringest here
Our souls to bless, our hearts to cheer.
|2|
The bread and cup before us now
Are witness to a work complete,
Through darkness dread, O Lord, when Thou
The awful power of death didst meet!
We praise Thee, Lord, as now come nigh,
Thee -- whom we soon shall praise on high!
{340}
F. WHITFIELD (1827-1904), C.M.
|1|
There is a Name we love to hear,
We love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in our ear,
The sweetest Name on earth.
|2|
It tells us of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set us free;
It tells us of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.
|3|
Jesus! the Name we love so well,
The Name we love to hear;
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear.
|4|
This Name shall shed its fragrance still
Along life's thorny road,
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill
That leads us up to God.
|5|
And there the whole triumphant throng
Of blood-bought saints on high
Shall sing the new eternal song,
With Jesus ever nigh.
{341}
W. YERBURY, 7.7.8.7.7.7.8.7.
|1|
Thy Name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells God's love unbounded
To ruined man, ere time began,
Or heav'n and earth were founded.
Thine is a love eternal,
That found in us its pleasure,
That brought Thee low to bear our woe,
And make us Thine own treasure.
|2|
Thy Name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells Thy birth so lowly,
Thy patience, grace, Thy gentleness,
Thy lonely path, so holy.
Thou wast the Man of sorrows,
Our grief, too, Thou didst bear it;
The bitter cup Thou drankest up,
The thorny crown, didst wear it.
|3|
Thy Name we love, Lord Jesus;
God's Lamb, Thou was ordained;
For us undone, Thou spotless One,
Our judgement hast sustained.
We see Thee crowned in glory,
Above the heav'ns now seated,
The vict'ry won, Thy work well done,
Our righteousness completed.
{342}
E. H. CHATER, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
O Lord, the knowledge of Thy love
Doth bow our hearts to Thee above;
Before Thy face we prostrate fall,
Whose wondrous glory shines for all.
We worship, praise Thee and adore,
Exalt Thy Name for evermore!
|2|
Thy church, Thy body and Thy bride,
With Thee, the Christ, identified --
Espoused to Thee, a virgin chaste,
While travelling still this dreary waste --
Finds in Thyself her hope, her all!
She waits to hear her Bridegroom call.
|3|
He comes! The longed-for, glorious Lord,
Whose Name by all shall be adored!
He comes to take His bride on high,
To share to all eternity
The fruits of God's eternal plan,
Before the age of time began.
|4|
The heav'n and earth, the sea and land,
Display the pow'r of God's own hand,
And all His matchless moral ways
Redound for ever to His praise;
But in this glorious mystery
Unfathomable love we see.
{343}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
"Lord, what is man?" 'Tis Christ who died,
And all Thy nature glorified;
Thy righteousness and grace displayed
When He for sins atonement made;
Obedient unto death, was slain --
Worthy is He o'er all to reign!
|2|
Thy counsels ere the world began
All centred in the Son of man;
Head of the church His destined place,
Thy glory radiant in His face.
To Him, enthroned in majesty,
Let every creature bend the knee!
|3|
Worthy, O Son of man, art Thou
Of every crown that decks Thy brow;
Worthy art Thou to be adored
And owned as universal Lord;
O hasten that long-promised day
When all shall own Thy rightful sway!
{344}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
Though all the beasts on earth be slain
To wash away sin's crimson stain,
Though all their blood should flow,
The sacrifice would be in vain,
Iniquity would still remain:
Sin is not cancelled so.
|2|
A better sacrifice than these
It needs, the conscience to appease,
Or satisfy the Lord;
No blood hath virtue to atone
For man's offence, but His alone
Whose title is the Word:
|3|
His, who could say, Himself the Son,
'My Father and Myself are One',
Who made the world around:
His, who Jehovah's Fellow stood,
And claimed equality with God,
Whose glory knows no bound.
|4|
Jesus the Christ, on earth His Name,
He came -- in love to sinners came --
And bowed His head and died;
A full atonement now is made,
The ransom by Himself is paid,
And justice satisfied.
|5|
That sinners might draw near to Him,
God planned this great, this gracious scheme,
And found the ransom too.
Let all His saints their voices raise,
And sing the great Redeemer's praise
While endless ages flow.
{345}
H. RELLSTAB from German, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, with joy we would acknowledge
Now we have our part with Thee;
As Thine own and of Thy brethren,
We a world of blessing see.
And, O Lord, to see us gathered
Joy unmeasured Thee affords;
Thou hast come and we are moved --
Thou dost touch our deepest chords.
|2|
Honour Thine amongst us here, Lord,
Thou art now no more alone;
Thou has gained the love Thou soughtest,
In the circle of Thine own;
Firstborn of the many brethren,
Now our hearts to Thee belong,
And our souls well up in praises
As to Thee we lift our song.
{346}
MRS. B. MERRITT, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Blessed Holy Spirit,
Our heav'nly Guide art Thou;
With thankful hearts and rev'rence
Do we in worship bow.
|2|
We praise Thee for the portion
We now possess in Thee;
Thy comfort all sufficient,
While Christ we wait to see.
|3|
And, at His shout of triumph
That calls us home above,
Thou'lt change our mortal bodies
To dwell in realms of love.
|4|
The grace of our Lord Jesus,
God's love past creature ken,
And Thine own blest communion
Be with us all, Amen.
{347}
J. MACDONALD, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Lord Jesus, Thou art risen
In glory from the dead;
Thy God the oil of gladness
Has poured upon Thy head.
|2|
Thy brethren, Thy companions,
With joy acclaim Thee too;
We sing Thy worth surpassing,
And yield Thee homage true --
|3|
Now in Thy life partaking,
As quickened with Thee, Lord;
Yet owning Thee, the Firstborn,
Pre-eminent, adored!
|4|
O who shall tell, Lord Jesus,
The joy that fills Thy heart,
As thus in nearness to Thee
We find with Thee our part!
{348}
W. H. TROWBRIDGE, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
How good and great, O Father,
Thy wondrous thoughts are shown!
Concealed from wise and prudent,
Revealed to babes alone.
But having understanding,
And Spirit-given joy,
To bless Thee, God our Father,
We heart and voice employ.
|2|
Father, Thine own Son praised Thee,
Of heav'n and earth the Lord!
Thy sovereign operations
Great joy to Thee afford:
For all those coming to Him --
The meek and lowly Man --
Are held by Him for ever,
The fruit of Thy great plan.
|3|
Each knowing Thee as Father --
Revealed so by the Son --
We share His joy before Thee
In all that Thou hast done.
The Son Thou, Father, knowest;
But in that Man so blest,
To whom Thou'st given all things,
Our souls find perfect rest.
{349}
J. LEPANSE from French, S.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, we draw near,
In answer to Thy love;
For ever with Thyself we find
Our part and place above.
|2|
Enjoying such a bliss,
Beyond all words to say,
Thy glory we with joy behold,
Thy rest in brightest day.
|3|
Lord, we Thy longings know,
And willingly respond
As one with Thee -- Thy flesh and bones,
A holy, heav'nly bond.
|4|
Our hearts as held by Thee
Vibrate with deep delight,
United to Thyself to be
Thy bride in glory bright.
|5|
Pure nard and frankincense
To Thee, O Lord, ascend
From Thine assembly -- vessel filled --
Praise that shall never end.
{350}
J. TAYLOR (1870-1953), L.M.
|1|
We hail Thee, Lord, our glorious Head,
Victorious Firstborn from the dead;
Exalted far beyond the skies,
To Thee our praises now would rise.
|2|
Received in glory bright up there,
The Father's greetings, honours rare,
Are heaped upon His Son's blest brow;
He is the mighty Victor now.
|3|
The Father's throne by Him is shared,
Whose nature He, the Son, declared;
Whose will He did, the cost how great!
His worthiness we celebrate.
{351}
ANONYMOUS, L.M.
|1|
There is no other Name than Thine,
Jehovah-Jesus! Name divine;
On which to rest for sins forgiv'n,
For peace with God, for hope of heav'n.
|2|
Name above every name, Thy praise
Shall fill yon courts through endless days;
Jehovah-Jesus! Name divine,
Rock of salvation-Thou art mine!
{352}
A. W. ROACH, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Blessed God, Thou only Ruler,
Only wise, invisible;
King eternal, Lord, Preserver,
Living, incorruptible!
God of truth, of grace and glory,
God of love -- we Thee extol;
Worship, bless, exalt, adore Thee,
God supreme -- soon all in all!
{353}
J. SWAIN (1761-1796), 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
What will it be to dwell above,
And with Thee, Lord of glory, reign,
Since the blest knowledge of Thy love
So brightens all this dreary plain?
No heart can think, no tongue can tell,
What joy 'twill be with Thee to dwell.
|2|
When left this scene of faith and strife,
And flesh and sense deceive no more;
When we shall see Thee, Prince of life,
And all Thy works of grace explore;
What heights and depths of love divine
Will there through endless ages shine!
|3|
And God has fixed the happy day
When the last tear shall dim our eyes,
When He will wipe these tears away,
And fill our hearts with glad surprise;
To hear Thy voice and see Thy face,
And know the fulness of God's grace.
{354}
C. DEAYTON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
There is a wondrous story,
That often has been told,
So full of grace and glory,
So new and yet so old.
And now again we tell it,
So rich, so full, so free;
And hosts unnumbered swell it
Throughout eternity.
|2|
He who was rich in glory
Came down to earth below
In love, O wondrous story!
To lowest depths did go.
Jesus, the spotless Victim,
Died there upon the tree,
That we might know God's favour,
From judgment ever free.
|3|
How dark that night of sorrow
Through which the Saviour passed!
And deep the stormy waters,
And fierce the tempest blast!
But O the mighty Saviour,
Victorious o'er the grave,
Has ris'n in glorious power,
And lives the lost to save.
|4|
The darkness all is ended,
That night for ever past;
To God's right hand ascended,
He'll come again at last,
To call His ransomed people
To yonder glory bright --
Made like to His own image,
To dwell with Him in light.
{355}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), L.M.
|1|
The perfect righteousness of God
Is witnessed in the Saviour's blood;
'Tis in the cross of Christ we trace
His righteousness, yet wondrous grace.
|2|
God could not pass the sinner by,
Justice demands that He should die;
But in the cross of Christ we see
How God can save, yet righteous be.
|3|
The judgment fell on Jesus' head,
'Twas in His blood sin's debt was paid;
Stern justice can demand no more,
And mercy can dispense her store.
|4|
The sinner who believes is free,
Can say, the Saviour died for me;
Can point to the atoning blood
And say, This made my peace with God.
{356}
D. T. HOLDING, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7. IAMBIC
|1|
To Thee, our God, we render now
Our willing adoration:
How great Thy counsels were of old
Before the world's foundation!
Rejoicing, we discern Thy thoughts
Secured in fullest measure
In Christ and His companion -- one --
For Thine eternal pleasure.
|2|
For Thou art glorified as God
By Him, the Man anointed --
Our Head, of whom are we, His like,
With Him our place appointed.
Here in the midst, the glorious Man
A song of triumph raises,
And in the Spirit's power we share
With Him in all Thy praises.
|3|
We worship Thee as Head o'er all,
In holy splendour dwelling;
In greatness and in power divine
Our highest thoughts excelling!
Most blessed is Thy sovereign will,
Thy love is all transcending;
Be glory in th' assembly Thine
Through ages never ending!
{357}
MRS MARY WALKER (1816-1878), 8.8.8.6.
|1|
The wanderer no more will roam,
The lost one to the fold is come,
The prodigal is welcomed home,
O Lamb of God, through Thee!
|2|
The Holy Spirit, too, has wrought
Within the soul to God now brought,
Love finding thus the joy it sought,
O Lamb of God, through Thee!
|3|
It is the Father's joy to bless;
His love has found for me a dress,
A robe of spotless righteousness,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
|4|
Yea, in the fulness of His grace,
God put me in the children's place,
Where I may gaze upon His face,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
|5|
Not half His love can I express,
Yet, Lord, with joy my lips confess,
This blessed portion I possess,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
|6|
Thy precious Name it is I bear,
In Thee I am to God brought near,
And all the Father's love I share,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
{358}
A. J. H. BROWN, C.M.D.
|1|
I heard the blessed story told,
Of Jesus crucified,
How once He took a bondman's form,
And here at Calv'ry died.
I saw by faith the judgment fall,
By faith I heard His cry,
And knew for me He suffered shame,
For me He stooped to die.
|2|
I heard the blessed story told,
Of Jesus glorified,
How He in dying met the foe
And all his power defied.
I saw Him then ascended high
Upon the Father's throne,
I knew His vict'ry set me free,
His triumph was my own.
|3|
I heard the blessed story told,
Of Jesus satisfied,
When every ransomed tongue shall swell
The praise of Him who died.
I'll see Him then by all acclaimed,
I'll triumph and adore,
And know the fulness of His love
When with Him evermore.
{359}
MISS E. CLEWLEY, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
We bless Thee, Holy Spirit!
Responding now to Thee,
We give Thee praise and worship,
Owning Thy Deity.
Our hearts have been awakened
To give Thee greater place,
To know Thee with and in us
In all Thy lowly grace.
|2|
We thank Thee for Thy service,
Thy patience and Thy care;
For every fresh unfolding
Of truth, so rich and rare.
O teach us in Thy movements
To walk in faith with Thee;
For in Thy holy keeping
The bride of Christ must be.
|3|
As we receive impressions
The journey doth provide,
May we with Thee together --
The Spirit and the bride --
Say "Come!" to Him who waiteth
The Father's perfect time --
The wondrous consummation
Of all Thy work sublime!
{360}
UNKNOWN, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
We know Thee, Lord, as risen,
Thou Firstborn from the dead;
We see Thee now ascended,
The church's glorious Head:
In Thee by grace accepted,
The heart and mind set free
To think of all Thy glory,
As now made one with Thee.
|2|
For Thou art Head o'er all things,
Thou hast the highest fame;
As Man Thou art exalted,
Supreme Thy glorious Name!
Supreme Thy love, for Calv'ry
Has shown its mighty power;
Thy love was proved victorious
In sorrow's darkest hour.
|3|
Thy Name all names excelleth,
Thy fame all fame transcends
Thy love all love exceedeth,
And never, never ends.
With joy we sing Thy praises
As one with Thee above;
Eternal are Thy glories;
Eternal is Thy love.
{361}
MRS. H. A. BERG, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Nought is detaining us,
Lord, in earth's sphere;
Thy love constraining us,
We have drawn near.
Thou hast this love expressed,
Now in Thy beauty dressed
We can be found at rest
Joyfully here.
|2|
Lord, Thy desire we know
As Spirit-taught;
That love which Thou dost show
Is not for nought!
Our heart Thyself enthrones;
Hark to the heav'nly tones!
We, of Thy flesh and bones --
O what a thought!
|3|
Lord, in this vessel chaste
Incense is found;
All that delights Thy taste
Doth here abound.
Thou, Lord, our Husband art!
Now to Thy loving heart
From Thy blest counterpart
Praises resound.
{362}
ANONYMOUS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
The Lord who healed the leper
Is looking on thee now;
And, though Thy case discerning,
No frown is on His brow.
Not all Thy sins dark story
Has turned away His love;
'Twas need like thine that brought Him
Down from His throne above.
|2|
The Lord who touched the leper
In His amazing grace,
Though ever pure and holy,
Once took the sinner's place!
His grace and perfect goodness
In all His actions shine;
His cross at length expressing
Both light and love divine.
|3|
The Lord who cleansed the leper
Can surely make thee clean;
His blood can cleanse the vilest,
Whate'er his guilt has been.
O doubt not, He is willing,
But take Him at His word,
Without the "If" exclaiming,
"Thou wilt, Thou canst, O Lord!"
{363}
H. F. REDFEARN, L.M.
|1|
Jesus, Thou glorious Son of God,
We hail Thee now with great delight,
As Thou dost claim us as Thine own,
Thy brethren, precious in Thy sight.
|2|
Thus sanctified and one with Thee,
We praise Thee now with holy joy;
The Firstborn Thou -- supreme in love --
We gladly thus our lips employ
{364}
J. C. TOZER, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Holy Comforter, who guidest
Those who seek Thine aid divine,
Who within the saints abidest,
May Thy light among us shine.
|2|
Precious things to Christ belonging,
Brought to us in love by Thee,
Fill our souls with holy longing
Of His glory more to see.
|3|
Grant us subject minds, attentive
As the truth Thou dost unfold;
May our hearts be more retentive,
Treasuries for wealth untold.
{365}
MRS. S. A. HAUGHTON, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Jesus, our Lord, Thou lovest to be near
To loving hearts who find Thyself so dear --
The precious fruit of purpose, deep, divine,
Secured and held for this great love of Thine.
|2|
Thy bride alone, Thy cherished counterpart,
Can satisfy the longings of Thy heart;
"Thou art all fair, my love," we hear Thee say,
"Arise, my love, my fair one -- come away!"
|3|
Freely we yield ourselves to Thy great love,
Responding gladly, as afresh we prove
That Thou the Bridegroom art, who hast the bride
In Thine embrace -- Thine own heart satisfied.
{366}
R. SANDEMAN, L.M.
|1|
See mercy, mercy from on high,
Descend to rebels doomed to die;
'Tis mercy free, which knows no bound;
How sweet, how pleasant is the sound!
|2|
Soon as the reign of sin began,
The light of mercy dawned on man,
When God announced the blessed news,
The woman's Seed thy head shall bruise.
|3|
Brightly it beamed on men forlorn,
When Christ, the holy Child was born;
And brighter still in splendour shone
When Jesus, dying, cried, 'Tis done!
|4|
Complete in power when He arose
And burst the bands of all His foes;
He captive led captivity,
And took for us His seat on high.
{367}
W. R. MASON, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God, to Thee th' assembly's praises flow
As one with Christ her Head, with love aglow;
Blest answer to the work of love divine --
The concept and the consummation Thine!
|2|
From Thee 'mid scenes supernal doth come down
The city, of Thy workmanship the crown!
Spotless, unwrinkled bridal beauties shine,
Rejoicing Him who fills her heart and Thine.
|3|
This august vessel doth for Thee provide
A dwelling where Thou canst with men reside.
Now, where Thy pleasure rests complacently,
Be glory in th' assembly unto Thee!
{368}
P. GERHARDT (1607-1676) from German, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
O Lord, Thy rich, Thy boundless love
No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
O give our hearts its depth to prove,
And reign without a rival there!
From Thee, O Lord, we all receive;
Thine, wholly Thine, alone we'd live.
|2|
O Lord, how cheering is Thy way!
How blest, how gracious in our eyes!
Care, anguish, sorrow, pass away,
And fear before Thy presence flies.
Lord Jesus, nothing would we see,
Nothing desire, apart from Thee.
|3|
'Mid conflict be Thy love our peace;
In weakness be Thy love our strength;
And when the storms of life shall cease
And Thou to meet us com'st at length,
Lord Jesus, then these hearts shall be
For ever satisfied with Thee.
{369}
E. E. NICHOLS, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Precious Name! the Name of Jesus,
Son of God most high,
Who in love to guilty sinners
Came to die.
|2|
Precious Name! the story telling
Of His humble birth;
Of His lonely pathway, trodden
Here on earth.
|3|
Precious Name of Him the Saviour,
Come the lost to save;
In His grace, for ruined sinners
All He gave.
|4|
Precious Name of Him who suffered
On the shameful tree,
Gave Himself, the willing Victim,
Spotless He.
|5|
Precious Name! enthroned in heaven,
Still that Name He bears;
On His brow the crown of glory
Now He wears.
|6|
Precious, peerless Name of Jesus,
None can tell its worth;
Sweetest Name there is in heaven,
Or on earth.
{370}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), C.M.
|1|
Jesus, of Thee we ne'er would tire;
The new and living food
Can satisfy the heart's desire
Of those redeemed by blood.
|2|
If such the happy midnight song
Our prisoned spirits raise,
What are the joys that cause, ere long,
Eternal bursts of praise!
|3|
To look within and see no stain,
Abroad no curse to trace;
To shed no tears, to feel no pain,
But see Thee face to face;
|4|
To find each hope of glory gained,
Fulfilled each precious word;
And fully all to have attained
The image of our Lord.
|5|
O may Thy Spirit help us still,
In this bright hope, to be
More subject to the Father's will,
E'en now much more like Thee.
{371}
H BENNETT, S.M.
|1|
We have a home above,
From all defilement free;
A mansion which eternal love
Prepared our rest to be.
|2|
The Comforter is come,
The Spirit has been giv'n:
He leads us onward to the home
Reserved for us in heav'n.
|3|
Thy love, most gracious Lord,
Our joy and strength shall be,
Till Thou shalt speak the gladd'ning word
That bids us rise to Thee.
|4|
And then through endless days,
Where all Thy glories shine,
In happier, holy strains we'll praise
The grace that made us Thine.
{372}
G. H. S. PRICE, C.M.
|1|
Blest Holy Spirit, let us prove
The help Thou wouldst afford,
As now assembled here to serve
The interests of our Lord.
|2|
O grant us wise discernment now,
And holy, priestly skill,
That we may every grace allow,
Yet righteousness fulfil.
|3|
Thus may the heart of Christ our Lord
In restfulness confide,
As we His glory here would guard,
And seek nought else beside.
{373}
MRS. H. A. BERG, L.M.
|1|
Lord, though Thy saints be laid to rest,
In Thee they have a portion blest;
Thy precious blood the purchase price
To be with Thee in paradise.
|2|
"Asleep through Jesus" -- blessed state!
What power from Thee can separate?
Not death nor life, not land nor sea,
Can come between Thy saints and Thee.
|3|
"With Christ" -- how better far the lot --
Where sin and sorrow enter not!
Our hearts anticipate the day
When every tear is wiped away;
|4|
When those asleep shall wakened be
To put on immortality,
And we with them shall rise to share
That rapturous meeting in the air!
{374}
J. PELLATT Adapted, 8.6.8.6.8.8.
|1|
Father, Thy love was deepest joy
To Christ when here below:
He came to earth (what blest employ!)
That we this love might know.
Thy Name by Him has been declared,
And His own place by us is shared.
|2|
The lustre of that love, in death
Shone forth in glory rare --
Then to impart the living Breath,
That we His peace might share.
He now delights with us to raise
A song of triumph and of praise.
|3|
He bringeth us to this blest place
Where we with Him can sing;
Where many sons -- surpassing grace --
Eternal praises bring.
On us shines favour ne'er to dim --
The love wherewith Thou lovest Him!
{375}
N. L. V. ZINZENDORF (1700-1760) from German , L.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, holy Lamb of God,
Who shed'st for us Thine own life-blood,
Come, teach us all Thy love -- then pain
In life were sweet, and death were gain.
|2|
Take Thou our hearts, and let them be
For ever held, O Lord, for Thee.
Thy willing servants, let us wear
The seal of love for ever there.
|3|
How blest are they who still abide
Close sheltered by Thy watchful side,
Who life and strength from Thee receive,
And with Thee move, and in Thee live!
|4|
Ah, Lord, enlarge our scanty thought,
To know the wonders Thou hast wrought;
Unloose our stamm'ring tongues to tell
Thy love, immense, unsearchable!
{376}
MRS. A. M. FENNELL, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, we've come together
As drawn to Thy blest Name;
That Name so rich in savour
Doth now our homage claim.
|2|
In wilderness surroundings,
Yet bound in closest ties,
Our spirits free, unfettered,
To Thee responsive rise.
|3|
Here nature's voice is silenced,
And natures claims give way;
The Spirit's realm commands us
On this most favoured day.
|4|
O Lord, with deep emotion
Thyself we magnify;
And own Thy love suffices
Our hearts to satisfy.
{377}
T H REYNOLDS, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Saved for glory! yes, for glory,
By the work of God's blest Son;
Saved for glory, wondrous story,
We believe what Christ has done.
Saved for glory, saved by Jesus,
All our meetness His alone;
Meetness which the Father pleases
Ours should be, in Christ the Son.
|2|
All of grace, yes, grace surpassing,
Such a portion to bestow;
But the love all knowledge passing,
Grace has called us now to know;
Love that bore the stripes and sorrow,
Love that suffered on the tree,
Love that shares the glorious morrow
With the loved ones, you and me.
|3|
Through that perfect Off'ring, never
Can our sins against us rise;
Perfected are we for ever
By that wondrous sacrifice.
Jesus, Saviour! we are graven
Ever on Thy heart of love;
We shall reach the wished-for haven
In Thy Father's house above.
{378}
A. G. DOUGHTY, 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Once from glory's height descending,
To this earth the Saviour came;
Here in grace His pathway wending,
Here He magnified God's name.
Lowly Saviour!
We would still His grace proclaim.
|2|
On to Calv'ry's shame and suff'ring,
He to death the path did tread;
There for sin the perfect Off'ring,
On the cross His blood was shed.
Wondrous Saviour!
Dying in the sinner's stead.
|3|
Out from death, His work completed,
Burst the portals of the grave;
High at God's right hand now seated,
He can e'en the vilest save.
Glorious Saviour!
'Twas in love His all He gave.
|4|
Still he waits in grace transcending,
He for thee has tarried long;
Bids thee share in joys unending,
Join e'en now in heav'n's blest song.
Worthy Saviour!
Theme of all the ransomed throng.
{379}
J. C. TOZER, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Now that wondrous, living story
Would our lips delight to tell:
How the Lord of life and glory
Came in love with men to dwell.
|2|
How in deep, divine compassion,
Once He sat at Sychar's well;
Here as Man in form and fashion --
God come down with men to dwell!
|3|
As the Lamb of God He suffered
For thy sins He knew so well;
On the cross Himself He offered,
That Thou mightest with Him dwell.
|4|
Come to Him! His heart so tender,
And His grace would Thee compel;
Yield to Him in full surrender,
And with Him for ever dwell!
|5|
Living water He would give thee;
Satisfied, thy praise shall swell
To the God who gives so freely,
Who would have thee with Him dwell.
|6|
Ask then for the Spirit Holy --
He who is the springing well,
Power for life and joy within thee --
He would come with thee to dwell.
{380}
MRS. P. R. MORFORD, 8.8.7.7.
|1|
Hearts awaking, Saviour, greet Thee;
Sleeping saints arising meet Thee;
Rising in enraptured love
To Thy rally from above.
|2|
Myriads, myriads, raised and living,
Blessed adoration giving
To the love, whose mighty tone
Rends the tomb to claim its own.
|3|
Raised and changed together thronging,
Quickened hosts to God belonging,
Fill with song the radiant air,
Sons of God, divinely fair.
|4|
Jesus died, but O His rising --
Angel hosts and men surprising --
Brings to God a glorious spoil,
Hosts unnumbered for His toil!
|5|
God supreme in power doth send Him,
Hosts exulting to attend Him;
Trump of God and angel voice
Bid the "dead in Christ" rejoice.
{381}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Stricken, smitten and afflicted,
See Him dying on the tree;
'Tis the Christ by man rejected;
Yes, my soul, 'tis He, 'tis He!
Mark the Sacrifice appointed,
See who bears the awful load!
'Tis the Word, 'tis God's Anointed,
Son of man and Son of God.
|2|
Here we have a firm foundation,
Here the refuge of the lost;
Christ, the Rock of our salvation,
His the Name of which we boast.
Lamb of God! for sinners wounded,
Sacrifice to cancel guilt,
None shall ever be confounded
Who on Thee their hope have built.
{382}
P. GERHARDT (1607-1676) from German, S.M.
|1|
Not to ourselves we owe
That we, O God, are Thine;
Jesus, the Lord, our night broke through
And gave us light divine.
|2|
Our God in boundless love
This blessing freely gave,
And Jesus came from heav'n above,
Our ruined souls to save.
|3|
No more in dread of wrath,
Thy sovereign love we see;
And, Father, in confiding faith,
We rest our souls on Thee.
|4|
Our hearts look up to see
The glory Christ is giv'n,
In spirit dwell where we shall be
With Him, Thine heirs, in heav'n.
|5|
With all the ransomed band,
Soon shall we see Him there;
With them and Him in glory stand,
And in His honour share.
{383}
J. TAYLOR, JR., 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thou Holy Spirit, come from heav'n above
To this dark world where sin and death abound,
To fill our hearts with heav'nly peace and love --
Our grateful praises now to Thee resound.
|2|
Spirit of Christ, come, fill Thou our hearts with grace;
Join now Thyself to all our weakness here;
Strengthen our souls as we move on apace --
Remove from us unfaithfulness and fear.
|3|
Spirit of truth, come, lead our hearts above;
Bring now to us God's thoughts for us today;
Fill us with wisdom, power, peace and love --
Shine in our hearts with Thy blest heav'nly ray.
|4|
Spirit of life, we gladly Thee would hail,
Bless Thee and praise Thee as we thus bend low;
Leading the sons of God through this dark vale
Into that scene where ceaseless praises flow.
|5|
Spirit of God, we glory in Thy Name,
Come forth from Him who dwells in heav'n above,
To sound the theme of Christ's all glorious fame,
And shed abroad the sweetness of God's love.
{384}
A. M. TOPLADY (1740-1778), 7.7.7.7.7.7.
|1|
Rock of Ages! cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleansing from its guilt and power.
|2|
Not the labour of my hands
Could fulfil the law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
Nought for sins could e'er atone
But Thy blood, and Thine alone.
|3|
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thyself I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
|4|
Found by Thee before I sought,
Unto Thee in mercy brought;
I have Thee for righteousness,
From Thy fulness grace on grace;
Thou hast washed me in Thy blood,
Made me live and live to God.
{385}
MISS M M WATNEY, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Father, we now are gathered
At this choice hour of prayer,
Drawn by Thy love so tender,
And readiness to hear.
|2|
And blessed Holy Spirit,
In Thee we now would pray;
Keep us in love abiding,
Awaiting Christ's blest day.
|3|
May all our hearts' deep longings,
Expressed in Jesus' name,
Be incense of sweet fragrance,
In faith's unwavering claim.
|4|
Thus may our hearts be joyful
In this, God's house of prayer;
In sorrow or in gladness,
'Tis love's own thoughts we share.
|5|
And so with deep thanksgiving,
Father, we now draw nigh;
Graced in this glorious favour,
With Christ as Priest on high.
{386}
C. T. LAMBERT, 11.11.11.11. TROCHAIC
|1|
Jesus, Thou art coming, coming as the King,
To this world of sorrow happiness to bring;
Evil then shall vanish, wars and strife shall cease,
Thou, O mighty Victor, art the Prince of Peace.
|2|
All Thy works shall praise Thee; men both high and low,
From the least to greatest, Thee as Lord shall know;
All shall call Thee blessed, all Thy Name confess;
Jesus, Thou art worthy, Sun of righteousness!
|3|
Jesus, Priest enthroned, Jesus, King of peace,
Thou art King of Salem, King of righteousness;
All Thy people call Thee, call from near and far:
Come, Thou Root of David, bright and Morning Star!
|4|
Come, Thou King triumphant; all the earth is Thine;
Show Thy mighty power, let Thy glory shine;
Come, Thou King of glory, Lord of hosts in heav'n,
Come, Lord Jesus, Saviour! Even so, Amen.
{387}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Lord, we wait for Thine appearing;
"Even so," Thy people say;
Bright the prospect is, and cheering,
Of beholding Thee that day,
When our sorrow
Shall for ever pass away.
|2|
Base the wish, and vain th' endeavour,
Here on earth to find our rest;
Till we see Thy face, we never
Shall or can be fully blest;
In Thy presence
Nothing shall our peace molest.
|3|
Till Thou comest keep us steady,
Ever walking in Thy ways;
At Thy call may we be ready,
On Thee, Lord, with joy to gaze;
And in glory
Sing Thine everlasting praise!
{388}
R. ROBINSON (1735-1790), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Brightness of th' eternal glory,
Shall Thy praise unuttered lie?
Who would hush the heav'n-sent story
Of the Lamb who came to die? --
|2|
Came from Godhead's fullest glory
Down to Calv'ry's depth of woe;
Now on high we bow before Thee,
Streams of praises ceaseless flow!
|3|
Sing His blest triumphant rising;
Praise Him on the Father's throne;
Sing -- till, heav'n and earth surprising,
Reigns the Nazarene alone!
{389}
MISS I. STEVENSON (1843-1890) Adapted, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Holy Father, in Thy mercy
Hear our earnest prayer;
Keep us now, and all Thy children,
'Neath Thy care.
|2|
Jesus, Saviour, let Thy presence
Be our light and guide;
Keep, O keep us, in our weakness,
At Thy side!
|3|
May the joy of Thy salvation
Be our strength and stay;
May we love and serve and praise Thee
Day by day.
|4|
Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
Sanctify our life;
Grant Thy grace that we may conquer
In the strife.
|5|
Father, Son and Holy Spirit --
God eternally --
Bless us, guide us, save us, keep us
Near to Thee!
{390}
A. P. CECIL (1841-1889), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the peace for ever flowing
From God's thoughts of His own Son,
O the peace of simply knowing,
On the cross that all was done.
|2|
Peace with God -- for Christ in heaven
Object is of faith to me:
Peace with God -- the Lord is risen,
Righteousness now counts me free.
|3|
Peace with God -- for Christ's in glory;
God is just and God is love;
O how blessed is the story,
That we're brought to God above!
|4|
Jesus, Saviour, we adore Thee,
Christ of God, anointed One!
We confess Thee Lord of glory,
Fruits of vict'ry Thou hast won.
{391}
T. THORSTENSEN, 8.7.8.7. DACTYLIC
|1|
Spring up, O Spirit most holy!
Move us to sing to Thee now;
Teach us with gladness, yet lowly,
Here in Thy presence to bow.
|2|
Spring up, blest Spirit, within us!
Speak to our hearts of His love
Who once descended to win us --
Jesus -- exalted above.
|3|
Spring up, O Well, in Thy glory!
Open the eyes of our heart;
Grant us full freedom before Thee,
Waiting our heavenly part.
|4|
Spring up, O Spirit most gracious!
Teach us while pilgrims below
More of God's glorious greatness,
Till as we're known we shall know.
{392}
J. C. TOZER, C.M.
|1|
Head over all, O God, art Thou;
All glorious is Thy Name!
Supreme in power and majesty,
Eternally the Same.
|2|
Divinely blest, we bring to Thee
What Thou Thyself dost give,
Delighting in Thy thoughts sublime,
As now in Christ we live.
|3|
Thy vast economy of love
With joy we apprehend;
Blest Father, Son, and Spirit, Thine
Be glory without end!
{393}
R. ARRAS from German, 7.6.7.6.8.8.
|1|
Through Thy great might and wisdom
Creation's worlds were made;
To us, O God, Thy greatness
Is seen in them displayed:
Thy glory and divinity,
Thy power from all eternity.
|2|
But all Thy blessed nature --
The movements of Thy heart --
Are known alone, O Father,
To those who have their part
With Christ; in freedom through Thy grace,
We joy in Him before Thy face.
{394}
I. WATTS (1674-1748), C.M.
|1|
Jesus, how glorious is Thy grace!
When in Thy Name we trust,
Our faith receives a righteousness
That makes the sinner just.
|2|
Vain are the hopes the sons of men
Upon their works have built;
Their hearts by nature are unclean,
Their actions full of guilt.
|3|
Silent let Jew and Gentile stand,
Without one vaunting word;
And, humbled low, confess their guilt
Before the righteous Lord.
|4|
No hope can on the law be built
Of justifying grace;
The law that shows the sinner's guilt
Condemns him to his face.
|5|
With Christ the Lord we died to sin;
With Him to life we rise --
To life which, now begun on earth,
Is perfect in the skies.
{395}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 7.7.8.7.7.7.8.7.
|1|
Great Captain of salvation,
Now crowned with highest glory,
We joyful raise our songs of praise,
And lowly bow before Thee.
We worship and adore Thee,
Each heart and tongue confessing,
To Thee once slain -- worthy to reign --
Be honour, power and blessing!
|2|
Thou hast the cross endured
In love beyond all measure,
The curse, the grave, Thy saints to save,
And have us as Thy treasure.
We see Thee as the Victim,
Our sins and sorrows bearing,
The Lamb once slain, alive again,
The crown of glory wearing.
|3|
Head of the vast creation,
To God's right hand ascended:
Thy saints rejoice with heart and voice,
Before Thy feet low bended.
We own Thee, Lord, exulting
In all Thy joy and glory,
And long to be on high with Thee
Where all shall bow before Thee.
{396}
MISS F. R. HAVERGAL (1836-1879), 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Shed on Calvary!
Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,
Shed for me.
|2|
Precious, precious blood of Jesus!
All the price is paid;
Perfect pardon now is offered,
Peace is made.
|3|
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Jesus, God's own Son!
Telling that the work is finished;
All is done.
|4|
Thought Thy sins are red like crimson,
Deep in scarlet glow,
Jesus' precious blood can make them
White as snow.
|5|
Precious blood, whose full atonement
Bringeth us to God!
Precious blood, our song and glory,
Praise and laud!
{397}
T. KELLY (1769-1855) Adapted, C.M.
|1|
Jesus, Thy head, once crowned with thorns,
Is crowned with glory now;
Heav'n's royal diadem adorns
The mighty Victor's brow.
|2|
Thou glorious light of courts above,
Joy of the saints below,
To us still manifest Thy love,
That we its depths may know.
|3|
To us Thy cross with all its shame,
With all its grace, be giv'n;
Though earth disowns Thy lowly Name,
God honours it in heav'n.
|4|
Who suffer with Thee, Lord, below,
Shall reign with thee above;
Then let it be our joy to know
This way of peace and love.
|5|
To us Thy cross is life and health,
'Twas shame and death to Thee;
Our present glory, joy and wealth,
Our everlasting stay.
{398}
ADAPTED, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, Thou hast touched our hearts
And told them of Thy joy;
Responding now in songs of praise
We would our lips employ.
|2|
We praise, we worship, we adore,
And thus Thyself would greet;
Thy beauty, Lord, our souls transports,
While bowing at Thy feet.
|3|
Such beauty shineth far above
Our present power of praise,
But we shall live and prove Thy love
Through everlasting days.
|4|
The endless praise our lips shall move,
And joy our spirits fill,
The objects of Thy love divine --
O who that joy can tell!
{399}
J MONTGOMERY, S.M.
|1|
For ever with the Lord!
Amen! so let it be:
Life from the dead is in that word,
'Tis immortality.
|2|
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him we roam,
Yet nightly pitch our moving tent
A day's march nearer home.
|3|
And though there intervene
Rough seas and stormy skies,
Yet, by no mortal vision seen,
His glory fills our eyes!
|4|
There shall all clouds depart,
The wilderness shall cease,
And sweetly shall each gladdened heart
Enjoy eternal peace.
{400}
J. PELLATT, 14.14.14.14.
|1|
God manifest in flesh, O wonder of His universe!
O wisdom all divine! that takes such blessed, lowly ways
To bring to pass its holy purposes in counsels deep,
That God may find a full response in worship and in praise.
|2|
What mutual glory, known between the Father and the Son,
And holy love in all its secret intercourse holds sway!
The Father's bosom its own sphere, where ever dwelleth One
Who fully answers to that love throughout th' eternal day.
|3|
And by the Spirit's power the Father's love e'en now we know
Within us; with the Son, its Object, ever to abide;
And the affections of the saints well forth in ceaseless flow,
Filled in the ocean of that love, a never-ebbing tide.
{401}
P. G. BLANC from French, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Spirit of grace, O Thou whose hidden might
Sustains us day by day the whole way through,
We bless Thee for Thy service, and unite
In rend'ring now the homage that is due.
|2|
Spirit of truth, 'tis Thou who lead'st us on
Into the fulness of God's purpose here;
Thou takest heav'nly glories of the Son,
And bringest every precious feature near.
|3|
Filled with the favour Thou dost make us prove,
Spirit of life, with rev'rent hearts may we
More skilfully in service learn to move,
And for the power rely alone on Thee.
|4|
Clothe us with that humility, we pray,
That honours Thee and shows what Thou canst do;
Grant that the lustre of th' eternal day --
The day of God -- shine in our hearts anew.
{402}
D. ROBERTSON, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit --
Blessed Name of Godhead known!
We its fulness, power and blessing
Claim in faith to be our own.
|2|
Father, the desire we cherish
To be sanctified by Thee;
In Thy Name, Thy truth, kept holy,
Joying in the Trinity.
|3|
Owning Thy blest claim, Lord Jesus,
May our households always be --
To the Name as thus baptised --
Held entirely, Lord, for Thee.
|4|
From the world -- its joys and sorrows --
Wholly sep'rate would we live;
In Thy power, O blessed Spirit,
Walk in life which Thou dost give.
{403}
H SETTLER From German, 9.8.9.8.
|1|
Lord Jesus, to Thee be the worship,
All praise and all glory above!
Once here in the form of a bondman,
Thou servedst for wages of love.
|2|
'Twas love all divine that constrained Thee
To stoop from the greatness on high;
We wonder at love thus revealed!
And worship Thee now as brought nigh.
|3|
O Lord, Thou art with us all glorious,
Our heart is united to Thine;
As like Thee and for Thee, Lord Jesus,
We gladly our praises combine.
{404}
MISS H. K. BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
On His Father's throne is seated
Christ the Lord, the Living One,
All His toil on earth completed,
All His work for sinners done;
In the glory
See Him, God's beloved Son.
|2|
Man the cross to him awarded,
Man the Saviour crucified;
This worlds judgment stands recorded,
God's own nature glorified.
By the glory
Christ was claimed, on earth who died.
|3|
Every knee shall bow before Him,
Every tongue confess His Name;
Ransomed myriads shall adore Him
Who endured the sinner's shame.
From the glory
God doth now His worth proclaim.
{405}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), L.M.D.
|1|
Master, we would no longer be
At home in that which hated Thee,
But patient in Thy footsteps go,
Thy sorrow as Thy joy to know.
We would -- and O confirm the power! --
With meekness meet the darkest hour,
By shame, contempt, however tried;
For Thou wast scorned and crucified.
|2|
We welcome still Thy faithful word --
The cross shall meet its sure reward;
For soon must pass the little while,
Then joy shall crown Thy servant's toil.
O may our path of service be
Well-pleasing, Saviour, unto Thee,
That when our earthly course is run,
We may receive Thy word, "Well done."
{406}
G. H. S. PRICE, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O blessed God, our souls are moved as one
To render praise and wider glory still;
Our minds are filled with all that Thou hast done
In working out the counsel of Thy will.
|2|
We bow in adoration, for we know
It was Thy thought before the world began
To fill a scene where endless praise should flow,
And share Thy rest eternally with man.
|3|
And by the Spirit now we touch that rest,
And see, O God, the end of all Thy ways;
We stand in Christ as those Thy love has blest,
To serve Thee now and richest anthems raise.
|4|
We thus extol afresh Thy wondrous name,
And bow before Thy glory all divine.
We worship still, while gladdened hearts exclaim --
"Thou canst be hindered in no thought of Thine!"
{407}
G. H. BROWN, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
O God, Thy grace no limit knows,
Pure and unfathomed is Thy love;
Thy boundless mercy freely flows,
Since Jesus left His throne above
And died -- our souls from sin to free --
When we were lost and far from Thee.
|2|
Jesus, the Lord, our ransom paid
In matchless condescending grace!
Came to the world His hands had made,
And stooped to take the sinner's place.
The just One for the unjust died;
Thy holy claims are satisfied.
|3|
But ris'n on high, for evermore
Jesus the mighty Saviour lives;
Blessings from Thine exhaustless store
To all who trust Him now He gives.
Through Him we know Thy love divine;
In Him we see Thy glory shine.
|4|
The Holy Spirit here below
Sheds in our hearts Thy wondrous love,
And gives us even now to know
Our glorious place with Christ above.
Thus pardoned, cleansed and freed from blame,
O blessed God, we praise Thy Name!
{408}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), 10.10.10.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
O what a Saviour is Jesus the Lord!
Well may His Name by His saints be adored!
He has redeemed them from hell by His blood,
Saved them for ever, and brought them to God.
|2|
Now in the glory He waits to impart
Peace to the conscience, and joy to the heart;
Waits to be gracious, to pardon and heal
All who their sin and their wretchedness feel.
|3|
Thousands have fled to His spear-pierced side;
Welcome they all have been, none are denied;
Weary and laden, they all have been blest;
Joyfully now in the Saviour they rest.
{409}
G. H. BROWN, 11.10.11.10.
|1|
Come! for the Father speaks to thee from heaven,
In Jesus' death His heart of love was told;
Since He His only Son for thee has given,
His bounteous hand no blessing would withhold.
|2|
Come! for the Saviour speaks, in grace appealing,
He waits to pardon, and to cleanse thy soul;
His precious blood alone can give thee healing,
Can wash thee from thy sins and make thee whole.
|3|
Come! for the Spirit speaks of Christ in glory;
In tender patience still He waits on thee.
Hark to His voice, and heed the wondrous story
Of full salvation, measureless and free.
|4|
Come now in faith, by God Himself invited!
He longs thy heart with heav'nly joys to fill;
For He, though oft His goodness thou hast slighted,
In grace and love unwearied seeks thee still.
|5|
To Jesus come, and as thy Saviour own Him,
To Him confessing all thy guilt and woe;
As Lord and Master in thy heart enthrone Him,
Life everlasting, peace and joy to know.
{410}
J. A. V. POSECK (1816-1896), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
On the Lamb our souls are resting,
What His love no tongue can say;
All our sins, so great, so many,
In His blood are washed away.
|2|
Sweetest rest and peace have filled us,
Sweeter praise than tongue can tell;
God is satisfied with Jesus,
We are satisfied as well.
|3|
Conscience now no more condemns us,
For His own most precious blood
Once for all has washed and cleansed us,
Cleansed us in the eyes of God.
|4|
Filled with this sweet peace for ever,
On we go, through strife and care,
Till we find that peace around us
In the Lamb's high glory there.
|5|
On the living Lord believing,
We have righteousness and peace.
By the Holy Spirit given:
Fadeless joys that never cease.
{411}
R. PEART, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thou Holy Comforter, we joy in thee,
Sent down in answer to our Lord's request.
Deep were Thy feelings when Thou cam'st to be
With us for ever from that day so blest!
|2|
Spirit of truth, in Thee our minds find rest,
While here in this dark, unresponsive scene;
Thou art for ever with us; O how blest
To know Thee even though Thou art unseen!
|3|
No eye has seen nor ear has ever heard,
Nor heart of man is great enough to hold
Those wondrous things in love by God prepared,
Which Thou, blest Spirit, lovest to unfold.
|4|
Nor is this all, for Thou the Earnest art
Of bliss to come, and giv'st us even here
To enter now our glorious heav'nly part,
And taste the joys of that eternal sphere!
{412}
MRS. W. T. PETERSEN, L.M.
|1|
Lord Spirit, blest, of Thee we're taught,
By Thee indwelt, and through Thee brought
To know the truth Thou dost confide
To subject hearts, whom Thou dost guide.
|2|
Thy service doth our praise compel,
As with and in us Thou dost dwell;
Spirit divine, our hearts we raise
In joyful worship, thankful praise.
|3|
All things of Jesus Thou dost know,
Their glorious greatness to us show;
By Thee, blest Spirit, now adored,
We contemplate the Christ, our Lord.
|4|
Where'er Thy Spirit, Lord, shall be,
For us there is sweet liberty.
Thus we upon Thy glory gaze,
Now shining in Thine unveiled face.
|5|
From glory unto glory brought,
And by Thy Spirit's work inwrought,
We see the glory that doth shine
In Thy blest countenance divine.
{413}
C WESLEY, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Love divine, all praise excelling,
Joy of heav'n, to earth come down!
By Thy Spirit here indwelling,
All Thy faithful mercies crown!
Jesus, Lord, Thy full compassion --
Pure unbounded love Thou art --
And the joy of Thy salvation,
Enter every longing heart.
|2|
And Thou giv'st Thy Holy Spirit
That we might Thy life receive;
Suited praise through Him ascending,
He would ne'er His temple leave.
Thus, Lord, we would now be blessing,
Serve Thee here as soon above,
Praise Thee, Saviour, without ceasing,
Glory in Thy dying love.
|3|
Firstfruits of things new-created,
Holy Spirit, may we be,
And beholding Christ exalted,
Even now transformed by Thee:
Changed from glory unto glory,
Till in heav'n we take our place,
Worship full to render through Thee,
Filled with wonder, love and praise.
{414}
MISS A. TAYLOR (1782-1866), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
What was it, blessed God,
Led Thee to give Thy Son,
To yield Thy Well-beloved
For us by sin undone?
'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus
To give Thy Well-beloved for us.
|2|
What led Thy Son, O God,
To leave Thy throne on high,
To shed His precious blood,
To suffer and to die?
'Twas love, unbounded love to us,
Led Him to die and suffer thus.
|3|
What moved Thee to impart
Thy Spirit from above,
Therewith to fill our heart
With heav'nly peace and love?
'Twas love, unbounded love to us,
Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
|4|
What love to Thee we owe,
Our God, for all Thy grace!
Our hearts may well outflow
In everlasting praise.
Gladly, O God, we praise Thee thus
For all Thy boundless love to us.
{415}
MRS. A. R. C. COUSIN (1824-1906) Adapted, 8.6.8.6.8.6.
|1|
O Lord, what burdens Thou didst bear!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest for the sinner there
To bear all ill for me.
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed;
Now there's no load for me.
|2|
Death and the curse were in our cup,
O Lord, 'twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop,
'Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup -- love drank it up;
Left but the love for me.
|3|
The tempest's awful voice was heard:
O Lord, it broke on Thee!
Thine open bosom was my ward,
It bore the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, thy visage marred;
Now cloudless peace for me.
|4|
For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
And I have died with Thee;
Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied;
And now Thou liv'st in me.
The Father's face in radiant grace
Shines now in light on me.
{416}
MRS J. A. TRENCH, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the brightness of the glory
Shining in the Saviour's face!
Telling all the blessed story
Of the ways of God in grace:
Lowly, hated, and rejected,
In the world He came to save;
By the glory of the Father
Raised triumphant from the grave.
|2|
Now we see Him crowned with glory,
Glory in His unveiled face,
And in peace and rest before him,
In that glory learn of grace:
For it shineth in the visage 
Of the One who for us died,
Bore our sins and all their judgement --
Jesus Christ the crucified.
{417}
R. HOLDEN from Spanish, L.M.D.
|1|
To God, in highest power supreme,
To God o'er all, the greatest theme,
To God, by heav'nly hosts adored,
To God, of all the sovereign Lord --
Our adoration let us bring,
And let our hearts His worship sing;
With grateful love our voices raise,
And every tongue proclaim His praise!
|2|
Thou gav'st Thy Son for us to die,
Revealing Thy great heart thereby,
Securing thus adoring love,
Which now ascends to Thee above.
What joy, O God, Thy heart must know
To see Thy lovers here below,
Made like Thy Son by grace divine,
With hearts responding unto Thine!
{418}
E. CARREN from Swedish, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Jesus, blessed Saviour,
As we Thy beauty see
We gladly do Thee homage,
And glory give to Thee.
|2|
Thou by th' eternal Spirit
Thyself didst offer up;
In perfect, full obedience
Didst take that awful cup!
|3|
How pleasing to the Father,
Whose will was fully done!
How honoured by Thy people,
Beloved, holy One!
|4|
Let hosts of heav'n acclaim Thee!
Let mortals shout for joy!
The lips of all Thy lovers
Eternal praise employ.
{419}
MISS A. ROSS, 5.4.5.4.5.4.5.4.
|1|
Lord, Thou art with me!
Whom shall I fear?
Who then can harm me
Whilst Thou art near?
Under Thy shadow
Is my retreat;
There to my taste, Lord,
Thy fruit is sweet.
|2|
Lord, Thou art with me,
And Thou dost give
Strength for the journey,
Grace now to live.
Mercies each morning
Thou dost renew;
And for my prospect,
Thy rest in view.
|3|
Lord, Thou art with me;
Onward I move;
Each day I'm proving
More of Thy love.
Now thou art training,
Setting me free
From all that hinders,
To dwell with Thee.
{420}
S. MCCALLUM, 12.13.12.10.
|1|
Glory, glory, glory, praise and adoration!
Hear the anthems swelling out through all eternity!
Father, Son and Spirit -- God in revelation --
Prostrate each soul before the Deity!
|2|
Father, source of glory, naming every fam'ly;
And the Son upholding all by His almighty power;
Holy Spirit, filling the vast scene of glory --
O glorious Fulness, let our souls adore!
|3|
God supreme, we worship now in holy splendour,
Head of the vast scene of bliss, before Thy face we fall!
Majesty and greatness, glory, praise and power
To Thee belong, eternal Source of all!
{421}
MISS A. ROSS, 11.10.11.10.
|1|
What will it be when all life's toil is finished,
And we have entered our eternal rest;
When past for ever is the night of weeping,
And with Thee, Lord, we are for ever blest!
|2|
What will it be when all the strife is over,
And all Thy saints, now scattered far and wide,
Shall be without one shade of variation,
All like Thee, Lord, united by Thy side!
|3|
What will it be when sorrow's day is ended,
And pain and grief for ever passed away;
When with Thee, Lord, we share the bright forever,
In perfect peace throughout the perfect day!
|4|
What will it be? -- In blest anticipation
E'en now our hearts outpour in praise to Thee;
But when we see Thee face to face in glory,
Then purer, sweeter, shall our praises be.
{422}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Lord Jesus, we remember
The travail of Thy soul,
When, through Thy love's deep pity,
The waves did o'er Thee roll.
Baptised in death's dark waters,
For us Thy blood was shed;
For us Thou, Lord of glory,
Wast numbered with the dead.
|2|
O Lord, Thou now art risen,
Thy travail all is o'er;
For sin Thou once hast suffered,
Thou liv'st to die no more.
Sin, death and hell are vanquished
By Thee, the church's Head;
And lo! we share Thy triumphs,
Thou Firstborn from the dead.
|3|
Unto Thy death baptised,
We own with Thee we died;
With Thee, our life, we're risen,
And shall be glorified.
From sin, the world, and Satan,
We're ransomed by Thy blood;
And here would walk as strangers,
Alive with Thee to God.
{423}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.2.
|1|
O Lord, what love to sinners Thou hast shown,
To give Thy life for those by sin undone!
But is that blood which doth for sins atone,
For me?
|2|
Was it for guilty sinners such as I
That Thou, O Lord, didst suffer here and die?
And is that grace which Thou dost now supply
For me?
|3|
Is it for me, who early went astray,
Who turned from God to tread a self-willed way,
Is it for me that mercy flows today?
For me?
|4|
If it's the hopeless case Thou lov'st to meet,
If it's a sinner thou dost run to greet,
Then 'tis for me to worship at Thy feet --
For me.
|5|
Yes, 'twas for me, Lord Jesus, Thou didst come;
To me Thou givest pardon, peace, and home;
And, Saviour, in Thy loving heart there's room
For me.
{424}
M. W. BIGGS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thy death, O Lord, and sorrow
Have told Thy love divine;
The deepest depths were fathomed
In that great stoop of Thine.
Thy love beyond all measure
Was proved in Calv'ry's shame;
Thy path of love we treasure;
As ointment is Thy Name.
|2|
And though Thou art in glory,
thy love is still the same
As when its depth and fulness
Were told 'mid sin and shame.
Thy love o'er all has triumphed,
And made us ever Thine;
The power of death has witnessed
The strength of love divine.
{425}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O God of grace, our Father,
We bless Thy holy Name;
We who enjoy Thy favour,
Made holy, without blame;
In love, which sought and found us,
And brought us nigh to Thee,
And won the rest of glory,
Our heav'nly home shall be.
|2|
Thy deep, eternal counsel
Chose us in Christ the Son,
Before the world's foundation
Or time had yet begun;
That we might now the nearness
Of the Beloved know,
And, graced in all His fulness,
As sons our praises flow.
|3|
We worship Thee, our Father;
Soon all Thine own shall be
At home in heav'nly glory,
In love and joy with Thee.
We worship Thee, our Father,
And praise Thy perfect love;
Soon shall we chant Thy glory
In better strains above.
{426}
P. P. BLISS (1838-1876), 7.7.7.8.
|1|
"Man of sorrows!" what a name
For the Son of God, who came
Ruined sinners to redeem!
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
|2|
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In our place condemned He stood;
Purchased are we with His blood --
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
|3|
Guilty, vile and helpless we,
Spotless Lamb of God was He!
Full atonement -- Can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
|4|
Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in heav'n exalted high,
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
|5|
Him as Lord we gladly own,
Seated on His Father's throne;
Soon we'll sing in sweeter tone,
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
{427}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856) Adapted, S.M.
|1|
Whom have we, Lord, but Thee,
Soul thirst to satisfy?
Exhaustless spring! The waters free!
All other streams are dry.
|2|
Our hearts by Thee are set
On brighter things above;
Strange that we ever should forget
Thine own most faithful love!
|3|
Our portion faileth not,
For Thou dost give as God;
Secure in thee our happy lot
Through the redeeming blood.
|4|
None like the ransomed host
That precious blood have known;
Redemption gives faith's holy boast
To draw so near the throne.
|5|
Higher and higher yet,
In Thee, through blood, made nigh;
We taste the love that knows no let,
And "Abba, Father!" cry.
{428}
E. MARKHAM, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Blest God, o'er all supreme,
Eternal Thou!
Thy love the glorious theme
For ever now,
In hearts to Thee brought near,
Where love has cast out fear.
We're hushed -- Thy voice to hear,
And lowly bow.
|2|
We, thine own sons, adore --
For ever Thine;
The fruit of love explore --
A work divine.
O God, our hearts are taught
To see what Thou hast wrought
In those Thy love has sought,
And claimed as Thine.
|3|
Behold the answer meet
Of all Thy ways;
Thy perfect work complete
For endless days.
Our God, we worship Thee!
Throughout eternity
Thy love shall ever be
Our song of praise!
{429}
A. J. H. BROWN, 10.10.10.6.
|1|
O Jesus, Lord, Thou stoodest in my stead;
God's holy wrath was poured upon Thy head;
For me Thou once wast numbered with the dead --
For me, O Lord, for me.
|2|
O Jesus, Lord, Thy blood has brought me nigh,
Has cleansed me from my sins of scarlet dye;
For me Thy blood was shed on Calvary --
For me, O Lord, for me.
|3|
O Jesus, Lord, unchanging is Thy love,
Thou liv'st for me at God's right hand above;
Thy tender care for me I daily prove --
For me, O Lord, for me.
|4|
For me, O Lord, Thou hast done all things well;
Though feebly here, Thy praise my voice shall swell --
When with Thee, Lord, I shall for ever dwell --
With Thee, O Lord, with Thee.
|5|
O Jesus, Lord, in Thee may I confide,
In Thee in every storm and trouble hide,
And trust in Thee whatever, Lord, betide --
In Thee, O Lord, in Thee.
{430}
J. PELLATT, C.M.
|1|
Thy love, blest Lord, in death made known,
Has touched our hearts anew;
Responsive love delights to own
All praise to Thee is due.
|2|
The bread reminds us we are one,
One body there is seen;
The Spirit's unity we own
Where diverse we had been.
|3|
"My body -- giv'n," Thou saidst, O Lord,
"My blood -- poured out for you":
What joy Thy precious words afford
As we these emblems view!
|4|
While thus we call Thee, Lord, to mind,
Thou dost Thyself now come,
To find in Thine assembly here --
Where Thou hadst none -- a home!
{431}
E. DENNY (1796-1889), L.M.
|1|
O grace divine! the Saviour shed
His life-blood on th' accursed tree;
Bowed on the cross His blessed head,
And died to make His people free.
|2|
Through suff'ring there, beneath His feet
He trod the fierce destroyer down;
There power itself and weakness meet --
Emblem of each, yon thorny crown.
|3|
'Twas mighty love's constraining power
That made Thee, blessed Saviour, die;
'Twas love, in that tremendous hour,
That triumphed in Thy mighty cry.
|4|
'Twas all for us -- our life we owe,
Our hope, our crown of joy, to Thee;
Thy suff'ring in that hour of woe --
Thy vict'ry, Lord -- hath made us free.
{432}
G CUTTING AND A MACE (1843-1934), C.M.
|1|
O gracious Saviour, Thou hast giv'n
My trembling soul to know
That, trusting in Thy precious blood,
I'm washed as white as snow.
|2|
Since Thou hast borne sin's heavy load,
My guilty fear is o'er;
Made Thine, by virtue of Thy blood,
I'm sealed for evermore.
|3|
What wait I for, most blessed Lord,
Except Thy face to see?
The Spirit is the Earnest giv'n,
What must Thy presence be?
|4|
To hear Thy voice, to see Thy face,
And grieve Thy heart no more;
But drink the fulness of Thy grace,
Thy love for evermore.
{433}
A. W. ROACH, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Hark! 'tis a message free,
Of pardon, joy and peace;
A trump of jubilee,
Glad tidings of release!
Let Satan's captives hear the sound --
Grace reigns where sin and death abound.
|2|
Salvation in the Name
Of Jesus, offered still;
Glad heralds sound His fame:
Ho! whosoever will,
Avail Thyself of grace supreme;
His blood doth ransom, cleanse, redeem!
{434}
MRS. S. HEDMAN from Swedish, 6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.
|1|
We see not all things yet
Subjected to Thee, Lord:
Thy throne has not been set,
Nor earthly praise outpoured;
But -- blessed holy One,
Who e'en in death wast found --
As God's beloved Son
We see Thee glory-crowned.
|2|
Now we await the day
When faith gives place to sight,
When all shall own Thy sway,
And give Thee every right.
Yet here we hold Thy Name
In love and faithfulness,
Till earth shall sing Thy fame
And own Thy worthiness.
|3|
Until we are with Thee,
And see Thee as Thou art,
Help us more faithfully
To fill on earth our part;
To witness in this sphere
To Thee, the Witness true,
That in these vessels here
Thy glory may shine through.
{435}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
On that same night, Lord Jesus,
When all around combined
To cast its darkest shadow
Across Thy holy mind,
We hear Thy voice, blest Saviour --
This do, remember Me!
With grateful hearts responding,
We do remember Thee.
|2|
We think of all the darkness
Which round Thy spirit pressed,
Of all those waves and billows
Which rolled across Thy breast;
O there Thy grace unbounded
And perfect love we see;
With thankful hearts, Lord Jesus,
We do remember Thee.
|3|
Till Thou shalt come in glory,
And call us hence away
To rest in all the brightness
Of that unclouded day,
We show Thy death, Lord Jesus,
And here would seek to be
More to Thy death conformed,
Whilst we remember Thee.
{436}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), C.M.
|1|
Behold the Lamb, with glory crowned!
To Him all power be giv'n;
No place too high for Him is found,
No place too high in heav'n.
|2|
He fills the throne -- the throne above;
Its rights to Him belong;
The object of His Father's love,
Theme of the ransomed's song.
|3|
Though high, yet He accepts the praise
His people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest note they raise
Will reach the Saviour's ear.
|4|
This song be ours, we join in one
To celebrate the Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to exalt the Lamb.
|5|
To Him whom men despise and slight,
To Him be glory giv'n:
The crown is His, and His by right
The highest place in heav'n.
{437}
N. B. STEWART, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
Blest Comforter, with joy we raise
Our song to Thee in holy praise,
As we discern the lowly place
Which Thou didst take in wondrous grace;
Sent of the Father and the Son,
In us and with us, Holy One!
|2|
Yet in true majesty divine
The glories of Thy Person shine;
Thou hast full part in Deity,
Its rights supreme belong to Thee.
Lord Spirit! Thee we worship now,
And joined in heart before Thee bow.
|3|
Thou art our Teacher and our Guide,
And Christ by Thee is glorified;
In that blest realm where love is free,
By Thine own power sustained are we.
We thank Thee for Thy service blest
That leads where God Himself doth rest.
{438}
ADAPTED, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Rejoicing in Thy presence,
O Holy Spirit, here
In God's own habitation,
Thy Person we revere.
|2|
Thou blessed, quick'ning Spirit,
Our liberty is Thine;
Within the holy precincts
At home, in light divine.
|3|
We listen as Thou speakest,
Attentive to Thy voice
Telling of Christ's own greatness,
In which our hearts rejoice.
|4|
By Thee we are, Lord Spirit,
Transformed as now we gaze
Upon that unveiled glory,
Radiant in Jesus' face!
{439}
O. L. BARNES, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Holy Spirit, Thou delightest
Christ to magnify;
In our hearts afresh responsive,
Thou art nigh;
|2|
Speaking to us of the glory
Of that Man on high,
Who to win the church, His body,
Came to die.
|3|
Here with joy we now remember
Him who suffered thus;
Holy, fragrant theme those sufferings
Are to us!
|4|
Thus in bonds of love together
We recall Thee, Lord,
While the Holy Spirit present
Strikes the chord.
{440}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
O Lord, what joy and glad surprise
Shall fill our hearts when we arise
To meet Thee in the air!
To see Thy face, to hear Thy voice,
And in Thy perfect love rejoice,
Whose glory we shall share.
|2|
No more deferred our hope shall be,
No longer through a glass we'll see,
But clearly, face to face.
Then shall we dwell with Thee above,
Whom absent we have learned to love --
Blest trophies of Thy grace.
|3|
While waiting for Thee, Saviour, here,
O may Thy word our spirits cheer --
I quickly come again!
O may our hearts expect that day,
And to Thy word responsive say:
Come, Jesus, Lord, Amen!
{441}
J. C. TOZER, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Father of every fam'ly,
Our song to Thee we raise;
Thou art supreme in glory,
Thy love commands our praise.
|2|
Now by Thy Spirit strengthened,
And filled by power divine,
We apprehend the greatness
Of all Thou didst design.
|3|
Here Christ and the assembly
Are seen in radiance bright,
Man in Thine own blest image,
For ever Thy delight.
|4|
His love, though passing knowledge,
Known to His spouse so fair,
As we in conscious union
With Him in glory share.
|5|
And so to Thee, blest Father,
Our hearts in worship bow,
As Head He leads our praises,
His God and ours art Thou.
|6|
Thus to eternal ages,
In the assembly be
Glory all thought exceeding,
Through Jesus Christ to Thee.
{442}
C. A. COATES (1862-1945), C.M.
|1|
No act of power could e'er atone,
No wonder-working word
Could, from the brightness of the throne,
Make love's sweet voice be heard.
|2|
If sinners ever were to know
The depths of love divine,
All Calv'ry's weakness and its woe,
Blest Saviour, must be Thine.
|3|
God's righteousness is there proclaimed,
His mercy's depths are known,
While to the full Thou hast maintained
The glory of His throne.
|4|
God now is glorified in Thee,
In Thee, His only Son;
His hand, His house, His heart are free,
Because Thy work is done.
|5|
For Thou hast brought again to Him
More than by man He lost;
And in the very place of sin
We see His glory most.
|6|
And drawn to Thee in holy love,
A song of joy we raise;
In concert with the heav'ns above
We crown Thee with our praise.
{443}
ANONYMOUS, 6.5.6.5.6.5.6.5.
|1|
Blessed Holy Spirit,
Comforter divine,
Dwelling in the temple,
In the holy shrine --
Holy is Thy presence,
Holy is the place
Where Thou now art dwelling
In exceeding grace.
|2|
Unto Thee ascribing
Glory, honour, power,
We would wait upon Thee
In this hallowed hour.
Let not human wisdom,
Nor let carnal thought
With unholy feelings
Hide what Thou hast brought.
|3|
Let Thy light transcendent
On the Scripture shine,
Opening the treasures
Of the mind divine:
Thoughts of Christ in glory,
Of the Father's love,
Bringing in their shining
Wisdom from above.
{444}
J. RYLAND (1753-1825) Adapted, C.M.
|1|
O Lord, we would delight in Thee,
And on Thy care depend;
To Thee in every trouble flee,
Our safe unfailing Friend.
|2|
When human cisterns all are dried,
Thy fulness is the same;
May we with this be satisfied,
And glory in Thy Name.
|3|
What good in creatures may be found
Is all derived from Thee;
We must have all things and abound
Through Thy sufficiency.
|4|
Thou who hast made our hope secure
Wilt here all good provide;
While Thou art rich, can we be poor?
Thou who for us hast died!
|5|
O Lord, we cast each care on Thee,
And triumph and adore;
O that our great concern may be
To love and praise Thee more!
{445}
T. HAWEIS (1734-1820), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Jesus, the Lord, is ris'n
Triumphant o'er the grave;
For us He burst the pris'n,
Almighty now to save!
Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth who was dead.
|2|
Who to our charge shall lay
Our sins before our God?
Since all are washed away
In Jesus' precious blood.
Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth who was dead.
|3|
Who now accuseth them
Whom God hath justified?
Or who shall those condemn
For whom the Surety died?
Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth who was dead.
|4|
Christ hath the ransom paid,
The wondrous work is done;
On Him our help is laid,
The victory is won.
Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth who was dead.
{446}
MISS C. ELLIOTT (1789-1871), 8.8.8.6.
|1|
Just as I am -- without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me.
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come!
|2|
Just as I am -- poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come!
|3|
Just as I am -- and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come!
|4|
Just as I am -- Thy love, I own,
Has broken every barrier down;
Now to be Thine, my joy and crown,
O Lamb of God, I come!
|5|
Just as I am -- of that free love
The fulness and the depth to prove,
Here for a season, then above --
O Lamb of God, I come!
{447}
H. RELLSTAB from German, 10.10.10.10.10.10.
|1|
O Holy Spirit, thanks is due to Thee;
Our hearts respond to Thy divine behest.
Thou leadest us to Christ so faithfully,
As Thou dost now fulfil Thy mission blest.
The Father counselled that a bride should be
Sought for His Son and brought to Him by Thee.
|2|
By Thy clear voice our hearts have all been moved;
For Him, the heav'nly Man, our thoughts are held;
Thy constant care effectual has proved,
And thus in holy haste, by love impelled,
We journey on with Thee -- for Thou art nigh --
And soon shall share with Christ our station high.
|3|
What thanks is due to Thee for guidance true,
And for Thy constant, watchful, tender care!
With tokens of God's love like heav'nly dew
Thou dost refresh our hearts with glories rare;
All that the Son is giv'n dost Thou make known
In faithful love to those He calls "His own."
{448}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 7.7.7.7.8.8.
|1|
Sing aloud to God, our strength!
He has brought us hitherto;
He will bring us home at length,
This the Lord our God will do.
Doubt not, for His word is stable;
Fear not, for His arm is able.
|2|
Sing aloud to God, our strength!
Sing with wonder of His love;
Who can tell its breadth and length,
Who below, or who above?
Who its depth and height can measure?
'Tis a rich unbounded treasure.
|3|
Sing aloud to God, our strength!
He is with us where we go;
Fear we not the journey's length,
Fear we not the mighty foe;
All our foes shall be defeated,
All our journey safe completed.
{449}
G. R. GREEVES, 6.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Glory to God! we sing:
Let all their tribute bring
With one accord!
His only Son He gave
The lost to seek and save,
And raised Him from the grave,
Jesus, our Lord.
|2|
Glory to God! we sing:
Let saints with heaven ring
His praise abroad!
Jesus, who once did die
To God to bring us nigh,
Is crowned as Man on high,
His God our God.
|3|
Glory to God! we cry:
Our tongues would magnify
Jesus our Lord.
O God, what grace is Thine,
Revealed in love divine
By Him! Our hearts enshrine
Our glorious Lord.
{450}
G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest be the God and Father
Of Jesus Christ the Son,
Who chose us for all blessing
Ere time had yet begun;
That we, redeemed, His loved ones,
Might dwell with Him above,
And know the depth and fulness
Of His unbounded love.
|2|
Where all those deep affections,
Which fill the Father's heart,
Shall find their satisfaction,
Their joy to us impart;
There we, Himself surrounding,
Shall "Abba Father!" say,
Within those many mansions,
Prepared for that day.
|3|
E'en whilst we here are waiting
His rest on high to share,
We know our blest relation
As sons before Him there;
And by His Spirit's leading,
We "Abba, Father!" cry;
With ever-growing longing
We seek our place on high.
{451}
J. REVELL (d. 1900), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hark, the solemn strains uprising!
Sweetly swells the note of praise,
From the chamber where the Saviour
Leads His own the voice to raise.
On the night of His rejection
All is darkness, deep'ning gloom,
As the Son of man goes onward
To the cross, to death and tomb.
|2|
Hark, the gentle strains uprising:
Softly swells the note of praise;
All His anguish we remember
As to Him the voice we raise.
All our guilt was laid upon Him --
On God's own beloved Son;
All the waves and billows pouring
O'er His head, He cried, 'Tis done!
|3|
Hark, the gladsome song uprising;
Louder swells the note of praise;
Lord, we hail Thee as the Victor
While to Thee the voice we raise.
Thou whom man cast out, rejected,
Sittest crowned upon God's throne;
Yea, Amen! Thou, Lord, art worthy!
This we gladly, fully own.
|4|
Hark, the mighty song uprising!
Loudly swells the note of praise!
Heav'n and earth shall soon adore Thee,
All to Thee their voices raise.
Thou hast loved us, Thou hast washed us
In Thy blood from every stain;
Raise we then the joyful chorus --
Worthy is the Lamb once slain!
{452}
W. MEYER from German, 7.7.7.7.
|1|
Holy Spirit, Helper nigh,
Sent in love from God on high
Here to dwell with us below,
Thou hast come, and Thee we know.
|2|
Thee we praise, uniting power,
Comforter for every hour;
Leader into truth we see
Meet it is to honour Thee.
|3|
Depths of God by Thee revealed
To His saints whom Thou hast sealed,
Earnest of eternal bliss --
Gladly we give thanks for this.
|4|
Thine anointing, too, we know,
Once the power on Christ below.
Thus, as filled by Thee in grace,
We can take for God our place.
{453}
B. SCHMOLCK (1672-1737) from German, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, to be in Thine own presence
Joy unspeakable will be;
We shall there with hearts exulting
Offer endless praise to Thee.
|2|
Every eye shall then behold Thee,
Gaze upon Thee as Thou art;
Every heart, in love delighting,
Shall fulfil its glorious part.
|3|
Every ear Thine accents hearing,
Which have quickened us below;
Every mouth Thy glory telling,
Filled by Thee, Thy praise to show.
|4|
Blessed Saviour, what rejoicing,
What delight we then shall share!
Freed at last to serve unhindered,
Praising Thee for ever there.
|5|
By the Spirit we already
Taste of love divine below;
At Thy feet we praise and worship --
Love ineffable we know.
{454}
L. H. RAILTON, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Father, Thy sons adore Thee,
For Thou our hearts hast won.
What joy to be before Thee
Accepted in Thy Son!
|2|
For sonship through Christ Jesus
By Thee marked out before:
What grace abounds toward us!
We worship and adore.
|3|
According to Thy pleasure,
Before Thee without fear,
A love which knows no measure
Doth rest upon us here.
|4|
Blest Spirit of adoption,
With us and in us here,
To Thee be praise and glory,
Through Christ by Thee brought near.
|5|
Thus, Father, now we worship
And praise adoringly;
To Thee be honour, glory,
Now and eternally.
{455}
I WATTS, S.M.
|1|
Not all the blood of beasts,
On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away its stain.
|2|
Thou, Christ, the spotless Lamb,
Didst take our guilt away,
A Sacrifice of nobler name
And richer blood than they.
|3|
Our souls look back to see
The burden Thou didst bear,
When hanging on th' accused tree
For all our guilt was there.
|4|
Believing, we rejoice
To see the curse remove;
And bless Thee, Lord, with cheerful voice,
And sing redeeming love.
{456}
W R MASON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest Spirit of the Father,
Thou in the inner man
Dost strengthen us with power,
The realms of bliss to scan;
To know Christ's love which passes
The range of human ken:
Be filled to all God's fulness --
What blessedness for men!
|2|
O Spirit of adoption,
To sonship's joyful cry
By Thee we give expression,
God's heart to gratify.
Through Christ by Thee we've access
Unto the Father nigh;
We worship in this nearness,
And "Abba, Father!" cry.
{457}
J. W. PARRY, L.M.
|1|
O God, our hearts are filled with joy,
And richest praise our lips employ,
As we anticipate the hour
When Thou wilt manifest Thy power --
|2|
When heav'n and earth shall pass away,
Ended for ever death's dark sway;
And Thou wilt then make all things new,
New heav'n and earth bring into view --
|3|
When Thou shalt wipe away all tears,
Banish all sorrow, pain and fears:
With rapture then each heart will swell,
When Thou Thyself with men shalt dwell.
|4|
Thy tabernacle then shall be
The centre blest, and all will see
Thy glory, love without recall,
And Thou, O God, be all in all!
{458}
MISS K M BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 6.6.8.4.6.6.8.4.
|1|
The Father sent the Son
A ruined world to save;
Man meted to the sinless One
The cross -- the grave.
Blest Substitute from God,
Wrath's awful cup He drained;
Laid down His life, and e'en the tomb's
Reproach sustained.
|2|
Earth shuddered as He died,
God's well-beloved Son;
The darkness sought His woes to hide;
His work is done.
He lives to die no more,
Joy dwells upon His brow;
His agonies untold are o'er,
He triumphs now!
|3|
The new and living way
Stands open now to heav'n;
Thence where the blood is seen alway,
God's gift is giv'n.
The river of His grace,
Through righteousness supplied,
Is flowing o'er the barren place
Where Jesus died.
|4|
The Lord shall come again;
The Conqueror must reign.
No tongue but shall confess Him then,
The Lamb once slain.
Jesus is worthy now
All homage to receive;
Worthy that all to Him should bow,
The truth believe.
{459}
J. PELLATT, L.M.
|1|
Into Thy presence, Lord, we come,
And sit in stillness at Thy feet
To hear Thy word, so pure, so sweet,
And find in Thee our spirits' home:
|2|
By faith e'en now to see Thy face,
And hear Thy words of light and love --
Thy witness of the things above --
The substance, Thou, of truth and grace.
|3|
Thus to retire from all around,
And in Thy holy presence be,
Thy beauty, Lord, alone to see,
Thy blessed voice the only sound.
|4|
For to our feeble path down here,
In love Thou dost delight to come;
Responsive love gives Thee a home,
Despised without, but welcomed there!
{460}
J. N. GRACE, L.M.
|1|
Thy death and resurrection, Lord,
(How faith rejoices in the word!)
Have met the charge that on us lay,
And taken all death's sting away.
|2|
Soon all the saints who through Thee sleep,
Th' appointment in the air will keep,
When, rising from Thy Father's throne,
Thou comest forth to claim Thine own.
|3|
Thy voice the realm of death shall burst,
The dead in Christ arising first;
And, in a moment, we who live
The Spirit's quick'ning change receive.
|4|
Together then, the church will be
Complete in one vast company!
Caught up to meet Thee, blessed Lord,
Where Thou shalt ever be adored.
|5|
And now in faith and hope and love,
We wait to greet Thee from above;
Each heart sustained in power and grace,
Until we see Thee face to face.
{461}
W. COWPER (1731-1800), C.M.
|1|
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.
|2|
Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill,
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.
|3|
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.
|4|
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.
|5|
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
And he will make it plain.
{462}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), L.M.
|1|
Ours is a pardon bought with blood,
Amazing truth! the blood of One
Who, without usurpation, could
Lay claim to heav'n's eternal throne!
|2|
No victim of inferior worth
Could bear the stroke that justice aimed;
For none but He, in heav'n or earth,
Could offer that which justice claimed.
|3|
But He, the Lord of glory, came;
Upon the cross He bowed His head;
He suffered pain, He suffered shame,
And lay a prisoner with the dead.
|4|
But lo! He's risen from the grave,
And bears the greatest, noblest Name:
The Lord -- almighty now to save
From sin, from death, from endless shame.
{463}
H. S. T. BULLOCK, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Love's remembrance, Lord, Thou seekest
From Thine own assembled thus;
In the bread we break Thou speakest
Of Thy body giv'n for us:
|2|
Holy vessel of God's pleasure
In His service day by day;
Nothing but His will Thy measure
All along that suff'ring way.
|3|
Lord, we drink the cup of blessing,
The communion of Thy blood,
Thus as one our love confessing
For Thyself, blest Son of God.
{464}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thy Name must live, whatever names may die;
It must fill all the earth, as heav'n on high.
Jesus! Thy Name by all shall yet be known,
All kings and nations shall Thy greatness own.
|2|
Thou livest, Saviour, and all grace is there,
That with such beauty shone in Thee down here;
No trait is lost, each beauteous grace we see,
All brought through death to shine eternally.
|3|
Our joy is full -- we have Thee, Jesus, still;
The glory bright Thy precious Name doth fill;
What holds Thy people now while here on earth
Is what Thou art in all Thy wondrous worth.
{465}
A. ALLAN, 8.7.8.7.8.7.7.
|1|
O blessed Comforter, whose power
And presence now are with us,
Assuring to us in this hour
Our link with Christ most glorious:
Thou springing Well of endless joy --
Response to Thee is rendered,
And homage now is tendered.
|2|
Blest God our Father, Thee we praise,
Source of unending blessing;
Our voices now as one we raise,
Thy glorious Name confessing.
Garbed in the dignity of sons,
We worship and adore Thee,
As now in Christ before Thee.
{466}
E. H. CHATER, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
"'Tis finished!" our blest Saviour said,
And meekly bowed His blessed head,
Poured out His soul, and died.
The veil by God was rent in twain,
And He who died now lives again:
Sound the glad message wide!
|2|
"'Tis finished!" Love unfathomed flows
In that blest word. No angel knows
Such solace for the soul.
Love far beyond all angel ken,
The work of Christ in love for men,
Which makes the sin-sick whole.
|3|
"'Tis finished!" Joyous let us sing;
No other hand need aught to bring,
'Tis finished every whit.
God's righteousness is now revealed;
Believers, by the Spirit sealed,
Are thus for Him made fit.
{467}
C. M. MENZIES, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
Our God, from Thee in love divine
Greatness and power and glory shine,
Splendour and majesty!
Head over all, Thy Name we praise,
With willing hearts our voices raise,
And worship give to Thee.
|2|
In spirit and in truth we sing;
To Thee, O God, our worship bring,
Holy and without blame.
And, in the shining of Thy face,
We know in Christ our joyous place,
And glory in Thy Name.
|3|
The city shines with precious light,
As bride adorned in glory bright,
All fair in every trait;
Eternity is now in view,
And Thou, who makest all things new,
Canst all in love survey.
{468}
H SATTLER From German, 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
Father of glory, our songs we are raising;
Such is Thy love, and so blessedly shown!
We are united in heart and in praising;
High we extol Thee, Thy glory we own.
|2|
Him Thou hast given -- unspeakable giving,
Father of glory -- the Son of Thy love!
Glorious answer -- response of the living --
Sons ever with Thee, O Father, above.
|3|
Yea, He has told us the wonderful secrets,
Father of glory, once hidden from man;
Fully revealed now to us by Thy Spirit,
All Thou desiredst -- eternity's plan!
|4|
Father of glory, we bow and adore Thee!
Restful our hearts as we wondering gaze.
O with what joy shall we offer before Thee
In the repose of Thy glory, our praise!
{469}
J. K. POLLOCK, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
It is to Thee our voices now we raise,
Blest Spirit of adoption; Thee we praise,
As, in the light of sonship's glorious place,
We serve by Thee before the Father's face.
|2|
Thy blessed, holy Person be adored
By those whose hearts respond with one accord;
For Thou hast served that we, through boundless grace,
Might know with Christ a son's eternal place.
|3|
Access by Thee, through Christ, in that blest sphere --
We know and prove the love which casts out fear;
And, restful in God's grace as now brought nigh,
We joy with Thee, and "Abba, Father!" cry.
{470}
W. P. SMITH, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O wondrous thought, that Thou, blest Lord, shouldst have
An object suited to Thy manhood's state!
A helpmate, like Thee, builded by Thy God,
One flesh -- O Lord, the mystery how great!
|2|
We gladly praise Thee, Spirit of our God,
Who hast secured for Him Thou know'st so well
A wife, adorned and now to Him brought nigh --
Joy of His heart -- the bliss, what tongue can tell!
|3|
Lord Jesus, true responses now we give
To Thee, whose deep affections stir our heart;
Soon we shall share Thy headship by Thy side,
But now in holy union know our part.
{471}
MRS. C. A. MARKHAM, 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
Our God and Father, we are here to share
Interests divine;
True is our love and genuine our care
For what is Thine,
As moved by Christ's own feelings in our heart,
We long to bear with priestly hands our part.
|2|
The sanctity of Thine abode on earth
Our hearts would guard,
That by unholy ways its holy worth
May not be marred.
The couch of Solomon we would surround
With valiant love and reverence profound.
|3|
Blest Spirit, who art here in charge of all
God's interests great,
On Thee, our Paraclete, we humbly call
As here we wait.
Hold us in faith, in dignity and power,
Throughout this privileged and sacred hour.
{472}
I. FLEMING, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Jesus, Lord, we joy before Thee,
Sorrow's night is o'er;
Foes are vanquished, Thou art Victor
Evermore.
|2|
All the way Thy love has trodden
We with gladness trace,
All Thy faithfulness and meekness,
All Thy grace.
|3|
To Thy Father's will obedient,
Thou to death hast been;
Righteousness and peace embracing
There are seen.
|4|
'Tis as risen, Lord, we hail Thee --
Shadows passed away;
Love has triumphed, Thou hast made us
Thine for aye.
|5|
Joy we thus in thee, Lord Jesus,
Gladly praising Thee;
Thine the triumph, Thine the glory
Ever be!
{473}
R. ARRAS from German, 14.14.4.7.8.
|1|
Jesus, our Lord, on the throne of the Father Thou'rt crowned;
Thou once on Calvary suff'redst, of man the disowned;
Worthy art Thou!
Glory encircles Thy brow,
Once the despised, now enthroned!
|2|
We Thy beloved, assembled, remember Thy dying;
Unto Thy death, blessed Lord, our full hearts are replying;
Thou hast loved us --
Jesus, who gav'st Thyself thus!
We on Thy love are relying.
|3|
Here upon earth, till Thy coming, Thy death we are showing;
But unto Thee in the glory our hearts are outgoing;
To Thee above,
Centre of glory and love,
Gladly our worship is flowing.
{474}
F. D. WATERFALL, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, the joy on union,
And Thine embrace, call forth
Our full appreciation
Of Thy surpassing worth.
|2|
Thy wife, with Thee in nearness,
Adds lustre to the scene
Where all Thy power and greatness
In headship's place are seen.
|3|
Th' assembly, Lord, Thy body,
As joined to Thee above,
Responds with deep affection --
At rest in Thy great love.
|4|
Thus in this blest relation,
With one harmonious strain
We join with adoration,
Thy praises to proclaim.
{475}
H. WREFORD, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Wilt Thou come, or wilt thou linger?
'Tis the Saviour calls;
Death and darkness are around thee;
Sin enthralls.
|2|
Thou may'st come; the vilest sinner
May in Christ confide.
Thou art welcome, for to save thee
Jesus died.
|3|
See the blood, and hear Him speaking
Of redemption done;
And on glory's heights behold Him,
God's own Son.
|4|
Hear Him speak the word of pardon;
Trust in Him who died;
And thy heart shall lose its burden,
By His side.
{476}
E. L. BEVIR, C.M.
|1|
Where glory lights the courts on high,
With highest glory crowned,
Thee, Lord of power and majesty,
Celestial hosts surround.
|2|
O who shall sing that path of worth,
That led up to the throne?
The Corn of Wheat upon this earth
Could but abide alone;
|3|
But Thou art risen from the dead,
And we, as one with Thee,
Now sing Thy Name, our Lord, our Head,
A heav'nly company.
|4|
Lord Jesus, Thou art waiting yet
Till, perfect at Thy side,
Thy blest companion shall be set,
Thy fair and spotless bride.
{477}
E. CARREN from Swedish, 8.7.8.7.7.7.
|1|
O our God, how great, unmeasured
Is Thy love divine and blest!
We its holy depths have treasured,
As in Christ Thy Son expressed.
Thee we worship from our heart,
Praising Thee for what Thou art.
|2|
From the far eternal reaches,
Through the depths Thy way has led,
Every step fresh glory teaches,
And with love is overspread.
For Thy Son who was "the Way"
We shall worship Thee for aye!
|3|
Now, O God, our hearts are bowing,
And with joy anticipate
The eternal music flowing
In that world surpassing great.
Praise and worship spread abroad
Soon shall fill the day of God.
{478}
N. B. STEWART, C.M.
|1|
Jesus, our Lord, the mighty power
Of Thy surpassing love
Has brought us to this holy hour,
When we its sweetness prove.
|2|
Thy church in Thine embrace shall be
Wholly for Thee, her Head;
Yielded in blest response is she,
Moving where Thou dost lead.
|3|
Thou dost fill all in this blest sphere
Where we are at Thy side;
With Thee, Thy fulness, brought so near,
Thy body and Thy bride.
|4|
And O how blest! that place above
Th' assembly shares with Thee,
As purposed in the Father's love
His joy and Thine to be.
{479}
MISS F. J. ELWOOD, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
The bread and cup, O Lord, recall
that sacrifice supreme, when all
The floods their voice did raise;
Their holy import we discern,
Thy suff'ring love afresh would learn,
Proved on that day of days.
|2|
All question of our moral stain
Thou didst resolve when Thou didst drain
That cup of bitt'rest woe:
So surely, that our hearts are free
To lose themselves adoringly
In love's eternal flow.
|3|
Borne in Thy heart through death's dark tide
(The travail Thine), with Thee we died,
In Thee we rise on high;
With hearts now filled with glory's light,
We tread our path through earth's dark night,
Where Thou our Lord didst die.
{480}
E L BEVIR (1847-1922), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God and Father, may our souls repose
In the deep sense of Thine unfailing love!
Kept by Thy peace, in Him who died and rose,
Till we are gathered to Thy rest above.
|2|
There shall we know as known, in Thine own rest;
No cloud or shadow in that scene so bright,
Where glory dwells and all, supremely blest,
Find in Thyself unchanging fresh delight.
