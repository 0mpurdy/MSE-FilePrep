OUR OUTLOOK IN CLOSING DAYS
A. J. Gardiner
@2 Timothy 4: 6 - 11; @Ephesians 3: 8 - 21; @Philippians 3: 12 - 14
In reading this passage in Ephesians what I had in mind was to point out that, as nearing the end of his course, Paul tells us that he is concerned about the mystery and about enlightening all as to it, and then moreover, having said that, he tells us how he prays in relation to it. We were hearing last night of Daniel as a praying man, and the importance and value of prayer, but here in this passage Paul comes before us as showing us how earnestly he prays.
But before that he speaks to us about the mystery, and the grace given to him to announce among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things. "That now", he says, "to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God". Earlier in the chapter he tells us that he desired that the Ephesians might know his intelligence in the mystery; that is, he would have us understand that he, at any rate, had intelligence in the mystery, which, he says, "in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the power of the Spirit" (verse 5). It is now revealed, and Paul, at any rate, had remarkable
{2}
intelligence as to it, intending to convey that there is no reason why we should not increase in under-standing as to the mystery.
I do not say that we are likely to have Paul's intelligence of it, but at the same time he wanted them to know the intelligence that he had, in order to show that it is not beyond the range of the saints. Indeed, he was concerned to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery, and that we might have our eyes opened to see what there is on earth in the assembly, through which principalities and powers in the heavenlies even now are learning the all-various wisdom of God, for, beloved brethren, it is God's masterpiece, the assembly. I am not speaking now of it abstractly or theoretically, but I am speaking of it as that which has concrete existence at this present time, and we ourselves are part of it.
There is here on earth (and I say again, we ourselves are part of it), that which is God's masterpiece in wisdom and love, a company drawn out from the nations, knit together, bound together in the power of the Holy Spirit in love amongst ourselves, and united in affection towards Christ in glory, and held in relation to Christ, so that He can speak of it, as He does, as "my assembly". Whatever Satan may do contrary to the truth, there is that here as held under the influence of Christ, and deriving wisdom from Him in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, which Satan cannot overcome.
{3}
That is a great thing, beloved brethren, that there is a sphere here in which what is of God is maintained in living expression, and it is to be seen in various parts of the world, and in it the service of God is maintained in a unified way and in spiritual power. Love amongst ourselves is seen there, and whatever Satan brings in, God turns it all to account to further this wonderful interest of His, which He has here on earth. The war [1939 - 1945] and all the ravages of it, so to speak, all the testings of it, have just brought to light love amongst the saints in a universal way. And it has resulted in the saints being enlarged in their apprehension of this great vessel that God has here on earth, and the links in the divine nature which bind us together have been strengthened and become more real.
God has used all the moral confusion in the world, brought in by the lawlessness of man, with Satan behind it, to further this great interest of His here on earth. Whatever has happened, Satan has not been able to interfere with the service of God, but through all the testings the service of God has been enriched. The saints are being delivered from earthly-mindedness and from having their interest in things here, and heavenly things and spiritual things are becoming more and more real as a consequence. You can understand how angels are taking account of what is going on. They are learning in it "the all-various wisdom of God". You might say, dear brethren, 'Well, it looks as though Satan is having it all his own way in the world', but it is not so. God is
{4}
using everything and turning everything to account to further this great interest of His on earth, the assembly which He is forming, and He is bringing it increasingly into view and making it more real to us all ...
After the apostle has spoken about this, and note, he was in a prison, though the conditions may not have been quite so rigorous when he wrote the epistle to the Ephesians as they were when he wrote the second epistle to Timothy, but he tells us he was a prisoner; in those conditions he was not praying to the Lord to take him to Himself or to release him from prison. He is engaged with the saints, and the ministry of the assembly committed to him, and wanting to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery; that is, how it works, and the present importance of it, that principalities and powers in the heavenlies are learning in it the all-various wisdom of God. Surely, dear brethren, it is for us to have the assembly before us.
Having said all that, Paul tells us that he bows his knees. Why does he say that? Is it not that we should bow our knees? Is it not that we should understand that however much is ministered to us, if we really want to get an impression of the mystery, what the assembly is to Christ, and what it is to God, it is a question of getting down on our knees, of bowing our knees? That is to say, it is a matter of real exercise. One is reminded of the incident regarding Othniel and Achsah, Caleb's daughter. Achsah is a type of the assembly, and Caleb says,
{5}
"He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife" (@Joshua 15: 16). That is to say, he is really presenting the assembly in her attractiveness. And Othniel goes and smites Kirjath-sepher, the city of the book, and overcomes it. That is, we are not to suppose that we can get into the truth of the assembly merely by reading books. Read the ministry by all means, beloved brethren. If the Lord is giving ministry to the assembly, we ought to be diligent to follow it up. Thank God for the ministry, for the books in which it is recorded and made available to us, but let us not think we shall get into it merely by reading books.
And so Othniel had to overcome the city of the book. He moved in energy because he wanted to have Achsah, and if we want to have the assembly, so to speak, and the assembly as the wife, what she is to Christ, it is a question not simply of reading books, although we may get help as to the mind of God by reading books, but what is necessary is that there should be the energy of the Spirit, for Othniel no doubt represents one in the energy of the Spirit, to apprehend the truth, and if the energy of the Spirit is to come into evidence, what goes with it is that we should be marked by prayer. This thought of prayer is amplified in the incident. You remember that Othniel took Kirjath-sepher, and Caleb gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. But then she urges him to ask of her father a field. It is a question now of the influence that she exerts upon Othniel to ask of her father. That is what Paul was doing, he was asking
{6}
of the Father. He said, "I bow my knees to the Father". The assembly was so great in his mind that it urged him, so to speak, to get on his knees to the Father. Typically, that is what Achsah does; she urges Othniel to ask of her father. Then it says, "she sprang down from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou? And she said, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. Then he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs".
Some of us have been together these last three days, and I think we have had a taste of the southern land which God has given us, a good land indeed. But now what is needed, beloved brethren, are the upper and the nether springs. It is a question of the power of the Spirit operating in us both in relation to heavenly things and also in relation, you might say, to the responsible life here, because if we are not maintained fulfilling righteousness in the responsible life here, we shall not be able to rise to the spiritual level that God has in mind for us.
So Paul tells us that he bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, "of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts". I know nothing more encouraging than this, beloved brethren, nothing more stimulating than that we should give ourselves to praying to the Father in relation to this great
{7}
matter of the assembly and our apprehending it in a real way. That the Father "may give you ... to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man". It is the Father's Spirit. The Father is the Originator of these great thoughts of divine love, and in them, Christ Himself is the Centre. And the Father in devising the assembly has been considering for Christ, providing something for the affections of Christ. The more you think of it the more you see how everything dove-tails together in wonderful wisdom, but the Father is the Source of all, the One who has conceived it, and it is the Father's Spirit which strengthens us with might in the inner man.
The Father's Spirit will give us something of the Father's thoughts, and the Father's feelings in regard to Christ, and the Father's intentions in relation to Christ in giving Him the assembly, and will give us to understand the portion that the assembly with Christ is to fill out in the whole range of glory of which the Father is the Source. It says that every family in the heavens and on earth is named of the Father. What an immensity of glory, of which the Father is the Source, lies before us! And we are nearing the actuality of it. We are to get an impression of the immensity of it, "the breadth and length and depth and height". The Spirit of God uses these words to convey that there is an immense range that we are to take up, that we are to enter upon. We are in the very centre of it, dear brethren, because we belong to Christ. Christ is the Centre of it, and the assembly is with Him, in the very centre
{8}
of it. The assembly has the foremost place with Christ. Wonderful thing!
And so the apostle prays that "the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts". As He dwells in our hearts, the true wifely features proper to the assembly will develop at the present time: faithfulness as to His interests and consideration for His tastes. There is plenty to do, dear brethren, at the present time. @Proverbs 31 shows us how much there is to do, how the assembly is to be marked by activity that is the result of her wifely affections for Christ, as the outcome of the Christ dwelling in her heart by faith. All these things are open to us. I would beg of you, dear brethren, as I would urge upon myself, not to allow these things to be just abstract thoughts in our minds, but to seek that we might get a greater view in a concrete way of what there is here among the saints. The assembly is to be seen now representatively, and its features, in all that it is for the heart of Christ and for God, are more and more to come into expression.
But then the apostle gives us this wonderful example, he tells us that in the light of these great things, he bows his knees to the Father. There is much wealth in the passage which one could not touch upon now, leading up to that which we so often speak of as to the assembly as the great vessel of praise to God throughout all generations of the age of ages. "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". We are to be concerned as to the service of God
{9}
now. How shall we develop in ability to ascribe glory to God unto all generations of the age of ages, if we do not avail ourselves now of the Holy Spirit, as capable of developing us in spiritual intelligence and affections, so that we might be formed as the vessel of praise?
Just a word now in closing, on the third of Philippians, because there we find Paul also at the close of his course, for he is ready to be offered, or rather as he says in chapter 2, "if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all" (verse 17); showing that he was contemplating martyrdom, and rejoicing in it. He was now drawing near to the close of his history, and what impresses one in relation to Paul in this epistle, is that, wonderful man though he had been, with wonderful gift, and wonderfully devoted in service, and he still was devoted to the saints, as we see from @Ephesians 3, the one thing that was before his heart was that he might win Christ, have Christ as his gain. His one desire was to know Christ better. He speaks of the "excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (chapter 3: 8). It is what a spiritual man has before him at the close of his career; not that he is giving up service, not that he is ceasing to pray for the saints or anything of that sort, but over and above all that, he is commanded by one thought, that he desires to know Christ and to have Him as his gain. And not only that, but he has known that he has been apprehended by Christ Jesus, for a calling on high of
{10}
God in Christ Jesus. He is viewing Christ Jesus, Christ in glory, the Man of God's purpose and good pleasure, and he sees that he, as an individual saint, and so with every individual saint, has been taken up to be found in Christ.
It is a wonderful thing, beloved brethren. If we have it before us, I think it will help us to renounce everything that would attach any kind of importance to us as in the flesh, or minister to self-gratification in any form. The more we get into our souls that we have been apprehended for a calling on high of God in Christ Jesus, Christ Himself where He is is the Pattern of it, the more we shall recognise that the one thing to do is to allow God to go on working in our souls to that end, bringing us increasingly at this present moment into conformity to the One to whom we are shortly to be conformed, even as to our bodily condition. For that is what Paul had before him. He said, "we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself" (verses 20, 21). Christ's body of glory enshrines supreme moral excellence in a Man, and we ourselves are to be found in Him, and our bodies conformed to His body of glory. We have been apprehended for that.
Paul understood that God was using everything in his circumstances to further the work in him of moral conformation to Christ. He would accept everything with that in view. We read from the first
{11}
chapter what the circumstances were; he was in bonds, and that unrighteously. And then certain brethren were seeking to add tribulation to his bonds by preaching Christ out of contention. Think of what that would mean to the spirit of a man like Paul! And now the question was, was he going to be overcome, or how was he going to meet it? He says, "for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 19). He would not allow himself to be overcome by it. He rejoiced that Christ was preached, and as to the circumstances, in the way they affected him, he would accept them and be with God in them, in the spirit of obedience. It is set out in its blessedness in Christ in the second chapter; it has proved itself of such moral excellence in the sight of God, that He has ordained that the One marked by obedience supremely, shall be acknowledged by all, heavenly, earthly, and infernal beings, acknowledged by all as Lord. God is going to exalt publicly the Man in whom obedience was supremely seen, and, beloved brethren, God will use every circumstance in our life, if we are with Him in it, and are in the light of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus, to promote further the features of Christ in us so that we may be found truly answering to our calling.
Paul says, "*I* do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before, I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling
{12}
on high of God in Christ Jesus". "One thing" -- it is a good thing for us to have one thing before us. If we have one thing before us, beloved brethren, we shall make a straight course; and if we allow ourselves to be diverted from the one thing that God would have governing us, we shall not make a straight course. What a day it will be, when suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye, we find ourselves absolutely and for ever with Christ. Not a trace left of what we have been, not a trace left of the flesh, nor of the poor, frail, mortal conditions that we are in at the moment; and yet it will be ourselves, in the full result of the work of God in us. What more is there to be desired? What glory to have it before us! The apostle would urge us, so to speak, by his own example. He is ranging himself alongside of us as one of the brethren and he tells us what is before him. And if that was before a spiritual man like Paul, as he was nearing the end of his day, we, as conscious that we are nearing the end of our history here, may well have it before us also.
Well, that was what I had in mind, dear brethren, that what was governing the mind of Paul as he neared the end of his course, might be found governing us also.
May the Lord grant it for His Name's sake.

GENUINENESS
K. E. de Casseres
@1 Kings 3: 16 - 28; @Acts 4: 36, 37; @Acts 5: 1 - 6, 11 - 14; @Ruth 1: 14 - 22; @2 Timothy 4: 3 - 11
I would like to speak a little about the feature of genuineness. We are living in the last phase of the assembly's history. The Lord's word to Laodicea was, "thou sayest, I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing", but the Lord's assessment of that assembly was "thou ... knowest not that *thou* art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (@Revelation 3: 15 - 17) -- such unreality marks some in the public profession in Christendom, but over against that there are those, thank God, that are genuine, and it is of that feature that I now wish to speak. So I want to refer briefly to these passages which speak of: a woman who was marked by genuine motherly feeling; Barnabas, as a "Son of consolation"; Naomi and Ruth; and Paul and Timothy.
The incident in @1 Kings 3 would appear to have happened shortly after Solomon came to the throne. God had appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, "Ask what I shall give thee". Solomon said, "I am but a little child ... Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to discern between good and bad" (verses 5 - 9). God was pleased with his request and said, "I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart" (verse 12) -- the spirit of judgment. In @Isaiah 28 it says, "In that day will Jehovah of hosts be ... for a spirit of judgment to him who sitteth in judgment"
{14}
(verses 5, 6), and here it was seen with Solomon.
These two women came before Solomon at the beginning of his reign. They were harlots, but there was a problem which had to be faced and it required judgment, and they appeared before the king. Both these women claimed to be the mother of the living child, and clearly one of them was not speaking the truth. What impresses me as I read this account is how patiently Solomon listened to them. He listened to both of them as they stated their case, and he did not interrupt them, and then he sums it up: "The one says, This that is living is my son, and thy son is the dead", and the other says the opposite. Up to that point the king did not pronounce any judgment, but then he says, "Bring me a sword".
What a scene it was: these two women, the living child, the king and the sword, and what is going to be done? It is in the presence of the sword that the true features of the mother come out when Solomon says, in wisdom given of God, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other". That word served to bring out true maternal feelings, so that one woman immediately says, "Ah, my lord! give her the living child, and in no wise put it to death". True maternal feelings, genuine maternal feelings are there, but the other woman says, "Let it be neither mine nor thine; divide it". How coldly and callously that woman spoke about division. Solomon then forms a judgment in the presence of what they have said.
The Lord Jesus said, "by thy words thou shalt be
{15}
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned" (@Matthew 12: 37). One woman was justified by her words, the other was condemned by her words. What a difference there was in the spirit of these two women: one had genuine motherly feelings, the other was hard and callous. A person's spirit is often a very good indicator of where he is in his soul, in his links with God. It says, "Man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the inner parts of the belly" (@Proverbs 20: 27), and how it searched out these two women and brought to light in the one what was genuine and in the other what was false.
So Solomon pronounces his judgment: "Give this one the living child, and in no wise put it to death: she is its mother". Wisdom, discernment and power are qualities that we need, dear brethren, and they are seen supremely in Christ, of course. Perfection of wisdom is in Him as the true Solomon, and discernment, power and authority are vested in Christ. In each local assembly may those features be found, and be made use of because of the presence of the Spirit in the assembly. The Lord said, "Judge not according to sight, but judge righteous judgment" (@John 7: 24), and that is what Solomon did. It was a righteous judgment, and his judgment as pronounced should leave no shadow of doubt in any one's mind as to who was the true mother.
Wisdom, discernment and power were seen in Solomon, and what a word it is to us, dear brethren, that these features of right discernment and right spiritual judgment should be operating at the present
{16}
time. "And all Israel ... saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice". This matter brought out something that was for the glory of God.
In the scripture in @Acts 4 we read of Barnabas. It says, "who ... being possessed of land, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles". He had "been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation)". He was not seeking a name for himself, but the apostles gave him that name. Another has said, He sold his earthly possessions in order that he might gain an inheritance in the walled city (@Leviticus 25: 29 - 34).
The features that marked Barnabas in the early references to him in the Acts are very fine. There is this first reference and then there is a reference to him later, in chapter 11, when he was sent to Antioch, "who ... seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord; for he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" (verses 23, 24). Then he went to seek out Saul and "brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd" (verse 26). Later, in Antioch, "the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" (@Acts 13: 2). What genuineness marked Barnabas, a son of consolation. Would we not each like to be a comfort to the brethren, not seeking a place, or a name for oneself in any sense, but each able to be taken
{17}
account of as one who would be a comfort to the saints at the present time?
But, in contrast to that, "Ananias ... with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, and put aside for himself part of the price ... and having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles" (@Acts 5: 1, 2). He was not obliged to bring any of it, as Peter said, "While it remained did it not remain to *thee*?" (verse 4) -- it was yours, and you could have done what you liked with the money. But what he did was to bring part of the price and pretend it was the whole. There was deceit in that and there was lying. Whatever the motive was, it was impure and Peter discerned it and said, "Why is it that thou has purposed this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God" (verse 4).
What a solemn thing he had done in the presence of God and in the presence of the Holy Spirit! It is a reminder to us that "God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints" (@Psalm 89: 7). While God's standard of holiness is unchanged, this particular incident, as far as we know, has never been repeated exactly in the course of the history of the assembly. Let us remember that the Holy Spirit is here -- we need to be sobered and searched in the presence of God. The positive result that comes out of this after Ananias and Sapphira were buried was, as it says, "And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things ... and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, but of the rest durst no man join them ... and believers were more
{18}
than ever added to the Lord" (verses 11 - 14). That is the positive side: those that were genuine believers were added to the Lord, "multitudes both of men and women". Well, dear brethren, this was in the beginning of the dispensation, in a time of great power. We are not in those days, but nevertheless, as matters that arise are faced in this way the holiness of the house of God will be maintained, and there may be spiritual spoil resulting from it.
In Ruth we read of Naomi coming back out of the fields of Moab as one who had known discipline, a widow woman. She had lost her husband and her two sons, and, as she came back from Moab, what humility marked her. It says in @Jeremiah 48: 29, "We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, -- he is very proud; -- his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart". Such features are not to mark the saints of the assembly. Naomi had been in the land of Moab for many years, but the arrogance of Moab had not, so to speak, rubbed off on her. She came back marked by humility, and her daughter-in-law Ruth with her. Her two daughters-in-law had set out with her from Moab. They both said, "We will certainly return with thee to thy people" (verse 10), but Orpah changed her mind. What comes to light is the committal of Ruth, and the conviction that marked her. We should not be marked by uncertainty, or vacillation. James speaks of "a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways" (@James 1: 8); ministers are not to be "double-tongued" (@1 Timothy 3: 8); and the men of Zebulun kept
{19}
rank "without double heart" (@1 Chronicles 12: 33). There was nothing double with Ruth, but Orpah went back and we do not read any more about her.
What an honoured place Ruth had as going on with Naomi, being marked by true humility, as a Moabitish maiden having no claim to anything, yet coming in on the ground of sovereign mercy, as we too have come in, dear brethren. "An Ammonite or Moabite shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah; even their tenth generation shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah for ever" (@Deuteronomy 23: 3), yet, in sovereign mercy, Ruth is brought in, and had an honoured place, the great-grandmother of David. We have often referred to her language of committal when she speaks to Naomi: "Do not intreat me to leave thee, to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried". That is the language of committal, and may it mark every one of us.
If there is anyone here that is at all uncertain, may this be a word to you at the present time to come in full committal to Christ, and to His people, assured that as coming into the path there will be divine help, protection and reward. So Ruth is marked by committal and conviction, and how greatly she is honoured and blest. It is a fine thing to see a person moving on the line of recovery and it is something that should rejoice our hearts: when they
{20}
came to Bethlehem, it says, "all the city was moved about them". Naomi said, "Call me not Naomi -- call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty". She was empty in her own estimation, and yet she is coming back as having Ruth with her, and what wonderful results flowed out of this. God can work matters out for our blessing and for His glory as we go forward in committal to His interests, and as marked by the spirit of humility that was seen in Naomi and Ruth.
Paul and Timothy were two more persons that were marked by genuineness. In @Acts 20 we see the genuine affection that the Ephesian elders had for Paul. In his last letter (2 Timothy) written to Timothy, "my beloved child" (chapter 1: 2), shortly before he was martyred, Paul is not despondent, though he says, "all who are in Asia ... have turned away from me" (chapter 1: 15). There were still a few that were standing with him in love for Christ, in love for the truth, and in love for what had been committed to Paul as an elect vessel. He speaks about all in Asia turning away from him, and of what would yet come in -- "they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will have turned aside to fables". But over against that he says to Timothy, "But *thou*, be sober in all things, bear evils, do the work of an evangelist, fill up the full measure of thy ministry". The work of an evangelist does not only involve public preaching, but it also involves labouring with individuals, as Paul sets out in @Acts 20:
{21}
teaching "publicly and in every house" (verse 20). Paul is urging Timothy to take that on in the same way, and, he says, "fill up the full measure of thy ministry".
Then Paul speaks to Timothy about his departure: "the time of my release is come". Timothy was urged to continue, though "Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age". "Luke alone is with me", he says, and, "Take Mark, and bring him with thyself" -- another recovered person. We have had Naomi an old sister, so to speak, recovered, now here is a younger man recovered, Mark. What a comfort he would have been to Paul, coming in at the end of Paul's life: "Take Mark, and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry". The Lord is about to come, and Paul's ministry has been recovered to saints, and may we be found among those who value it and hold to it, marked by genuine affection for Christ, having genuine love for the truth and for the saints. That is what marked Paul, and Timothy too -- he cared "with genuine feeling" how the Philippian saints were getting on (@Philippians 2: 20). Well, may we all be encouraged as the days become increasingly dark and difficult, that the feature of genuineness may mark us as we await the coming of the Lord, for His Name's sake.

TYPES OF THE CHURCH -- REBECCA
M. W. Biggs
@Genesis 24
How very wonderful it is that, before actually going to be with the Lord where He is, the Holy Spirit enables the believer to take that journey spiritually.
Abraham's unnamed servant, as we have seen, is a type of the Holy Spirit, who has come to earth to bring to light the church and to conduct her to Christ where He now is as risen from the dead. In one sense, His service in this respect will not be completed until the church is actually with Christ. The typical teaching of @Genesis 24, however, is not so much to depict the final destiny of the church with Christ in glory, as to show us how the church may now be for the comfort of Christ during the time Israel is dead, as it were, and no longer recognised as God's people. The fact that Isaac took Rebecca into his mother Sarah's tent, would illustrate this. And the journey that Rebecca took is illustrative of that which we may now take in affection, as led by the Holy Spirit, from what is natural and earthly to what is spiritual and heavenly -- indeed, a journey *to Christ where He is*.
It was a test when the question, "Wilt thou go with this man?" was put to Rebecca. There were those who would have detained her at least ten days. But love would allow of no delay. Those ten days would have meant everything; and the servant urges his master's claim. How strong the appeal is which is made for earthly and natural things! Let us stay
{23}
ten days at least. There must be something else in our lives than Christ and spiritual things. 'We must not be too extreme', it is said. But is it so? *Must* there be something else than Christ only? What a moment for our souls when this question is definitely and fairly faced. Has Christ so come before our hearts that we are glad to go the Spirit's way? or, are earthly and natural things practically keeping us from taking this journey of heart, and so preventing our being for the pleasure of Christ? Rebecca's reply was beautiful: "I will go"!
What an education to His disciples the Lord's ministry must have been during the forty days after He rose from the dead. How it must have transferred their interests from earth to heaven, and eventually even from Jerusalem and the best of what was natural, to Himself as risen. It is instructive to trace in the Acts how the interests of the assembly were transferred from earth to heaven. This did not immediately take place. God allowed things to overlap in His ways on earth. But gradually the Spirit's energies exhibited themselves, and the proper heavenly character of the assembly came to light.
It was from heaven, where Jesus had gone, that the "violent impetuous blowing" came (@Acts 2: 2). It was to Stephen, a man full of the Holy Spirit, that the *heavens* were opened (chapter 7: 56). God then allowed a persecution and the earthly circumstances of the saints were broken up.
Then we read of the Ethiopian (chapter 8: 26 - 40),
{24}
who, returning from Jerusalem, read the passage in Isaiah telling us that Jesus¬ life had been taken from the earth. And the Ethiopian suggested that he should be baptised, taking up this new position. How could he live where Jesus had died? After this, Saul is converted. There is a light from *heaven* (chapter 9: 3), and Jesus speaks from thence. Then Peter in a vision sees the vessel like a sheet let down from *heaven* and taken up there again (chapter 10). All these details illustrate the servant taking Rebecca and going his way, typical of the Holy Spirit leading the church to her "Isaac" -- Christ risen and in heaven. And that journey taken in the beginning of the church's history has again and again to be taken. It has to be taken by every one who is experimentally to reach Christ as risen.
"I will go". What a joy to the servant. Have you ever faced this question, dear reader? Have you allowed the Holy Spirit to take you *His* way?
To follow a Christ rejected by the world and to be true to the fellowship proper to His own here, is indeed of importance. To see that the world and Christ have nothing in common is an immense point.
Happy, too, to care for those who are Christ's here. But to take our journey to our "Isaac", Christ risen, and in our affection *join Him in heaven*, is something more than taking the path of rejection and fellowship and caring for the Lord's people here, though happy indeed is such a path.
Barzillai (@2 Samuel 17: 27 - 29; @2 Samuel 19: 31 - 40) is a forceful illustration of the difference. Barzillai had
{25}
been faithful to David and succoured his followers in the days of his rejection by Absalom. But he failed to go over with David to Jerusalem. He was not up to it.
The enjoyment of a nice meeting, service in the gospel and visiting among the saints, may yet leave us lingering in what is merely outward, and in circumstances only earthly. A nice meeting may be something merely earthly as much as the temple, or a Jewish farm. Have we not heard of believers who, when they had to move from one district to another, or perhaps have part in forming a new assembly in a place, felt as if their very life was being taken from them? Where did they live? 'I have been in that meeting thirty years', says another. Have you lived in the outward circumstances of the meeting? Where is Christ? Have you never taken this journey to a heavenly Christ? Have we but found a new set of earthly circumstances in our 'nice meeting' and failed to be a comfort to Christ through not allowing the Spirit to take us His way? Have we said, "I will go"?
But should we not feel these things? Is not a break-up a sorrow? Most surely. Our discipline would not be such were we not to feel it. Did the Lord chide Mary as she wept in @John 11? Indeed, He wept too! Oh! how wondrous His ways. But the circumstances of @John 11 were all part of that education which was necessary so that Mary might reach Him who is "the resurrection and the life" (verse 25) and know the inestimable joy of the Lord's company
{26}
in @John 12. There are no tears in @John 12. How easy it is in our souls¬ history to come short of this experience and hence fail rightly to occupy the real spiritual ground of the assembly.
The two who journeyed to Emmaus learned something of this lesson. How real the cross was to them! The Lord's supper should make us feel as if the Lord had only just died. It is not merely an historical remembrance of something which took place nineteen hundred years ago. No, His death and His love are *present*. The whole thing is *fresh* before our hearts. Nor is this all. He has made *Himself* known to us. As He did to the two in their home in Emmaus, He vanished and left them. It was a natural circle and they must know Him in *His* circle, not theirs. It changed everything to them. They found Him again in His circle. What an experience to have the heart taken by the Spirit and conducted into the presence of a risen Christ. He died for us that we should live with Him. Think of living with Christ even now! Being dead we have been made to live together with Him (@Colossians 2: 13). The servant took Rebecca and went *his* way.
It is interesting to notice that Isaac is at once brought before us. The journey is not dwelt upon. The Holy Spirit would immediately bring us into the presence of Christ. "That is my master!"; a man full of the Spirit is very near a risen Christ.
Rebecca with suited grace now veils herself. We are to be exclusively for Christ. It is only as covered, or veiled, that we can suitably enter the assembly (@1 Corinthians 11).
{27}
And since we are to be for Christ we wish to be seen by no other. How exclusive the heart becomes -- exclusive in a right sense -- when it learns, as in the language of the Song of Solomon, "I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me" (chapter 7: 10). We would not seek to acquire the style or wisdom of the world if we have seen a risen Christ. "Not according to Christ" settles everything (@Colossians 2: 8). All but Christ is the "reproach of Egypt" (@Joshua 5: 9). *One trait of the world is a shame to us*!
"And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and ... Isaac was comforted". This very plainly shows that the type sets forth the present place of the assembly. Israel, at present, yields no joy to Christ. The church is given to occupy Israel's place, only in a more blessed way, and is for the comfort of Christ. But how shall we practically reach this? Only as our hearts respond and say, "I will go", and allow the Holy Spirit to take us *His* way.

DEPARTURE AND RECOVERY
J. Pellatt
@Revelation 2: 1 - 7; @Revelation 3: 7 - 13
I think in the message to the church at Ephesus we have marked out by the Lord Himself the point of departure, and in the message to Philadelphia we have on the part of the Lord the recognition of the point of recovery, and these are the two thoughts I desire to bring before you on this occasion. It is an
{28}
immense thing to have the expressed judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is no need for any of us to be in any uncertainty with regard to His judgment upon matters at the present time. I do not mean matters pertaining to our responsible life here or to our circumstances, or to ourselves, but matters pertaining to His glory, to that which is in relationship to Himself; that which is the delight and satisfaction of His own heart.
One feels very much at the present time the need of grace from the Lord to rise above every form of selfishness. We are blocked up and hindered by selfishness, perhaps to a greater extent than we are aware of. I do not mean common selfishness with regard to our own things, but selfishness in regard to the Lord's things; we are much hindered in this way. We need to be delivered from this kind of selfishness, so that apart from every thought of ourselves we might be able to look at things in the light of the Lord, in the light of the relationship of the assembly to the Lord and what is really involved in that relationship.
In the first place I want to bring before you the point of departure. I am not speaking of that which is merely individual. I am speaking concerning Christ and the assembly. Our attention has been called of late to the distinction between the primary thoughts of God, and those thoughts of God which have been brought before us consequent upon the entrance of sin -- the presence of sin in the world, and I would like to say that the relationship of the assembly to
{29}
Christ belongs to the primary thoughts of God. In the very beginning of the Bible, in the account of things here prior to the entrance of sin, when there was nothing of the kind to affect man, nor to call out the blessed activities of God in grace, I need not recount to you the story of creation as we have it by the Holy Spirit in the opening of Genesis. I refer to the six days of creation, and how at last man was brought upon the scene, everything ordered and arranged by God with reference to man. Then the man was brought upon the scene. The whole scene of creation was open under the eye of God; there was nothing evil in it; God was able to say as He surveyed it that it was "very good". It pleased Him to look upon it, and it was at that time that you get that wonderful statement, "It is not good that Man should be alone" (@Genesis 2: 18). You might think it primarily applied to Adam, but no! it primarily applied to Christ.
We are told in @Romans 5: 14 that Adam was the figure of Him that is to come, and we must take account of things as under the eye of God. God's mind, God's interest, was primarily in Christ. When He said concerning the man down here, "It is not good that Man should be alone", we then get for the first time in scripture after the creation of man the expression of divine sovereignty. God says, "I will". What did He "will"? What was His purpose -- His counsel? What was in the mind and heart of God? It was this, "I will make him a helpmate, his like". There we get in type Christ and the church! Sin is
{30}
not in question, sin is not there. I have no doubt that in the light of the first epistle of John that sin existed at that time, but it did not exist in connection with man nor in relation to the creation brought before us in the opening of Genesis and which God pronounced to be "very good". Sin existed already in relation to Satan; he was the original sinner -- "from the beginning the devil sins" (@1 John 3: 8), but there was a created scene down here without sin. So that we are not going beyond Scripture in saying that the truth of Christ and the assembly belongs to the primary thoughts of God.
I do not wish to traverse all the distance between the opening and the end of the Bible, but I just want to call your attention to the end. When the end is brought before us, God does not say much about the eternal state, though He speaks plainly, and no doubt tells us all that we need to know about it at the present time; and when the new heavens and new earth come into view in @Revelation 21 what do we see? We see the bride of Christ. We see her in all her undimmed loveliness and freshness. One thousand years at least had rolled by; the world to come, the whole millennial age had passed by, and there are no signs of fading, no signs of age in her. No, she is still "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (@Revelation 21: 2). I only refer to this, I am not dwelling upon it now, but I wish to point out that if in the opening of Genesis before the existence of sin took place, so far as this world is concerned, we see foreshadowed God's primary thought, so in @Revelation 21 when sin
{31}
is 'no more' -- gone -- when what John the baptist declared of the Lord Jesus Christ on the banks of Jordan, when he sees Jesus coming to him, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (@John 1: 29), when that has taken place, He has borne it away and not a trace of sin remains in that bright scene -- that blessed moment, then we find God free to return to His primary thoughts. There is Christ and there is His assembly ... adorned for Him; there she is in all the glory and brightness and freshness that God has purposed to adorn her with, "as a bride adorned for her husband", she has a place in that scene.

SOLID WORK IN EVANGELISATION
J. B. Stoney
I thank you for your kind wish that I should be present at the meetings at -- -- next week. I do trust the Lord will keep you all much on my heart before Him during the meetings. I desire much love to each of you, many long known and esteemed for the Lord's sake. May each derive much blessing from conferring one with another before Him. The Lord grant that you may be taught of Him to do *solid* work.
There are three things: "open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God" (@Acts 26: 18). I believe that in conversion it is a great thing to have a *good*
{32}
*beginning*; a good beginning is always marked with deep repentance. If repentance does not mark the beginning, there is not depth in the conversion. Saul of Tarsus was three days without sight, neither did he eat nor drink. You must keep together "repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Acts 20: 21). The sense of relief is always in proportion to the sense of danger and judgment. Man is not only a sinner but he is under the judgment of God -- Death, "the wages of sin" (@Romans 6: 23). He was "delivered for our offences", that was often typified, but no victim ever rose until "Jesus our Lord" was "raised for our *justification*" (chapter 4: 25). I suppose justification is the finish of the evangelist's service. I believe if the convert can see by faith that all that oppressed him, all that was against him in relation to God, has been cleared away by Christ (as clearly as Jonathan saw that Goliath was gone), he would not only be at peace with God but that the Lord Jesus Christ would be the object and delight of his heart, as was David to Jonathan, and as the Lord to the woman in @Luke 7. I must not add more, excuse me for saying so much; but I am sure, once the soul is personally attached to the Lord, His coming again is its paramount hope, and when this is the case, to find Him in the assembly, and to do His pleasure here, become, as I might say, a necessary consequence. The Lord bless each of you much.

THE ACCEPTANCE OF LIMITATION
P. A. Gray
@Philippians 2: 3 - 11; @2 Peter 1: 12 - 18; @Revelation 1: 9, 10; @Ephesians 3: 8 - 12
I desire, beloved brethren, if the Lord will, to speak about the acceptance of limitation and the mind to go down, and for an example we must first look to the Lord Himself. In the other scriptures referred to, Peter was facing death, John was isolated, and Paul was willing to count himself "less than the least of all saints".
In @Philippians 2 Paul enjoins us to "let nothing be in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves". I believe there is blessing for us if we esteem another saint more excellent than ourselves. If we have regard to our own qualities, then we may give way to the spirit of strife and vain glory.
Gideon is exemplary in this matter when, in @Judges 8, matters are taken up with him by the sons of Ephraim. They said to him, "What is this thing thou hast done to us, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they disputed with him sharply". They said, You have not given us our place, you have not acknowledged us. But he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you?" -- what I have done is a small thing in comparison to what you have done -- "Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer" . He says, Is not the best that I can do
{34}
much less than the least that you can do? He puts himself down and he lifts them up. He says, "Into your hands hath God delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?" (verses 1 - 3). The enemy will seek to bring in distance between brethren, if he can, but the answer is in going down.
"For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus". Who went down like Jesus? "Who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God". It was no robbery for Him to be in that place, and yet He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form" -- He was content with that place as Man because it was the will of His God and Father that it should be so. "Taking his place in the likeness of men" -- He brought Himself down, you might say, He took that place near to men in the likeness of men. He made Himself like men, sin apart, in order that God might draw near to men. Going down is seen supremely in Jesus, who has "also descended into the lower parts of the earth" (@Ephesians 4: 9). Whose descending movements were so glorious as the descending movements of Jesus? Can we not, beloved brethren, afford the mind to go down?
Think of Elisha when he came into the house of the Shunamite woman and her son was dead. It says, "he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and bent over him; and the flesh of the child grew warm" (@2 Kings 4: 34).
{35}
Elisha the great prophet -- the one who had desired "a double portion" of Elijah's spirit (chapter 2: 9) -- the one who brought in the works of grace, was able to go down, to bend over this child. Can each of us, beloved brethren, afford to do that? Can we afford to bring ourselves down, to make ourselves available?
I believe that, in these last days of the testimony, the enemy would seek to spoil what is for the pleasure of God, and the way to meet that is in the mind to go down, a willingness to descend, to accept limitation, and to accept the circumstances in which God has, in His sovereign grace and will, placed us. Elisha went down and the flesh of the child grew warm.
Think also of Paul, descending to Eutychus and "enfolding him in his arms, said, ... his life is in him" (@Acts 20: 10). Can we go down in that attitude of enfolding? The One who has gone down supremely is the One whom God has also highly exalted. And in going down and making ourselves as nothing, all we do, if I may say it simply, is to make way for Jesus, to make room for Him so that He might be exalted in our hearts. If we are inflated in our own estimation, then there is little room in our hearts for that blessed Saviour of whom we speak. But when we go down, when we consider ourselves and see that we are but nothing, then room is made for that blessed glorious One.
"Having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself". Oh! what humbling, for He is the One by
{36}
whom God "made the worlds"; who at the present time is "upholding all things by the word of his power" (@Hebrews 1: 2, 3); in whom "dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (@Colossians 2: 9); of whom it says, when here as Man, "in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" (@Colossians 1: 19); who "humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death". He went into death and "that the death of the cross". He took the place of the curse for you and for me (@Galatians 3: 13). "Wherefore also God highly exalted Him". Is He exalted in your heart and mine? That would be my desire, not that we should be occupied with weakness and failure, but rather that we should be occupied with Christ exalted. The hymn writer says:
<blockquote> 'In concert with the heav'ns above <br> We crown Thee with our praise' (`431:6). </blockquote>
Are we in concert with heaven in relation to Jesus? For if we have place in our ways, in our hearts, and in our minds for this blessed Man, then everything else takes its place in relation to that.
"God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that ... every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to God the Father's glory". That helps us to have everything in its proper perspective. If we confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, we say that His place is the place that God has given to Him, and my place is to own Him as Lord. Let us follow after Him, doing His will, and thus to endeavour to keep out what may intrude will be
{37}
something that we desire and long to do. "Jesus Christ is Lord to God the Father's glory". God is glorified when we acknowledge the Lord Jesus, the One who humbled Himself, who had the mind to go down, not only in what we say, but also in what we do.
Peter was one who was willing to accept limitation. That had not always been so, for when things were difficult he sometimes reacted suddenly: he "smote the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear" (@John 18: 10), when circumstances were contrary; and when challenged that he was "with Jesus the Galilaean", he "began to curse and to swear" (@Matthew 26: 69, 74), denying he knew Him. That Name was going to put limitations upon him, it was going to bring him into reproach. But where we read, Peter had been through much soul history and had learned to accept the limitation of his circumstances. He says, "I account it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance, knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is speedily to take place, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested to me". The Lord had told him by what death he would glorify God, and here he is in the full acceptance of that. But he is not pre-occupied with that; he is concerned about the blessing of the saints. He says, "I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things" -- I emphasise that what I am saying is not new; it is intended for our confirmation -- "although knowing them and established in the present truth". So Peter
{38}
continues, "I will use diligence, that after my departure ye should have also, at any time, in your power to call to mind these things". The Scriptures are available, and much ministry that the Lord has given has been preserved in writing, that saints should have in their power to "call to mind these things" when they are needed.
Then Peter speaks of "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ", and of his having been an eye-witness "of *his* majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory". Again we come to the point that Peter is not concerned about his circumstances but rather that Christ is glorified: "such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory". It is not 'from', but "by" the excellent glory. It was the Father's voice, no doubt, that spoke to Christ and of Him: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". Peter is repeating this for the saints and he is drawing it freshly to our attention, as though to say, This is the One in whom God has found delight; have you found delight in Him too? "And this voice *we* heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain". If we find delight in Christ, then we will find delight in the saints, because we will see in the saints what speaks to us of Christ. What can we see of value in one another? Referring again to Gideon, of his brethren it was said, "each one resembled the sons of a king". And what does he say? "They were my brethren, the sons of my mother" (@Judges 8: 18, 19). Surely if we see the glory of Christ and acknowledge Him as God's
{39}
beloved Son, and then we see in one another features of that blessed One, we can well afford to stop thinking of ourselves and emphasise the glory of Christ which shines in those whom God has been pleased to give us as our brethren.
In @Revelation 1, John speaks of himself as "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience". He loved Christ, and knew the love of Christ for him, and, though isolated "in the island called Patmos", he is conscious of his links with the saints. If we feel the limitations of the circumstances in which we are, then the consciousness of our links with the saints universally is a wonderfully sustaining thing. Still John regards himself as "your ... fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus". Well, there had been a scattering of the saints; how is the kingdom to be maintained in these circumstances? I believe that the coming of the Lord will be very soon, but patience is needed in the present time. How is it to be sustained? - in Jesus. That makes it worthwhile.
John says that he "was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus". Each of us, I believe, should think of the circumstances in which we are in relation to what they might mean for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus. Then we may see our circumstances in perspective, and be encouraged by what John says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day". So that the limitation of his circumstances was
{40}
no barrier to the work of divine Persons. He was lifted up out of the circumstances in which he was and brought into a realm which was heavenly and spiritual.
John continues, "I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet". The power of the heavenly voice was in no sense diminished by the circumstances in which John was. That mighty, powerful voice spoke to him and told him certain things. What a wonderful revelation this book is. What glorious things were vouchsafed to him: "what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these" (verse 19). He gets a marvellous view of all that God has under His hand and in His mind to do. Well, though our circumstances may be limited down here, yet divine Persons are not limited, and we can be lifted in spirit out of our circumstances and brought into contact with a scene that is heavenly and spiritual. Think of all that was vouchsafed to him! But what lies behind it, I believe, is what he says in verse 5, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood". These circumstances had not diminished for a moment John's conscious sense of the love of the Lord Jesus. It was not to Him who *has* loved us, although that is so. He loved us and He died on the cross -- that was a demonstration of His love -- but it is a present love: "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood". That is the One who sustains His own in conditions of limitation and weakness, for His love is the same.
{41}
We are soon going to hear His voice calling us from here to be eternally with Him. But let us hear His voice now! Let us pay attention to the voice now because it speaks to us, not of weakness or defeat, sorrow or limitation, but it speaks to us of heavenly and eternal joys.
In Ephesians Paul speaks of himself as "less than the least of all saints". He could say, "I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound" (@Philippians 4: 12); he had learned that in his circumstances. Think of what he says in @2 Corinthians 11: "In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up, wishing to take me; and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands" (verses 32, 33). There was Paul, the apostle, one to whom God had vouchsafed glorious light, and yet he was being let down by the wall in a basket! He did not say, That is too lowly a way for me, for that is the way that God had ordained for him to escape, and therefore he accepted it, and thus he was preserved for the testimony and the Lord's service.
"Less than the least of all saints". Well, can we look up to the brethren? I say especially to my younger brethren, Learn to look up to the brethren, because if one such as Paul could look up to the brethren, then so should we. He speaks of one as "the brother whose praise is in the glad tidings" (@2 Corinthians 8: 18). He was able to identify in that brother something which was pleasing to God. He says of Mark, "Take Mark ... for he is serviceable to me for
{42}
ministry" (@2 Timothy 4: 11). He speaks about Philemon's runaway slave, Onesimus, and he tells Philemon no longer to receive him as a bondman but as "a beloved brother" (verse 16). He has something positive to say about each of them, I believe, because he regarded himself as "less than the least of all saints".
"To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ". Again, he moves quickly to magnify Christ, and those riches have not diminished through searching them out! He says, "and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God". So that having certain riches vouchsafed to him, and having the knowledge of the mystery, his desire is to enlighten all. He would do that "in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God". We may say that our circumstances are limited, and times are difficult, but this scripture is still as true today as it was on the day that it was written. There is nothing lacking in the assembly, because the Holy Spirit is here, and our Head is in heaven. Heavenly personages looking on are to see the all-various wisdom of God working out in the assembly.
Well, that is my simple impression. Let us learn from Jesus as to the mind to go down. Let us accept the limitations of our circumstances and find in them
{43}
that we have access to a sphere of things where sin and sorrow can never come, where the Lord Jesus is the Head and the Centre. May we know more of it, for His Name's sake.

THE WILL OF GOD
J. Taylor
@1 John 2: 17
It is laid upon my heart to say a word in regard to God's will, feeling that it becomes the test to men, and hence to us. One feels especially encouraged to call attention to it in view of existing conditions, for it is the question really raised at the present moment amongst God's people; that is, Is God's will or man's will to rule? What is noticeable in the passage I have read is, that all that is contrary to God's will has to be removed; whereas, on the other hand, he who does the will of God abides for ever.
John does not here raise the question as to where he is to abide, but he habitually refers to the sphere created by God for man, and he thinks of it as a sphere of blessing, and a sphere in which God's will is to be paramount. Evidently, if God creates a sphere, He creates it for His own pleasure, and He intends that it is to be dominated by His will; and all who are not at agreement with His will have to go, for God will not brook any disagreement. It is well for people to make their minds up as to this. God will not admit of any divergence from His will.
{44}
I think you will find if you trace it in Scripture that this is so, and what specially marked Christ was, that in becoming Man He recognises the principle of absolute submission to God's will. He came into the sphere designed for man, and that was His first object; He would at all cost recognise God's will. As we have been seeing already, He found the law, which was the expression of God's will, disregarded; but He says, "thy law is within my heart" (@Psalm 40: 8). In a way I know of nothing that brings out the faithfulness of Christ, and what He was as a perfect Man, more than that. He had in His soul before God the idea of what man's place was, and that is, that man was to be subject to God. Hence He thought so much of God's will and of His law that He had it in His heart.
Not only did He keep the law Himself, but He brings in a generation who keep it also. I think if there is one thing more than another that brings out who Christ is, it is that He is capable of bringing into God's world a generation of people who love His law. You remember how that, directly He begins to teach His disciples, He taught them how to pray, and what He had in view was the production of a race which should be according to Himself, loving the will of God. He says, "pray *ye*, Our Father ... thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth" (@Matthew 6: 9, 10). The Lord was perfectly cognisant of what existed in heaven. God's will was not contravened in heaven, but it was on earth. So His thought was to form His disciples in accordance with God's will,
{45}
and hence their petition was to be, "thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth". And I think that this desire is what the Spirit of God produces in us. But I will come to that presently.
I was saying that if you search the Scriptures you will find that in every new departure in God's ways there was something that indicated His will, and whatever it may have been, it became the test for the moment. It takes a very little thing to indicate what God's will may be, and it takes also a very little thing to indicate that it is man's intention to disregard it. You find this at the very outset. Eden was designed for man; it was a garden of delights, in every way representing the goodness of God; but there was one element there that was a testimony to God's rights; God planted one tree there, which was a witness to His rights. He planted another, a witness to His counsels; the tree of life was a witness to His counsels, but He also planted a tree there which was a witness to His rights, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and what was a testimony to God's rights placed man under responsibility. So that in result the conditions were simply this, that God had formed a sphere which was in every way in accordance with His nature as revealed, and that sphere was to be dominated by His will. It was very simple. The will of God for the moment was set forth in a negative way. It was a question of what should not be taken. It was negative, but it was sufficient to become a testimony to God's rights. It indicated that the sphere in which He placed man
{46}
was to be dominated by the will of God, and hence Adam was placed under responsibility.
Now you see that what the apostle John states in the passage I read is fully verified in what took place. Adam did not abide "for eternity". He was driven out because he did not regard God's will, and so it is, that unless there is recognition of God's will in any given sphere of blessedness (and there is at the present time a sphere of blessedness ordained of God) those who do not recognise His will must go out. It is not a question of what your brethren may think of you, but of the unalterable principles of God's government. Adam was driven out because he did not recognise God's will. And this we find all through the Scriptures. You will find that in every departure in God's ways, in every new phase of the testimony, there was always something that indicated that God's will must prevail.
We have been speaking of the law given to Moses, which was in an especial way the testimony on the part of God to His rights. It was not a negative law like that given to Adam; it contained positive requirements. It was one of two testimonies. There were two great witnesses in the Old Testament: first, the law, and secondly, the prophets. I do not know if we have considered them much in that light, but it is clear from the New Testament that these are the two witnesses to men in the Old Testament. "The law and the prophets", the Lord says "were until John" (@Luke 16: 16). I take the law to be a witness to God's rights, and the prophets to be a witness to His patience.
{47}
It is remarkable that there were so many prophets. I have often wondered why there were so many. You would think Isaiah said so much, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, that these three would be sufficient, but it is very interesting to see that there are so many, and there were a great many more prophets than those who have written. There were prophets who spoke, whose words are not recorded. The prophets have a voice. I believe the voice of the prophets, in one respect, is the patience of God, God's long-suffering. It tries a man to get up early. God states several times, in figure, of course, that He rose up early to send prophets. It does not say this as to the law, but He rose up early to send prophets; a striking testimony to His patience. The people de-parted from Him and from blessing, and hence He recalls them. He gets up early to send prophets to them to recall them to what was a standing witness to His rights. The permanent testimony to God's rights in the Old Testament is the law. We were saying that Israel did not keep it, and hence God made an ark in which to treasure it; so that the ark was the depository of His law. The ark is a most remarkable type of Christ in many ways, but especially in this, that it is the treasury of God's law, that in which God's law was preserved when men could not keep it.
But what I want to say, as briefly as I can, is that the Lord Jesus Christ has taken up the testimony, He has taken up the law, He has treasured it in His
{48}
heart; He came to fulfil it, and that one jot or tittle of it should not fail. Moreover, what He proposes to do is to bring in a generation of law-abiding people. We were speaking about the Son of man, and I think the Son of man recovered humanity for God, but how? He recovered man in the law-abiding condition. That condition is set forth in the Lord Jesus Christ. He treasured the law in His heart; He was here for God's pleasure, and He is raised up on high and given a place in heaven. That was the place for the ark of the testimony for the moment, but there is now a place for it on earth. He treasured that which was the most precious thing on earth, the will of God, and He goes to heaven. What you see is that the Lord intends to bring in a generation after His own pattern. It is just that which I would like especially to make clear. The disciples asked Him to teach them to pray. I think it were well for us to be stirred up in regard to God's will, and directly you become exercised, what marks you is prayer.
Now I would say one word in regard to prayer, and that is, that God does not always answer prayer immediately, because He puts your heart to the test as to whether you really value what you ask for. As an example, Jacob requested from Jehovah in @Genesis 32 that He would reveal His name to him. He says, "Tell me, I pray thee, thy name" (verse 29). God had asked Jacob for his name, and he told Him that his name was Jacob. Jacob in turn asked God for His name, and God says, "How is it that thou askest after my name?" It is well
{49}
for us to have our interest aroused as to something of God that we are not acquainted with, because directly our interest is awakened as to something we do not know, we ask. God does not answer Jacob's request until @Genesis 35. He waited until then, and in that chapter God answers him in His own time.
We must never think that we can control God in any way, even by prayer. God reserves the right to answer, and He chooses His own time and place to answer. In regard to Jacob, the place where he got the answer was at Bethel, and the time was when Jacob arrived there. Bethel is God's house. That is where most things are disclosed to you. You may ask for things from God at home and He answers in the assembly. I do not say it is so in every case, of course, but the assembly is the oracle really, and if you are in the assembly in heart, all your difficult questions will be answered. It is in Bethel that God answers Jacob's question, "Tell me, I pray thee, thy name", and it is there He says, "I am the Almighty God" (chapter 35: 11). That is a wonderful disclosure.
We are accustomed to the term "God Almighty", but it was a wonderful thing for Jacob to have a God like that. It means that He is Almighty. He is able to do everything to accomplish His counsels, and to do everything needed for our good, and He revealed His name to Jacob in His house. I do not know of a chapter that is, in a way, more helpful to believers than @Genesis 35. I think it shows how God directs His people into a sphere in which His interests are, and where His will is paramount. God says to Jacob,
{50}
"Arise, go up to Bethel" (verse 1), and directly Jacob crossed its threshold he recognises that God is the God of it; he rears up an altar to God in Bethel and he names it El-beth-el. He is now in God's sphere where God's will is supreme. God is not the God of Shechem, but He is the God of Bethel. He rules there. If you come into the house of God remember that His will is paramount there. Now Jacob recognises that in his altar, and God answers his question there. He says, "I am the Almighty God", and He tells Jacob that he would be multiplied, not after the flesh, indeed, but in the power of resurrection. He would be multiplied by God Almighty. The answer to all this will be seen for us in the future on the principle of resurrection. But I do not dwell on that now, I only referred to it in connection with prayer.
The disciples professed not to know how to pray so they asked the Lord to teach them, and He taught them according to what was in His own heart. He had before His heart the formation of a generation of people like Himself, a people who would adhere to the will of God. Such is the generation that Christ left in this world. He did not find them here. He found the law disregarded by men; there was nobody treasuring it. He took it up and placed it in His heart; and He left here a generation of people who love God's law, who love the will of God. They had been taught by Him to pray that God's law should be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Now I wish to add a word in regard to ourselves.
{51}
The Lord Jesus Christ, having gone into heaven, gave the Spirit to those same people; hence their walk should be in accordance with their prayers. Evidently if we pray to God that His will should be fulfilled on earth as it is in heaven, we are inconsistent if our walk is not in accordance with God's will. Clearly you have to take the path indicated by God's will, as we are told in @Romans 12, "that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (verse 2). His will is not arbitrary or irksome, it is good and acceptable and perfect. And how is that brought about? By the Spirit. The Lord Jesus Christ, having gone into heaven, has given the Spirit to His people, and we are told that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled by those who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. It is a question of walk, and those who have the Spirit walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Now it is in that way that a generation of law abiding people, people who treasure the will of God, is continued in this world, and manifestly it is of supreme moment that we should be found such. It is not that I wish to place you under law in that ordinary meaning of the word, but it is evident that God must rule, and that our blessing depends on our abiding under His rule. Present blessing is the result, for as we prove that His will is good and acceptable and perfect by walking in it, we remain in the sphere of blessing. I wonder if you understand what it is to be in the sphere of blessing. If you have tasted what
{52}
it is, you wish to remain there.
You know that God is dealing in a judicial way amongst His people, and if His will is not adhered to people must go. John states it here. He that doeth the will of God abides for ever, but the world passes away. Why does the world pass away? Because it is lawless. It must pass away. But he says, "he that does the will of God abides for eternity". And so God would preserve us and keep us in the sphere of blessing and privilege by pressing upon us the necessity of walking according to His will. May it be so! May there be a generation, at least in measure, amongst us now after the pattern of Christ! a generation of people who respect God's will and adhere to it; who would rather die than surrender one jot or tittle of what God has made known. There must be no deviation from it, for God will refuse all non-adherence to it. All God's will must be fulfilled, and so today the Spirit of God would maintain in His people a respect and love for God's will, for all that is contrary to it has to go.

DEPARTURE AND RECOVERY
J. Pellatt
@Revelation 2: 1 - 7; @Revelation 3: 7 - 13
Now I would like to speak simply about this message to the angel of the assembly in Ephesus. I leave the Old Testament for the present; the church is not there, as we know, except in type; the first
{53}
actual mention of the truth of the church is in @Matthew 16. There Christ says, "on this rock I will build my assembly". The moment has come; there has been the revelation by the Father of the blessed Person of Christ to Peter, who says, "*Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God". And the Lord says, "on this rock" -- Himself, the Father's revelation of Himself -- "I will build my assembly" (verses 16 - 18).
Now I pass on. We come to the Acts of the Apostles -- to the day of Pentecost; the Lord had died; He had been raised from among the dead and had ascended, and taken His place up there in glory, and from that scene of heavenly glory the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost. The result is that the church is here; she is here as an actual fact; the presence of the Holy Spirit from the risen, ascended and glorified Christ -- the Son of God, has brought into existence the assembly.
But I am not going to speak now about the assembly as the "one body", nor as the house of God, the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth, nor as seen for a brief season as the assembly at Jerusalem; but what I am going to speak about is local assemblies -- assemblies here and there. There were many local assemblies, but I want now to call your attention to the one particular assembly at Ephesus.
I think the scriptures fully entitle us to consider the assembly at Ephesus as rising, in apprehension of privilege unfolded to them, above and beyond
{54}
every other assembly at that time. From a very small beginning (see @Acts 19), the assembly at Ephesus had grown numerically and spiritually. Afterwards we find the apostle paying them a long visit (chapter 19: 10); you remember when on his way to Jerusalem he sent from Miletus and called the elders of the Ephesian assembly to him, and he rehearsed to them his ministry. He said that he had not "shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God" (chapter 20: 27). In that assembly he had unfolded all the wonderful range of things that lies within that expression -- "the counsel of God". Later on he writes to them a marvellous letter.
We have often been told that there is a certain connection between each epistle and the state of the saints composing the particular assembly to which it was written; you cannot fail to see this connection in the first epistle to Corinth, and in the epistle to the assemblies in Galatia, and that to the saints at Colosse, and we see this connection in a marked way in the epistle to the Ephesians. What a marvellous unfolding of the counsels of God is there! One never tires reading the opening of the epistle to the Ephesian assembly. It begins at the very top: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (chapter 1: 3). You cannot find anything above that, it is the peak that towers up above every other peak; and the Ephesian saints were there, and as there, in Christ, they were spoken to as having been blessed
{55}
with every spiritual blessing. Then further on you get in chapter 3 that wonderful prayer. Do you know the climax of that prayer? He says, "and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God" (verse 19).
I believe that prayer was answered in the assembly in Ephesus. I do not believe that the apostle bowed his knees for naught. He says: "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father ... of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" (verses 14, 15). I believe that prayer found its answer. What light, what marvellous privilege, what a state there must have been in those saints! That prayer has in view what is subjective in the saints: "to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man" (verse 16). It is *inward* and spiritual; it was to be effected in them, and that "being rooted and founded in love" they might be able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, length, depth and height, and that they might "know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge", that they might be "filled even to all the fulness of God". That was not simply what was unfolded in ministry to them, but there had been wrought in them by the Spirit an answer to it; these saints at Ephesus had reached the top. You say, How do you know? I know it from @Revelation 2. The Lord says there: "but I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love". If first love has never been reached you cannot be charged with having *left* it. It was reached
{56}
at Ephesus; in that assembly; by the Spirit, there had been wrought such a response -- a full response to the love of Christ for the assembly, and *that is first love*. It is not the first love of a new convert (we use the expressions of Scripture very loosely). It is the assembly down here with the light of the range of the counsels of God; it is the assembly down here in the knowledge of the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge and as answering to that love.
And that is where declension began. I do not mean geographically, I mean where it began spiritually. It began at the highest point that can be reached down here (I say it reverently, recognising all Christ's interests in the assembly, and recognising the ministry of the Holy Spirit with us in the assembly), the highest point that can be reached by the assembly down here -- the only thing I know beyond it is not beyond it even in character, it is only the difference between spiritual reality now and eternal actuality by and by. Well, that is where it began. But the wonderful thing is this -- in connection with this particular message, and indeed with all these messages -- one gets to know, if I might say it reverently, the feelings of the heart of Christ in relation to His assembly here. Oh! how He must have felt that leaving of first love. Really outwardly the assembly at Ephesus was still in a wonderful state; there were no signs or symptoms of outward decay; there was wonderful activity, wonderful energy of a spiritual sort, there was no thought at Ephesus of putting up with anything evil,
{57}
they had tried those who took high ground, who said they were apostles and were not, and they had found them liars, and there was patience, and endurance, they had not fainted. But the eye of Christ discerns, and His lips pronounce the declension.
"I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love". I would, beloved, that the impression -- the divine conviction might come home to us of what really is proper to the assembly in relation to Christ; that is what the Lord looks for and prizes; it is not what people, and even God's people, sometimes value and prize. A great deal is thought of outward order, and I am not saying a word against it, but if there is not the responsive affection to the love of Christ for the church it will not please Him, it will not suit Him. It was not simply that they had fallen, but the point of the statement is: "*whence*" they had fallen. I would not make light of any kind of fall, but I would that we might feel the force of the Lord's words: "Remember therefore *whence* thou art fallen, and repent"! They had fallen from the greatest height, and the Lord calls them to *repent*, and I would that *we* might understand it. We think we understand repentance on the part of the sinner, but have you ever thought of what repentance is on the part of the saint, and on the part of the assembly? The Lord says: "repent, and do the first works". You might say, What *are* first works? First works are the expression of first love. There is a great variety of works; there are works that are not thought much of down here, and which do not gain credit here, but I
{58}
am sure of this, that "*first* works" will not fail to secure His approbation and the expression of His delight. The assembly at Ephesus had left first love, and with the decline of first love, first works were no more.
Let me say a word further with regard to the phases of the decline. In a certain sense the seven messages to the seven assemblies present a consecutive and a successive history, but (not to go into details) what is the final result of falling from first love? Spued out of Christ's mouth. There is quite a journey between, but this is where it leads to, that is the ultimate end of falling from the heavenly height of first love. So it is a very serious matter, and I would that we might think of it in a very serious way, and remember, beloved brethren, we are here where the decline has taken place, and we are here in the presence of the consequences of the decline; we cannot ignore it, and it would be profitable for us to recognise it.
Now I turn for a moment to the message to Philadelphia. There we see the point of recovery. If you read these messages it will produce a sad impression upon your heart. First in Ephesus there is a fall from the height of first love, then you come down to Smyrna and Pergamos, and while there is in Smyrna much the Lord can and does approve of, and concerning which He encourages the saints to be faithful unto death and He will give them a crown of life, still on the other hand there are evidences of increasing declension. They hate the deeds of the
{59}
Nicolaitanes at Ephesus, but they are tolerated further on, and their doctrine is tolerated too. You trace all these assemblies and you come to the last four, which are those which particularly concern us, because it is evident that these last four -- Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea -- continue to the end. So somewhere and somehow there must be that now that answers to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Laodicea. I cannot speak for the want of time so fully as I would like, but I may say this -- you will find in Sardis the last appeal of Christ to the church here; there is no appeal after Sardis, there is no need of appeal in Philadelphia, and Laodicea is beyond appeal. The Lord says, "because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spue thee out of my mouth" (verse 16). There may be individuals that He loves, but not the church at Laodicea.
When you come to Philadelphia I do not know how it impresses you, but one feels at least relieved. There is Thyatira -- that terrible state of things (there is I know a remnant described as "the rest", but I do not speak of that at this moment) there is Sardis, "a name to live"; and what good is a name to live when you are dead; it is a mockery; it is empty pretension, "I have not found thy works complete before my God", and the terrible threat hanging over Sardis that the Lord would treat her like the world -- would come upon her as a thief in the night. When you come to Laodicea, well, you have to turn away from it if you are at all spiritual, if you have any feeling for Christ you can only turn away from it with a
{60}
pained heart at the utter indifference to Christ that is evinced; self-complacency, self-satisfaction, "I am rich ... and have need of nothing". What a terrible state, so obnoxious, so nauseating to Christ.

"MADE LIKE TO HIS BRETHREN"
C. A. Coates
@Hebrews 2: 1 - 18; @Hebrews 4: 14 - 16
Our hearts have often been comforted and elevated by the thought that we are going to be like the Son of God in His glorified condition, but it is necessary also that we should consider that in becoming Man in the circumstances in which we are, sin apart, "it behoved him in all things to be made like to his brethren".
We are told that "he takes hold of the seed of Abraham". In becoming Man, He took up a special relationship with the faith family -- with what God owned as having a link with Himself. There were features about that family which were of God, though every member of it had been by nature a child of wrath, even as the rest. But faith having come in, there was that in them which was not of the fallen man, but which had its origin in God. Christ could take hold of that, for it was suitable to Him; we might say that it was kindred to Him. It is as having this characteristic of faith that men are regarded as Christ's brethren, and it behoved Him in all things to be made like to them. This underlies the
{61}
teaching of Hebrews: we hardly get the indwelling Spirit in this epistle, but all through, prominence is given to faith. Christ's brethren are in view, and "the people" are the elect nation -- those who have faith. They, and they only, get the good of the Apostle and High Priest of our confession (chapter 3: 1).
Those from among the Jews who received Christ were the true "seed of Abraham", and they became Christ's companions and His brethren. They were the seed of whom Christ took hold; He attached Himself to them and was made like to them not that He could have them apart from His death and from His soul being made an offering for sin, for they all had sins for which propitiation was needed if they were to be with God in a righteous and holy way. The seed could not be sanctified -- they could not be "all of one" with the Sanctifier -- if He had not made propitiation for their sins. So we find later in the epistle (chapter 10: 10) that by God's "will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all". We also read that "by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified" (verse 14). As purged worshippers they have no longer any conscience of sins. We need to shut out the flesh more completely from our thoughts of the holy brethren. They are to be regarded as the epistle to the Hebrews regards them. There are more than twenty designations of the saints in this epistle, but they all suggest suitability to God and to Christ, and not the contrary.
It is as having the exercises and trials and
{62}
sorrows of *faith* that saints are Christ's *brethren*, and it is as having part in the testings and sorrows of faith that it has behoved Christ to be made in all things like His brethren. Christ's brethren are viewed here as in a position and condition in which they are sure to be tempted and tried, and they are also marked by infirmities. Faith is there as a ruling principle, but it is surrounded by almost universal unbelief, and is therefore continually exposed to temptation in the sense of trial. It has always been so, wherever there was faith. And along with faith there is always, in our present condition, the consciousness of infirmity. These things mark Christ's brethren here. The temptations or trials here referred to do not arise from the activity of the flesh; they are the result of faith coming into conflict with the influences that operate in the present evil age. If faith and a good conscience are maintained, there is bound to be suffering, and when we have part, however small, in the sufferings of faith, there is always the consciousness of infirmity. Infirmity does not mean that we give way before the power of evil, but it means that we are conscious that if we did not get divine support we *should* give way.
Now it is this experience which prepares us to appreciate how near Christ has come to us in becoming Man. He entered into, and took part in, all suffering which had been the portion of faith in all ages. He was tempted, or tried, by every form of trial which has ever come upon faith. And having passed through this experience He is qualified to be "a
{63}
merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God". It is in these things that we need a merciful and faithful high priest. Faith governs all matters relating to God, and when faith brings us into trial here, we need One who is able to help us as having suffered and been tried in exactly the same way Himself. When we prove that He does help us, it makes Him a very blessed reality to us.
We cannot for a moment think of Jesus, the Son of God, as having infirmities, but He had the true feelings of a man in presence of trials and sufferings. He was "tempted in all things in like manner". Therefore He is able to sympathise with *our* infirmities. He knows perfectly how trial and suffering affect man -- how they ought to affect man. In His case the sensibilities and the sufferings were perfect, and were all infinitely acceptable to God. They were wholly apart from sin. They are real trials which cause suffering, but they are not the result of evil-doing, but of faith. Now the Lord, in the state of a blessed, perfect Man, has been subjected to every such trial, that He might be able to sympathise with His brethren who suffer the same trials, but who are also conscious of infirmities. He never had infirmities, and He certainly has none as the great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, but His experience of trial and suffering here has qualified Him to sympathise with *our* infirmities. If I feel so weak that I cannot possibly hold fast the confession unless I get His support, He is exceedingly sympathetic with that feeling. It is the
{64}
very reason -- or, at any rate, one reason -- why we have Him as our High Priest.
We have infirmities connected with our bodies, such as Timothy's "frequent illnesses" (@1 Timothy 5: 23) and the sickness of Trophimus (@2 Timothy 4: 20). Christ has not been made like to us in these things, but He can enter perfectly into them because in the days of His flesh "Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases" (@Matthew 8: 17). It has been well said that He bore in His spirit what He removed by His power. He felt in His spirit all that pressed upon men, even physically ... (See note to @Hebrews 2: 17 in the Darby Translation). But it enables Him to enter fully and sympathetically into all that His saints suffer, even in their bodies, and He is able to help them in those sufferings, as an innumerable multitude have proved.
*Ministry by C. A. Coates, Newton Abbot, Volume 23, pages 227 - 230. Devon, (c.) 1935*.
RESURRECTION TO LIFE
There could be no resurrection to life if sin had not been put away, that is perfectly certain, because resurrection is the annulling of the sentence of death, and the sentence of death could not have been annulled if sin, which brought in death, had not been put away.
*Letters of F. E. Raven, page 290*.

THE SUPREMACY OF CHRIST
J. G. Frame
@Luke 14: 7 - 11; @Psalm 45: 1, 2; @Song of Songs 5: 10 - 16; @2 Corinthians 11: 1 - 3
I want to speak from these scriptures, beloved brethren, in relation to the supremacy of Christ. God would bring before our hearts the greatness and glory of His own beloved Son, the One whose supremacy is going to be universally acknowledged. He intends that Christ should be precious to our hearts, as He is to His own heart, and so He would occupy us with Him at this time, that His supremacy should be established in each one of our souls, and each one of our homes, and each local assembly, and finally, as we have been saying, throughout the whole universe.
We do not see all things subjected to Jesus now, but we see Him "crowned with glory and honour" (@Hebrews 2: 9). That is the privilege of the believer, through faith and in the Spirit's power, to take account of Jesus, not yet publicly owned, but already crowned of the Father, there in His presence, as it says, "Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet" (@Hebrews 1: 13). We are in the time of waiting, in the day of grace, the Spirit's day, and God is working out His own blessed thoughts, I believe, through the glad tidings in order to attach souls to Christ, and to bring them into the knowledge of the blessings that are centred in Him. So God would impress us with the greatness and the glory of Christ, and the blessed Spirit, too, I believe,
{66}
would occupy us with Christ.
Think of the lowly place the Spirit has taken, and the way He would impress us with the greatness of this One who fills God's heart, who came here, as we often say, in incarnation's lowly grace, trod this scene in obedience to the will of His God and Father, suffered and died, and has been raised again. He "has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father" (@Romans 6: 4), and He "set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" (@Hebrews 1: 3). He is there tonight, an Object for faith to those in whom God has wrought in His wonderful grace and drawn to Christ. I trust we will all receive a definite impression at this time of the greatness and the glory of the One whom God would occupy us with.
I read the passage in @Luke 14 that we might learn to make way for Christ. The moral of this passage, of course, is that we should be marked by lowliness and humility. Paul says, "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 2: 5). Think of the glory of the One who was equal with God, yet, in incarnation's lowly grace, He humbled Himself, was found amongst men, and was "obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross" (@Philippians 2: 8). Think of the glories of the Lord Jesus, and how right it is that those who love Him should give Him the first place. I believe God is working to that end at the present time, that in each of our souls the Lord Jesus might have a greater place than He ever has had.
{67}
This parable in @Luke 14 was spoken to "those that were invited". Well, through grace, we have been invited. How that should affect us, that we have been invited into the most wonderful things, and as coming into these things, I believe we should be marked by lowliness and humility, and not in any way taking the first place, because that belongs to the Lord Jesus. The Lord is speaking here of a wedding, and, of course, that is often the happiest day in a person's history naturally, specially if it is a marriage in the Lord; but it is a time when prominence is often given to the first order of man instead of to the Lord Jesus. And we need to remember, when these occasions are being arranged, that they are not for the introduction of the flesh or the first man, but for the introduction of what belongs to Christ and the assembly -- that is what needs to be prominent.
"Give place to this man". That is what God would have us to do, to give place to Christ. Whatever our arrangements, whatever our movements, whatever our desires and longings are, I believe the Spirit of God would speak expressly. He may speak in a still small voice, but I think He would speak at any rate, and He would remind us that we are to "Give place to this man". At the end of the parable it says, "for every one that exalts himself shall be abased, and he that abases himself shall be exalted". What a matter that is for each one of us to take account of, that God will have that principle characterising the whole universe of bliss
{68}
where Christ will have the supreme place. Oh! how God has honoured Him, how He has exalted Him, and I think He is looking to those who love Him to do likewise.
I believe in the present time that the Lord's rights are acknowledged and honoured by those who love Him, who gather together every first day of the week to remember Him as He has requested, and to announce His death until He come. How pleasing that must be to the Lord Jesus. So that, as we often say, He would come to where love is and make Himself known, that His lovers might have a taste of these wonderful glories in association with Himself. What a stimulation to our hearts to give Jesus the first place! It is sobering to think of the sin and shame the first man has brought in, and we need to understand that God has judicially ended that order of things. A servant of the Lord has said, Where man was removed, God was revealed. What an important matter that is, to understand that God has ended the first man, and He has brought in another Man, and so a process goes on in our souls, as it says, "He takes away the first that he may establish the second" (@Hebrews 10: 9). The Lord Jesus is the One whom God has established "heir of all things" (@Hebrews 1: 2). How great Jesus is! May He become greater to every one of our souls as we are left here.
I read in @Psalm 45 to illustrate one whose heart, typically, was full of Jesus, full of the sweetness and blessedness of that One. How touchingly it says, 'Of the sons of Korah' -- those who were spared in the
{69}
judgment (@Numbers 26: 11). They would never forget that they were spared, and therefore they can enter into what is involved in the instruction of this psalm. We have been spared too from the judgment to have part in the most wonderful things that "eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him" (@1 Corinthians 2: 9). Our hearts should be flowing forth concerning the King, concerning this glorious Person. 'A song of the beloved', it says. The psalmist here is "welling forth with a good matter". How good it is to be occupied now with these things that will not pass away, things that are eternal, things that are associated with Christ, that belong to another scene where He is. How pleasing it must be to the Lord to take account of those whose hearts are welling forth with joy because of what belongs to Himself, what He has brought in, a "good matter" indeed.
Surely our hearts would be freshly stimulated at this time, as the greatness and glory and supremacy of Christ is brought before our hearts, that we should have our part in song too: "I say what I have composed". What an occupation belongs to us eternally -- praise. Well, that is to be our occupation now, "touching the king". I wonder if we have had a fresh glimpse of the King in His glory. Think of the greatness of what belongs to Christ. He has not yet been crowned publicly, but the day is soon coming when He will be. How glorious that coronation day will be, when these rights so long denied to Jesus
{70}
will be granted to Him, and we will be with Him, in company with all who love Him, who have tasted something of the sweetness of His love. The psalmist could say, "Taste and see that Jehovah is good" (@Psalm 34: 8). Oh! how we need to commit ourselves to contemplate and meditate upon Him, upon the greatness of His name, the greatness of His exploits -- things that are intended to cause us to be occupied with the One who is the King.
The psalmist goes on to say, "My tongue is the pen of a ready writer" Oh! that we might con-template and meditate upon the greatness and the glory of Christ, and that one's tongue might be loosed in relation to His glory. I think meditation is an important thing, and I would commend it to my younger brethren, that they meditate upon these things. That is the way that things get into your soul, eternal and abiding things, not things that belong to this world, that are soon to pass away, but things that belong to that world where Christ is the Centre. The Spirit of God would attach us to Him that our tongues may be loosed in order to say something in relation to the honour and glory and greatness of Jesus.
"Thou art fairer than the sons of men". Who could be compared with the Lord Jesus? He is incomparably great, divine and yet a blessed Man. And then it says, "grace is poured into thy lips". Oh! what grace was evident in this wonderful Person as He came from God to make God known, to draw us to Himself, to bring the knowledge of that grace, and
{71}
the blessings of that grace, very near to us. Luke tells us about the Lord reading in the synagogue, "he has anointed me to preach", and later that they "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth" (chapter 4: 18, 22). Yet such hatred and animosity was generated there that they would have cast him over the brow of the hill (verses 28, 29). But grace was expressed nevertheless, and that grace is still the same.
"Therefore", it says, "God hath blessed thee for ever". Little wonder indeed that God has given to Christ the supreme place, the place at His right hand, and there He sits, as we have been saying, until the day of grace is closed, until the operations of God by the Spirit to bring into His house what is suitable and comely, are over. The day will not close one minute before God's designs are fully completed.
Later in the psalm it says, "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions" (verse 7). How rightly we would draw attention to the Lord as the One who is above His companions, the One who surpasses all in the beauty and grace and glory of His Person, yet the One who is still the same, who would endear Himself to our hearts at this time. He would help us all the way through, I believe, to count upon Himself and upon that grace that never tires, that service of His that is carried on continually in relation to His own. May the Lord Jesus become greater to us. He wants the first place in our hearts, so that we can
{72}
truly count upon Himself in relation to the journey here, however long or short it may be.
In the Song of Songs the question is asked, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved?" (verse 9). And then the spouse breaks forth and speaks about her beloved. Well, can we speak of our Beloved, as knowing Jesus in this way? How beautiful are the ten features that the spouse draws attention to in her beloved. We can meditate upon them, and see, typically, the glory and greatness of Christ in them.
First of all she says, "My beloved is white and ruddy". Think of that as characterising the Lord Jesus; the vigorous character of His life here. How pleasing it must have been to God. Then it says, "His head is as the finest gold". Well, how wonderful it is to take account of the Lord Jesus in his Headship -- "the finest gold". Divine righteousness and divine glory find their perfect expression in this glorious Person, and that is intended to affect us, for the head affects the whole body. It says, "His hands gold rings, set with the chrysolite ... His legs, pillars of marble, set upon bases of fine gold". Oh! how lovely Jesus is; how supremely great. That is what the spouse here is occupied with. She goes on to speak of "His bearing as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars".
How excellent the Lord Jesus is! Our hearts need to be occupied with Him continually. Think of how the psalmist bursts forth with "how excellent is thy name in all the earth!" (@Psalm 8: 1). He begins and he
{73}
finishes the psalm with that ascription of praise to the One whom he so loved. Well, may our hearts too be stimulated as we take account of the greatness and the glory and the perfections of the Lord Jesus. "His mouth is most sweet". Can we say that His mouth is most sweet? Think of Mary, "who also, having sat down at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his word" (@Luke 10: 39). Surely His mouth was most sweet to her. She was drinking in all that He said. He had become increasingly great to her, and she was enjoying the sweetness of love's communications. That is what the Lord would have us to do. He would love us to be near to Himself.
"This is my beloved, yea, this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem". Think of having Jesus as a Friend! We would not address Him as 'Friend', but nevertheless we would know Him as the One who has come near to us, a Friend above all other friends. Our hearts as occupied with Himself can break forth in an ascription of praise and give testimony to what we have found in the Person of our Beloved. How wonderful it is to be occupied with Him, and with the greatness of His love who has gone so far in order to secure us eternally for Himself. That should encourage us to learn more about His glorious perfections, and to study them and to enjoy them as in nearness to Himself. I believe that is what the portion of the saints is to be in a coming day, and I think we are being educated for that now. May it be the portion of every one of our hearts, as occupied with our Beloved, to say truthfully from our souls,
{74}
"This is my beloved". The Spirit of God would help us to love Him and to be able to say what we think of Him as bringing glory and honour to Himself. The Lord is working towards this great end. Oh! that our hearts might be more occupied with Him, and that He might have indeed the supreme place with us. How often we are content to give Him another place.
In @2 Corinthians 11 it is a question again of the place that really belongs to Christ. Satan had been active among the Corinthian saints, and we need to be warned about Satan's activities, because even in occasions like these, it may be, as it says in Job, "Satan came also" (chapter 1: 6). Paul had laboured that he might have these Corinthians for Christ. What a labour the apostle had. The Corinthian saints were perhaps two years out of paganism, and although they had made some progress, yet Paul was labouring in order that Christ might have the first place with them. He says, "Would that ye would bear with me in a little folly; but indeed bear with me". How patient Paul was; just like God. He stayed away from Corinth in order to give them an opportunity to adjust themselves; he sent Timothy instead. He said, "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and in a spirit of meekness?" (@1 Corinthians 4: 21). The Lord had said to him, "I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 10). Paul had great love for the Corinthian saints. He says, "I am jealous as to you with a jealousy which is of God". Oh! he is the true Phinehas of the New Testament.
{75}
Paul had a jealousy which was of God, and he was jealous lest the enemy should come in and corrupt or divert the saints from being occupied with Christ. He says, "I have you espoused unto one man". That is what Paul had in mind -- no other man but Christ should have a place among these Corinthian saints. And so he says, "to present you a chaste virgin to Christ". This would mean that in our dress and ways there is to be nothing loose, nothing that would bring dishonour on the Lord Jesus; our affections should not be going after others.
The woman of Samaria in @John 4 had had five husbands. But she became attached to Christ, she came to the true Husband. So Paul here is speaking about Christ and the assembly. He says later, "This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly" (@Ephesians 5: 32). How precious these things are, and through wonderful grace we have been called into them. But Paul feared: he says, "I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ". He had Christ before him, and the glory too of the assembly as the one who was to be united to Christ. No other thought did Paul have for these Corinthian saints than that they were to be espoused to this one Man, to Christ.
Well, that is all a have to say. I believe that the Spirit of God would occupy us with Christ, and Christ supremely. I believe we see it in the third chapter of Ephesians, where Christ is dwelling in the heart through faith (verse 17). That is, they were
{76}
brought near to the One who is the Centre of God's world. Oh! how we have had other centres, how we have been drawn away from God's Centre. I believe the Spirit of God would revive our affections at this present time, that as Christ is the divine Centre, so He might be our Centre, and our affections might be livingly connected with Himself where He is, in glory. May God bless the word, for His Name's sake.

"HIS INHERITANCE"
E. J. McBride
@Genesis 24: 43 - 46, 52 - 67; @Genesis 25: 5, 6; @Romans 8: 9, 10; @Colossians 2: 2, 3; @Ephesians 3: 16 - 21
I wish, beloved brethren, in nowise whatever to divert from what the Lord has been bringing before us, but desire rather that it should be confirmed in our souls, and hence I have before me to say a few words on what the hope of His calling is, connected, as it is, with the riches of His inheritance in the saints (@Ephesians 1: 18).
You will doubtless remember that when God brought Israel out of Egypt, He had it before Him to bring them in and plant them in the mountain of His inheritance; He would plant them there; that is to say, He would have His people to share in the things that He Himself delighted in.
But now I should like us to look for a little at the inheritance on the heavenly side -- and I may say in
{77}
passing it is not the mountain of His inheritance exactly, but it is that which the blessed God has taken up in Christ, and His inheritance in the saints. And I believe it is the desire of the Spirit of God to bring us into the good of that inheritance now; that it might not be simply a question of merely being in the company of people with whom you have certain outward privileges, such as breaking of bread, prayer meetings, reading meetings, and so forth, but that you might have the practical spiritual enjoyment of the inheritance in the circle of the saints now. In that circle you learn to appreciate and enjoy what the blessed God has got for Himself in His redeemed beloved people.
Now I trust, with the Lord's help, to make this more clear to you. I would like to give you the connection in which the Old Testament setting of the inheritance is presented. If I understand the book of Genesis correctly, the climax of that book is reached in chapter 22. I must not, however, enlarge very much on that at the moment, but it is intensely precious -- I refer to the beautiful figure of Abraham and Isaac ascending the mountain where Isaac was to be offered up; but I may say in regard to it that the blessed activities of the Father and the Son, with a view to all blessing, both heavenly and earthly, are set forth there in type. The foundation on which everything stands for God is the offering up of His own beloved Son; and I think it was a wonderful point when God brought out, in figure, a father's affection for his son, and yet the son of his affection
{78}
was offered up as a sacrifice -- a sacrifice that prefigured what Christ was, not merely as the answer to guilt, not merely as the atonement for all the sin and ruin that had been brought in, but the offering up of His Son in order that from that very spot where all the corruption and departure were, there should be a savour of eternal sweetness rise to the heart of the Father. It is from that spot that the Spirit of God records the blessing that was to come in through Isaac.
Now, just to keep the connection for one moment, you will remember that at the close of the 22nd chapter there is a little parenthesis which gives you the generation of Rebecca, just immediately before you get the record of the death of Sarah, showing that the church was in view before the history of Israel was portrayed.
Now chapter 23 gives us the record of the death of Sarah, and Abraham's purchase of a burial- ground. It is perhaps one of the most interesting chapters in the Old Testament, for it establishes the rights of redemption in regard to the earth, and you have the purchase price paid with the current money of the country, and the land made sure to Abraham for ever. And, let me remind you, that piece of land is going to be demanded, and Israel shall come forth and people the earth. The incident is a picture of Israel, for the time being, buried; but the rights of redemption are held by the true Abraham, and He will take up those rights, and Israel will come forth and stand upon the earth, for the purchase price has
{79}
been paid, the deed has been made sure, and the inheritance rightly belongs to Abraham. Now that is connected with the death of Sarah.
Chapter 24 stands between chapter 23 and the incidents recorded in chapter 25 where other families are referred to; but you will have noticed in it that Isaac gets the pre-eminent place -- Abraham gave to Isaac all that he had, and before he died he sent the other families away eastward. The picture is beautiful: there stand Isaac and Rebecca, with all the blessing of his father, in a unique and distinct position; and all the other families blessed as only Abraham could bless them, but sent away eastward.
Now the hope of our calling is connected, I think, with the 24th chapter of Genesis; and when you come to consider the way we have to enter into it, practically, you will, I think, agree that the Spirit of God has graciously given us, through Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, three salient epistles that deal with the subject; I do not at all undervalue Paul's other epistles, but the three epistles in which the heart of the apostle comes out in a distinct way in this connection are those to the Romans, the Colossians, and the Ephesians. I may remind you that the apostle had not seen either the Roman or Colossian saints when he wrote those epistles; he had, however, been to Ephesus, and he knew the people intimately. Ah! beloved, it is an immense thing that we should be established in these with a view to entering on the whole of our calling.
Now let me say a word on @Romans 8: 9: "if any
{80}
one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him". I take the 24th chapter of Genesis to be illustrative of the Spirit's mission to bring to Christ a company which will be adequate to fill a special place in His affections; in other words they are the company of whom the apostle spoke in the epistle to the Ephesians: they are His inheritance. And what marks the chapter is that the servant starts out with ten camels of the camels of his master, indicating that the whole question of the responsible wilderness journey -- ten camels -- had been contemplated before the servant ever started out on his mission. Is there a faint-hearted or tremulous saint here this evening? Ah! beloved brother or sister, you need not be at all afraid; when the servant started out on the journey he knew all the distance that was to be travelled on the onward path and every mile home. What a heart the blessed God has: He not only gave His Son, but He gave the Spirit of His Son. What was the mind of the servant? Ah! his mind was to discover someone that was like his master.
Here the apostle writes to Rome, the metropolis of the world at that time, and his object in writing was to bring to light the mystery of the metropolis of God's world. He wrote a thesis that was to deliver the saints from this world, and put them in touch with the metropolis of God's world, to which they were to belong. And what was to mark them? They were to have the spirit of the kind of Man that God was going to people His world with. Now I think you have this pictured in the scripture I have read in
{81}
the 24th of Genesis; there you have the servant explaining his exercises; his communications take the line of exercises, that he might find a wife that was suitable to his master; and he asked Jehovah to bring him into touch with someone of the same sort of spirit as Isaac. And what kind of spirit was that? Ah! the servant says, When I ask a drink, she will say, "Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also". What is the Gospel? It is the recovery of man for God. So the servant's exercises were not to the end that he should find someone who was very beautiful to look upon; no, but to find someone touched with the Spirit of Christ. Beloved, many of us profess to believe the Gospel, but, I ask you, how far are we each marked by the Spirit of the Man who is God's Glad Tidings? If you have got the Spirit of that Man, you will have no room for the display of your own spirit.
Now, when the camels had done drinking, the servant took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ... Just imagine this damsel looking at these things, and feeling that there was now only one person for her -- the one who had sent her the ring and bracelets; her hands were only to be active in the service of that one person, and her ear to listen only to his voice.

TYPES OF THE CHURCH -- EVE
M. W. Biggs
@Genesis 1: 26 - 28; @Genesis 2: 18 - 25; @Ephesians 1: 17 - 23; @Ephesians 5: 25 - 32
In our meditations upon the various types of the church, we have now come to that of Eve. The order selected has been that which would suggest our spiritual progress rather than the unfolding of truth from the divine standpoint. There are certain spiritual steps we take in experimentally reaching that which is proper to the assembly. Hence Eve suitably comes last.
Rebecca as a type sets forth the church as presented in the epistle to the Colossians; Eve the view of the church seen in Ephesians. Eve is a type given to us before the question of sin came into the world. And the view presented is not that of the church in the ways of God, but as the fruit of divine counsel and as having a place according to the purpose of God.
(1) Eve typifies the church as the subject of divine counsel and as sharing in the headship of Christ. The words, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion", obviously included Eve. It was a matter of divine counsel that the woman should share with the man the position as set over the works of God's hands. The first chapter of Ephesians brings this before us as to the church. After the apostle's prayer in chapter 1: 17 - 20 an additional statement is given, "and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies", etc.
{83}
Having raised Christ from the dead, the thoughts of divine counsel were unfettered, and it was an act of divine pleasure to place Christ thus as Head over all things to the assembly. The church is given to share with Him in headship. In Colossians Christ is said to be the Head of the body (chapter 1: 18), but here He is given to be Head over all things to the assembly, and the assembly is said to be the fulness of Him who fills all in all.
Both the man and the woman were included in the name Adam, and together they were to have the place of dominion over all earthly creation. And the church is included in the thought of headship as presented in @Ephesians 1. She shares with Christ in the place of supreme influence. This, dear reader, let us note is a question of the pleasure and counsel of God. Nothing, of course, can possibly interfere with or prevent it. The counsel of God shall stand.
It is refreshing to turn from the turmoil of conditions here on earth to the calm definite certitude of divine counsel. It is God's will, and in divine counsel it is settled, that Christ and the church shall be together over all things. There will be many families in the world of the Father's pleasure (as we read in @Ephesians 3: 15), and each family will have some impression of Christ who will fill all things. But the assembly will be 'next his heart' as has been happily remarked; indeed she will be His body, His fulness: His every feature will be expressed in the assembly. Who can now rightly estimate the precious influence the church will exert both in the world to come and
{84}
in eternity?
(2) In order that there should be such a place, we find a work of God of a special kind. Not only is the assembly the fruit of divine counsel, she is also the product of an entirely divine work, and she is derived from Christ. This is beautifully prefigured in the type before us.
How really wonderful it is that in the quiet, pure scene described in @Genesis 2 God typically set forth the fact of the death of Christ and the formation of the assembly. There is no reference made to any other question: it was not a matter of remedying things, but of the pleasure of God. The "deep sleep" was wholly with a view to forming a helpmate for Adam. It is very clear that neither the death of Christ nor the assembly were afterthoughts. The entrance of sin into the world had not yet taken place. @Genesis 2 describes a condition of things wholly the outcome of divine wisdom and pleasure. This act of forming the woman was the fruit of divine deliberation.
From Adam, then, God takes a rib, and out of this rib He builded the woman. The infidel mind may find difficulty, and scorn to receive the simplicity of the divine account. But the believer is filled with holy wonder as he reads the record in @Genesis 2. Marvellous indeed that God should thus set forth the far greater marvel of the death of Christ and the formation through that death of a vessel suited to be a companion of Christ!
It may be advisable again to remark that the side
{85}
of truth here presented is that of the purpose and work of God. In previous articles other sides of truth -- equally important in their place -- have come before us. But it is necessary to seize this view of things; for otherwise a great deal of Scripture is unintelligible to us.
In one view we may consider the "deep sleep" of Adam as typically covering the whole period during which the assembly is being formed. And when she is brought to Christ He will recognise that which is wholly of Himself. In another view the "deep sleep" suggests the death of Christ, and in His resurrection the assembly is seen as made to live and, elevated in His exaltation, she sits in heavenly places in Him.
It is of immense moment to recognise that viewed in this light, and in fact spiritually viewed, the church is wholly derived from Christ. Though we can well remember, as we are exhorted to in @Ephesians 2, that we were Gentiles in the flesh, yet in the way in which we are considering the church, what we were is not the question at all. The church is wholly the product of God's work. There was no past to Eve, and Adam could recognise that she was wholly "of him". "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man" (@Genesis 2: 23).
It is this that qualifies the church for the place she has of wondrous intimacy and influence. How else could she be the suited companion of Christ? How else fitted to share with Him His place of headship?
{86}
It is a great moment in our soul's history when we can take up this ground spiritually. The privileges of the assembly connected with the first day of the week are after this order. A 'first day' obviously has no day before it. And as we are by the Spirit's power enabled to take up our place as of the assembly, we are entitled to view our whole history and being as of Christ ...
So long as we are on earth we have our several paths of responsibility, and the assembly as in the wilderness has its history and responsibility. The first epistle to the Corinthians views the assembly thus. But there is also another side of the truth, and Eve sets forth the assembly according to the purpose of God and as wholly derived from Christ.
(3) From @Ephesians 5 we learn that which the type does not afford, namely, that Christ loved the assembly and gave Himself for her. The deep sleep of Adam did not set forth his love for Eve; but the death of Christ was the deepest proof of love. It is not the only proof; for He still cares for the assembly and lives for her, sanctifying her by the washing of water by the word.
As to its actual condition, the assembly needs to be purified from that which is extraneous to it -- to be washed from that which is really not itself. This is the present service of Christ. He gave Himself for the assembly and proved His love in so doing. But though as an object of His love He could view it as wholly pleasing to Him apart from whatever might be its circumstantial condition, as here on earth, it is
{87}
encumbered with much not really itself, much that is not derived from Christ. It is from this the Lord in His service of love is setting her free by the washing of water by the word ... Let us remember this as we experience the service of Christ.
The Lord now serves His assembly in His activities of love. It may be He leads us to see that we are allowing an element belonging to Gentiles in the flesh or some other feature of the children of wrath. His loving service is removing it; He is purifying the assembly. It is with a view of the final presentation to Himself of a church without spot or any such thing. All is being wrought out in the moral history of our souls. We shall be presented so. How would this be possible without this present service of Christ? He is setting us free from that which He could never love. As an object of His love the assembly is wholly pleasing to Him. Such in actual state she will soon be presented. Wholly of Christ, the fruit of His death, the object of His love, the assembly will soon be presented to Christ in every way pleasing to Him and thus fitted to share with Him His glory and His place of influence over all things.

DEPARTURE AND RECOVERY
J. Pellatt
@Revelation 2: 1 - 7; @Revelation 3: 7 - 13
Now, when we come to Philadelphia, I think one might be justified in speaking of its surroundings,
{88}
for it is preceded by Thyatira and Sardis and succeeded (I mean in the order of statement, I am not speaking of the order of time) by Laodicea, and there stands Philadelphia. What do you find there? What is perfectly according to Christ. Perfectly suitable to Christ, and, beloved, the Lord Jesus has not one word of censure or blame to say. You cannot read the message to Philadelphia without feeling impressed with the encouragement, complete from the first word to the last.
I would that I were able, and had the time, to speak fully of it, but what I want to say is that the point of recovery is in Philadelphia. We have dwelt a good deal upon the point of departure, because you must see the point of departure in order to apprehend the point of recovery; the point of recovery must be equal to the point of departure. Will Christ be satisfied with anything less? Will the Spirit of God work from any lower standard than what is perfectly suitable to Christ? I cannot believe such a thing. It is impossible. I want to say emphatically that whilst the word 'love' on the part of Philadelphia (mark this!) is not mentioned in the message, His love is declared when He says, "and shall know that I have loved thee"; but while the word 'love' as marking Philadelphia is not mentioned there is the threefold unquestionable evidence that recovery to first love is reached in the answer to His love in the saints in Philadelphia.
I hope we shall be able to divest our minds, beloved, of all geographical or ecclesiastical ideas. I
{89}
trust the Lord will give us ability to take in the spiritual application of the message to Philadelphia. Let me tell you one thing very plainly, there is no publicity in Philadelphia. Are you on the line of publicity? What is the idea of publicity? It is the eye of man; -- the approval, the endorsement of man; and what an unholy competition there is all around us today, each, as it were, bidding to outvie the other with regard to publicity. Let me tell you there is no publicity in Philadelphia; hence Philadelphia does not represent any public body.
Philadelphia is not brethrenism. If you have ever taken that thought up, drop it! We all would seek to be Philadelphian as to our state, but Philadelphia is not brethrenism. How one beloved servant of the Lord laboured in his soul, that the saints might be delivered from the idea of brethrenism! When you come to 'isms', I would not give you much for the choice; I was once, and I am ashamed to say it, in Methodism, and I am sure the Lord never brought me out of Methodism to put me in another 'ism'. It is a matter of prayerful exercise, and has been with me for some years, that not one bit of 'ism' might be found about us, and I would wish the Lord to utterly divest me of it. There is nothing for the eye of man in Philadelphia, nothing for the praise of man; but everything for His eye and everything according to Himself.
Now for the threefold proof. Oh! how beautiful are the three MYs of this message. Are you acquainted with them? Christ is speaking. He says,
{90}
"my word", "my name", and "the word of my patience". Now, when you find these things, you may know that the Spirit of God has effected recovery. First love is there, and first love asserts itself. "My word", "my name", "the word of my patience". The Lord says, "thou hast a little power". What it must be to Christ to be able to recognise the presence and proof of the power of the Holy Spirit, for any real power in Christianity is that of the Holy Spirit. "Thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word", not 'words'. "If any one love me, he will keep my word" (@John 14: 23) -- not ought to. His word is kept and cherished. He is not here. What is here? What represents Him? In one sense the Holy Spirit represents Him, but in another sense He is represented by His word, and His name, and the word of His patience.
I do not want to strain this passage, or to give any extraordinary meaning to it; there is no need of that; it is unmistakable: "thou ... hast kept my word", and "hast not denied my name". There is recovery! The love of the Christ has its place in the hearts of those who morally and spiritually stand for Philadelphia, and there is response to that love. Then there is another expression. Philadelphia has a crown. "I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown". What is the crown? First love is the crown. Christ has got His crown. There is that which is His distinguishing glory, and there is that which is the distinguishing glory of the assembly here, the crown seen in Philadelphia. Do
{91}
not let any one take it from you. Be careful about your crown!
There is one thing more I should like to say before I close, and that is -- do not take Philadelphia as representing anything outward, anything material -- what some speak of as assembly order or anything of that sort. Let me remind you, there was much in Ephesus that the Lord Himself commended; there was nothing outward or external lacking there; all was as it should be, but we find this in the history of things, that where first love is lacking, sooner or later, even the outward thing will go. It has gone. I would ask you, can you find anything that answers even to that which the Lord commends in Ephesus at the present time? It has gone. Oh! beloved, do not get the idea of anything outward, even that of meetings or fellowship, however blessed that may be and is; what the Lord is seeking now and the Spirit too (and no wonder, for He is coming, He says: "I come quickly"), is to effect in us, to produce and maintain in us, an answer to the love of Christ to His assembly, and that is recovery. It is a state produced by the Spirit.
I am sorry to have to speak so briefly, but I trust the Lord will help us. I feel it is a great thing for the saints of God to get help inwardly. The Lord is coming. I would like to allude to one more scripture. There is a certain connection between Philadelphia and @Revelation 22, nearly at the close, where the Lord presents Himself; He says: "*I* Jesus ... *I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning
{92}
star". Listen to the response! "And the Spirit and the bride say, *Come*" (verses 16, 17).
May this blessed effect be really produced in us to His praise and glory!

UNSPOKEN PRAYER
S. J. B. Carter
@Isaiah 54: 11 - 13
Spoken prayer is audible, and normally it is distinct, and generally it is public. Unspoken prayer is inarticulate -- it is too deep to be voiced in words, but it is heard -- heard in secret by God.
When passing through seasons of trial and sorrow, when the water-floods of grief and bereavement overflow the soul, when depressed by one's moral state or circumstances, when the pressure seems well nigh at breaking-point, and prayer seems torpid and dead, what a relief, what a comfort it is to know that God searcheth the heart, eager, as it were, to detect, to decipher anything there that is for Himself, and that He "knows what is the mind of the Spirit" who "intercedes for saints accordingly to God" (@Romans 8: 27). Can He heed a groan? Yes, even a groan. He counts a groan as a prayer -- not only the groanings of the Spirit, "which cannot be uttered", but also the groanings of our own spirits.
A groan may speak anguish or of longing desire. We may "groan, being burdened" -- groan for deliverance (@2 Corinthians 5: 4). We may likewise groan
{93}
because what is awaiting us up there is so enchanting that we yearn to enter into it (@2 Corinthians 5: 2). "The whole creation groans", and Paul adds, "*we* ourselves ... groan" (@Romans 8: 22, 23). Sometimes that is all we can do. Sometimes we may even groan, "O wretched man that I am!" (chapter 7: 24). But we never add: "who shall deliver me?" if we know who He is. But every groan to God is heard. "Lord ... my groaning is not hid from thee" (@Psalm 38: 9, Authorised Version). Thank God, it never is. But He can also heed a sigh. A sigh has not that intensive force which a groan has, it is softer. Yet how affecting it sometimes is.
The weeping prophet was full of sighs: "I sigh" -- "her people sigh" -- "her priests sigh" -- "my sighs are many" (@Lamentations 1: 21, 11, 4, 22). The weeping Saviour, Jehovah's Servant-Prophet, often sighed, yea, "He sighed deeply" (@Mark 8: 12, Authorised Version).
<blockquote> 'For ever on Thy burdened heart <br> A weight of sorrow hung, <br>Yet no rebellious murmuring word <br> Escaped Thy silent tongue'. </blockquote>
The Psalms breathe His sighs. They reveal what Jesus felt as He suffered.
In the Pentateuch we have the *figures*; in the prophets, the *forecasts*; in the gospels, the *facts*; in the epistles, the *fruits*; but in the Psalms, the *feelings* of Christ as He suffered.
Every sigh He heaved was to God, and, like the frankincense of the meat-offering, it went up to God. Every divinely prompted sigh we utter to God is heard. Ay, and, poor weary soul, it may mean more
{94}
to Him then ten thousand words, however eloquent -- "for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord" (@Psalm 12: 5, Authorised Version).
<blockquote> 'No faintest sigh His heart can miss, <br> E'en now His feet are on the way, <br> With richest counterweight of bliss <br> Heaped up for every hour's delay'. </blockquote>
The great men of the Bible were often great weepers -- Joseph, Moses, David, Jeremiah, Ezra, Nehemiah.
"Jesus wept". The Man of sorrows mingled His tears with those of His bereaved and beloved ones. He wept, too, over Jerusalem. He wept also in other ways -- ways too mysterious and sublime for us to understand (@Hebrews 5: 7). Oh! let us ponder His tears well -- ponder them till every fibre of our moral being pulsates with holy emotion.
Whilst guarding against what is natural sentiment, yet we should cultivate spiritual emotions. A tear in the eye of a child may be very appealing and do what words fail to do. God treasures the tears of His people. He has a bag for their sins, a book for their thoughts and words and deeds, a bottle for their tears (@Job 14: 17; @Malachi 3: 16; @Psalm 56: 8). David was not satisfied with a divine record of his tears being kept -- he wanted them preserved. "Put my tears into thy bottle".
Even in public let us not check the tear when it starts. I once saw a brother in tears at a prayer meeting, though he spoke not a word. I murmured, 'Amen' to his unspoken prayer. The woman of @Luke 7 said nothing with her lips, but her tears said a good
{95}
deal. Paul speaks of his "many tears" (@2 Corinthians 2: 4); John wrote, "*I* wept much" (@Revelation 5: 4) ... We need to steep the gospel seed in tears (@Psalm 126: 6). Who can estimate the worth and power of a tear shed before God in prayer?
Solomon prayed, at the dedication of the temple, "when they shall know every man the plague of his own heart and shall spread forth his hands toward this house" (@1 Kings 8: 38). What a mute appeal, yet how pathetic! How many a pious Israelite, in captivity or alienation from God's house, feeling the plague of his own heart and otherwise oppressed, looked towards God's house, like Daniel at his open window, and got blessing. We can look toward heaven -- to a Person. "They looked unto him and were enlightened" (@Psalm 34: 5) -- that is the way of relief and happiness.
Try it, dear troubled one. Perhaps you say, I have looked but have got no relief. Look again -- look till your spiritual vision becomes calm and clear. Jonah said when down among "the weeds" and "at the bottoms of the mountains" and tempest tossed by "floods", "billows", "waves", "Yet will I look again toward thy holy temple", and he did. Then he was able to add: "And my prayer came in unto thee" (@Jonah 2).
How cheering and reviving it is that even a desire can cleave the mighty space between earth and heaven and be heard above. "Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble" (@Psalm 10: 17, Authorised Version). Every desire born in the renewed affections after
{96}
Him is cherished and fostered by Him. "Lord, all my desire is before thee" (@Psalm 38: 9).
Are we so overwhelmed that we cannot even groan or sigh? so low that we cannot give vent to even a tear or a look? so utterly cold, inert, and hopeless that the soul feels it is prayerless? Yet, surely there must be a desire after God if there is life! Beloved, that is prayer! "With my soul have I desired thee in the night" (@Isaiah 26: 9).
Amid impenetrable gloom that may sometimes enshroud us, when the soul seems shut out from God, and the heavens seem like brass, when there is neither "moon nor stars" to lighten the darkness of our night -- then, even then, we can rest in a quiet waiting, heaven-inwrought desire after God, and be encouraged by knowing that even the desire of the heart is graciously heeded and interpreted by Him as unspoken prayer.

THE COMFORTER
F. E. Raven
It is by the Comforter that Christ makes Himself real to us. There is no solid comfort to be found outside of Christ: real comfort and strength are only found in what He is to us. Though He be absent, to prepare us a place, yet none the less His heart is down here. If the heart of Christ be down here, He Himself is not far distant, and He puts Himself in evidence to those who love Him, by the Comforter.

LONGINGS OF DIVINE PERSONS
R. Gray
@2 Samuel 23: 13 - 17; @Psalm 132: 13 - 18; @Luke 22: 14 - 22; @John 17: 24
These scriptures refer to longing or desire, and it is in mind to speak, with the help of the Spirit of God, as to the feelings and longings of divine Persons. There are instructions for us in Scripture as to how we should walk. The first epistle to the Corinthians would bear on our conduct in regard of the assembly, and other epistles would amplify that. The epistle to the Romans would help us as to our individual walk, leading on to the assembly, because the assembly is ever in view in divine arrangements. The first epistle to Timothy would help us as to how we should conduct ourselves in the house of God. These things are given to us for our help and guidance, so that, when circumstances arise that test us, we should have recourse to Scripture to guide us as to what we should do, as helped, of course, by the Holy Spirit.
So we need help and guidance to use what we have been given by way of instruction, and the Lord has in mind that, whatever the circumstances, there should be an answer provided that would result in two things: one, that what is right might be done; and the other, that there might be glory to God. As exercises come up in relation to divine things it is not simply sufficient that matters should be put right, but God would look for something added. That is prefigured in the Old Testament where it says, "he
{98}
shall make restitution for the wrong that he hath done in the holy things, and shall add the fifth part thereto" (@Leviticus 5: 16). Well, that is instruction for us, and I think most would agree that it is a simple matter to rehearse the truth -- it is good, and it has its own value -- but to work out the truth is a real test. We speak about self-judgment, but let us practise it so that Christ becomes greater and what is in us according to flesh is reduced. There is much discipline among the saints, and we would speak about it very carefully, but God is working to that end, and in one way there is an element of encouragement even in the very discipline itself, "for whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives" (@Hebrews 12: 6); and the Lord Himself said, "*I* rebuke and discipline as many as I love" (@Revelation 3: 19). Discipline is no light matter, but still there is this element of comfort in it, that as accepted from God's hand there will be fruit.
I would like now to touch on the scriptures read as to the feelings of divine Persons, either actually or typically, on the line of desire. I am thinking of David here as a type of Christ, and what he looked for. It says, "David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate!" David was then in the stronghold. You might say, in one sense, the position is impregnable, and that is true, for what is connected with the position the Lord has taken up cannot be overthrown, it is impregnable. But there is the other side in which it is possible to minister to
{99}
His blessed heart something that He actively desires. Bethlehem, to David, I suppose, would mean much, for, historically, it was the place of his youth. But perhaps we could apply it in this sense, that, as the Lord looks back over the history of the testimony, there is much that He has enjoyed from His saints, there has been much for His heart from the gatherings of His people. The Lord looks at the present time for something from His own that would be pleasing and refreshing to His own blessed heart.
Now it says, "three of the thirty chiefs went down"; they are not named; they were three overcomers, and they worked together. It says, "the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines", but there is no mention here of using the sword, nor any reference to bloodshed or warfare, it simply says "they broke through", they worked together. Think of the difficulty involved in carrying out this matter of breaking through, but to bring back a vessel of water through hostile country they would have to work together. Well, I just present that because if we are going to be helped to minister to what is for the Lord's own heart, He would help us to work together. What bound them? No rule, no regulation -- what bound them was love for David. You might say, Are there not more pressing things connected with the conflict than this? But what they heard was his own expressed longing, and if we are near the Lord, we begin to understand what He really looks for: a clean place, yes; righteousness maintained, yes. But what else does
{100}
He look for? -- some expression of the saints working together to produce something for His own heart, something fresh that means much to Him.
Well, "David ... would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah". What it means, I believe, is that the service of God is enriched. Do we have the sense that the service of God is vitally important? Is it something just to be kept up as best we can? No, the service of God is something that pleases His heart, and that comes from the hearts of saints as they think of Him and His interests.
In @Psalm 132 we read, "For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling". Think of that, God Himself, in all the greatness of His Being, yet having desires after a dwelling place such as this. What would He find in Zion? A place of sovereign mercy. Zion, typically, would be composed of the fruit of His own work, the persons there would be persons like you and me, enjoying a sense of mercy. Paul, the apostle, never left Zion in that sense, he carried with him throughout all his christian pathway a growing sense of God's mercy. He says, "but mercy was shewn me because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief" (@1 Timothy 1: 13). What a sense of mercy Paul had, and what a fine thing it is to carry with us a sense of mercy, and of divine love and divine giving. These things should form us spiritually. A good assembly person, I believe, would be well-founded in the truth of the glad tidings. Paul, in @Ephesians 6, exhorts the saints to "take to you the panoply of God, that ye may be able to withstand in
{101}
the evil day, and, having accomplished all things, to stand" (verse 13). He speaks interestingly about the believer's armour, for what wealth the saint is expected to defend. Well, are we going to stand for the truth? -- we ought to, but never let us forget that our feet are to be shod with "the preparation of the glad tidings of peace" (verse 15). That should affect all we say and do, and instead of principles being used perhaps in an arbitrary way, we should have some sense of what "the truth is in Jesus" (chapter 4: 21). The truth is to be maintained, with no watering-down of principles, no setting aside of what is the truth, but the truth is to be held in a way that would make it attractive. Well, that is how citizens of Zion would act, and God delights in it.
More than that, it says, "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it". Think of all God's thoughts and purposes combining and having in view that He might have a place in which to rest. What does it speak to Him of? It speaks of Christ, and those who are the fruit and the product of Christ's death, who are formed after Christ. God says, I am delighted with that. Well, it goes on, "I will abundantly bless her provision" -- is that not so? We say we have failed, and surely we have. Has God failed? No, there has been abundant provision for all that was needed. "I will satisfy her needy ones with bread; And I will clothe her priests with salvation". What the psalmist had asked for was that the "priests be clothed with *righteousness*" (verse 9). Well, it would be good to have things maintained
{102}
according to the divine standard, but God says, "I will clothe her priests with *salvation*". In effect, God would say, I will set My priestly family free from every influence that would hinder in relation to the maintenance of service Godward, and manward. That is what salvation is, it is full liberty from anything that would becloud or mislead. "And her saints shall shout aloud for joy", and surely we should in such an environment, and then it says, "There will I cause the horn of David to bud forth". Well, in conditions like these, would what is according to Christ not flourish? We give thanks for what we see of the Spirit of Christ amongst the saints. How many older brethren have been preserved in the testimony, and in brightness of spirit. That is a feature of the present time, for saints have been preserved through many years, maybe some have experienced much discipline, and yet how bright they are -- well, it is like the horn of David budding forth.
"I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed" -- there is still divine speaking. We must not allow to go from our grasp the actual blessings of Christianity: the anointing still operates; the assembly is in operation, and we seek to walk in the light of it. Persons may say, You are claiming to be it. Well, far be it from us to claim that, but let us at all costs walk in the light of the truth. I believe that is something of the meaning of the word to Philadelphia, "hold fast what thou hast" (@Revelation 3: 11) -- let us be sure of what we do, and cling to it and
{103}
never let go.
In @Luke 22 it speaks of the Lord's desire, His own feelings entering into this matter. I know it relates to the passover, but the thought was in one's mind that what the Lord looked for was the company of His own. The Lord is still in rejection, He is refused publicly, and He feels that. He is rejected by many in Christendom, but we would respect the work of God, and salute it, wherever we see it. Luke's gospel does not deal with the side of pressure quite so much as Matthew and Mark, as we know. What Luke brings out more is the side of things connected with the Lord's feelings and sufferings that the saints can take account of, and that is an interesting consideration. It says in Luke's account, when they were on the mount of Olives, that the Lord found the disciples "sleeping from grief" (verse 45). They were overwhelmed for the moment by the pressure that had come upon them. It says of the Lord that "being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth" (verse 44). We are intended to feel conditions as they are in the testimony, and to feel them as the Lord feels them.
Exercises among the saints need to be worked out together, but Satan would seek to bring in cloudiness and distance, and even suspicion, among saints to hinder matters. But there is nothing binds saints together more closely than to contemplate the Lord's sufferings and the way that He has gone for us. It says, "And having taken a loaf, when he had
{104}
given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you". How full the Lord's giving was. He had said, "With desire I have desired ..." He longed for, He desired the company of His own, but what He expressed to that company was the fulness and depth of His own blessed feelings. He said, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you". That puts it's imprint on the present dispensation: the blood poured out, the Spirit poured out, the fulness, the unstinted character of divine giving in order to furnish us with the wealth that we need in this present time to meet every exercise that comes upon us.
I conclude with reference to @John 17, where we have the Lord's own feelings expressed as though His sufferings were past, and it has in view, I believe, that we might be with Him. It is wonderful to think that believers are the objects and the subjects of divine desires. The Lord in this chapter speaks about men, "the men whom thou gavest me" (verse 6), that is, persons (both brothers and sisters) formed substantially after Christ, having taken on the features of manhood, able to stand in the testimony and maintain, not only the truth, but the character that belongs to the present dispensation. You might say the two are one thing, and in a way they are, but the character of things which the Lord
{105}
showed here, and which is maintained by the Holy Spirit, is the test at the present time.
So the Lord says, "as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me". The Lord knew practically what it was like to be alone, yet He could say, "I am not alone ... he that has sent me is with me" (chapter 8: 16, 29), and again, "and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me" (chapter 16: 32). The Lord knew what loneliness of spirit meant, He knew what standing for the truth meant, and His desire is that He might encourage us and strengthen us, so that, even though we go through circum-stances that are testing, He can assure us that He has been that way, and that He has been maintained in it, and He has been faithful. And so He says, "I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" -- what a thought that is! I cannot say much about it -- simply this, that the Lord would have His own, persons like you and me, with Himself to take account of His glory that the Father had given Him.
That was all one had to say. May we be encouraged as seeking, not only to maintain what is due to divine Persons, but to answer to Their longings, for His Name's sake.

THE BASKET OF FIRSTFRUITS
J. Taylor
@Deuteronomy 1: 5 - 8; @Deuteronomy 26: 1 - 11
Perhaps one might say that there are few books in the Bible less understood than the book of Deuteronomy; and I think it is because the assembly is not understood; for, I take it, that Deuteronomy contains regulations for the assembly. You will notice in chapter 1: 5, that Moses speaks of a second law. He had given the first one in @Exodus 20 ... But what you find in the book of Deuteronomy are instructions for the people, which were to be permanent; laws which applied to them as in the land.
Now it is to my mind of great importance that that thought should be laid hold of. You will notice that, after speaking of the law given in the land of Moab, the Spirit proceeds to indicate the character of it; "Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have stayed long enough in this mountain. Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbouring places in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the seaside, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them" (verses 6 - 8).
God took account of the people in the
{107}
wilderness; He knew perfectly what the wilderness was. It was not a land flowing with milk and honey. The people had been there forty years, and in the kindness of His heart God suggested to them to move on. He said, You have been at the mount long enough. It is true that this was said at Horeb, but the generation to which the first law was given never answered to it, so here it is set at the beginning of the second law which is spoken to another generation. I allude to it just for a moment, for one is forced to the conclusion that the people of God are more content in the wilderness than in the land, and, if not in the wilderness strictly, at any rate, in the plains of Moab ...
It is most touching that God, through Moses, should proceed to suggest to the people that they move on, opening up to them the entire extent of the promised land. That is what the Spirit of God would seek to do for us. The resurrection and ascension of Christ secures for man at the present moment what answers spiritually to the entire extent of the land of promise, from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, including the valleys and the hills, Lebanon and the sea-shore; a land flowing with milk and honey; a land watered with the rain from heaven; a land influenced by heaven itself; that land is opened up to the people of God at the present moment, and it is most touching that Jehovah, in opening up His second law, in giving the regulations for the land, should suggest to them to go in.
Well, I would suggest to all here, that, inasmuch
{108}
as the Lord Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and is ascended as Man, it entitles man to the land of promise. The time will come when God will discriminate; some of His people will remain upon the earth, while others will inhabit heaven. But the Lord Jesus Christ has gone into heaven as a risen Man; He has taken up a place as Man beyond death, and the place He occupies indicates God's mind for man. There is nothing limited; the whole land, from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, is opened up to man. It opens out a wonderful vista. Moses did not put his feet there, but he saw it. It is a wonderful thing to get a glimpse of the land of promise. All these things were spoken in the plains of Moab. Moses saw the land from Moab, but never put his feet there until he appeared with Christ on the mount of trans-figuration. That was when Moses got into the land of Canaan.
Now, beloved friends, where are we? The plains of Moab is a most desirable place for a certain state of soul in Christians. The Israelite that inhabited the plains of Moab had the Spirit typically, and was an intelligent believer ... People who dwell there are Christians; they have title to Canaan, but they do not go there, and, inasmuch as they have no regulations from God, they make regulations for themselves, they formulate codes of laws for themselves; these laws are especially fitted for them, but they are not God's laws. Now God begins His law by directing His people to move into Canaan, and He opens up the entire extent of the land of promise to them.
{109}
Now, I was saying that Deuteronomy corresponds with the assembly in a sense. One could easily show that from different passages. I refer to one particularly in chapter 16, in which Jehovah enjoins the people, all the males, to appear before Him three times in the year (verse 16). Now I take it that when the Spirit of God specifies the males among His people He alludes to the saints viewed as formed in the intelligence of the Spirit, and hence they represent the whole. They were to appear three times in the year. I venture to connect it with the Lord's request in regard to the Lord's supper. It may be inquired, Why three times? I believe that three is an adequate testimony, and in the threefold appearance of all the males of Israel in the presence of Jehovah you have an adequate testimony of their affections, affections formed by the Spirit of God, and they are not on the wane. If they only appeared once or twice one might conclude that their affections were declining; but inasmuch as they were to appear three times in the year it indicates how Jehovah would secure for Himself the affections of His people. As often as they responded there was a positive testimony to sustained affections.
Now I think that it is in that way the Lord maintains us. We do not come three times in the year only; we come on the first day of every week in answer to the request of our Lord. Every Christian who neglects the Supper virtually confesses that he has no affection for Christ. It is impossible for one who really has affection for Christ, and who rightly
{110}
understands the Supper, to neglect it. Therefore the Supper was to be a continual law, so to say. It was to be permanent during the absence of Christ. It was to afford an opportunity for the saints to attest their affection for the Lord. But what I wish specially to call attention to is that in the assembly there is a witness to resurrection.
I do not say, for the moment, that the assembly itself is that, although that is also true, but what I see in @Deuteronomy 26 is that, as the Lord's people appear before God they do not appear in their own nakedness; they appear with that in evidence which is an obvious testimony to Christ in resurrection, the basket of firstfruits. That is what I had specially before my mind, but I would like to encourage you first of all in regard to the assembly. As the resurrection of Christ is realised and laid hold of in the soul one is led to the assembly, and once there, you are under the law that is to regulate the assembly. I would impress you with that, because we are living in a most lawless age; and I would point out again that the law that is to regulate you in your individual conduct is not the law that is to regulate you in the assembly. There are regulations for the assembly that have no reference to the wilderness; and there are regulations for the wilderness which have no reference to the assembly.
It is most important, if we are to walk together, and if we are to maintain the order that belongs to God, and to God's house, that we should recognise that there is a code of laws, so to speak, which
{111}
regulates the assembly. Those laws are of a unique character; as I have already pointed out, they begin with directing the saints to go in, and that in itself suggests a great deal. They are of a unique character; in truth, because it is the law of new creation. Who can tell anything about the law of new creation? Certainly none but those who are created anew. The apostle says, "neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation. And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy" (@Galatians 6: 15 - 16). Is that your rule? It is a rule that is altogether outside of the ken of man in the flesh. He may know something of the law given at Sinai, but the law of new creation is outside of him. The law that rules in God's world is altogether and absolutely outside of the knowledge of man in the flesh for "neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision".
Now that is what the assembly presents under the eye of God. It is a company of people here upon the earth risen with Christ, morally outside the present order of things ... it is ruled by the law of new creation; in that people there is what is for God, and it is because of that I delight in the book of Deuteronomy. It is the family book. The priest and the Levite officially have little place there. The priest is recognised in chapter 26, but when the man comes and sets his basket of firstfruits before God (verse 10) he is the most conspicuous person; not that he was conspicuous personally, but the basket of firstfruits was conspicuous. You may ask where he
{112}
got it. We must not be too abstract in dealing with divine things. If that man came in with his basket of firstfruits they cost him something; they were placed down by the altar; they were a sacrifice.
You remember David positively declined to offer to God anything that he did not pay for; and the man who can come up on the first day of the week with a basket of firstfruits brings what has cost him something; they may cost him a good deal of self-denial, and a good deal of sacrifice. They are the fruit of the Holy Spirit in his affections; they are the fruit of the Holy Spirit forming a man after Christ; so that, instead of the Aramaean, instead of a poor dying, perishing Aramaean, you have a man living; for, remember, the man himself is the basket and the firstfruits are in the man; they are not separated from the man, they are in him. The man is formed after Christ by the power of the Spirit of God. That man appears in the presence of God in the character of Christ risen from the dead. It is the firstfruits. He got them out of the land; he came up to Jehovah with something he had got in the land.
As risen with Christ, "raised with him through faith of the working of God" (@Colossians 2: 12), the Holy Spirit has His way with the believer, and the Aramaean is not there; the man himself is the basket; the fruit is in the basket, and the man appears in the presence of God. He does not forget what his father *was*, "A perishing Aramaean", but *he* is not ready to perish. Viewed as risen with Christ we are not ready to perish; we are living; we are made to live by the
{113}
power of the Spirit, and we appear before God in all that Christ is. It is not simply Christ objectively, for, I repeat, the basket was full of firstfruits, and the basket is the man; it is the affections of the man. The firstfruits are in the man. We appear before God as formed by the Spirit, so that what God sees is Christ. He does not see the Aramaean; He sees Christ. The assembly is not composed of Aramaeans ready to perish. It is composed of men risen with Christ, and those men are not only risen with Christ as an objective truth, they are also quickened subjectively (@Colossians 2).
The basket is placed down there at the altar of God by the priest, and the man worships. And the scripture goes on to say, "And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the land, which thou, Jehovah, hast given me" (verse 10). The man is in the land, and he recognises that God has brought him there and given it to him, and he says, I have brought the firstfruits; he had brought them to God. It is a great thing for God to find in us the gracious fruit of the Spirit formed in our affections, so that morally Christ appears and not the Aramaean. The word says: "And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God". Now it seems to me that all these things are found today in the assembly.
Then, "And thou shalt rejoice in all the good that Jehovah thy God hath given to thee, and to thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is in thy midst". There is the side of things that God
{114}
indicates for His people. God receives His portion from us, and there is joy, there is abundance, and there is joy, not only for ourselves, but also for the Levite and the stranger. The Lord's servant is not neglected, neither is the stranger.
Such, beloved friends, is the order of things that God has inaugurated here upon the earth in connection with Christ risen from the dead. His beloved people are formed by the Spirit, and thus all those things come to pass in the assembly.

"HIS INHERITANCE"
E. J. McBride
@Genesis 24: 43 - 46, 52 - 67; @Genesis 25: 5, 6; @Romans 8: 9, 10; @Colossians 2: 2, 3; @Ephesians 3: 16 - 21
Well now I pass on for a moment to what we may see in connection with the epistle to the Colossians; it is very interesting; there the apostle says, "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". Now you can understand the picture in Genesis: you can understand the impression that the servant must have given of his master; there was no question whatever of what they gave to the servant; they gave him nothing; but he begins to unfold the illimitable wealth of Isaac. Oh! I wish we took it in. If a person were prepared to listen to the Spirit's account of Christ, what would impress one would be the extraordinary wealth of Christ, and what God had gained for Himself in that blessed Man. And it
{115}
was to this end that the apostle exercised himself on behalf of the saints at Colosse; he says you need not go outside Christ for anything -- you are complete in Him, who is the Head of all principality and power. In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
Now when you come to consider the question of the state that is necessary in order to enter into the inheritance, and this is a point of very great importance, you will remember that what led the damsel to the conclusion that she should go with the servant was the treasure that he gave out at this particular juncture; we read, he brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebecca; he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. This is the picture that the Spirit of God gives to captivate the heart for Christ, and to get you to move in your affections to the scene where Christ is. Look how the Spirit lavishes the wealth of God upon you. Is His object that you and I might be established, and set up, and made glorious with the glory of this world? No, no. What is His object? It is that we might cut our connection with this scene, and move to where Christ is.
The servant says, Now I have had the liberty of bringing out the wealth of my master, and I must go back to him again, do not hinder me; and I think I can see in the spirit of the apostle Paul an intense longing to get the saints to move on that line. "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ", he
{116}
says, "seek the things which are above" (chapter 3: 1). Ah! seek them. The enemy says, 'Adapt yourself to the things that are down here; you had better stop with us; bring the light of the truth and establish a system here, so that we can all be benefited by it; do not mind going over to Canaan. The two-and-a-half tribes settled down here, and only went over occasionally'. But what does the Spirit say? "Do not hinder me". You may say, But if I were to move it would mean breaking loose with my father, mother, sister, brother, all the household, and all that I have been interested in, all my life. Ah! but just look at the wealth, the ring and the bracelets, and the jewels of silver and jewels of gold. How the Spirit of God delights to give an external view of Christ to the affections of His people, so that they might cut loose from the things in this world and move towards Him. The Lord help us, beloved, to respond to the presentation of Christ, so that we may, like Rebecca of old, put them on and say, "I will go". Do not think, beloved, that these things are just to be listened to and passed over. The Lord looks for decision, definite and distinct, that we should be set in the line of the exercises of the Spirit of God for us.
The Spirit of God takes up the journey, He accepts the responsibility; and what is He doing on the road home? He is strengthening you with might in the inner man. I venture to say that between the moment that Rebecca cut loose from her own family circle and the time she saw, in type, God's blessed
{117}
Man meditating in the field, she had her affections strengthened by her communications with the servant. And what is the object and intention of ministry? Why, to quicken, and increase, and intensify the spiritual affections of the saints; just think of it, the apostle bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He would grant the saints according to the riches of His glory to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith.
You say, What do you understand by that? I will tell you. There was a time when every interest that was common to men in the world had a place in my affections; but now I have before me another Man and another world; and the interests of that blessed Man now occupy the place that formerly was held by the things pertaining to this world. And what are His interests, beloved? -- His inheritance is in the saints. And I venture to say that when you come into a local meeting, and look around on, it may be, only two or three, you have a profound impression of what they are to Christ. People may say, Oh! what a poor lot they are. Ah! they have never seen them rightly; to see the saints properly you must have the Christ dwelling in your heart by faith. You look around, and you are unconscious of any peculiarities they may have; instead you see the preciousness of Christ in them.
Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac meditating in the field at eventide, and she asked the servant who he was; and do you know what he said?
{118}
-- "That is my master!" How beautiful to see God giving us a record in the Scripture of the delight that the Spirit has in being at the service of Christ. "He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (@John 16: 14). And I believe, beloved, that nothing is a more real delight to the Spirit of God than to retire behind the affection that He has created for Christ, and to watch those affections in their own proper movement, in their own proper sphere, and to contemplate the delight of Christ in them.
Do you not think it was a moment of supreme delight to the servant when he saw Rebecca array herself? What a delight to the Spirit of God when the hope of His calling has laid hold of saints, and then to quietly go out of sight, that Christ might have His unique and proper place in the midst of His gathered people. There is a day coming when He is going to have a public display; when every eye shall see the supreme place that Christ has in the affections of His people; but the Spirit of God desires that He should have that place now. That is the hope of our calling. We are called to be the vessel in which Christ has His rightful place, that in the very midst of the confusion, and in the scene where the enemy's power is, there should be glory to God in the church, world without end. As we were reading a short time since, Joshua commanded the sun and moon to stand still (@Joshua 10: 12); what a day; and what was seen at that moment? The power of God in His delight to have man entirely for Himself; one to whom He could listen.
{119}
Now, beloved, just think of being called. There will be no barrier in the coming day; but why does the Spirit of God want us on the heavenly ground now? That there might stand on this earth, in the very spot where the man of sin will stand, a living witness to God's delight in His blessed Son. What is He going to do for that company? Scripture is so beautiful -- the servant told Isaac all that he had done. Now, I would like to say one word to encourage you; just think of the servant telling Isaac how the same spirit, the spirit of Isaac, had come out in Rebecca; then he related to him the history of the home from which she had come, and how she had left all to come to him; when she was asked would she go, she responded, 'Yes, I will go'. I believe it will be supremely delightful to the Spirit to bring the company in to Christ, and -- I speak reverently -- to report all the incidents that occur in it, the pathway here, that Christ may welcome the company in all the warmth of His everlasting love. What did Isaac do? He took her into the place where Israel had been, and he was comforted.
People have sometimes said to me, Why are we not caught up to be with Him now? Why do we wait? I will tell you: there are certain things that have to transpire in the ways of God before He can renew His links with Israel; and the church holds the ground until the moment arrives for those links to be renewed. Now there are two sides to this privilege; one is that you stand for Christ here. What is the other? The other is that there is an inside spot, and
{120}
there are communications of a spiritual character inside that will never be known by anyone but Isaac and Rebecca, typically.
If you were to ask me what I coveted above everything on earth, I should say it was to know a little more of those inside communications. You may ask me, is there any scripture for that? There is; if you were to read at your leisure from the 1st verse of the 4th chapter of John's gospel to the 16th chapter, you would find some of those communications. Do you know what happens at the close of them? The heart that made them prays. The heart that made those communications prays that the Father, about whom the communications were, might make good, in the company, the force and meaning of them. Beloved, we have a wonderful calling. We are not called to do exploits on earth, to convert the world, or do some stupendous acts; we are called to fill a peculiar place in the heart of the blessed Son of the Father's love. May God give us grace, so that there will be wholehearted response from every one of us, for His Name's sake.

THE GLORY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD
J. Revell
@Romans 5; @Romans 8
We read in @Romans 5 of the glory of God in the hope of which the believer boasts (verse 2); in @Romans 8 we read of the manifestation of the sons of God
{121}
(verse 19), and the glory of the children of God (verse 21). God has become glorious in the eye of faith, and He will eventually display that glory before the face of all; in our Lord Jesus Christ man has become glorious, and into that glory it is God's purpose to bring His loved ones. Man, in his estrangement from God, has sought glory, and in his own way he has gained it, for the scripture speaks of the glory of man; but it speaks of it to show how vain and short- lived it is, comparing it to the flower of the grass which falleth away (@1 Peter 1: 24). This must be so, seeing that death rests upon man as God's judgment. Man may gain great renown among his fellows, and clothe himself with honour, but he passes away and his glory fades. The One to whom God has given glory has passed through death, and has been raised from the dead, the token of God's having been glorified in His death respecting sin, and also of the breaking forever of the power of evil. The renown which He has, therefore, is deathless, and can never fade away. It is through Him that God carries out all His purpose of love, and His end is to have us in association with Christ, as the many sons whom He brings to glory.
The expression of God's purpose concerning us is seen in Christ glorified, and what corresponds to this with us on earth is the gift of the Spirit. The Spirit was not given until Jesus was glorified (@John 7: 39), and He has come to us as the Spirit of that glorified Man; He is to us the Spirit of glory. But if so, He must set aside in us all that is morally of the
{122}
flesh, He must deliver us from all its activity, for only thus can we be enabled to enter into all the precious thoughts of the love of God. In @Romans 8 the Spirit is thus first presented to us as freeing us from the mind and activity of the flesh. Then the thoughts of God's love are touched upon. As led of the Spirit we are sons of God, having received a spirit of sonship. A slave may be emancipated and yet retain a slave's spirit. God displaces the spirit of slavery by a spirit of sonship. The Holy Spirit who is given to us (chapter 5: 5), so sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts that we become formed in reciprocal affection and cry to God with holy delight, "Abba, Father". The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God. Our glory as children of God is not yet made known to the world. Another apostle says, "For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not" (@1 John 3: 1). The Spirit maintains it in the intelligence of our spirits as the present secret of the love of God.
Heirship is attached to it; "If children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs" (chapter 8: 17). The love of God is known as a present reality, and in the knowledge of that love we know that with Christ He will freely give us all things; we are to be sharers in all the range of the inheritance. But our glory is hidden, even as was His in whose steps we are called to follow. We are children and heirs; we have the love of God, and the inheritance as that which is His pleasure for us; but the world knows us not.
{123}
Consequently we are called to suffering. All this present period is marked by the sufferings of Christ. He was here a lonely Sufferer among men, and now the sufferings have to be taken up by His own.
Suffering is not peculiar to those who believe; the whole creation groans and travails in pain together. What is peculiar to the Christian is that he is instructed in the mind of God concerning it all, and through the Spirit he becomes the vessel of holy feelings and intelligent desires which are according to the mind of God. The groan of creation tells of a world brought into vanity and under the bondage of corruption through the sin of man who was placed over it all. The Son of God upon earth groaned and wept in the presence of sorrow and death, although He carried in His bosom the secret of divine love, and was Himself the resurrection and the life, the One by whom God would fulfil all His purpose of love, bringing life out of death and setting all in incorruption. We groan within ourselves, having in our hearts the secret of divine love through the Spirit, and waiting the actual fulfilment of divine purpose when we shall reach the place of sonship for which we are destined, with the redemption of the body.
The creation also awaits this blessed moment. The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. When man sinned, the shadow of his sin fell upon the whole creation; when the sons of God shall be revealed, the light of their glory will be the deliverance and
{124}
blessing of creation. The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. That which is now the precious secret of our souls, the love of God, will then come into open display, and will pervade the universe of bliss. The world will then know that the Father sent the Son, and that His own, who have believed on Him, have been loved as He has been loved. This will give its character to the whole creation which will participate in the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
In @Revelation 21 the church is seen in its relation to the earth, under the figure of a city, the centre of administration. It descends from God out of heaven, invested with the glory of God. It is the figurative setting forth of those who are children of God, now unknown of the world, partakers of the divine nature, brought into display, and inheriting with Christ. Light shines from the holy city for the nations upon earth, and healing and blessing flow from thence.
What a separating effect must all this have upon him who through grace enters into it! The eye penetrates below the surface of man's glory and sees the corruption to which the whole creation has become subject, and into the ear enters the groan which can never be hushed until Christ reigns. But in the midst of it we know the love of God, and in the enjoyment of that love we not only trace our own blessing of superlative degree, but we also know the peace and bliss which shall shortly fill the earth.
{125}
Thus we can quietly wait, giving ourselves to prayer, in which we are aided by the Spirit, who makes intercession for saints according to God.

FOLLOWERS OF JESUS
F. S. Marsh
@John 1: 35 - 41; @John 10: 3 - 5; @John 12: 26; @John 19: 25 - 27; @John 21: 19 - 22
Each of the four gospels lays emphasis upon the thought of believers being 'followers' consistently with the presentation of Christ in the gospel.
In Matthew we are to loyally follow Christ, the rejected King; in Mark, Jesus the perfect Servant has those who follow Him in the path of service; the evangelist Luke describes the followers of the lowly Man, Christ Jesus; but in the gospel of John the followers of the Son of God are seen in their various characteristics.
Following does not mean having followed; it is not some incident in our past history: the normal present feature of the Christian is that he is following.
By profession all believers are followers of Christ. If we, who have believed in Him, who are cleansed by His precious blood, and who love Him, were challenged by an unbeliever, we should have no hesitation in confessing that Jesus is our Lord and that we are His followers; yet that is not sufficient. It is not enough to be a professed follower, nor to have followed in the past; the great objective of the Spirit of God, especially in this gospel, is to ensure that we
{126}
should each, at the present moment, be following; that spiritual movement should be marking us now; so that instead of going back, or turning aside, we should be making steady forward progress, with Jesus, the Son of God, as our Object.
A follower is one who has come under the influence and attraction of another, having been so impressed that he has turned his back upon that which once held him, and is now definitely pursuing his object.
There is an outstanding instance in the Old Testament of such an one. Five times in the Holy Scriptures it is recorded that Caleb "wholly followed Jehovah" (@Numbers 32: 12; @Deuteronomy 1: 36; @Joshua 14: 8, 9, 14), and once Jehovah said of him that "he hath another spirit in him and hath followed me fully" (@Numbers 14: 24).
How important it is in this day of great profession, and yet of sad departure from the truth, that this should be true of each one, that we are wholly following the Lord and that we should not be found in company with those of whom it was said, "From that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him" (@John 6: 66).
How many spiritual shipwrecks are the result of not wholly following! Peter failed so seriously because he "followed afar off" (@Luke 22: 54). We may well exclaim, as the bride said in the Song of Songs, "Draw me, we will run after thee" (chapter 1: 4). This is not a spasmodic movement, but following steadily in a clear, straight, positive path -- the path
{127}
of the just which is "as the shining light, going on and brightening until the day be fully come" (@Proverbs 4: 18) -- until the coming of the Lord.
Following is such a full word in the gospel of John. It may have been limited in some minds to the initial thought of discipleship, but this inspired writer does not do so; he develops it to its fulness. He speaks of following in the first chapter, and carries the thought, by the Spirit of God, to the close of his gospel, thus emphasising its importance, each mention having a distinctive significance.
This is so important for those who are young, who have not yet wholly committed themselves to the Lord. He would bring them under His influence, and draw them by His own personal attractiveness; for every heart must have an object, and every path must have an end! Persons are held by that which allures and attracts the heart. How encouraging to discover that while many are held by objects other than Christ, there is on earth today a vast number of people who are truly following Him.
Paul, in his epistle to the Philippians, speaking as a pattern Christian, says, "but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it, seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus" (chapter 3: 12). He had been set in movement by the glory and attractiveness of Christ, to pursue with diligence and spiritual energy the path that leads to Christ in glory, so that he could say, "I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (chapter 3: 8). Thus many
{128}
things that were once his objectives are now thrown aside and counted as filth that he might "gain Christ; and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which would be on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God through faith" (chapter 3: 9).
*Followers of Jesus, pages 1 - 4 [1 of 3]*.
SURE GUIDANCE
C. A. Coates
@Exodus 13: 21
"And Jehovah went before their face by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; so that they could go day and night". This comes in at the end of a chapter in which His people are seen as holding themselves hallowed unto Him, putting away all leaven and owning themselves to be ransomed.
If these conditions are maintained we shall have sure guidance; God becomes the Guide and Light of His people; He would not have His saints to take one step in uncertainty. Whether it be in bright circum-stances or in dark,
<blockquote>'Light divine surrounds thy going, <br> God Himself shall mark thy way' (`76:3). </blockquote>

{129}
THE LOVE OF THE SAINTS
B. W. Burton
@Matthew 22: 35 - 40; @1 Peter 1: 6 - 8; @John 13: 34, 35; @Galatians 5: 13; @Colossians 1: 3, 4; @Philippians 1: 9, 10
I want to say a word, beloved brethren, about the love of the saints. I think the more we contemplate and enjoy the love of Christ, the more we shall be able to reflect that love amongst His people. I would encourage the younger brethren, that, as coming in amongst the Lord's people, you come into a sphere of affection. If you love the Lord you will want to serve Him, and I think He would show you that the sphere of service is primarily amongst His people. We should be encouraged to see that, as enjoying something of Christ's love and the love of God, we are enriched and have the wherewithal to promote things amongst the Lord's people.
I would like to speak of love in two ways. The first two scriptures speak of love in a vertical sense, that is, love towards God, and love for Christ. The other verses that we have read speak of love working out horizontally amongst the Lord's people. I think the two go together, and the verses we have read in Matthew confirm that. The Lord speaks of two commandments: He speaks of the first and then He says, "And the second is like it". So that these two thoughts are not to be divorced -- what we may enjoy, and what we may contribute in the way of affection Godward, and in relation to Christ, is to correspond with our love for the Lord's people. Persons who are marked by affection, I think, have a
{130}
great advantage in Christianity. That is illustrated in Mary in @John 20. Affection held her, and, while Peter and John went away home, she was detained in pure and outstanding affection for Christ: "they have taken away my Lord" (verse 13), and it led to her being given an outstanding message. The Lord would encourage each of us to be marked increasingly by affection for Himself. He has great interest, I believe, in persons who have unadulterated affection for Him.
I read the verses in Matthew to speak first about love for God. It is well to look to the Source of all our blessing. This lawyer questions the Lord as to which is the great commandment, and the Lord simply says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding". There was no room for anything else. I think God would put in His exclusive claim to each of His own. John tells us that "*We* love because *he* has first loved us" (@1 John 4: 19). I would like to encourage each one in the reality of a link with God, the Source of all. He has demonstrated His love in the gift of His Son, and in the fulness of the blessing that flows to us at the present moment. How full the heart of God is! I think God would put in His claim for us, and that it should appeal to each one of us how He has loved us, and how He does love us, and how we are served in divine grace at the present moment. It all has in mind that we should be secured as lovers of God.
In this world it is not fashionable to be a lover of

God. In @2 Timothy 3 Paul speaks of the character of "the last days" (verse 1), and one feature is that men "shall be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God" (verse 4). The natural reaction of the heart is to please itself, but Christ has died to deliver us from that, and bring us into liberty, not liberty to do as we please, but liberty to draw near to God, to believe that He is, and be marked by affection towards Him. I would encourage each young believer to be in reality a lover of God. You will find others that are like-minded. You can be restful in such company, and be a source of comfort to another. There is an area where the praise of God is secured amongst those who love Him.
We should think about what our affections are set upon, whether we love God with all our heart. I think it will bring in peace and joy and a sense of fulness, that all that God has had in mind in shining out towards us is finding an answer in the believer. The Lord then says, "with all thy soul" -- the feeling part. How fine that is, that in spiritual emotion and affection, all that we are results in love Godward. Then "with all thy understanding" -- that is, with the mind too. We are to set our minds on the things that are above where the Christ is. There are many things in this world that can occupy the mind, but those are not the things that go to make up the personality of the believer, and God would put in His claim, dear brethren, to each one of us, that our whole affections, soul and understanding are all to be directed Godward. God is looking for it, and He
{132}
would have us entirely in accord with His thoughts. Well, I suppose in its fulness that awaits the time when every earthly hindrance is removed and we have bodies of glory. But in the meantime the Spirit is promoting this line of things with the saints here and now, that we should be numbered amongst those who are truly lovers of God.
The verses read in 1 Peter speak of love for Christ. We are looking for the moment when there will be "the revelation of Jesus Christ". How the saints love His appearing, love to think of that moment of Christ's glory -- and we shall be with Him. But Peter follows that with this beautiful touch, "whom, having not seen, ye love". Peter, of course, had been with the Lord and had seen Him literally, but he seems to have a peculiar feeling and affection for the saints to whom he is writing who had not seen the Lord. Most of the saints have not actually seen Jesus yet, as we know, although, of course, we see Him by faith. But even though we have not seen Him, we love Him. Oh! that we might love Him more. Peter seems to be building upon that here, giving them the credit for it. How enriching these thoughts are! What language the beloved apostle uses! He would encourage us to be amongst those who love the Lord Jesus Christ at the present moment. He is a real, living Person to us, and though we have not seen Him, we love Him. It is a challenge to each of us, is it not, as to how much we love the Lord? Oh! that our measure, in the reality of it, may be increased, and as it is, I believe, we shall
{133}
desire to serve Him, and I think He will show us what He will have us to do. So this leads to exultation with "joy unspeakable and filled with the glory". Is this not worth going in for? Younger brethren, you will not find anything to equal joy unspeakable and being filled with the glory.
Think of the place that Christ fills at the present moment. The Father "has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35). What glory is His! How attractive is the Person of Christ! Do you love Him as you ought? I do not suppose any of us love Him as fully as we ought at the present moment. But may the desire for it, and our measure in it, increase. I think the Spirit of God would help us, and faith would help us too. It raises the challenge, dear brethren, as to how much our life is bound up with Christ where He is, how much our minds are set on things above, and our affections engaged with the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I want now to speak of love working out horizontally. In @John 13 the Lord says, "A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another". Those whom the Lord was addressing knew very well what He was speaking of. How He had loved them! He had loved them through everything. They would have had a perfect demonstration in Him personally here of the provision of love: "as I have loved you, that ye also love one another". They were to take it up and work it out amongst themselves. What a challenge, yet I
{134}
believe they answered to it. What love was seen among the saints in the early chapters of the Acts. How things worked out so wonderfully in love, so that, when three thousand were converted in one day in Jerusalem, they could be absorbed among the saints, and there was administration there that could handle it. There is a challenge, dear brethren, in the working out of things at the present moment, and I believe each one is needed to help in it. We need to draw upon Christ.
I think there is great opportunity for each of us to be marked by these affections which were seen so perfectly in Jesus. The Lord says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves". I would encourage the younger brethren that, as coming among the saints, you should find a sphere which is permeated by love. We know that sometimes when persons get cold in their affections for Christ, they remark that there is not much love amongst the saints. Well, that is a sad thing, and of course, at times there may be some truth in it. If so, it should exercise us that we should put it right, because it is incumbent upon every one of us to see to our stock of love, and to see that, as drawing from Christ, we are able, beloved brethren, to bring in amongst His people that which will help, and will promote this atmosphere of love. It is a sphere of things that is to be known amongst those who are vitally in touch with divine affections at the present moment. This is what characterises the assembly: she is to be a reflection of Christ here. I
{135}
think that involves that there are persons that have come under divine discipline and instruction, persons that are subject to the Lord's word and commandment, and persons that can bring in love, each one contributing to it. May it work out in all of our localities. I believe it does, but I suppose we would all agree that the measure of it could be increased.
In @Galatians 5: 13 it says, "For *ye* have been called to liberty, brethren; only do not turn liberty into an opportunity for the flesh, but by love serve one another". Very simple words and yet very telling. As I said earlier, if you love the Lord you will want to serve Him. If you get into His presence you will find out from Him what He has for you to do. I think He would point you, first of all, to your local brethren, and this word would come to each one of us, "by love serve one another". That is, the resource for the service is in our link with Christ. It is "by love", and the source of that is in God, expressed to us so perfectly and beautifully in Jesus, and we must draw from Him. If we are going to serve the saints, we must love them; and if we are going to love them, we must respect them. Although these words are very simple, I believe there is a good deal of instruction in them: "by love serve one another". If you do not remember anything else from this occasion today, take those words with you, and treasure them in your heart and mind, that you may be of service to your local brethren, first of all, because that is where the Lord has set you.
{136}
There is always the need for serving, admonishing, encouraging and strengthening one another, and I believe that by love we are helped to serve one another. So you may see a certain need among the saints, and it may be a very practical one. Well, love would meet that. @1 Corinthians 13 tells us a good deal about the practical results of love: what it does and what it does not do. If we take up these words, and want to work them out, the Lord will show us how to do it. He may put opportunities for service in our way, and He will, of course, also give the grace to meet them. When the Lord was here He would have discerned immediately every need amongst His people. If we are with the Lord in relation to His interests, and marked by affection for His people, He will show us what is needed, and He will give us the grace to meet the need, so that the spiritual health of the saints is improved, resulting in more for the Lord's glory.
Maybe, as we serve locally, the Lord would increase our sphere of service a little, and we may find that there are other things that we can do. I think the Lord has great opportunities at the present moment, especially for the younger brethren. If you turn to Him and are subject to Him, you will find that He will show you, dear brother and sister, what He has in mind for you to do. It may be a simple matter to begin with, but all service needs to be done in the grace in which Christ Himself would have done it. I believe He is very pleased with that, and I would commend it to you that the sense of His
{137}
approval in the serving of one another, as we draw upon Him, will be ample recompense for any sacrifice that we might make in relation to it.
From the verses in Colossians I believe the Lord would encourage us to have a wide and universal outlook. You have in Colossians, and also in Ephesians, the reference to love towards all the saints. Paul is giving thanks to "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually when praying for you, having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints". I think it is very encouraging to see persons who have a universal outlook. We should all be marked by that; we ought to have "love towards all the saints", but primarily in relation to those we walk with. We ought to have an interest, and affection, in relation to the whole work of God at the present moment, and to all that belong to Him. Would that there were more available to us, but at least we can have love towards all the saints, and pray for them, and I believe that is one way, an outstanding way, in which love towards all the saints would be realised. We would pray that the work of God universally should go forward, and that we might be helped in our measure to do things that will help that work forward. Thus our meetings for prayer will be marked by concern, interest and affection for the work of God wherever it is amongst the saints universally.
We are going to be with all the saints eternally, beloved brethren. What a moment it will be when
{138}
the Lord takes all His own, those that have died and are "with Christ", and the living who remain, to meet Him in the air! Think of all the saints together for the first time ever! I think the Lord would just encourage us to have this wide outlook in relation to what He is doing at present moment, to have prayerful and affectionate interest in it.
In @Philippians 1: 9 Paul is praying that "your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent". As footnote *h* indicates, it is not that the love itself increases, it is the character of the love, that it should abound more and more in full knowledge and intelligence. I believe Paul would not let the saints settle down, however fine the state of soul was in Philippi. What a place they had in his affections. How enriched he had been as a result of their ministration, but he is praying that their love might "abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence". And so, dear brethren, there is always room for increase. The Lord encourages us in meetings like this, I believe, lest we may rest in what we have already arrived at, blessed as that may be, so that we may be reaching out, as Paul says in chapter 3, towards the goal of the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (verse 14). Let us have interest and affection on this line of increase, praying that the love of the saints might abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, and then that we might have this approval and discernment as to
{139}
what is more excellent, and that we might be pure and without offence for Christ's day.
Every little bit of work for the Lord and the saints that is done at the present moment, every stitch that goes into the work of righteousness, is going to have its answer, beloved brethren, when the assembly will be ready for Christ: "his wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" (@Revelation 19: 7, 8). I believe that love amongst the saints at the present moment, love for Christ, love for God, and love for one another will result in an increase in what is for the pleasure and glory of Christ.
May we be encouraged in these things for His Name's sake.

FOLLOWERS OF JESUS
F. S. Marsh
@John 1: 35 - 41; @John 10: 3 - 5; @John 12: 26; @John 19: 25 - 27; @John 21: 19 - 22
The instances of 'following' in the gospel according to John are progressive in soul history. The two followers of whom we read in chapter 1 were men who had already been attracted by "a man sent from God, his name John" (verse 6), truly one of God's prophets; indeed, the Lord Himself said that "a greater prophet is no one than John the baptist" (@Luke 7: 28). He was a great man, and impressive, so that multitudes came to him, and under his
{140}
influence many were baptised, confessing their sins; and a great spiritual movement had taken place. No doubt John the baptist, a young man -- only thirty years of age -- with a distinctive message from God on his lips, marked by devotedness and energy, was exceedingly attractive. These two men had come under his influence, they had followed him, and had become his disciples. Was that the end of the matter? Indeed it was not!
It may be that there are many who have been attracted by the servants of God, helped and impressed by them, and who have followed them, being glad of the spiritual help they have received, but the work of God has not this objective in view. The one who has been the most help to us is not intended to become our object. No, the Lord would Himself become everything to our hearts. So there comes a test, as every true believer is tested, and it does not harm any of us. The question arises: Are you prepared to go forward, and take a further step than you have yet taken? Have you reached your real objective? As they were in company with the one whom up to that moment they had been following, who held and commanded them, there came before their vision the Son of God, and they listened to John breathing the very language of his heart, entranced by the glory of this Person. It was but a short word -- a most beautiful message -- "Behold the Lamb of God"! Here is a man who in the power of the Holy Spirit speaks five words with the understanding, with the result that his two disciples left
{141}
John and followed Jesus. They were *following in affection*.
We know the history so well; but we must dwell on it for a moment, because it is the beginning of this great spiritual development which is to reach a point in our history when Christ fills the vision of our souls. The appreciation of Jesus as the Lamb of God is essential to us if we are to follow this path. We must tread it from the beginning; so these two disciples began their real spiritual history as followers of Jesus, by coming under His influence as the Lamb of God. "Behold the Lamb of God", they heard John say. How attractive that would be!
Think of the thousands of lambs slain during the past dispensation, all pointing on to this Lamb! It is as though, in the power of the Holy Spirit of God, those five words gathered up the whole of the Old Testament, and centred all the light of its types and shadows on this glorious Person, Jesus! The suggestion is that the two disciples saw the whole of the Old Testament teaching in relation to the types, set forth in a Person -- not that they understood the fulness of it, but they saw the Person who was Himself the Antitype -- the Lamb of God! How often they had eaten the passover lamb, and had looked back to the experience of their forefathers in Egypt! They understood little of the import of it; but now they see the Lamb of God, "as he walked". What an attractiveness there was about Jesus! Every step He took was filling heaven with delight and the heart of God with pleasure! And John the baptist, coming
{142}
under the influence of Christ, enraptured by the glory of His Person, exclaimed out of the fulness of his heart, "Behold the Lamb of God". That influence was so powerful that it transformed the lives of those two disciples: they followed Jesus! It meant leaving John, and going beyond him. It has to be so; often those who are used to the blessing of souls see them going further and following Jesus, and they rejoice in it.
Now these two disciples meet another test: the Lord Himself challenges them. It is a very interesting moment. Perhaps a fellowship meeting is an occasion for the Lord to challenge hearts. In the rush of life, the pressure of business, and of home life, it is so easy to get distracted; but in the quietude of such an hour, with nothing to occupy us save the immediate matter before us, the Lord Himself would take the opportunity to say, "What seek ye?" Let every heart be prepared for the challenge! The Lord knows whether we are wholehearted. We must emphasise the seriousness of being half-hearted. 'Oh, he is a believer!' they say -- but is he wholeheartedly following in the path? Is he going after Christ? If not, what will happen? Spiritual shipwreck. Persons cannot be held by mere outward belief. They may assent to the truth, they may even have a living faith in the Saviour, but that in itself will not hold them; it must be Himself they are following if they are to be held.
Dear christian friend, we appeal to you with the deepest affection, and urge you to be wholeheartedly
{143}
for Christ, to be marked by wholly following the Lord. Is there anything standing between you and this wholehearted committal to Christ? Is there any object claiming your attention that would divert you from the path of true discipleship? If so, may the Lord attract you by the glory of His Person so that you can let nothing stand in the way of devotedly following Him! Let us remind you that the service of God in all its glory and greatness is being continued today on earth by wholehearted brothers and sisters; those who have come under the influence of Christ, who have yielded their bodies a living sacrifice, and who are prepared to devote all that they have to the highest and best interests of the service of God here. Those who are half-hearted retard progress, cause difficulties, present other objects, stumble in the path, and alas! often turn out of it to the discouragement of others. Those who are unreservedly committed to the path, experience the grace of Christ upholding them, the power of the Holy Spirit with them; and unquestionably the service of God is maintained in spiritual power by those who are marked by wholeheartedness.
These two disciples had to be challenged: "What seek ye?" Is it a matter of curiosity, or some personal gain, some ulterior motive? Let our hearts be challenged in the presence of Christ. "What seek ye?" That is a very searching word! Their answer is, "Rabbi ... where abidest thou?" They employed the choicest title they knew. They are now whole-heartedly under the influence of Christ. He may lead
{144}
them where He will: wherever He leads them they will go. They have Christ before them: that is the secret. He says, "Come and see". The Lord will always encourage those seeking Him. Never has there been a seeker who sought Him in vain when he has sought Him with all his heart. Solomon, Hezekiah and many others in the Old Testament demonstrate this beyond question.
What is presented to us in chapter 1 of John's gospel is a necessary preliminary to what is developed later. In chapter 10 the question arises of *following with the flock*. The Lord said, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (verse 27). In the first nine chapters of John the work of God is seen proceeding and developing. Individuals are brought forward to illustrate certain stages or developments of the work in souls. In our spiritual history it is intended that we should step into the blessing indicated in these individuals; in other words, that each should receive the blessing Nicodemus gained in his interview with Jesus; the living water which the woman of Samaria received; that each should be empowered to walk as the paralytic man in chapter 5; and that, as the man in chapter 9, each should have his eyes opened, and be developed until he becomes a worshipper of the Son of God. But in chapter 10 the Lord begins to speak of His own collectively, as a flock, or a company -- not as individuals only, but the individuals now forming a flock; and He talks about leading them, and of their hearing His voice.
{145}
This brings us to this very interesting point: As a follower of the Lord Jesus, you will not be called upon to follow alone. The Shepherd will lead you to the flock. You will find He has His objective in mind, as well as you having yours. As the bride says in @Song of Songs l: 7,
<blockquote>"Tell me, thou whom my soul loveth, <br> Where thou feedest thy flock, <br> Where thou makest it to rest at noon; <br> For why should I be as one veiled <br> Beside the flocks of thy companions?" </blockquote>
Ah! she was learning the lesson. She had just said, "Draw me, we will run after thee!" now she says, There is only one place in which I can be found -- by the flock! A lonely sheep is a sick sheep, and resourceless. The only safe place for a sheep is to keep with the flock. We need to follow our Shepherd by the footsteps of His flock, not that of any other.
The Lord is opening our spiritual minds to see the importance of the assembly. An aged brother said recently, 'As I look back over more than sixty years which have elapsed since my conversion, how I thank God that soon after I was converted the light of Christ and the assembly dawned upon my soul, and I was brought to see that the christian path is not an individual but a collective one'. We are to walk together. The Lord would open your soul to this wonderful thought, that it is not an individual path in which the Lord would lead you as the Shepherd. Each has his own personal path to tread, we know; but what is involved in this thought of following is
{146}
that, under His leading, you find yourself with the flock. Has everyone here experienced what it is to come in this way under the leading and the shepherding and the feeding of Christ, under the care which He exercises towards the flock? Have you enjoyed the bounty of the Shepherd's provision for the flock, those pastures of tender grass? Are you following where He leads? How we need His Shepherd care! We are not wise enough either individually, or collectively, to get on without the ministry of the Shepherd. How He is serving us collectively today! But the whole secret of getting the gain of His shepherd care lies in following.
We should appreciate this much better if we understood the conditions in the East where the sheep are absolutely dependent upon the shepherd's leading to find their food, in a land where there are no fields, only patches of grass here and there. We do well, dear brethren, to recognise that despite all the wealth of ministry which is being given, with the Scriptures in our hands, and all the privileges which are available to us, we still need to come under the shepherd care of Christ, to find the pastures of tender grass, and to be kept together. What power there is with Him to hold us together! He says, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd" (verse 16) -- "one flock", not 'one fold'. There is no need for a fold now because the Shepherd is there, and He is the point of attraction: He holds the sheep together.
{147}
The fold is an artificial means of holding the sheep together, encircling them with a wall. The power of the Shepherd to hold the sheep individually and collectively makes unnecessary the appointment of religious leaders, organisations, committees, and such humanly devised means to hold together persons who are following Jesus in the path where He leads. The Lord has raised up leaders certainly; and we thank God for them! We should remember our leaders and follow their faith; but the Lord Jesus Himself is the Shepherd of the sheep, and He is the One we follow. So He takes us in chapter 10 from the individual into the collective thought. He says not only, 'I know my sheep', but He speaks of the one flock that we might each know consciously our part in it, proving all that the Shepherd can be to that flock collectively.
*Followers of Jesus, pages 4 - 15 [2 of 3]*.
THE INFLUENCE OF MANHOOD IN VIEW OF COMPLETION
P. H. Hardwick
@Deuteronomy 33: 1 - 8; @Daniel 9: 17 - 23; @2 Corinthians 10: 1 - 3; @Philemon 8 - 10
I would like to speak of these three men, Moses and Daniel and Paul, as exercising great influence among the brethren, among the people of God, and especially as helping them to reach completion in certain lines of exercise. Likewise we, as being near the end of the church's time and being concerned about completing everything which we have to
{148}
complete, may perhaps catch the spirit of these three men and be helped to influence one another, for good, for it must surely be said wherever there are brethren together, few or many, they do influence one another. Where divine love is operative and there is cleaving to the truth, the influence is for good, and it is to be calculated therefore that everything will be finished that should be. We shall end well, but as at Corinth we may have to face some adverse influence working at times in a person or in persons, and the lesson for us is to allow for the necessity for self-judgment in ourselves. This all has to be thought of when we are contemplating the thought of influence amongst God's people.
The first thing which really would arise in our thoughts would be the kind of person that a man is, so we may inquire at the outset of our meditation, what kind of a man is Moses, and particularly what kind of a man is he under pressure, when there are difficulties?
What we find is that Moses exhibits a wonderful spirit throughout the whole of his pathway, having in mind always great thoughts of God and great thoughts of God's people. Indeed these two things always go together. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that if we have poor thoughts of the saints it is likely we have poor thoughts of God. The two act and react upon one another; moreover, what is needed alongside of great thoughts of God and great thoughts of His people, is small thoughts of oneself, all seen very happily in Moses, Moses the
{149}
man of God.
The word used for man, as many will know, is *Ish*, meaning, I believe, that in all that Moses had to undertake whether for good or correction, or in suffering or in victory he always had the affectionate feelings of a man, as I might say, a husband. He had, as it were, God's feelings for His people. God says of them later, "I was a husband unto them" (@Jeremiah 31:32), and I believe Moses shines in this particular way as he shone in affection and real husbandly thoughts towards God's people. He would not be hard unless he had to be.
We think of him as even hesitating to speak, "I am slow of speech" (@Exodus 4: 10), he says. Stephen says of him later, "mighty in his words and deeds" (@Acts 7: 22), but he says of himself, "slow of speech". It was no doubt a thing which God helped him in, but that is what he says and that is what he meant. Think of the meekness of spirit too, which marked such an one, even under the most irritating circumstances of the whole people worshipping a golden calf, Moses going up to the mountain and saying he would pray for them, "perhaps", he says, "I shall make atonement for your sin" (@Exodus 32: 30). Think of being served, dear brethren, by a man like that. We have known the spirit of that in our day.
Again when the people were calling out for flesh, Moses confesses that God had told him to carry all these people in his bosom, as a nursing father carried the suckling (@Numbers 11: 12) . Think of being served
{150}
for forty years by a man of that spirit and being brought by such a man to the fringe of the heavenly land. We have been brought in just such a spirit by many of those who have led and helped us; we have been brought now, as it were, to the very fringe of the land. We are in the plains of Moab, as we may say, our eyes lifted up across the Jordan thinking of the good land and the goodly mountain and Lebanon; we are thinking of heaven, the assembly being the 'anteroom' to heaven; we are thinking of all that is heavenly now which we may say a man like Moses would help us to reach, reach in spirit, that which we are soon going to reach literally.
So we are led to think of the spirit of a man like Moses, how he would impress the greatness of the inheritance upon us, as Paul says in our day, that we have a holy calling, a heavenly calling, a high calling, the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 3: 14). It is that kind of thing which Moses typically sets out, and with which he charges himself through many a wearisome year in the wilderness to bring the people to at the end.
So Moses¬ blessing is beautiful, dear brethren; he himself is about to depart and he leads the brethren, as you might say, with great thoughts of God and His movements, and great thoughts of the saints. What a great God we have! God in His holy movements, as it says, He "came from Sinai", that is in His majesty. How majestic are His movements! Especially how they appeal to us at the present time. Our God moves in majesty according to His own
{151}
rights of glory, coming from Sinai; then He "rose up from Seir unto them" ... God ... would cover every part of our wilderness journey, dear brethren, with great majestic shining, as from Himself.
This is our God, and He is not moving alone, as He says through Nathan to David, He walked the wilderness with Israel "in a tent and in a tabernacle" (@2 Samuel 7: 6), content to go along in all the lowly humble circumstances which belong to a pilgrim people. Who can compass a God like that? So great He is and yet coming down so low, and yet the pilgrims that He accompanies are necessary to Him in His love, and so He comes down like this in order to shine upon us and encourage us in the way. We might well, therefore, dear brethren, encourage one another at the end of the day with great thoughts of God, for He is our Father, He is our Saviour, He is our God, the eternal God, but He has come down so close to us that we can know Him even in our pathway right to the end.
Then these wonderful thoughts about the saints, not forgetting the place that Moses had amongst them, for there was never a lawgiver like him. The law here is not merely the enunciation of the ten commandments, it is that which the people of God are to live in. That is the heritage; nothing more happy than for us to find out what it is to live in the blessedness of the will of God, that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It is not merely that which is put before us at the outset but that which opens out before us in all its grandeur, and includes
{152}
the great thoughts of God's purposes, as it says in Ephesians, "the good pleasure of his will" (chapter 1: 6). These are to be the things which we live in especially at the end of our time, and Moses is set before us here in the end of the time as being the one that commanded a law. He is likewise king in Jeshurun, a man enshrined in a kingly way in the affections of the saints, shining particularly when they are together.
Well, this is Moses, the man of God. Not only has he a great place himself, not only would he give us great thoughts of God, but he would ensure, as it were, that we should step over into our heavenly inheritance as understanding God's best thoughts about His people. Think of His blessing, think of Reuben, meaning 'See! a son'. We may say that Reuben personally in Genesis is not much; he has had a shameful history ... But now, it is not a man, we may say in our case it is not even a tribe, it is the whole of the people of God who are to shine in the great matter of sonship. For God is going to have His people as sons before Him for ever. He has not just thought of it, it is that which He has had before Him from before the foundation of the world, as it says, "marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself" (@Ephesians 1: 5).
We may well admire God's pattern in sonship in Christ, the blessedness of being in such a relationship, God rending the heavens at least three times to speak to His Son, saying not only, "This is", but "Thou art", "Thou art my beloved Son". God
{153}
would speak thus in a way to show us that intimate relationships and love are entwined in this matter of sonship. He is calling, you might say, upon His sons to be released, saying to the north, "Give up", and to the south, "Keep not back" (@Isaiah 43: 6). Literally this is a word for Israel, spiritually a word for us, God wanting us all released in the glory of sonship for Himself ... We should exercise ourselves to see that we are keeping the company of the best of God's people that we can find, those who walk in the light and the joy and the love and the intelligence of God's sons. If we can find them, let us walk amongst them, for they are soon to cross over into the land ... He has the praise of God in mind too, in speaking of Judah whose name means 'praise', for praise is being released; it is released now, "Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah", the voice is going up in the assembly, the great praises of God, praises of Israel as we read, in which God dwells. These are the great signs of maturity, the great matters of completion with which the saints will finish as going over into their heavenly inheritance. David in his day even lowered the age of the young men, the Levites, that they might come earlier into the service of praise. God would thus have His assembly fuller and more resonant with the praises of His people. We might well take in that word, I would submit to the brethren, "Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah".
Then Levi, whose name means 'joined', "joined to the Lord" (@1 Corinthians 6: 17), I suppose, preparing our hearts for the saints being united to Christ. Of Levi it
{154}
is said, "Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one". The Thummim first, the *perfection* first before the *light*, meaning, I believe, that Levi has got on, we may say, in his soul, that is to say, the brethren have got on; they have *arrived* at something; there is not only now light about the truth, but there is arrival at the truth. "Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one". Levi has something and that would be, dear brethren, I judge, a voice for us, that we should see that we are arriving somewhere.
The gifts have been many within our own time, not apostles, but the apostolic writings, then the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, the teachers; we have them all, we may say, but it is for us now to see that we do not fail to *arrive*, as it says "until we all arrive ..." (@Ephesians 4: 13). God said to Israel, not only "the land which I give you", "the land into which I bring you", but the land "into which ye *come*", as if God would urge upon us in the end, the glorious end, that we should be arriving at something substantial in the truth.
Well, that is not all that is said about Moses, but it is sufficient, perhaps, to show what kind of a man he is, what kind of influence he exerts over the people and what kind of things he said, and what kind of things he was thinking about, for these things we would say now are to be constantly in our minds, great thoughts of divine Persons and great thoughts of the saints. Thus he blesses the people.

HUSBANDS
E. Dennett
@Ephesians 5: 25 - 33; @Colossians 3: 19; @1 Peter 3: 7
The duty of the husband is quite as simple as that of the wife. As hers is comprised in the word "obedience", his is contained in that of "love". The wife, if a direction sent to a special class be excepted (@Titus 2: 4, Authorised Version), is never commanded to love her husband. It is taken for granted that she will do so; and, as a matter of fact, she seldom fails in this direction. Even though she may be unequally yoked -- be united to one who has not the least sympathy with her holiest feelings, and receive little but unkindness, her love will survive the harshest treatment. Crushed and trodden under foot, it will spring up and greet the first display of kindness with a forgiving embrace. It is a perennial fountain. But with the husband it is often otherwise. With fewer of the tender emotions, engrossed by his daily occupations, and exposed, it may be, to severer temptations, his danger is to forget his responsibility to love -- or at least to manifest his love to -- his chosen wife. Hence the Spirit of God recalls his responsibility to mind, and gives this injunction, "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word", etc.
1. Let us consider what is to be the character of the husband's love as here enjoined. "Husbands love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved
{156}
the assembly". It is a most wonderful standard; and no doubt here introduced because of the typical character of true marriage, because the primal marriage between Adam and Eve displayed, in figure, the union between Christ and the church. This should ever teach us the sanctity and real character of marriage before God.
What then, we may enquire, was the character of Christ's love to the church? The answer is here given. First, He proved it by giving Himself for it (verse 25); and He gave Himself to death for it, and thereby in fact purchased His bride. 'He gives Himself; it is not only His life, true as that is, but Himself. All that Christ was has been given, and given by Himself; it is the entire devotedness and giving of Himself. And now all that is in Him -- His grace, His righteousness, His acceptancy with the Father, His wisdom, the excellent glory of His person, the energy of divine love that can give Itself -- all is consecrated to the welfare of the assembly. There are no qualities, no excellencies in Christ, which are not ours in their exercise consequent on the gift of Himself. He has already given them, and consecrated them to the blessing of the assembly which He has given Himself to have. Not only are they given, but He has given them; His love has accomplished it'. And this gift of Himself is greatly enhanced when we remember that it was upon the cross that this gift was consummated.
Secondly, His love is displayed in His sanctifying and cleansing the church with the
{157}
washing of water by the word (verse 26). This exhibition of love is a present thing, that which goes on now, and by which He suits it to Himself. 'It is important to remark that Christ does not here sanctify the assembly to make it His own, but makes it His own to sanctify it. It is first His, then He suits it to Himself'. The means is the word, the washing of water by the word, the truth taught in @John 13 by the washing of the disciples¬ feet by the Lord. And there, it will be remembered, it is in connection with His love. "Having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" (verse 1). The sanctifying and cleansing of the church is thus the expression of His abiding and unchanging love -- love that finds its delight in making it morally suitable to Himself, and hence never wearies in watching over, tending, and preparing it for Himself.
Thirdly, the fruit of His love is seen in the object He has before Him -- "that he might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless". This refers to the time when the Lord shall have returned to receive His church to Himself, or more exactly, to the period indicated when it is said, "the marriage of the Lamb is come" (@Revelation 19: 7) ...
And wherefore have we this wondrous description of the love of Christ for the church? To show what should be the character of the husband's love for his wife. "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly". Not to press
{158}
too closely the comparison in all its parts, we yet cannot fail to observe, that as Christ's love preceded His giving Himself for the church, so there cannot be a true union in the sight of God unless it has sprung from love. Love, and love only, should be the motive of the choice; and love must cement and beautify the union when formed. The whole element of the married life should be love; and not only so, but if the husband looks upon the standard here given, he will see that the one and constant demand the wife will make upon him is for love. His love must endure -- survive all trials, unweariedly seeking to draw his wife closer and closer to himself, and ever keeping before him (as to earth) the object of a union which, as it has sprung from, can only be cemented by, an unchanging and indefatigable love. Nothing less can be intended by this divine model.
A special application may perhaps not be out of place. Many a christian husband finds himself united to an unbeliever; but his duty remains the same. And as the love of Christ seeks the eternal blessedness of the church, so the love of the husband will not be satisfied with seeking to secure the present comfort and happiness of his wife; but it will be exhibited in watchful and tender ministry of that word which brings the knowledge of salvation, through faith in the Lord Jesus. Every husband indeed will feel the obligation of caring for the spiritual welfare of his wife; for it is in this direction that his love will more nearly partake of the same character as that of Christ for the church. Truly therefore marriage, according
{159}
to God, is no unimportant thing; and the more deeply this is felt, the greater will the husband feel the need of constant dependence, in order in any way to meet his responsibility. And, it may be added, the more constantly he is himself abiding in the sense of Christ's love, the more freely will his love flow out towards his wife.

THE SAINT AN EXOTIC
J. B. Stoney
A saint is an exotic here, he belongs to heaven, but as a vine-branch he is to yield fruit for God and man. There is really no soil for the vine here now; consequently there is no vine; but as we through the Spirit are abiding in Christ, and He in us, we bear fruit for God's heart. Christ was the Vine when here, and we have to maintain the virtues of Christ now that He is absent. We are to live Him here during His absence; but we are not of earth, for our Head is not here, though we are here for Him, and we act like Him here ... We are exotics, but we are here to represent and bear testimony to One who is absent; consequently, it is not ourselves we are thinking of or any one else, but the One who is everything to us, even Christ, whom we are seeking to express here where He is no longer ... The exotic yearns, and in a measure pines for its own clime, for there truly and fully it would be developed; but being here, where everything is adverse to it, and for Him from whom all is derived, He by the energy of His Spirit sustains
{160}
us in His own life down here. We can thus brave all that is against us, and maintain true constitutional vigour, and ability, too, to manifest the rarity and value of the grace and divine power which has made us exotics, and thus set forth, to the praise and glory of Christ, His name to a world which has not comprehended His beauty.
I am heavenly in nature, and it is as such that I set forth Christ. The more I maintain this, the more I repel the adverse moral influences bearing upon me; and the more I set forth the excellency and virtue of Christ. It is as I am an expression of Christ here, that I am really useful to others. The more I am, the more I exhibit what is the grace of God to man, the more the Father is glorified, and the more vigorous am I myself in my own heart; for because of the energy of the Spirit maintaining me in the life of Christ, I am in the healthy tone of constitutional strength. The more exotic you are, the more useful you are, the truer witness for Christ, and the healthier and happier you are; because, like one exercising one's self in frosty weather, you have the fresh glow of the virtue and power of life.
Be an exotic wherever you are, be it in the queen's palace or in the humble cottage. Let each eye see that you belong to heaven, and that you manifest the life of Jesus amid everything that is adverse to it here.

KNOWING THE MIND OF GOD AT THE PRESENT TIME
F. B. Frost
@John 13: 1 - 5; @2 Timothy 1: 6 - 15; @2 Timothy 2: 1, 2; @2 Timothy 3: 10 - 17
In reading these passages of Scripture the object is that we might know the mind of God at the present time. God knows the circumstances of the testimony in which we find ourselves, so it is a great advantage if we know what His mind is as to the whole situation, for it will help to bring stability and certainty into our souls.
There were many persons in Scripture who walked with God, who were acquainted with His mind at the time in which they lived. So God looks at the present moment for persons to be intelligent as to His mind in the difficult times in which we live. God has set these times for us, and He would have a word to say to us in regard to how we are to conduct ourselves.
So I have read in @John 13 the wonderful words of the Lord Jesus toward the end of His pathway here. He was about to go to the cross, and these words and actions of His would give us some impression of His understanding of God's mind in regard to that situation. He was about to leave His own who meant so much to Him: "Jesus ... having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end", that is, through every circumstance, and that love is still the same toward you and toward me. It says, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come", and "Jesus, knowing that the Father that had given him all things
{162}
into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God".
Then with Paul we have similar thoughts in 2 Timothy. He was at the end of his course, but he was in the secret of God's great thoughts as to the assembly and sonship. God intends that what He has established here on earth will continue, because the Spirit is here, and God can be hindered in no thought of His (@Job 42: 2). Now that is very encouraging. And God intends that not a single feature of the assembly shall be lost sight of, but rather that it should be livingly expressed in persons, and in our localities right through to the end.
It says of Enoch that he "walked with God" (@Genesis 5: 22). And, "before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God" (@Hebrews 11: 5). A man who walks with God is acquainted with the mind of God. Noah was another who "walked with God" (@Genesis 6: 9) and was acquainted with the mind of God. He knew that judgment was coming on the world, and he prepared an ark. In figure, that ark represented the assembly, and every feature of life was to be found in the vessel that he built. He was a builder because he knew what the mind of God was at that time. Jehovah said to Moses, "Come up to me into the mountain" (@Exodus 24: 12) and He gave him the pattern of the tabernacle. He learned what God's mind was for His people whom He had delivered from Egypt. "David gave to Solomon his son ... the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit" in relation to the house of Jehovah (@1 Chronicles 28: 11 - 19). David
{163}
knew what God's mind was. Daniel had his windows "open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem" (@Daniel 6: 10). He knew where God's name was, he knew the divine centre, that was his objective. Jeremiah invites the people, despite all the departure, saying, "let Jerusalem come into your mind" (@Jeremiah 51: 50). He knew what was uppermost in the mind of God, and that sustained him in the very trying circumstances in which he was.
It says in @John 13, "Jesus, knowing ... that he came out from God and was going to God". A few words, but how much was involved in those two wondrous movements! God's heart was set upon man, and His love, His holiness, His righteousness, His grace, His patience, His mercy, His sympathy and His power were made known in the Lord Jesus in His life here. Indeed His title was the Word -- the mind of God was expressed in Christ, and so we need to be continually occupied with Him.
There is going to be a glorious display in the world to come of God's thoughts as to the assembly, when He will "head up all things in the Christ" (@Ephesians 1: 10). The work of God is going on in saints now in view of that day of display, in those "who love his appearing" (@2 Timothy 4: 8), who are waiting for it. The assembly will come "down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God" (@Revelation 21: 10). How has she acquired that glory? Through the exercises of the wilderness pathway through which the saints of this dispensation have passed. What limitations the beloved apostle Paul had in prison. Was he cast
{164}
down? Not at all. He tells the Philippians, "Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice" (chapter 4: 4). You might say, Those are extraordinary words from a man who was in prison with the choicest thoughts of God made known to him to pass on to the saints. But he knew that God would triumph, he knew what the end would be. The same with John on Patmos, in very limited circumstances, he is the one who writes about the assembly coming down having the glory of God. What is substantial is going to be displayed. The assembly is a formation of Christ; what is of Himself is united to Himself.
I read in 2 Timothy because these verses remind us that the testimony is to be continued in life, despite departure: Paul says, "all who are in Asia ... have turned away from me". Now what is the secret of life? It is the life that is in Christ Jesus, that glorious Man who was once upon this earth, but who is now in glory. There is no change in His heart of love, no change in His sympathy, no change in His interest in and understanding of each one of His own. Think of the preciousness of His own to Himself, that blessed One, Christ Jesus, and He is living.
Now Timothy was no doubt overwhelmed by the current condition of things and the imminent departure of Paul, who was in prison. What was going to happen to the testimony? Paul writes these words in view of Timothy's timidity, and Paul reminds him of certain solid facts: there was unfeigned faith in his grandmother, and his mother,
{165}
and in him also. There was real faith in God. Those that walked with God of old certainly did so by faith. God said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" (@Genesis 18: 17). God loves to disclose His secrets to certain persons who are walking in faith, friends of God.
We are to "be emulous of spiritual manifestations, but rather that ye may prophesy" (@1 Corinthians 14:1). Footnote *h* to "emulous" reads, Or 'desire earnestly'. A prophet would be exercised to have the mind of God in regard to any circumstance that arises. That is something that is very exercising for us, but the way to arrive at it is to get rid of our own minds, first of all. Remember, the Lord Jesus was crucified at the "Place of a skull" (@Matthew 27: 33) -- that is the end of man's mind. The princes of this world had no idea of God's mind and God's thoughts: "for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory" (@1 Corinthians 2: 8).
Paul writes to Timothy, "in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God" (@1 Timothy 3: 15). It is the greatness of these things and how we regard them that is of all importance, and the Lord values every one who belongs to the assembly. So in his second epistle Paul tells Timothy, I want to stir you up, "to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee", so that you might not be slack, but take up the responsibility that is yours. We have received the gift of the Spirit, and we have the unceasing service of Christ on high to
{166}
help us in every situation. God has not given us a spirit of cowardice. We perhaps cannot explain God's ways with us, but through them God is forming this wondrous vessel which He is going to display in magnificent glory in the world to come.
I love to think of the joy that God will have in the display in the world to come of His own wondrous work. The work of creation is very wonderful, but think of the glory and greatness of the work of new creation! What will shine out is all of Christ. God has shone out in Christ, and there is the divine answer to it in the assembly. But where is that glory now? The glory is shining in the face of the Saviour where He is at God's right hand. Oh! that by the Spirit it might shine into our hearts. Once you have had a sight of the Man in the glory, it is like an anchor to the soul, it will hold you because He is the Centre of all God's thoughts. God will accomplish everything that He has in mind. As believers, we are essential parts of God's plan -- it involves you and me, and this gives us, I think, to realise not self-importance at all, but the divine point of view that we are necessary for the fulfilment of what is in God's mind, and particularly in the circumstances in which we are at the present moment. The Lord loves us for ever, right through to the end, and the Spirit has taken up His abode in us, and He abides with us for ever. We have these wonderful Resources at our disposal so that we might continue and be strengthened in the path of faith.
Paul was soon to depart this scene, and he was
{167}
concerned that the testimony should continue. So he says to Timothy, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord". Whatever little testimony there is to the rights of the Lord, we are not to be ashamed of it. If you confess the name of the Lord, you have all His power and protection behind that confession. That is a little part of the testimony, the confession of the name of the Lord. All will come to recognise Him as Lord in the day to come, "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea" (@Habakkuk 2: 14). What a day is about to dawn, the day of Christ's glorious appearing. But we are in the secret of it now.
So, there is a testimony being rendered at the present time of what is due to the Lord. One thing that is due to the Lord is that we should remember Him: a very great privilege that we have, and a means of preserving us in our affection for Him. We might have light as to the truth, but we need also to be preserved in our affections for Christ. Therefore we delight to assemble together to remember Him. How do you come to the Supper? I like to come to the Supper in faith of the Lord's promise, "I am coming to you" (@John 14: 18). Think of the grace of the Lord that He would give us by the Spirit a sense of His own blessed presence. Our hearts are freshly stirred by the magnificence of His love and His mighty sacrifice, and in the midst of it the Lord gives a fresh glimpse of His glory -- of the Person Himself. These are very precious things, but they are
{168}
part of the testimony of our Lord. Anybody can walk into the morning meeting and see it taking place. Yes, and many have received a lasting impression as a result of it. I bring that in because we need to have freshness marking the service of God. It is very important not only to have the knowledge of it, but the function of it should be in spiritual freshness of affection. God intends things to be carried on in life.
Why has God called you? It is according to His purpose, part of His plan. He has called you that you might fit in to the fulfilment of His thoughts and His plans. So Paul would remind Timothy of that. He has called us with a holy calling, according to His own purpose in grace given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time. Think of God knowing about you and about me before the ages of time! Wonderful facts these are, that in time He would call us to have part in, and appreciate, His greatest and most precious thoughts.
Paul knew he was about to be put to death, but he knew that the testimony would continue: "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him". Then he tells Timothy to "keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted". That good deposit for us, dear brethren, includes the truth that has been recovered to us, that Christ is Head in heaven, and His body here is united to Him by the Spirit. Lordship involves rule by authority, but the headship of Christ is rule by influence. It is by the influence of love that we are to
{169}
be kept.
Then Paul says to Timothy in chapter 2, "Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus". That is, there is a constant supply available from that blessed Man in glory. "The things thou hast heard of me ... these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also". Here is provision for the continuance of the testimony, of what is most precious to the mind of God, which was not made known in previous dispensations. And so Timothy is to hand on what he had learned from Paul to "competent" persons -- to vessels who would exemplify the teaching.
Paul says in chapter 3, "from a child thou hast known the sacred letters" -- and he had in mind that "the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work". There would be much work to be done after the apostle Paul died, and he is encouraging Timothy to go on with it. Paul addresses Timothy, "O man of God" (@1 Timothy 6: 11), one who would seek to be acquainted more and more with God's mind, and with His thoughts.
Well, may that desire remain with each one of us, that we might know more and more of the secret of God's thoughts, and, as a consequence, that they might govern our lives and our practice at the present time, despite all the adversity that we are faced with. May it be so, for His Name's sake.

THE INFLUENCE OF MANHOOD IN VIEW OF COMPLETION
P. H. Hardwick
@Deuteronomy 3: 1- 8; @Daniel 9: 17 - 23; @2 Corinthians 10: 1 - 3; @Philemon 8 - 10
Now coming to Daniel I am thinking of him as reading and praying. We may say, transferring him into our day, that he read the Scriptures and he read the ministry and therefore he gained intelligence, understanding.
This part of the book of Daniel is not the official service part, it is the more private and personal part, beginning with dreams and visions, and now reading and praying. The veil is lifted upon the private exercises and the private history of Daniel, between him and heaven. It underlies largely the public side of this great man's service and it is to be so with us all; whether serving in little or in much we are to have our private dreams and visions, reading and prayer and confession between ourselves and heaven. Otherwise there will be little or no power in the public service, and so we find Daniel here at the end of a certain period reading and praying and confessing. The dates will show that it was only a year or two before the people were released to go back to Jerusalem. We may not have long, dear brethren, before we are released to go to our own place on high. As we have been repeatedly told, there is not very much more time for reading and praying and learning and getting understanding.
{171}
Daniel was well using his time. He understood by the books, as it says, that "the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years" (verse 2). Sixty-eight of them had gone; he was very near the end. As being there you see it was a question now of a suitable attitude in view of the great release of the people of God. Shall anything hold us up, shall anything, morally speaking, prevent the Lord from having full pleasure in taking them to be with Himself? If so, let us pray and confess. Thus Daniel prayed, and you notice as he goes on he gets away from *I* and *me* and says *we* and *us* and *our* and within a very few verses his prayers are on the glorious level of what belongs to God; "thy people ... thy city ... thy sanctuary ... thy holy mountain". These are the things that Daniel speaks about in his prayer.
You can well understand that a prayer like that opens the way for power, and that the angel came at the time of the evening oblation. The evening oblation means power at the end, corresponding to the morning oblation. The man standing by the cross saying, "In very deed this man was just" (@Luke 23: 47) is in the presence of the evening oblation, the offering of the evening time. And now it is not Christ, it is the testimony of Christ, and the truth, and so if we are to have power at the end, we must pray; and if there is anything to confess, as there is much, let us confess it. Daniel is not thinking merely
{172}
of himself, or the three other Hebrew children; he is thinking of all the children of the captivity, Israel, what they have done, their sin, their departure. We are thinking of it too, for we are thinking of Christendom, we have much to confess, much to take on by way of church sorrow; and the evening oblation is the time for us to take it on in power. At this very same time, the time of the evening oblation, Elijah had power in recalling the people to God. Think of it. Thousands and thousands of them all bowed down and said, "Jehovah, He is God", and slew the false prophets at the brook Kishon (@1 Kings 18: 39, 40). What power there was there!
At a similar time Ezra was weeping and confessing, blushing to lift up his face before God, for the unholy links of companionship that had been taken on by the remnant. But at that time there was power to deal with it (@Ezra 10).
It is power, not at the beginning of the day, but at the end, so that the end corresponds with the beginning. And Daniel now, in his own way, is signally approved of by heaven. The man Gabriel came and touched him, it says, "about the time of the evening oblation". Gabriel says, "I am come forth to make thee skilful of understanding"; that is, it is to unfold to him the rest of the time, the seventy weeks, and how it should all work out. For us, of course, it is a question now of our being near the end of our time, and how that is going to work out; but in his approval, the touching of him, he says, "one greatly beloved". I suppose, dear brethren, this is the
{173}
way that power comes in, and the people of God are influenced for good and rightly helped, that one should be thus before God about the whole position in general, take it on humbly; and that one should read, one should pray, one should confess, and that one should take on the whole situation, as it were, as it is under the eye of heaven, and approved by heaven.
I would like to be one like that, to help the people of God to be released rightly; that there might be no moral hold-up to the people of God going out in power. You might say that God was fully justified by the exercises of Daniel, in releasing His people to go into their inheritance. And Daniel himself never went, as we know; he stood in his lot but what a power there was behind the goings of Zerubbabel, behind that proclamation of Cyrus. It is not only now the prophetic word as to Cyrus, uttered years and years beforehand; it is the prayers, exercises of moral power standing behind it all in the person of Daniel. He is in keeping with his own name; he judged himself in his confession; and as we judge ourselves, we shall be called, I believe, as vessels for the power of God and the glory of God, to go forth in victory. Now that influence, we may humbly desire to take on ourselves; "The fervent supplication of the righteous man has much power" (@James 5: 16). That still remains, so we can take this on, the spirit of it amongst ourselves, and help the brethren, as they help us.
Now Paul is not exactly blessing in this chapter
{174}
in 2 Corinthians. We may say he is a father, but for the moment, his fatherly affections are somewhat restrained. There is more here in this verse or two of the apostle; but at the same time there is the meekness and gentleness of Christ in his manner. He says at the opening of the chapter, "But I myself, Paul", reminding us that we are to develop in heavenly and spiritual personality. We are to be able, all of us, from the youngest believer to the most spiritual amongst us, to say in measure, "I myself".
Some may ask how can we get into it, which is always one of the very best questions, and I would suggest that one way to get into it is to keep close to the light that we have. I am thinking of Ruth in saying this. She followed Naomi as the vessel of light. She came into the inheritance, she came into good companionship; she came, we may say, to thoughts of Christ out of death as suggested in the barley harvest, and thoughts of the saints. She came into the field that was being reaped, the present ministry; she came into the Lord's supper in type, the "mealtime" (chapter 2: 14), and then there came a time when Boaz said to her, "Bring the cloak that thou hast upon thee, and hold it" (chapter 3: 15). "The cloak", the cloak being, we may say, our capacity, our personality, what we can contain. He poured into it six measures of barley. And with it she went home to Naomi, and Naomi said to her, "Who art thou, my daughter?" (chapter 3: 16). "Who?". That is to say, it is a question of the person; the personality, that is in
{175}
mind. Now, dear young brethren, that is a good start, and as we may say, a normal start. If you are close to a vessel of light, keep company there; follow the light. It will take you into good things, good fields, good company. Indeed the typical teaching of Ruth's end is marvellous, as she comes into union with the "mighty man of wealth" -- Boaz -- that is Christ!
These are very attractive things, dear brethren. And it all leads into this great matter of "I myself". Another time Paul said, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". He has come under the influence of the new husband in @Romans 7; he is like Ruth. He begins to understand what it is to be to another; to be free from every kind of bondage; now he says, I am free. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". I am reminded often of the Tachkemonite amongst David's men, of whom it says, in David's last words -- "He fought against eight hundred". The word "fought" is not strictly there in @2 Samuel 23: 8. It is not a question of his fighting; the fighting comes in from Chronicles; but in Samuel it is his person. "He fought against eight hundred". Think of it; what a person! No wonder he had the chief seat, the chief of David's mighty men. This is a man formed under David, the Beloved! That is where personality is formed, I am sure, under the influence of the love of Christ. The green grass mentioned in David's last words is something growing, living, fresh! His mighty men, as it were, are the green grass. Saul never had any, not a blade. David had many, many of them; there they are like blades of green grass,
{176}
coming up under the shining of the sun, and the refreshing of the rain. These are hints, you might say, if you will allow them, dear brethren, in relation to personality.
So we come to this great man, Paul, and yet he is so approachable. They could write letters to him about collections, and about all kind of exercises and he would write the answer, and he says: "Now concerning the collection ..." (@1 Corinthians 16: 1), "concerning the ministration which is for the saints ..." (@2 Corinthians 9: 1), and so on. I understand that to mean that he is answering the points in their inquiries; he is taking them up, but when he has finished all this, he says, "But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ". That is, he is greater than all his answers, and all his ministry; and he needed to be, for there was a naughty man at Corinth, a wicked man. There was one whom Paul does not name; he just calls him "he". "His letters", says he, "are weighty" (chapter 10: 10). Who is the he? It is the false apostle at Corinth. "But his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught". That is what he said of Paul in Corinth. We need something to counterbalance all that. If there is anything of that kind in Corinth, or anywhere else, we shall need personality to deal with that. "Let such a one think this", Paul says (verse 11). He says in the next chapter that he, Paul, reckons "that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles" (verse 5). He says, In nothing I am behind any of them. "Let such a one
{177}
think this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also present in deed", that is in actual fact. All that lies in my mind in relation to that, dear brethren, is the need for bringing all that we are to bear upon our local position. Not that there is a false apostle in our localities, thank God! But there is the need for influence for good, and so we have to call upon ourselves, little in our own eyes, so that Christ may shine, and all that we are as formed by divine grace, to bear upon the local position, for its good, so that the saints may not only be saved from evil, but carried by the truth.
How much more could be said about that. Think of this beloved brother; think of his having been caught up to heaven, the third heaven, and into paradise! Think of the personality, you might say. Think of what was lying in his soul, what he knew, what he had heard, what power he would be in a meeting. He would not have to say much, if he were there, though you would delight to hear him. That is it, I believe, that we might have some development of spiritual heavenly personality, for the enrichment of the saints in our localities. Unless we should think that Paul is too great to deal with our small matters, he reminds us in his beautiful epistle to Philemon, how interested he is in all the saints, even the smallest. One has to admit to having had to judge oneself about this, that is, overlooking the interests of the saints. And here they are!
Paul in writing to Philemon is thinking about a runaway slave; he had come to Rome and had been
{178}
converted, and Paul, the father, says: "whom I have begotten in my bonds". "My child". Think how Paul, dear brethren, could come down to the smallest of us here tonight, one who has come under the influence of the truth, we might say, a boy or girl, as we were hearing last night, a twelve year old, or even less, and under the interest of a man like Paul such an one becomes valuable; he is valuable in a spiritual father's eye; and he commends him to his master; "not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother" (verse 16). Think of it. Onesimus now, as he goes back, will sit down in the meeting in Philemon's house. The assembly is in his house; the meeting is there; and Onesimus, the runaway slave, now the believing, Pauline child, is to sit there with the brethren, as he comes back; and Philemon shall have nothing against him.
Philemon would say, 'Paul has offered to pay, but he will not have to pay, I will pay'. What a delightful spirit, dear brethren, the spirit in which Philemon and Paul, would regard this matter; Paul "being such a one as Paul the aged". What a spirit in an aged father amongst the saints. What a benign influence shines in Paul, "such a one as Paul the aged". What an influence he would exert.
So we may encourage one another, dear brethren. Sometimes it is a question of outlining the truth in its scope, and saying the right thing, and saying it as helpfully as possible, and seeing to it that the brethren get the best; if sonship is the best, let us bring it before the brethren, let us have it before
{179}
ourselves. If the land, heaven, is the best, let us speak of it, let us have it before us increasingly. Sometimes it is a question of praying, and confessing, and giving God, we may say, a justification from our side, for His taking us on as self-judged persons, vessels of mercy, prepared for glory. But most of all, I suppose, this great matter which comes in with Paul, the matter of spiritual personality, whether in the meeting or in regard of a person, is to have weight with us. Thus we shall be influential for good, I believe, and serve one another well and finish well.
The Lord help us in these things, for His Name's sake.

FOLLOWERS OF JESUS
F. S. Marsh
@John 1: 35 - 41; @John 10: 3 - 5; @John 12: 26; @John 19: 25 - 27; @John 21: 19 - 22
May we raise this important question? Is everyone here definitely following the Shepherd? Have you found the place where He feeds His flock, making it to rest at noon? The Lord would lead you there. Do you ask, What am I to do? Where am I to go? Tell me where to find it? We would rather tell you to follow Him: He will lead you to it. Say to the Lord, 'I want to follow Thee!' He will surely lead you to where He has a place for you in this one flock. You may say, I know the Lord Jesus has prepared a place for us in the Father's house! Yes; but He has a place
{180}
for you in His assembly today! Have you thought of that? And, if so, have you found it? Have you followed Him to where He says, This is your place? If He has assigned a place to you, no one else but you can fill it; it will be empty till you do so; and the Shepherd is leading you to it. The assembly is composed of persons like that who have been led by the Shepherd to find their place in the flock.
In chapter 12 it is a matter of *following in service*. "If any one serve me, let him follow me". It is important not to divorce these two great thoughts of serving and following. This verse is the Lord's own words: "If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be *my* servant". Precious as service is, it is of no value to Christ, or to His own, unless the service is rendered in relation to following; that is to say, the servant must be characteristically a follower. He is himself progressing. He is near the Lord, and is himself under the Lord's leading. Let us dismiss from our minds the limited use of the word servant as applying only to those who serve publicly. One recognises that the Lord has entrusted to some the holy responsibility and privilege of serving publicly; but in this verse the Lord is not limiting the application of His words to such. We credit every true child of God with possessing in his own heart a longing desire to serve. You cannot love without desiring to serve, and becoming characteristically a servant. It is so even in relation to human love. A little child of four years heard for the first time the story of the cross and the
{181}
love of Jesus. She came to her mother the next day and said, 'Is there anything I can do for Jesus? I do love Him!' That is the spirit of service; it is what the work of God produces in the soul. We recognise that every true lover of Christ has that spirit. But that has to be worked out according to God. You cannot serve at your own dictation; it is too holy, too dignified, too magnificent, for anyone to take up of their own volition, and according to their own ideas. Remember, dear fellow believers, you are servants. We may have to say we are unprofitable ones (we all have to say that!), or perhaps we have not done much, but we are all servants who belong to Him.
The Lord's service is being carried forward by those who love Him; and everyone who loves Him has the spirit of service implanted in his heart, and thus we become servants, but then, if we are to serve we must follow. How often we have to lament the poverty of our service, and when the matter has been faced it is seen to be because we were not following closely enough to the One who alone can make that service effectual. The Lord sets out the principle here: we do well to heed it. "If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be *my* servant". And then the Lord gives a further word of encouragement: "If any one serve me, him shall the Father honour". What a cheer that is! How it would encourage the dear young brothers and sisters who may have felt how little opportunity they have to serve the Lord. It may be the Lord leads them to take up some apparently insignificant service
{182}
(though, really, there is no service which is insignificant -- every detail is dignified), and out of true love for Christ they take it up and pursue it in devotedness. The Father will honour them. The Lord is disclosing to us the wonderful secret that the Father's heart is gratified by everyone who is pursuing service for Christ's sake. "Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me" (@Matthew 25: 40). Oh! to think of spending the few days that may be left to us, rendering no service. What a serious thing! We believe the Lord is pleased to develop greatly the souls of His people as they pursue with diligence and devotedness the dependent path of service.
Perhaps you say, I would love to serve the Lord, but I do not know what to do! The Lord Himself is the only One who can answer that question for you. What did Saul of Tarsus say? "What shall I do, Lord?" The Lord said, "Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do" (@Acts 22: 10). The Lord may use those who are His to indicate to you and to encourage you as to service for Him, and to support you in it, but you have to go to the Lord first of all for the answer to that question. Think of the Father honouring the one who follows and serves Christ! What a dignity attaches to that service! It will involve reproach, sacrifice, and oftentimes putting our own matters on one side, but "him shall the Father honour"! So it is worthwhile. The Lord would lead us until, qualified, equipped and filled
{183}
spiritually, we can take our intelligent part in the service of God.
Now along with this service is the reproach of Christ. In chapter 19 this is in evidence. Jesus goes on His way to the cross. Now the test comes! Who will be with Him as the rejected One, the crucified One? Nailed to the cross, between two malefactors, scorned, hated, and spit upon; the object of man's derision, who will follow Him there?
"And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala ... and the disciple standing by, whom he loved". These sisters and the brother are *following in reproach*. How encouraging this is, especially to those who are in small gatherings, where the fewness of numbers and outward feebleness of the position is realised! Yet it is the reproach of Christ! Think of that little gathering at the cross! There were but few: the multitudes had cried, "Take him away, take him away, crucify him" (verse 15)! but these were a few lovers of Christ, in the minority indeed, yet prepared to stand by the cross in the darkest hour! What it must have meant to them to be there, but what must it have meant to the Lord's heart to see them there: prepared, if needs be, to suffer the same indignities as were heaped upon their Master.
No doubt, but for the ordering of God, the enemies would have treated every follower of Jesus as they treated Him, but those devoted hearts said in effect -- If to follow Him means going the whole
{184}
way, we will go with Him!
Surely, when He will review the paths of His own, those who stood by the cross so devotedly will stand out then in a holy dignity before the vast company of the saints to hear the Lord express His great appreciation of their loyalty. Can we do likewise? Let us remember our brethren who are in reproach today -- following our rejected Lord, turning away from formal religion and from all that exalts the man after the flesh, to stand true to the cross with all its deep meaning and import! It was the same devoted love that led Mary Magdalene to remain at the sepulchre -- still following Him as her heart said -- I cannot leave Him. She was speaking in the language of @Psalm 73: 25, "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee".
It is important that we should be prepared to suffer the reproach of Christ. Up to the present time many of us have not been called upon to suffer much in this land; some of our younger brethren are being tested more than hitherto, but the Lord would have us all follow Him with such true and deep affection that we may all be able to rejoice to be "counted worthy to be dishonoured for the name" (@Acts 5: 41).
The last reference to following in the gospel is in chapter 21, where the Lord Jesus in resurrection-life is heard saying to Peter, "Follow thou me"! He would have us *following in testimony*. We are left here awaiting His coming, and the one important
{185}
matter is for each one to be in the path of testimony, in affectionate loyalty to Him. Peter had said, "Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death" (@Luke 22: 33), but he had proved his inability to do so: now, humbled and restored the Lord enjoins him, "Follow thou me"!
Then in reviewing the words of the Son of God throughout this gospel, can we limit the thought of following to our path here on earth: as we follow Him, will He not delight to lead us even now into the deep joys that are His -- the Son of the Father: will He not lead our hearts into the Father's realm, into the enjoyment of the Father's love, until at last we are found with Him in the Father's house -- having followed Him there?
May the Lord be pleased to bring each heart under His influence, and allure us after Himself, and as He says to each of us, "Follow thou me", may our sincere response be --
<blockquote>'Saviour, we long to follow Thee, <br> Do Thou our hearts prepare <br> To count all else, whate'er it be, <br> Unworthy of our care' (`278:1). </blockquote>

HUSBANDS
E. Dennett
@Ephesians 5: 25 - 33; @Colossians 3: 19; @1 Peter 3: 7
2. But again it is added, "So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself. For no one has ever
{186}
hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, *even as also the Christ the assembly*: for we are members of his body; we are of his flesh, and of his bones. Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ and as to the assembly. But *ye* also, every one of you, let each so love his own wife as himself".
Here we are carried back, as has been remarked, to the garden of Eden, to the creation and presentation of Eve to Adam, which in itself is a manifest figure of the union between Christ and the church; and this fact accounts for the way in which the apostle weaves the two things in these exhortations. (See @Genesis 2: 21 - 25). The union is thus looked upon as so complete -- as Adam said of Eve, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh"; and again, "they shall become one flesh" -- that it is said, so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. In this aspect, self-love is to be the measure of a man's love to his wife; and as this is one of the instincts of our nature -- and naturally its governing principle -- it is impossible to conceive of a more definite and comprehensive direction. Let therefore the oneness of the union -- they two shall be one flesh -- be apprehended, and love will follow; for the husband will then no more consider his wife as distinct from, but as a part of, himself. Thus whatever touches her, will touch him; and his self-love, moving now in a wider circle, includes her, and all that affects and concerns her, within its
{187}
embrace. All that he desires for himself he will also desire for his wife; all the care he exercises for himself he will exercise for her; and all that he receives he will receive for her as well as for himself. In a word, all the good he seeks, and all the evil he deprecates, he will also seek and deprecate for his wife, as for himself; for together they are "one flesh", and therefore he that loveth his wife loveth himself. The word of God provides in this way a perfect antidote against selfishness, and leads out the husband in self-sacrifice, which is the fruit of all true love, and which finds its highest exemplification in Christ, who loved the church, and gave Himself for it.
We have said that self-love is to be the measure, in the aspect considered, of the husband's love for his wife; but it is remarkable how this also is connected with Christ, teaching us that in no human self-love, but only in the love of Christ for the church, can its true pattern and example be found. For, giving the other side, the apostle proceeds: "For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, *even as also the Christ the assembly*". The wife therefore being "one flesh" with him, he must nourish and cherish her, even as Christ the church. What heights and depths are contained in this comparison! showing indeed that the debt of love is never paid, but always owed. And yet that love delights to recognise it, and to be ever paying it, in lavishing care and tenderness upon her who has thus become one with him in the view of God.
{188}
It should again be added, if we would have a full sense of the responsibility, that this obligation of love is also irrespective of the character of the wife. No amount of unworthiness in the wife, short of the one sin specified by our Lord, can excuse the husband from the duty of love; for Christ loves the church unceasingly, and in spite of all faults and failures, and even worse; yea, He is even seeking to wean her from her faults, and to cleanse her from her defilements by His perfect charity; and His love, be it ever remembered, is the model of that of the husband. It may be that he will fail to copy it in its infinite perfection; but notwithstanding, it is His love which the husband must ever have before his eyes. Behold in this the wisdom of God; for here is the provision to direct the gaze of the husband to Christ, to keep Him before his soul, and thereby he will surely be drawn into imitation of His love; for no one ever failed while his eye and heart were fixed upon Christ.
3. The apostle Peter confines himself to certain aspects of the husband's responsibility. "Ye husbands, likewise, dwell with them according to knowledge, as with a weaker, even the female, vessel, giving them honour, as also fellow-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered".
To dwell with the wife "according to knowledge", is to have the relationship, and the affections proper to it, ordered by the truth, by the knowledge which the Christian has of the relationship in the sight of God. And this is exceedingly important; for herein lies the difference
{189}
between the believer and the unbeliever in these relative positions; and it behoves the Christian to act in all these according to the new place in which he has been brought by the death and resurrection of Christ. The christian husband will therefore dwell with his wife according to the truth of his union with his wife, as revealed in the Scriptures.
Moreover, he is to give honour to his wife, and on two grounds. First, on the natural ground, that she is the weaker vessel. There is little doubt that this reference is to the more delicate frame and organisation of the woman, requiring and deserving more gentle and more tender treatment. So that just as weakness constitutes a claim upon strength for consideration and support, so the wife as the "weaker vessel" has a claim upon her husband for thoughtful, loving watchfulness and care. He is to give her honour by rendering her all the attention which her more delicate nature requires. It is possible, however, that there may be a reference to the fact that "Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression" (@1 Timothy 2: 14), that she thus showed herself to be the "weaker vessel", by being the first to fall through the subtlety of the devil. More easily acted on, especially through the affections, she thus needs and demands from her husband vigilant and tender care to shield her from the peculiar temptations to which, with her weaker nature, she is constantly exposed. But, secondly, this exhortation is grounded in grace as well as in nature, as being "fellow-heirs of the grace of life". In Christ there is neither male nor
{190}
female (@Galatians 3: 28). All natural distinctions therefore, as constituting any relative superiority in Christ, are abolished. While therefore the husband claims the natural obedience of his wife, he must never forget that, if they are both children of God, they are together "heirs of God, and Christ's joint-heirs" (@Romans 8: 17). And as such he is to give honour unto his wife; for these natural ties, and these relative connections, are only for earth; and when the Lord comes to receive His people unto Himself, husbands and wives will alike be caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and then both will be like unto Christ, and be for ever with Him.
Attention to this injunction is the more needful for the reason given, "that your prayers be not hindered". It is pre-supposed that husband and wife will habitually unite in prayer; and hence the warning is, that any failure in the husband to give honour unto his wife will tend to disturb harmony of feeling, and thus to hinder prayer. It were well if all christian husbands and wives would often ponder these words. For in the activities of this present time there is great danger of neglecting this united prayer; and the slightest disturbance of concord will ever tempt them to neglect it the more. Satan knows this, and hence he ever seeks to cloud over the peace of these relationships; for he does not forget that it is impossible for husband and wife to go together to the throne of grace when there is the smallest discord in their hearts. The husband must watch against this snare, remembering the importance of
{191}
their prayers not being hindered. For how many things are there constantly occurring in every family which need to be spread out before God! And how blessed it is when husband and wife can go together, with one heart, concerning every difficulty and perplexity, to the throne of grace!
4. There is one thing the husband is taught to avoid: "Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them". It might be thought that if the 'love' were secured there would be no place left for the 'bitterness'. But is it so in the actual experience of life? Many a husband, who truly loves his wife, drops, in moments of unwatchfulness, when out of the presence of God, hasty words, which are as bitter as gall to a tender heart. The object of the warning seems thus to be to secure the constant exercise of a spirit of self-judgment, so that the husband may avoid everything that might fret or irritate the spirit of his wife. Bitterness -- whatever the provocation -- is to be carefully eschewed; and it will be done the more easily if he but remember his responsibility to love his wife, even as Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it.
Such, then, are the divine requirements from the husband. We might perhaps shrink from them, if we did not remember that He who enjoins them is ever at hand to supply the needed grace, and to enable us to walk according to His word. The power for such a walk is found in the Holy Spirit who dwells within us; and inasmuch as He ever leads us to Christ, we shall find that the path thus indicated is one of peace
{192}
and blessing, leading us into the enjoyment of a fellowship which adumbrates, by no means dimly, that between Christ and the church. As Christ to the church, so is the husband to the wife. To fulfil therefore the duties of a husband needs that Christ in His love to the church should ever be before the soul; and then, if the eye be but upon Christ, there will be transformation into His likeness (@2 Corinthians 3: 18), and the consequent expression of Christ in the relationship which the husband sustains towards his wife.

CHRIST IN HEALING POWER AND SYMPATHY
F. E. Raven
It has been most beautifully expressed: 'He suffered in His spirit what He took away by His power'. He could only bear them in His spirit.
I use the word sympathy advisedly. It gives us another view of Christ. We get something very touching in the ability of Christ, because He had become a real Man, to enter sympathetically into all that which pressed on man down here. I think it leads up to the priesthood of Christ.

{193}
HEARING AND OBEYING THE WORD OF THE LORD
R. E. Fielder
@John 4: 16 - 19; @Micah 3: 12; @Micah 4: 1 - 5; @Micah 7: 18 - 20; @Jeremiah 26: 1 - 3; @Proverbs 25: 4
There is an urgent need to hear the Lord's word and to obey it. It is possible to listen to the Lord's word and to be, perhaps, little affected by it. Some, in Ezekiel's day, who listened to such a word found it "a lovely song, a pleasant voice ... and they hear thy words, but they do them not" (@Ezekiel 33: 32), and we too might be unmoved inwardly. Or the word might, like the seed that "fell by the wayside" (@Mark 4: 4), be quickly snatched from us. The Lord is very gracious, and He provides a word, and He looks for exercise with you and me, that we might sow and reap and take root downwards and bear fruit upwards (@2 Kings 19: 29, 30).
This is what happened, I believe, to the woman in @John 4. It is a solemn passage, illustrating that the Lord knows intimately every detail of your life and mine. Even His use of the word "five", "thou hast had five husbands", demonstrates how perfectly He knew everything about this woman. Well might she say, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" (verse 29). We can hide nothing from Him. He is the One who pleads with persons to hear His words and do them, and He has His own way of reaching into the recesses and depths of our hearts, that we might not only hear His voice, but open to His knocking. "If any one hear my voice and open
{194}
the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me" (@Revelation 3: 20).
Everything about the pathway of Jesus here, as He moved in perfection under the eye of God and in relation to man, was perfect. What evenness marked Him, as is suggested in the fine flour of the offerings. He reached Sychar's well, weary with the way He had come, but never was the Lord too busy, and never, reverently speaking, was He too weary to meet the need of a soul to whom He spoke. And this woman heard Him. Now bring that right forward to the present day -- the Lord is ready to speak to us now. What a privilege that is! There are persons whose lives are devoted to the Lord, and who are committed to serving Him, and to many of those He will say, "Well done" (@Luke 19: 17). He could not say "Well done" to this woman at this point, could He? But in grace He goes as far as He can. He says, "Thou hast well said ... this thou hast spoken truly". Oh! the grace of Jesus, as He would speak to us in order that we might yield ourselves to Him.
There is a verse in Job that says, "For there is hope for a tree: if it be cut down ..." (chapter 14: 7). Here was this woman in @John 4 who had lived a life of continuing and developing sin, and she comes face to face with Jesus, a Man wearied with His journey, and yet speaking to her of things that amazed and thrilled her soul, and she is "cut down". The depth of His knowledge concerning her, and us, would cut us down completely. But it says further in Job of that tree that there is hope for it: "Yet through
{195}
the scent of water it will bud" (verse 9). I think this woman got "the scent of water" from the One who could speak to her saying, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (@John 4: 10). Think of what He provides. We need to be cut down, and from the scent of water, to find something that will grow. What does she say? "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet". Have you let the prophetic word of Jesus reach into your soul? Is there anything unjudged there? This woman had a history that was unjudged, and she was still involved in it.
It has been said, 'If a man truly judges a thing he never returns to it'. Have we truly judged things that have hindered us and things that have turned us out of the way? When persons went out into the wilderness to visit John the baptist, Jesus raised the question, "What went ye out into the wilderness to behold?" and He gave them certain choices, and He says finally, "a prophet?". Then He says, "and what is more excellent than a prophet" (@Luke 7: 24 - 26). Did that thrill your soul as we sang at the beginning of this meeting, 'Christ the Prophet, Priest and King' (`191:2)? Think of the greatness of Jesus, and of all that He would be to us! Yet I think that this woman found more than a prophet as she yielded herself to Him.
I was hearing recently of a man and his wife who were considered to be good Christians. Their home was always available; they entertained hospitably;
{196}
they gave of their possessions to persons in need; the kindness of God, you might say, shone out in what they did. Someone once came to their place of worship and preached about those who "gave themselves first to the Lord" (@2 Corinthians 8: 5), and "yield yourselves to God" (@Romans 6: 13), and that word went right home into their hearts. Their home, their possessions, everything they had was available for others, but there was one thing they had not truly done: they had not yielded *themselves*. Everything they possessed was available, but this woman of @John 4 learned, I think, to yield herself. What had failed to satisfy her now was found completely answered in the One to whom she said, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet". The prophetic word, beloved brethren, is vital today, and God's blessing is coming through it. May we hold to it, and may old and young commit themselves to it.
I have read from Micah, a man who spoke faithfully. His name means, 'Who is like Jah'? Who is like God? And that was characteristic, I think, of Micah. We read in @Micah 7: 18, "Who is a God like unto thee?" But what particular feature of God impressed Micah? At this point it was the God "that forgiveth iniquity". What a God He is! I would say to the younger men and women, and to all of us, that, as we learn God, let some feature of God characterise our lives and what we say. If you have an impression as to the nearness of the coming of the Lord, let it colour what you say. Let it colour your life. Let it shine out in what you commit yourself to
{197}
and where you go and how you speak to others.
We read in the passage in @Micah 4, "they shall sit every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree". In Hezekiah's day, the king of Assyria sent to the men of Judah, saying, "eat every one of his vine and every one of his fig-tree ... until I come and take you away to a land like your own land" (@2 Kings 18: 31, 32). Hezekiah had commanded his people, saying, "Answer him not" (verse 36), and they remained faithful. May we remain faithful and through it learn God, like Micah did. Let us bear in mind that Satan is against God. If there is something that the Lord values in Bangor, Satan will be against it; not because it is in Bangor, but because it is of God. When Satan spoke to Eve in the garden, he said, "Is it even so, that God has said ... ?" (@Genesis 3: 1); he was questioning what God had said, questioning what God had done, and attempting to offer an alternative.
What we have read in @Jeremiah 26 is the word of the Lord, and we need to hearken to it. The word of the Lord is very important. Jeremiah was a man who must have gone through a lot of exercise. The opening chapter of the book is very interesting. He did not want to serve. He said, "Alas, Lord Jehovah! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child". And God said to him, "Say not, I am a child", and commissioned him to speak faithfully, "to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to overthrow" -- but also to bring in what is positive -- "to build and to plant" (verses 6 - 10). And so in chapter
{198}
26, Jeremiah has a message from God, and God's message is always so important that it needs to be faithfully and fully delivered.
Paul did that. He says, "*I* received from the Lord, that which I have also delivered to you" (@1 Corinthians 11: 23). Mary brought word to the disciples that she "had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her" (@John 20: 18). She passed on the message faithfully. May we, both brothers and sisters, if the Lord's word comes to us, deliver it faithfully and fearlessly. God said to Jeremiah, "diminish not a word". Do not cut one word out. Do not take off the emphasis of one word. "Diminish not a word. Peradventure they will hearken". Think of the feelings of God in that as His word comes to us, "Peradventure they will hearken". Maybe there is someone that will yield today.
It goes on to speak of how Jehovah had been "rising early" to speak to them through "the words of my servants the prophets". Think of God's care and God's concern. Yet, in chapter 26, when Jeremiah delivers the word, the priests and the prophets said, "This man is worthy to die" (verse 11). They were not ready to accept the word of the Lord. Oh! may we hearken to the word of the Lord. They sought to slay Jeremiah because of his faithful speaking. If you have a word in the meeting for prophetic ministry, speak it. Count upon God, rely upon the Spirit, and deliver the word. Diminish not a word of it. Leave the consequences with God.
There was a time when Jesus spoke and they
{199}
"wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth", and yet before the address was finished, they sought to destroy Him (@Luke 4: 22, 29). The priests and prophets sought to slay Jeremiah, but "certain of the elders of the land spoke ... saying, Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah" (@Jeremiah 26: 17, 18) and Hezekiah did not put him to death. But Micah prophesied and they quote in this chapter the words we have read, the last verse of @Micah 3, when Micah was pronouncing a very strong judgment on what was a vital earthly centre at that time in Israel's history, and what it was going to become because of their neglect of God, and these elders said, "Did Hezekiah ... put him at all to death?" (verse 19), did he slay Micah because of his faithful prophecy? And they said 'No, he hearkened to the word'. And I would plead with our hearts to hearken to the word of Micah in chapter 3, that very straight word, "Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field", and so on. What judgment was coming in, and has come in, but he goes on to speak of a time of wondrous blessing.
It is important to listen to the whole of God's word, and Micah speaks of this time of blessing, and he would, as it were, invite our hearts to have part in it, for faith has part in it now. It speaks of a time when Christ will reign in righteousness, when He will come publicly to take up His rights in a scene where they are at present denied. But amongst His people He has those rights now, and may we prove
{200}
it. It says of persons in that day that "they shall forge their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more". What damage has been done through personal feeling. What damage has been done by the wrong use, as Peter demonstrated, of the sword or the spear. "They shall not learn war any more".
It is a wonderful thing to see brethren dwelling together in unity, and working out the truth in love for one another. The pruning-knives and the ploughshares would link with sowing and reaping and taking root downward and bearing fruit upward. What a lovely scene it is, beloved brethren, where things are right in the local company, where Christ, the Prophet, Priest and King has His rightful place.
The king of Assyria had said, I will "take you away to a land like your own land". If the king of Assyria had taken them away; they would have had to learn to walk in the ways of another god, a god with a small 'g', a god with no power. But they say, "we will walk in the name of Jehovah, our God for ever and ever". God has in mind that we should walk and serve and praise Him. It says as to Jehovah's house that "the peoples shall flow unto it". There has been a flowing from different parts of Ireland today, in order that we might be together to hear the word of the Lord. May He speak to us, and may our souls be moved.
I read in @Proverbs 25, one of the Proverbs that the men of Hezekiah transcribed. These are
{201}
Solomon's proverbs, and it would seem that they were not known during the reign of Solomon, but the men of Hezekiah found them and transcribed them. There was a time, you remember, in Josiah's day (@2 Kings 22), when the book of the law was found and was read, and it completely changed the thoughts and longings of faithful hearts after God. And these proverbs were found, and the men of Hezekiah transcribed, or copied, them. They are very interesting. We read, "Take away the dross from the silver", and what comes to light is a vessel for the refiner. Perhaps that is a simple impression for some soul here today: "Take away the dross"; allow the Lord to act upon you as when He spoke to that woman at Sychar's well, that what will come to light may be "a vessel for the refiner". The work might not yet be complete, but the dross is gone. Maybe something has yet to be done to that vessel. Yes, there will be, for even our bodies are going to be changed, and the moment is soon coming, beloved, when we shall see the Lord, face to face, and the Refiner's work in us will then be complete.
May He, in the meantime, become increasingly precious to every heart here, for His Name's sake.

SYMPATHY IN THE TESTIMONY AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD OF GOD
J. Taylor
@Luke 8: 1 - 21
My thought is to say a word in regard to sympathy with Christ in the testimony, and in connection with that to seek to show the importance of the word of God. What you can see here is that the Lord stands forth in connection with the testimony, not only as individually connected with it, but as associating others with Himself; and you will observe that whilst it states that the twelve were with Him, there were also others, and these were women. You will find in the Scriptures that what represents divine authority, as the apostles, is associated with what is subjective; and the feature in which the subjective side appears here I take to be that of sympathy.
Now I think you will find in the perusal of the Acts that these two lines are found together. Most of us here are aware that Luke wrote to confirm Paul. It is indeed essential to a right understanding of Luke to bear that in mind, and you will find in the Acts that which corresponds with this section of his gospel; namely, the position and ministry and authority of the apostles, which I take the liberty of designating as official, it being the result of divine appointment.
The apostles were divinely appointed, but they were tried men. The Lord took them up in perfect discrimination; they were men whom He knew, and
{203}
who had been tested, so that He appointed them as qualified. What corresponds with the official position of the apostles is the Spirit which indwelt them. That is to say, although divinely appointed, they were not to exercise their apostleship apart from the Spirit. They were to remain in Jerusalem until they should be endued with power from on high; and I think you will find by a consideration of @Acts 1 that they were in every way equal to their mission. Their hearts were attracted to Jesus; that wonderful Person had been brought to their attention and had completely won their hearts, so that when He is taken up from them they are found gazing up into heaven. In other words, the apostolic ministry was marked by affection for Christ.
Then you will find that whilst awaiting His promise, the gift of the Spirit, they recognised the authority of the Scriptures in the choice of an apostle to fill Judas's place; the Scriptures being the only authority left upon earth, seeing that Jesus had gone into heaven. To these men the Holy Spirit came, and as endued with power from on high, they carried on their ministry. The Holy Spirit coming down from heaven, we are told, sat upon each of them; there were others there as we know, but I speak for the moment of the apostles. The Holy Spirit came into the company, and His sound filled the house where they were sitting, and He sat upon each of them. Peter in the power of that Spirit stood up and testified for Christ. Now that is the apostolic position; it was characterised by affection for Christ,
{204}
by submission to the authority of the Scriptures, and energised by the Holy Spirit come down from heaven. That continued through the Acts, I might say, up to chapter 15. They were in complete identification with Christ, representing His authority here upon earth.
What I wish to show is that side by side with that there appeared a spontaneous element, which is represented in Barnabas. I am not overlooking the fact that Barnabas was called an apostle; he was an apostle in virtue rather of what he was morally than by official appointment; that is, he was sympathetic with what was going on. Barnabas first appears in @Acts 4. We are told that he had lands and he sold them. Now we might have thought he sold them because he cared no longer for them; that, in the light of what was heavenly, brought in by the Spirit, he who had title to the earthly possessions surrendered them; but that is not the way in which the Spirit of God presents the matter to us. Barnabas had a true estimate of his property, I have no doubt, and did not undervalue it; we are told by the Spirit that he sold his lands. Why did he do that? Clearly because he saw that he could use the price for the furtherance of the testimony. He was taken up with the testimony, and he brought the money and laid it at the apostles¬ feet. That is to say, he recognised the authority of the Lord in His apostles. They were there with power to administer, and he brought to them what he had; he had land, he sold it, and devoted the money to the service of the testimony. It
{205}
was not exactly Levitical service, although he was a Levite; his gift was not spiritual for the moment.
You will recall how in Israel the Levites were divided into two classes: there were those who carried the holy things upon their shoulders, and there were those who had wagons. I take Barnabas¬ gift in a sense to be a wagon; he recognised the necessities connected with the testimony, and he brought what he had got for his lands and laid it at the apostles¬ feet. What came to light in connection with his action indicates the Lord's appreciation of what he did. He was sympathetic with the testimony, and the apostles named him; his name had been Joseph, but they called him Barnabas -- "Son of consolation". Now that is what I understand to be an evidence of his sympathy with the testimony.
As we proceed in the Acts you will find that the testimony moves on, and it is when the movement takes place that Barnabas shines. He shone in connection with that which was official at Jerusalem, but the testimony moved on; and when we are genuinely moved in regard of Christ we shall follow the course of the testimony. The testimony moved out to Antioch. An independent action of the Spirit took place there. There were no apostolic labours bestowed upon Antioch, as far as we know, prior to the movement there, but chapters 11 and 13 show us that Levitical service, and, indeed, priestly service, had moved out among the Gentiles. That was a great triumph for Christ. There were found at Antioch certain men who ministered to the Lord and
{206}
fasted; that is, they were in the liberty of service outside of Jewish territory.
Now Barnabas, who was a "good man and full of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 11: 24), recognised this work; he recognised the movement of the testimony and he was in complete sympathy with it. What did he do? He went down to Tarsus to seek out Saul. He was instinctively in the mind of God, and recognised what God had done, and how the testimony had moved. He sees that Saul is the man for the occasion; he goes to Tarsus to seek him out, and he takes him, not to Jerusalem, but to Antioch. Thus the testimony moved on, and correlatively the authority of Christ in the apostles, until we come to chapter 15. That is to say, the service of God was set up among the Gentiles, and you will find in tracing these chapters that the Spirit of God pursues it until it is enshrined at Ephesus.
I make another remark in regard to Ephesus: the economy of the house of God is in connection with Ephesus. Timothy was at Ephesus when Paul wrote his first epistle to him, and it is this epistle above all others which should govern us in relation to the house of God. The house of God, beloved friends, is a heavenly institution. The assembly at Ephesus was set up in the light of its heavenly position, and hence you have the true basis for the development of the house of God. The house of God is in the good of what is in heaven; the first mention of it in Scripture shows it was the connection between heaven and earth (@Genesis 28: 17 - 19). We need to maintain the
{207}
light of that in our souls; it is the sphere in which the affections of God flow; a heavenly institution upon earth, so that it was a question of Timothy's conduct there. We have to be regulated by heaven in regard to our conduct. So Timothy was to know how to conduct himself in the house of God, which was at the same time the assembly of the living God; it was also the place of strength -- "the pillar and base of the truth" (@1 Timothy 3: 15).
In this eighth chapter of Luke's gospel we have what in a measure corresponds with all that I have been saying; that is, we have the apostles; they are with the Lord; and then there are those also who represent the subjective state; the sympathy that would sustain the testimony. These had been benefited by Christ, and the names of some of them are given to us. It is said of them that they ministered to Him of their substance; they were in complete sympathy with His position in connection with the testimony.
I just refer for a moment to what follows in this chapter, and that is, the authority of the word. One might speak of it in another way, in connection with sowing, but I refer now to its authority. The fruit of the word is spoken of as an hundredfold; those who "in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it". There is a peculiar touch here, which is confined to Luke's gospel. It is only in Luke that the hundredfold is spoken of. In the gospel of Matthew the result of the seed sown in the good ground is said to be an hundred, sixty, and thirty (chapter 13: 8, 23).
{208}
Matthew contemplates things set up in perfection and a perfect result -- an "hundredfold", but there is decline from a hundred to sixty, and from sixty to thirty; whereas in the gospel of Mark it is presented in the reverse order; that is, there is fruit, thirty, sixty, and an hundredfold (chapter 4: 8, 20). Mark presents increase of energy. Mark had at first failed as a servant (see @Acts 15: 38), but having been restored he was stronger at the end than he was at the beginning. Now Luke gives the full and perfect result of the testimony of God in the soul of man; it is not a question of our responsibility in that respect, or of the history of the church. What he is presenting is the ministry of grace; the effect of the Lord's ministry. In other words, he is presenting the full testimony by Paul; the *word of God*. When Paul went out from Antioch, it was to preach "the word of God" (@Acts 13: 5), and Luke shows us that the word of God produces a perfect result.
I now want to dwell a little on the light in regard to the word. "No one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lampstand, that they who enter in may see the light". Now there cannot be light unless we are governed by the word. The Lord says, "Take heed therefore how ye hear". The man that brings forth fruit is the man who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keeps it. I need not say that no son of Adam has that; God alone can produce an honest and good heart. The Lord says, "... having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience". I wish to
{209}
emphasise the importance of the recognition of the word, for we cannot have the light unless we are regulated by the word. The word of God entering into an honest and good heart is kept with patience, and bears fruit an hundredfold; and the result of that is that there must light. Light is morally the character of God coming out in the Christian.
I now pass on to where the Lord's relations are referred to. It is good to have the light in our souls of our relation with the Lord as the result of His death and resurrection. One cherishes the thought that we are the "brethren" of Christ, not only of Christ as risen from the dead, but we are the brethren of the One who could say, "I ascend", which in a certain sense is the most wonderful light that can possibly enter into the soul of a man. He who says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father" (@John 20: 17), also says, "my brethren". It is a divine Person speaking in the liberty of sonship. The Son has the full liberty of the house, and He can say, "I ascend"; and at the same time He associates us with Him as His brethren. I repeat, that no greater light can enter into the soul of man. But here in @Luke 8: 21, we have the other side. The Lord says, "My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and do it". I am not introducing @John 20 into this passage; I referred to @John 20 as showing the full light of our place. One can see in the Acts that the Lord in the course of the testimony indicates that the earthly relations were abandoned, and that the new circle took form at Antioch and Ephesus, where divine
{210}
relationships were established, which were connected, not with an earthly system, as Jerusalem was, but with heaven. The enemy saw it, and he essayed, by introducing legality, to capture the glad tidings of that wonderful liberty of sonship in the presence of God which was enjoyed at Antioch; but the saints were mercifully preserved, so that are see the full light of it in Ephesus.
But how are we to be marked off in this world as related to Christ? The Lord's word is, "My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and do it". We have to maintain clearly and distinctly in our souls our position as the result of the death and resurrection of Christ, and the Holy Spirit is given to us to that end. But what is to be the rule for us here upon earth? The authority of the word; the word of God is to be the rule for us, and it is to be acted upon; the Lord says, "those who hear the word of God and do it". The Lord recognises those who hear and do it. You may ask me, How does He recognise them? He comes to us; He distinguishes us, He manifests Himself to us. The Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word"; and "I ... will manifest myself to him ... my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him" (@John 14: 21 - 23). We are marked off in that way as submitting ourselves to the word of God.
May the Lord bless these simple thoughts to us. It seems to me to be a great thing at the present time to be in sympathy with the testimony. Things are
{211}
much reduced, but the Lord is moving on, and He takes account of the twos and threes of His people here and there who recognise the authority and rule of His word and are in sympathy with His testimony. It is not a question of numbers, though Scripture makes a great deal of the vast number of the redeemed, but evidently the great point for us as upon earth is the authority of God and His word. If there are but a few Christians in a city who are governed by the word, you may depend upon it that the Lord will distinguish them by manifesting Himself to them, and they will be in sympathy with His testimony.

THE CHRISTIAN COMPANY
J. Revell
@John 13:1; @Acts 4: 23
I want to speak a little, in a very elementary way, on the christian company. Some think that the subject of the church is very difficult and intricate. It is true that the full truth of the church is not easily reached, and therefore it is not all at once that the Christian understands it; but while this is so, the first elements of it are very simple, and the youngest believer should not be ignorant of them.
The thought of company is a common one to men. From the beginning of history men have gathered themselves together. In the earliest age a man built a city, having in view the dwelling of men
{212}
together. Though it was a bad man that built the first city, God does not ignore the thought. In His own judgment it was not good for man to be alone. Sin brought in elements of separation, because it lies in man's self-will, but God does not give up the thought of His people being together. It is said of Abraham, that "he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is the artificer and constructor" (@Hebrews 11: 10) And again it is said, "God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city" (verse 16). Cain's city was built in independence of God, whereas faith waits for God's city; but the thought of men dwelling together is found with both.
God's city has foundations. Cain's city had no moral foundations, therefore it came to nothing. He was himself a vagabond by the sentence of God, having shed his brother's blood. An unrighteous man, guilty and under the sentence of God, could not give moral foundations to his city. Every city built by man hitherto has come to an end, and the beautiful cities now in existence will also come to an end; but God has for His own a city which has foundations, of which He is the Builder and Maker.
In working for the preparation of the christian company, God began with righteousness. John the baptist came in the way of righteousness. He came to prepare the way of the Lord, and in so doing urged the people to repentance. The place of his testimony was significant. It was not in the glorious city of Jerusalem, nor was he in priestly garb,
{213}
although of priestly family; he preached in the desert, clad in hairy garments, subsisting on locusts and wild honey. So in his preaching he would not have men counting upon their religious standing and privilege; he insisted on their taking true ground with God as those who had utterly failed. Having baptised them with the baptism of repentance, he pointed out to them the One to whom it was his delight to testify, the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. He thus brought them to the recognition of their own failure, and to the recognition of the place which Christ has.
It would not be a righteous thing to deny the failure and ruin of man by sin; neither would it be a righteous thing to deny the place which Christ has, as having come forth from God. The question was asked, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications, in like manner these also of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?" The Lord's answer was, "Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them?" (@Luke 5: 33, 34). The Pharisees were bent on maintaining the goodness of man, and to this end were fasting and making prayers. John pressed repentance, and the fasting and prayers of his disciples were the expression of their sense of man's failure. But those who had reached Him of whom John testified had got beyond even this, and were rejoicing in all that Christ is.
God works repentance in men, and then sets before them His Son in whom all that God is finds
{214}
its expression. The grace of God is perfectly expressed in Him. That grace was not, as the Pharisees supposed, contrary to the holiness or the righteous claims of God. He spoke of repentance, as John had done, but it was as the perfect expression of divine grace that He came to call sinners to repentance. Thus the vilest might come, as the poor woman in @Luke 7, and find at His feet the forgiveness of sins, peace and salvation. Then the very sense of grace attracts the heart and binds it to Him. The one who is forgiven much loves much. The deeper the sense of grace, the more the heart is attracted and bound to Him who has brought it. The law engages a man with himself, but grace engages us with Him in whom that grace is expressed.
All this is of an individual character. We each have our sins, and find our need of the grace that shines in the Lord; and it is as we are each in the faith of Him that we individually receive forgiveness, peace and salvation. Then as the Spirit takes our hearts and knits them to the precious Saviour, we find that others also have been drawn to Him.
When here on earth the Lord accepted the place of centre. Indeed He declared Himself to be such, saying, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened" (@Matthew 11: 28). It had not been so with any of the prophets. They could testify the word of the Lord, but they could not take the place of being a centre for men. Neither could John take such a place, nor was it his mind to do so. He testified to the Lord,
{215}
and directed the gaze of those who were even his own disciples to Him, saying, "Behold the Lamb of God". The Lord drew men after Himself by the moral power of His own presence, even without speaking a single word, and then as they followed, He confirmed their following by saying, "Come and see". He is not now upon the earth, but that does not alter the fact of His being the true Centre for men. In @John 12: 32 we have His own words, "and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". Upon the earth, and in flesh, He could not be the Centre in the wide sense in which He is as the lifted-up One out of the earth; it is as such that He becomes the glorious Centre of the whole universe of God.
Such was man's state in the flesh that the sacrifice of Christ was a necessity. All man's efforts at union are formed on the basis of being agreeable to each other, and God and His truth have no place at all. Men agree upon certain principles which they judge to be expedient, but if they find these things to be inexpedient all falls to pieces. There is no basis of righteousness, nor any bond of truth. If God binds men together He does so on the basis of righteousness, and binds together with truth. His people love each other in the truth. This gives stability. Now the righteousness of God demanded the judgment of sin, and the removal of all that which is offensive to God. This has been accomplished in the sacrifice of Christ. Not only did He die for our sins, but also that the history of man in the flesh might be ended before God. Thus has
{216}
been removed, in the sacrifice of Christ, the man that was contrary to righteousness and truth. Now God works in His own to produce that which is according to Himself. This He does by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.
The Lord, while here on earth, was the Centre for His own, and in virtue of all that they found in His company (God having wrought in their souls) they were bound together. Then came His death, the immediate effect of which was that they were scattered. The Lord had foretold it, saying, "Behold, the hour is coming, and has come, that ye shall be scattered, each to his own, and shall leave me alone" (@John 16: 32). Even this showed, in a striking way, how everything for them depended on His presence. While He was present they were held together; when He was taken away they were scattered.
After His resurrection the Lord appeared to His own, and by Mary Magdalene He sent that wonderful message, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17). The effect of this was that they were gathered together again. They found that they had not lost the One who bound them together, but that He had been taken from them for a little season that they might have Him, though in a different way, for ever. He had accomplished redemption; all that was offensive to God had been removed in His sacrifice, so that they might be associated with Him beyond fear of separation. He was ascending to His Father as their
{217}
Father also, and His God was theirs. In this way does He show their association with Himself, and that on the ground of righteousness and in resurrection. When gathered together He took His place in their midst, showing that He was still their Centre, and as thus in their midst, He spoke peace to them, and filled their hearts with joy. This is the unalterable portion of His own.
Then, in the beginning of the Acts, we read of the Holy Spirit sent down from Him. The Spirit came to dwell with the disciples, and to be in them. He, as another Comforter, took charge of the company which the Lord had formed here on earth. Thus were they bound together, even more effectively than before, by the presence of a divine Person, for He dwelt in them, and formed them spiritually. It was then that that became true, which was afterwards written in @1 Corinthians 12: 13, "For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit". Yet the Spirit ... maintains us in the faith of Christ, who has gone up to heaven, and thus He, who was the Centre for His people upon the earth, continues to be such to them. The Spirit ministers to us of Him, and forms affections in our hearts for Him, and consequently towards one another, and so He binds us together.

THE DAYSPRING FROM ON HIGH
C. A. Coates
@Luke 2: 7 - 40
There is a peculiar sweetness about the gospel by Luke. It is pre-eminently the gospel of grace. Written by a Gentile who was the companion of Paul -- the apostle of the Gentiles -- I believe it contains a presentation of the gospel as, in a special way, God would have it to be made known to the Gentiles. This is not fanciful, because the gospel is addressed to a Gentile -- Theophilus -- whose name means, Lover of God, and no doubt the Holy Spirit indicated thus that this gospel has special claims upon the attention of Gentile "lovers of God" (@2 Timothy 3:4).
This gospel is the unfolding of the dispensation of grace. In its opening chapters we have the dawn of a new day as it is said, "the dayspring from on high has visited us" (chapter 1: 78). A day of heavenly light and blessing has dawned upon this dark, lost world and the Gentile "lover of God" is to "know the certainty of those things" (chapter 1: 4).
In this gospel every blessing is wholly of God, and therefore purely of grace, and the only link that man has with it is faith. Hence the gospel opens by a striking contrast between Zacharias and Mary -- unbelief and faith. Zacharias, a type of the Jew, reasons and doubts, with the result that he is dumb until the period of faith is ended. He completely failed both as a witness and a worshipper until the time of faith ended; that is, until John was born. Zacharias at the beginning of the gospel history and
{219}
Thomas at the end both set before us the guilty, reasoning unbelief that often clings even to saints. They both failed as witnesses and worshippers all through what was typical of the period of faith. The Jews are exactly in this position. A dispensation has begun in which sight and sense are nothing, and faith is everything: as the scripture says, "faith having come" (@Galatians 3: 25). The Jews have not got faith, and therefore they are dumb, as @Psalm 65: 1 says, "Praise waiteth for thee in silence, O God, in Zion".
It is well for us to remember that we are living in a period when every blessing is of pure grace, and can only be apprehended by faith. Mary sets forth the blessedness of faith; see Chapter 1: 45. She does not reason; she anticipates no difficulty; her spirit rejoices in God her Saviour; she enters into the character of the new day which was just dawning; she knows that men of low degree are to be exalted, and the hungry are to be filled with good things. How truly do we speak of her as the blessed virgin! The new day of grace had lighted up her heart, and there was not a cloud of unbelief to dim the joy of her happy spirit.
You will notice, too, that in this gospel we have not visions and dreams as in Matthew's. The communications come directly from heaven, and they relate to a new order of things in which heaven delights -- an order of things in which everything is of God -- connected with a Person who is not only the Seed of the woman, but the Second Man out of
{220}
heaven.
Think of the moment! God waited until the legal heir to David's throne was an obscure Carpenter in a Galilean village; a descendant of Esau reigned in Judaea as a vassal of Roman power; and the religion of the day was characterised by total ignorance of God's purposes and grace. Just at that time the Son of the Highest was born into the world in obscurity, in weakness, and surrounded by circumstances which made it impossible for anything but heavenly given faith to recognise Him. God began the dispensation of grace by setting aside every conceivable thought and opinion that men might have as to the way in which He would act.
The natural man would never expect to find the greatest actings of God where there was nothing to be seen but the greatest weakness and the deepest poverty. Do not think that the innkeeper of Bethlehem was worse than his fellows. The same company would have the same reception at any other inn in any other town. As someone has said, 'An inn is the place where a man is measured -- the best rooms for the rich, the worst for the poor'. Measured thus by man's standards of reason, common sense, and self-interest, the comfort of a stable, the corner of a manger, was all that the Son of the Highest was worthy of. There was no prospect of earthly gain in receiving Him, and therefore there was "no room" for Him.
That scene at Bethlehem is only a little picture of the world at large, and of each individual. There was
{221}
a time in the history of everyone here tonight when there was no room for Christ in the little world of your own heart. The reception of Christ offered you no worldly advantage, it gave you no prospect of earthly gain, and therefore you had no appreciation of Him whatever.
Such being the case, how does it come to pass that anyone in this world ever gets a right appreciation of Him? John the baptist uttered a great truth in connection with this dispensation when he said, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven" (@John 3: 27); and elsewhere the Lord said, "Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him, comes to me" (@John 6: 45). These shepherds supply the first and one of the most striking instances of this truth. It was from heaven that God communicated to them the glorious fact that a Saviour was born into the world. The heavenly day was dawning, and the first glimmer of its light shone in their hearts. No tribute of earthly glory surrounded that lowly nativity, but heaven loved to herald it, and grace called these "men of low degree" to see what all the respectability and religion of the day was blind to.
There were men of "high degree" sitting in Moses¬ and Aaron's seats at Jerusalem, but God in His sovereignty passed them by and let the light of His grace shine into the hearts of these poor shepherds. Beloved friends, it is not the greatness or the religion of man that commends him to the grace of God. God looks upon men in relation to their
{222}
need, and the more sensible they are of need the more are they suited to His grace.
The first thing heralded from heaven was the announcement of a Saviour. "For today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord". A needy sinner must begin with a Saviour. Is there one such here tonight? Have you a desire to know the Lord Jesus Christ? Does your heart turn to Him in any way? If so, the movement in your soul had its source in the same grace that provided a Saviour for you. The Saviour came from heaven, and the desire to know Him comes thence also. Thank God! that precious Saviour is for you. In the matchless glory of His Person -- in the deep perfection and eternal efficacy of His work -- in the infinite love of His heart -- He is for you. See Him here in the humiliation of matchless grace! Trace the footprints of His love by Sychar's lonely well, in the Pharisee's house, amid the throngs of need- oppressed sinners, right on to Gethsemane and Calvary! As you see Him thus seeking the lost, does not your heart rejoice to know that grace makes you welcome to such a Saviour, and that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life? Then believe in Him now, and
<blockquote>'Let not conscience make you linger, <br> Nor of fitness fondly dream; <br> All the fitness He requireth <br> Is to feel your need of Him: <br> This He gives you, <br> ¬Tis the Spirit's rising beam' (`208:2). </blockquote>
{223}
The announcement of a Saviour is the occasion for heaven to join in a chorus of praise in which the whole result of Christ's coming into the world is celebrated: "*Glory to God in the highest*"!
The first and greatest result of Christ coming into the world was that God was glorified in the scene where sin had dishonoured Him. Christ came into all the circumstances and responsibilities in which the natural man had completely and continuously dishonoured God, and filled up the whole compass of man's responsibility with absolute perfection.
Then think of what was at stake when as the Victim He hung upon the cross! We had a great stake in that work: our salvation was at stake. Two men were at work on a lofty building in London, when one of them looked down to the pavement far beneath and said to his mate, 'Jim, there are only two inches between us and damnation', referring to the plank on which they stood. We can look down to the depths of hell and say that there is nothing between us and damnation but "a Saviour ... who is Christ the Lord". Take away His precious blood -- His finished work -- and nothing could save us from dropping into hell. Yes! we have a great stake in the atoning work of Calvary!
But let us not forget that God had a far greater stake in that work than we had. Sin was a challenge to His majesty, a tarnish upon the glory of His throne, a dishonour to His name, and an insult to His nature. When that blessed Victim hung upon the cross, the glory of God's name and nature in respect
{224}
to sin was staked upon Him, and with a glorious result. The work is accomplished which has established the glory of God in imperishable splendour for ever. His counsels and purposes rest now upon the secure basis of redemption, and He is indebted for His glory to the same Person to whom we owe our salvation. If I think of all that I was as a guilty child of Adam, I can look to the cross and say, 'That wondrous work has not only cleared me of every charge, but the Holy God against whom I have sinned has been glorified about all that I have done and all that I was'. "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace".

RIGHTEOUSNESS
F. E. Raven
Do you understand what righteousness means?
Righteousness is the maintenance in integrity of every established relationship. That has come out in Christ, and is brought to pass in us by the springing up of the Spirit. That will enable you to understand @Romans 8: 10: "But if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness". It brings us to practical righteousness, that is, to correspondence to Christ. We are righteous even as Christ is righteous. It is a remarkable result to be brought to pass in one who has been sinful and lawless in this world.

CHRIST IN US
W. R. Mason
@Romans 8: 9, 10; @Galatians 2: 19 - 21; @2 Corinthians 13: 3 - 5; @Colossians 1: 24 - 29; @Colossians 2: 6, 7
We were speaking earlier, dear brethren, of being in Christ. I want to speak now of Christ being in us; the two go together: "In that day", the Lord said, "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" (@John 14: 20). The Lord prayed too that the love wherewith the Father had loved Him might be in us and He in us. It is a great thought with Christ that He should be in us, and have scope and precedence. So the Lord desired that the saints might be one "as we are one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me" (@John 17: 20 - 26).
This is a great truth, central indeed to all that is proper to Christianity, that Christ should be in His saints. That is the great mystery of the gospel. It is not just that we should believe in a certain Person of whom we have heard, but that we have received Him. That is what we read in Colossians: "As therefore ye have received the Christ ... walk in him, rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving". I hope we all here have received Christ. God has received Him up there in glory, and wants us to receive Him down here into our hearts. As Paul prayed, "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in
{226}
love" (@Ephesians 3: 17). These are very wonderful living things, dear brethren, not mere doctrines or theories, but actualities -- Christ in us.
We read in @Roman 8 "*ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him". That is a very testing word. Have we all got the Spirit of Christ, so that we think and feel like Christ? Well, it will be manifest then that we are of Him. And then he says, "but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness". The "body is dead", he says, "on account of sin". Let us keep it that way, dear brethren, that, as far as things are going down here, the body is dead on account of sin. How then are we to be in the way of righteousness? By the power of the Holy Spirit, as it says, "the Spirit life on account of righteousness"; on the one hand, the body dead, on the other hand the Spirit life. That is to be the experience of every true Christian.
If righteousness is to be accomplished, it must be as the Spirit is life in us. It says in chapter 6 too that "our old man has been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be annulled" (verse 6) -- I think that corresponds with chapter 8, "if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin" -- "that we should no longer serve sin. For he that has died is justified from sin". And so we are to reckon ourselves "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus". That is the kind of spiritual arithmetic that we are to carry out every day: reckoning ourselves "dead to sin and
{227}
alive to God in Christ Jesus. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts". Sin is not to reign. The mortal body is to be held for God.
That means, dear brethren, practically that we must be thinking about Jesus every day, every hour of our lives, and bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, for His death has put us to death according to flesh. "Our old man has been crucified with him ... that we should no longer serve sin" (@Romans 6: 6), and now the life of Jesus is to be manifested in our body. That is an affecting thought, one of sensitiveness and feeling, that we really feel what the dying of Jesus meant: the gradualness of it, and yet the deliberateness of it, and we are to bear it about in the body, remembering the dying of Jesus, "for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh; so that death works in us", Paul says, "but life in you" (@2 Corinthians 4: 10 - 12).
What we referred to in chapter 2 of Galatians is very affecting. There it says, "For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God". The law only brought condemnation upon us. "There is then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus" (@Romans 8: 1), but we have died to law that we may live to God. We have a new Husband now. Abigail got a new husband when Nabal died, and David became her new lover, her new master (@1 Samuel 25). Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me". Now that is a further thought. Not just that Christ is in us, but that He
{228}
lives in us.
But then Paul says, And the life "that I now live in flesh". You might think it is rather theoretic to say that Christ lives in me, but then he goes on to explain that the life "that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me". That makes Christianity very personal, and very attractive too, that He loves me and has given Himself for me. Christ "died for all", it says elsewhere, "that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" (@2 Corinthians 5: 15). And we need to take on Paul's language: He "has loved me and given himself for me". Should that not make Christ very attractive to every one of us, to claim Him as the One who died for us? His death was an atoning death; it was not a natural death. Death had no claim upon Jesus. His death was a sacrificial death in which He laid down His life, having authority from the Father to lay it down, and to take it again. Well, this is very precious teaching indeed, and we are to be found therefore in this way of committal to the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. That is the real testimony: that the life of Jesus might be manifest in the mortal bodies of the saints.
In @2 Corinthians 13 we have an interesting reasoning on the part of the apostle. These Corinthians had become so low in their spiritual state that they were doubting the apostleship of Paul.
{229}
He says, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me". Some of them were saying, Prove that Christ spoke to us through you. He says, Christ "is not a weak towards you, but is powerful among you, for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power; for indeed *we* are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God's power towards you". That is a great principle for the ministers to follow: that they are weak in Him, but live by God's power towards the saints.
The Corinthians were debating Paul's apostle-ship, doubting it, questioning it. How far away they had got! So he says, "examine your own selves if ye be in the faith". That is something for us to do. If we have any doubts about the truth, about the Scriptures, about the ministry, let us examine ourselves. He says, "do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?" That was something that was a fact, it was true. They did not seem to realise that. And Paul says, "examine your own selves if ye be in the faith", adding, "do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?" Why do we act the way we do? Why do we abstain from the world, and the things of the flesh? Because Christ lives in us, and Jesus Christ is in us. That is not only a doctrine, that is a fact Paul is speaking of. This is what God has done, He has put Jesus Christ in us.
So as it says in Colossians, "As therefore ye have received the Christ ... walk in him". I hope we have all received Him, that He is in our hearts and that we recognise ourselves that Jesus Christ, the second
{230}
Man out of heaven, is in us, for that is what makes us true Christians, and it gives us a part in the testimony of God at the present time.
Well, I thought the passage in Colossians would enhance our apprehension of this. These persons were under assail by Philistine minds, and they were being diverted through wrong teaching. False leaders sought to displace Paul and his teaching from the Colossian saints. But Paul rejoiced in sufferings for the brethren. This was not merely an abstract line of doctrine; he suffered for the saints. He says, "I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly". So Paul's sufferings have to be viewed in that light, not just that he was being persecuted by Gentiles or Jews or chief priests, but he was suffering to "fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh". Those were, I think, the testimonial sufferings. Paul had no part in the atoning sufferings of Christ. That was completed, perfected by Jesus Himself alone, as it says in Hebrews, "having made by himself the purification of sins" (chapter 1: 3) -- nobody helped in that work, that was Christ's work alone upon the cross. Not even the Spirit was helping Him there. He was forsaken of the Father and of the Spirit: "having made by himself the purification of sins". But, thank God, They are both seen gloriously in the resurrection of the Lord (@Romans 6: 4; @1 Peter 3: 18). Such was Christ, and now Paul is thinking of the tribulations of the body of Christ. There are many tribulations the saints are going
{231}
through, and I have no doubt there are many believers in many parts of the world who are suffering for Christ according to their light and their testimony. Well, let us keep them in our prayers. They belong to His body, which is the assembly.
Paul never forgave himself for persecuting the assembly: "I ... am not fit to be called apostle", he says, "because I have persecuted the assembly of God" (@1 Corinthians 15: 9). That was very solemn in Paul's mind, because it was the tribulations of Christ. So he says that now he was suffering "for his body, which is the assembly; of which *I* became minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God". We might say, John is the last writer of Scripture. But John does not give us any more than Paul gives. Paul completed the word of God. He brought in the truth of Christ in glory and His body here on earth. That was the very first thing that came into Paul's life as he met the Lord on the Damascus road: "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?" (@Acts 9: 4). Jesus Christ was here in those saints on earth whom Paul was persecuting. The Lord felt it that Paul was persecuting His hands and His feet, His members. That is what we are, dear brethren, members of Christ. Let us see what we do with the members of Christ. Keep them holy, pure and separate from this world, and fully devoted, as He was, to the will of God.
Paul completed the word of God, "the mystery", he says, "which has been hidden from ages and from
{232}
generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints". We are living in a wonderful time. Soon the time of mystery will be over and it will then be the day of manifestation. The whole creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. It is suffering now, even the animal creation, on account of the fall of Adam, but the mystery is that Christ is and will be made manifest in His saints. We know now who Jesus is. The Jews do not recognise Him yet as their Messiah, the One sent of God, the revelation of God to His earthly people. But we of the assembly, we Gentiles, have been initiated into the truth of the mystery "hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints".
Think of all those holy prophets from Isaiah to Malachi, and they did not understand the mystery. It was hidden from them. God was reserving it for another generation, for another body of people, all one in Christ Jesus. That is what Paul is dealing with now, when he speaks of completing the word of God. What John has is something for the glory of Christ. He brings out the truth too that Christ should be in us, "I in them and thou in me". If we dwell in love we dwell in God and God in us. John was very close to Paul in his teaching. Paul completed the word of God, and now the mystery has been made manifest to His saints. Oh! let us pray more about this, that we might understand what the mystery is, and how it is soon going to be unveiled before a wondering universe, when Christ will "have come to
{233}
be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed ... in that day" ( @2 Thessalonians 1: 10).
Paul says, "to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory". That is wonderful: "Christ in you, the hope of glory". That connects in my mind with "the bright and morning star" (@Revelation 22: 16). The Lord's promise to one of the overcomers was: "I will give to him the morning star" (@Revelation 2: 28), the light of a Man who would fill another day, who would arise as "the Sun of righteousness" (@Malachi 4: 2). He is known as the morning Star while the night still persists, but soon He is going to be the Sun of righteousness and He will bring peace and glory to the nations of the whole world, specially to His called people. So he says, "God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory". Well, that is the bright and morning Star, and that is what we are to be in the gain of at the present time.
Peter says, "we have the prophetic word made surer, to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts" (@2 Peter 1: 19). I trust that we have come that far, dear brethren, and are not just depending now on the word of prophecy, what these Old Testament prophets have brought out, but that the morning Star Himself has arisen in our hearts. We have a living Person now dwelling in us, arising in our hearts; of Him, Paul says, "whom
{234}
*we* announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ". What a standard the apostle had before him in his service, that he would have every man presented perfect in Christ, fully developed in the knowledge of the Son of God who loved him and gave Himself for him.
Paul says, "Whereunto also I toil, combating according to his working, which works in me in power" (chapter 2: 1). How short one comes as to this matter of combating. We might pray in a superficial way for the people of God in their difficulties and trials, but what do we know about combating, because this combat is with the powers of darkness, the wicked ones in the heavenlies. And Paul does it according to God's working, "which works in me in power". Oh! let us make room for that in our prayers, beloved brethren, the power of God in us, and there will be combat according to that power. He says, "I would have you know what combat I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh; to the end that their hearts might be encouraged, being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom
{235}
and of knowledge" (verses 1 - 3). Oh! how we need to ponder these things, dear brethren. How often we are occupied with trivialities, what is going on in this world, but think of the greatness of "the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge". So we are not to be deluded "by persuasive speech". There are many persons in Christendom seeking to persuade believers away from the faith. Let us not succumb to that kind of teaching.
"As therefore ye have received the Christ ... walk in him". Now let us be sure, dear brethren, that we have not just received teaching, or light, about Christ, but that we have received the Person: "As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in him". What a wonderful thought -- "walk in him, rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving". We must not despise teaching that we have had, dear brethren. Let us walk in it and abound in it with thanksgiving.
May the Lord bless these thoughts to us for His Name's sake.

THE DAYSPRING FROM ON HIGH
C. A. Coates
@Luke 2: 7 - 40
There never was, from the moment of the fall, such a thing as peace on earth until this blessed Babe was born. Before the fall there was the peace of innocence without a jarring note in all creation: but sin came in and reduced the harmony to discord, and from that moment until @Luke 2 there was no 'peace on earth'.
{236}
This peace may be considered in three ways:
1. The Son of the Highest was here upon earth -- the blessed, perfect One whose every motive and desire was exactly in accord with the will of God. He could speak about "*my* peace" (@John 14: 27). *His* peace was found in having no will of His own. He walked under the yoke of God's will in unbroken rest and peace. He could answer the most cutting rejection -- the most adverse circumstance -- with a peaceful, "Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight" (@Matthew 11: 26). But He was *alone* in that circle of peace. Peter, James, and John -- much beloved as they were -- were not in it. How often *they* were ruffled and perturbed!
2. But the moment came when He could say, "I leave peace with you; I give *my* peace to you" (@John 14: 27). The circle of peace was going to be enlarged. This could only be on the ground of His death, for man after the flesh could never give up his own will: to do so would be to give up his very existence. But the death of Christ is -- judicially, and for faith -- the end of that man, and the Christian walking in the Spirit owns him no more. The believer can thus -- and only thus -- have freedom from sin as he reckons himself to have died to sin, and to be alive to God in Christ Jesus. Then, as free, he yields himself unto God as one alive from the dead. He presents his body a living sacrifice unto God, and proves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Thus walking, the peace of Christ becomes an experimental reality in the heart
{237}
of the Christian. Oh! what a gift. Think of the blessed serenity of spirit with which He passed through the world, doing the will of God, and then weigh the words once more, "I give *my* peace to you"! And do not forget that this is for earth, where every disturbing element is present; there will not be the same need for it in heaven ...
It is on earth that we need, and may have, Christ's peace. Do you know anything of this peace, my brother, my sister? It is not a dreamy speculation in the clouds, it is an experimental reality, and if as one alive from the dead in Christ Jesus you accept His yoke you will have His peace. It is your birthright -- the portion which His love bestows.
3. Then there will be 'peace on earth' in the millennial day. The ruthless, wicked will of man will be set aside, the swords beaten into ploughshares and the spears into pruning-hooks, and the Prince of Peace will reign. Peace will be universal then. I need hardly say that it is an infinitely greater thing to be in peace amid sin's confusion, and in spite of all the stormy waves of adverse circumstances which beat around us now.
If we think of the wondrous fact that a divine Person has become man, we cannot fail to see that He must be a Man in whom God would find "good pleasure". What He was from eternity necessarily gave character to what He became as Man upon earth. Hence He is called "the second man, out of heaven" (@1 Corinthians 15: 47). The first man was made of the earth and for the earth; the second Man was One
{238}
who had been in heaven, who belonged to heaven, and who was ever in spirit there. As it has often been said, He was a Man of an entirely new order -- a Man in whom God could find His delight. God has found "good pleasure" in a Man.
Think of the contrast! When man after the flesh came into view "Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart" (@Genesis 6: 6), and the flood was the solemn testimony that the judgment of God was upon "all flesh" (verse 13). When the second Man was in view, God opened the heaven and declared, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Luke 3: 22). Thank God! we are no longer linked with the fallen man; the man in whom God could find no pleasure was ended at the cross. The death of Christ has severed our links with Adam, and the Holy Spirit now links us with Christ risen and glorified. We are His companions. "Both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (@Hebrews 2: 11). The same love and good pleasure which rested upon Him rests upon us. God has "*good pleasure in men*".
Has this glorious truth become a reality in your soul? Has your heart fed upon the death of Christ as that which has severed your links with Adam, that you might become a member of a new race -- linked up with Christ risen and glorified? You are not only forgiven and cleansed, but an object of delight to God and the Father as He looks upon you in all the
{239}
acceptance and beauty of the blessed Person who put away your sins and with whom you have died. God has "good pleasure in men".
Heaven was celebrating all this, while as yet there was nothing to see but a Babe in a manger. The work which was the basis of it all was not done for three-and-thirty years, but the presence of that Babe on earth was the pledge to heaven of the sure accomplishment of every purpose and delight of God's heart.
Now I want you to notice the different persons who are mentioned in this chapter, because I think that they illustrate the *characteristics of faith in the dispensation of grace*.
First, we find some people who say (@Luke 2: 15), "Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us". The heavenly communication found a response in the faith of their hearts. There was *nothing* in that matchless scene to human sight or reason, but there was *everything* for heaven and *everything* for faith. These men were content to leave their own things -- their duties, their possessions, all that was naturally and rightly their object upon earth -- because they were so charmed by the revelation of heaven's delight in One who to the eyes of men was utterly insignificant. The heavenly glory which shone upon them had thrown earthly things into the shade. Oh! that it might be so with ourselves.
There is a moral journey which answers to the
{240}
literal journey of the shepherds. Have you ever taken it? Has your heart been attracted to the Son of God who thus came down in the humiliation of matchless grace to be the Saviour of sinful men? Have you ever gone by faith to Bethlehem to find the peace of your conscience and the joy of your heart in that lowly, heavenly Saviour? Have you found *Him* to be *everything* -- all your salvation and all your desire? Have you in heart and spirit left earthly things because *He* has eclipsed them all? If so, I am sure you can understand in measure the effect produced upon these shepherds. "The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen" (verse 20). They went back to their duties and occupations in this life with full hearts. They had found a joy greater than all the gladness of the earth, and they went back into the trying circumstances and difficulties of everyday life with that joy so filling their hearts that they were "glorifying and praising God". They had not received a single earthly blessing, and yet their cup was running over; they were enriched in faith beyond expression.
Next, in verse 25, we have a man *waiting* and *watching*, and it is remarkable how much is said of the Holy Spirit in connection with him. "The Holy Spirit was upon him"; "it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit"; "he came in the Spirit into the temple". Then he was not looking for death, but for a coming Person who already filled his heart. And, lastly, he had no desire
{241}
to remain in a scene where Christ was to be rejected. What a beautiful picture of a Christian!
Because of the value of Christ's work, the Holy Spirit seals and indwells every believer. In the cleansing of the leper the oil was put upon the blood (@Leviticus 14: 14 - 17). When our faith laid hold of the value of Christ's work, and we believed on Him as the risen One who had accomplished everything for us, we were sealed by the Holy Spirit. I am sure that we have a very feeble sense of the greatness of this blessed fact and its consequences. The Holy Spirit would do wonderful things for us if we did not hinder and grieve Him. He would make us practically free from the lust of the flesh (see @Galatians 5: 16), and would give us the abiding consciousness that we are the objects of God's love (@Romans 8: 14 - 16). The result would be that we should walk every day and all the day long in liberty and joy as the sons of God. Is it so with us, my brethren?
Simeon was led by the Spirit and did not miss his opportunity. Do you ever miss opportunities? The Holy Spirit never does. He led Simeon to the right place just at the right moment. I believe if we were more subject to the control of the Spirit of God our experience of His leading would be much more distinct and habitual.
Then it was revealed unto Simeon by the Holy Spirit "that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ" (verse 26). The Holy Spirit would fain detach our hearts from this present evil age, and occupy them with the One who is coming. The
{242}
Christian -- taught by the Holy Spirit -- does not look for death; much less does he expect things to improve either in the world or the church: he is *waiting* and *watching* for a Person from heaven.
Further, nothing is more striking than Simeon's utterance when at last he held the infant Saviour in his arms. The Messiah was truly there -- the One whom a Jew would naturally look upon as having come to set everything right on the earth. Yet he says, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go ... in peace" (verse 29). 'What! *depart* from the place where the Messiah is?' 'Yes!' 'Why?' 'Because I know He will be rejected here, and I do not want to have a place where He has none'. Ah! Simeon, you are far ahead of many Christians in the twentieth century!
Now, just a word about Anna and her *witness for Christ*. She was of the tribe of Asher, and a lovely illustration she presents of the blessing of her tribe. "Let him dip his foot in oil. Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be" (@Deuteronomy 33: 24, 25, Authorised Version). Think of this dear old woman having gone through a wilderness journey of over a hundred years without being footsore or crippled. She was still active, whether to go *in* as a *worshipper* or to go *out* as a *witness*. God knows how to equip His people for a rough journey. Thorns and stones and burning desert sand will not hurt you if your foot is dipped in oil and you wear shoes of iron and brass. In type it is walking in the Spirit, and having the strength and endurance which faith imparts.
{243}
Anna's affections were in the current of God's acting. She had read that the Lord would come suddenly to His temple, and she tarried there, sustained through the long years by the strength and patience born of faith. Then that lovely word was verified in her experience -- "as thy days so shall thy strength be". In nature as we get older we get weaker. The blessing promised to Asher was that as they got older they were to be stronger. It corresponds, I think, to @Proverbs 4: 18, "the path of the righteous is as the shining light, going on and brightening until the day be fully come". Anna's last days were her strongest and her brightest days. Beloved, we should look for this -- a continual advance and increase of light and strength -- not, indeed, as to the outward man, but as to the inward, being renewed day by day.
She "spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem". Who would have thought of sending such a missionary into the most religious city on earth? The first *witness for Christ* -- the first *missionary of grace* in Jerusalem -- a widow over a hundred years old! When it is a question of *witness for Christ*, man's strength and abilities go for nothing, and *fidelity* to His blessed name and Person is everything. Her fidelity had kept her for long years in the temple -- the devoted handmaiden of the Lord. The same fidelity had drawn out the affections of her heart to the beloved remnant who looked for redemption. She was no mystic, wrapped up in her own spirituality. Her heart had busied itself to find
{244}
out "*all* those who waited for redemption", and now at the fitting moment she went forth to speak to them of *Him*.
"She spoke of HIM"! That is our mission. We have found the answer to all our need in that blessed Person. Would to God that He was more practically *everything* to our hearts! We are left in the world that rejected Him to speak of Him. Thank God there are -- through His grace -- empty, longing, needy hearts in this world -- hearts that are sick of the pleasures and weary of the bondage of sin -- hearts that cannot be satisfied with the empty shell of the temple-ritual. Thousands, too, of His own who long to know Him better, are waiting for the "word in its season" (@Proverbs 15: 23). Oh! that we may have our own hearts filled first, and then go forth -- whether it be to saint or sinner -- to *speak of Him*.
*The True Grace of God, pages 54 - 61 [2 of 2]*.
THE CHRISTIAN COMPANY
J. Revell
@John 13:1; @Acts 4: 23
In @Acts 4: 21 - 23, the disciples had been examined and threatened, and being let go, they went to their own company. They were not isolated as solitary individuals, they had their own company, and they knew it. Their company was not of the world. There was the plainest distinction between them and the world. The world had crucified the One who was so dear to them, and they themselves were suffering from the same world. And this, too, was the
{245}
religious section of the world. So they were very conscious of their separation from it, but they found their company with those who were attached, as they themselves were, to the Lord Jesus Christ. This was the company formed and controlled by the Holy Spirit, and in it they found their happy place. It was a refuge for them from the cold persecuting world, which had crucified their Lord.
Now when a man is converted he should know his own company. That company is not found in the world. If he turn to the world for company he shows that the gospel has not yet done its full work in his soul. Where the gospel has done its work, not only is the forgiveness of sins known, and the grace which is manifested in this, but also, like the woman of @Luke 7, the One in whom that grace has reached us becomes unspeakably precious to us. When this is the case, we cannot find our company with the world with whom the Lord has no place, but we must seek it with those who have been similarly drawn to Him. God does not intend that we should be isolated, nor that we should content ourselves with individual blessing, but He would have us in the company of His own.
But it will be said: There are now so many companies of Christians that we cannot tell which is the right one. The fact that there are so many companies only tends to show what a small place the Lord has in the hearts of His people. The simpler and the stronger the affection for Christ, the more unbearable everything becomes which is not of Him.
{246}
I know only of one test for discovering the right company, and that is the place which Christ has with them, and consequently the intolerance with which everything is viewed which is not of Him. If all Christians were in simple love to Christ, and in the exclusion of everything which is not of Him, they would all be together. It is the entrance of the will of man and confidence in the qualities of the flesh, that has divided Christians.
In @2 Timothy 2 we are told to purge ourselves from vessels to dishonour, and to follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Such are not of necessity advanced Christians. To call on the Lord is a sign of absolute dependence on Him. Samuel was characterised by this; he was among those who call on His name, as @Psalm 99: 6 says. When he began his ministry, the priesthood was corrupt and was the means of corrupting the people, and yet was held with the greatest pretension by the sons of Eli. God judged all this; He gave His glory into the hand of the enemy. It was a terrible step to take, and showed in what a terrible state His people were. Samuel gathered all the people to Mizpah and there he prayed, with fasting and pouring water out on the ground, in token of their undone condition; and he offered there a sucking lamb (@1 Samuel 7: 5 - 11). It showed, in figure, that no confidence was to be placed in man, but only in that which Christ is to God. Their comprehension of this might be small, as the offering was, but it spoke of Christ. In a similar
{247}
way to this, we should be marked by absence of all pretension, and be found cleaving to Christ alone, with true affection for Him. "Out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2: 22) shows that there is no hypocrisy, and this is made manifest by what a man pursues. There will be with such a man, as this portion of Scripture says, the pursuit of righteousness, faith, love and peace. Thus do we find those with whom we should have our place. If we have regard to the Lord alone we seek the company of those who pursue these things. We want to be with those who are free of all pretension, but who, in absolute dependence on the Lord, seek those things which are approved of Him.
My reason for reading the first verse of @John 13 is that I identify "their own company" in @Acts 4 with the expression "his own". The company becomes our own, because it is the Lord's own. Whatever they may be, in obscurity or poverty, if He loves them, we may well love them too. It must be recognised, however, that this is not at the expense of truth or holiness. The expression is striking which is found in the two short epistles of John: "whom I love in the truth" (@2 John 1 and @3 John 1). It con-templates the flow of divine affections in the saints, as formed and controlled by the whole truth of God. Thus all that is contrary to the truth is excluded.
In the second epistle the apostle directs that the door be closed against those who bring not the doctrine of Christ (verse 10). Such a proceeding may be viewed by men as narrow and uncharitable, but the claims of Christ demand it, and those who love the
{248}
Lord will not be slow to respond to those claims. In the third epistle the door is opened to all who have gone forth for the sake of the Name. No matter how amiable and plausible a man may be, if he bring not the doctrine of Christ, we must close the door; but the one who comes in all the value of the name of Him whom we love, must find an open door. In love in the truth, Christ, and not our own feelings or wishes, is the test.
The company which the Lord recognises as His own is the object of His unchanging love even at the present time. And in speaking thus I do not exclude from my thought one Christian upon the face of the earth; all come under His love. When He rose from the dead the only thing that claimed His attention upon the earth was the company of His own. Now that He is in heavenly glory, His love is unchanged; He loves His own to the end. How many things may come in before the end! Yet it is to the end that He loves. "Having loved his own which were in the world, loved them to the end". If we look at the church today in its outward aspect, as it is before the eyes of the world, there is nothing but grief for us; but as we look at it under the gracious and unchanging love of Christ we can rejoice.
While the whole church is under the love of Christ, if we would know the joy of His presence and the enjoyment of His love, there must be the maintenance of righteousness and holiness. If there be not that which is suitable to Him, He cannot give the sense of His presence with us. In @John 13 He
{249}
speaks of our having "part with me", and it is to this end that He washes the feet of His disciples; "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me" (verse 8). He delights in the company of His own, but they must be in a suited state, and with this in view He carries on this patient service of love, freeing us from all the defilement which we may contract in going through this world. Then in chapter 14 He says: "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (verse 18). Not only does He long after the company of His own, but He counts on the same longing being found with them so that they value His presence, and to those who value it He gives it. Now I desire that we should not only have outward identification with the company which the Lord approves, but that also we may reach the consciousness of His presence in the midst of His own. It is this which constitutes the full privilege of the assembly; for in the consciousness of His presence we are led into all the joy of the Father's love. The One who has declared the Father's name gives us to know all the blessedness which lies in that name as we are consciously in His company; and in the midst of His own He sings praise to the Father.
In view of His absence the Lord instituted the Supper of which we partake in remembrance of Him. He counted upon His own coming together during the time of His absence, and He knew that in thus coming together they would feel His absence, and on this account He gave them the Supper to keep. The apostle speaks of it again in @1 Corinthians 11.
{250}
We partake of the Supper, in coming together, for the purpose of calling to mind the One who has loved us even to death; so that, though He be actually absent, He may become present to our minds and hearts¬ affections. We recall Him in all the greatness and devotedness of His love. As He becomes present thus to us, we enter into all the joy of His presence, and taste all the blessed portion into which He brings us, according to the will of God. The truth of all this is unfolded for us in Paul's epistles.
I trust that you may see the great importance of the christian company. I trust that you will not stop short at seeing, in a general way, that the church is under the love of Christ, but that you may know the place where principles are maintained which are according to the Lord, and where consequently He is free to come, fulfilling His own word, "I am coming to you", and that in that place you may know all the joy of His realised presence; the consciousness of His own love, delighting in the company of His own, and leading them into the enjoyment of the Father's love.

THINGS REVEALED, ONCE CONCEALED
J. B. Stoney
@Proverbs 25: 2
"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing". Thus spake Solomon, for God reveals, and man learns. The
{251}
revealer can select his own time for the revelation; till then what he knows is kept concealed. The learner searches out a matter to increase his store of acquired knowledge. How these words, the last clause especially, became themselves an illustration of the truth they set forth, in a way Solomon surely never thought of! For, uttered by him before Israel was separated from Judah, they were probably, with what follows them, not incorporated with the book of Proverbs till Israel had ceased to be a distinct kingdom on earth. They were copied out by the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah. It was to that king's honour to search out all that he could of the sayings of the wisest of men replete with divine wisdom, which God till then had not allowed to form part of this book.
But the former clause of the verse receives a fuller illustration when we turn to other parts of Scripture, and observe how God has concealed things from man till the right moment arrived to reveal them. Centuries rolled by before He placed in the hands of His people the first written portion of the volume of the book. During fifteen hundred years subsequent to that epoch, the Spirit of God, from time to time, added to the sacred volume, till, at the death of John the evangelist and apostle, the pen of inspiration was laid aside, the range of God's revelation to His church being by that time complete. Commencing in Genesis with the record of the old creation, it carries us on to the new creation of all things, an outline of God's dealings
{252}
with man and the earth in time, which divides the eternity of the past from the eternity of the future. But as it speaks a little of the eternity of the future, so does it of the eternity of the past. Yet we must penetrate far into the book, and read almost to its close, ere we gather up all we are permitted to collect of what took place near the beginning. God reveals things to man, but each in his season.
The history of the creation is an example of this. To learn about it we turn naturally to the beginning of Genesis, where we find it the special subject of revelation. But all is not told us at once, for we must turn to @Job 38: 7 to learn whether any created intelligences witnessed the fastening of the foundations of the earth. To rebuke Job, who was speaking of things he knew not, Jehovah mentions the morning stars singing together, and all the sons of God shouting for joy, as they beheld almighty power dealing with this our earth. How then should Job, whose existence, compared with these, was so limited, and whose knowledge was so scanty, presume to sit in judgment on the actions and motives of his Creator?
Far back as this takes us, we can travel in thought to a period still more remote, when we hearken to Wisdom's voice, persuading men to give ear to her teaching, as one fully competent to instruct them, @Proverbs 8. In presenting, as it were her credentials in proof of the claims she asserted, she tells us, "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old ... When he
{253}
prepared the heavens I was there", etc. (verses 22, 27). In Genesis neither of these matters is stated. God brought them out when needed, the truth in season for men. Do we not feel, as we gather up these notices of creation, that all has not yet been told us that God knows about it? We know something, but only what He has revealed; and His manner of relating it suggests to the heart that, were it requisite, He could tell us yet more. It is the full treasury of knowledge dealing out at times a little of its store.
If we turn to the epistle of Jude, we are furnished with a few more illustrations of God's concealing a matter till the time arrives to declare it, as we read of the sin of the fallen angels, and the contention of Michael the archangel with the devil, and as we peruse the prophecy of Enoch, the seventh from Adam.
In @2 Peter 2 we are told that punishment awaits the fallen angels (verse 4); for the sure punishment of sins is the subject there in hand. In Jude we learn what their sin was -- they "had not kept their own original state" (verse 6). But why is their existence kept a secret till so late in the world's history? Why is it that what happened, we believe, before man was created is not disclosed till after atonement has been made? The character of their sin is similar to that of apostate Christendom. They left their first estate. Men in the latter days will despise dominion. Both cast off the position of subjection in which God has placed them. Now this evil having been introduced in the days of Jude, the Spirit by him warns souls of
{254}
it. The evil was then germinating through the introduction privily of ungodly men to the assembly of believers, who turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, and denied the only Lord (despot -- "God" is omitted by the best MSS and textual critics) and our Lord Jesus Christ. Great is the sin of these men; but if earth has not been a stranger to such daring wickedness, heaven witnessed something similar when the fallen angels forsook the place God had originally assigned them. So their history is referred to as a warning to souls now.
But if the character of their sin finds a parallel in that of the fallen angels, their presumption, their arrogance, stand rebuked by the conduct of Michael the archangel (@Jude 9). Here we are introduced to a contention between him and the devil which took place, not, like the previous event, before Adam was created, but, though man was unconscious of it, after Israel had been called out to be the Lord's peculiar people. These men would speak evil of dignities. Michael the archangel would not allow himself to bring a railing accusation against a dignity, even though it was a fallen one, the devil. He would maintain the authority of the Lord. "The Lord rebuke thee". That was the Lord's, not Michael's part. They would shut God out of the world, and act in a manner the archangel would shrink from.
Privily these men had entered in amongst believers, deceiving the saints as to their real character, though they could not deceive the Lord. He saw them, described them, and had even foretold
{255}
their latter end by His servant Enoch. If we turn to the inspired biography in Genesis we read nothing of his prophecy, and should not have gathered from it that he had ever been used as a prophet. Jude however discloses this fact, and gives us the very terms of his prediction; so we read what men before the flood heard and knew, we can listen to language with which some of them may have been familiar. As long as God was dealing with Israel as a distinct people apart from others, the Gentiles were not brought into view, generally speaking, except as they were connected with the people of Israel. But now that God will deal with the whole world, and pour out His wrath upon the ungodly, the prophecy of Enoch again has its place amongst the revelations He has made, and for the first time is recorded in the volume of His word. It was truth in season for souls in Jude's day; so, though in existence for more than three thousand years, it was not brought forward after the flood, till the time for its use as a warning of coming events had arrived.
How simply are these revelations of the past unfolded to us! They come not as discoveries just made by the writer, but as facts which God had never forgotten.
These examples of God concealing matters till the revelation of them would profit men might well speak to man's heart, and make him pause ere he sat in judgment on his Maker, questioning whether he is as fully informed of all he needs to know as he ought to be, if the actions and character of the Lord are to
{256}
be judged at the bar of human opinion. How limited is his knowledge of what had taken place before Adam walked in the garden! How ignorant too is he of what may be taking place around him, between spirits invisible to mortal eyes, and impalpable to mortal sense!
Who of the children of Israel witnessed that dispute Jude alone speaks of? Who of them was cognisant of its taking place? And how ignorant too man may be of what has happened on earth in bygone ages, as this prophecy of Enoch, recovered by God after the lapse of so many years, strikingly testifies. Reading these notices of the past, man should surely feel there is a history known to God and other created beings of which we know little, and there may be a history of the present, some day to be learnt, of which we know nothing. How well then, with these glimpses of what has been before us, to be humble and teachable about the ways of God, instead of proudly judging the omniscient Creator!

THE LORD HAVING HIS PLACE
R. Gray
@Isaiah 6: 1 - 8; @Psalm 132: 1 - 9, 13 - 18; @Luke 24: 36 - 44; @John 20: 19 - 23
My thought, beloved brethren, in reading these Scriptures is to speak, with the Lord's help, about the Lord as being in His place, and what flows out from that. It is evident that God has in mind that the Lord should form the central point of His moral universe, and that everything in it should take character from Him.
God has chosen to work out His thoughts in man. He has passed by angels in taking hold of the seed of Abraham by the hand (@Hebrews 2: 16). As to why, we cannot say. It is God's sovereign right to do as He will. But in His sovereign actions we can only marvel at the display that there has been of Himself in the working out of His thoughts.
Paul says as to the Lord, "that *he* might have the first place in all things" (@Colossians 1: 18). There is no question as to that. But the question is, Does He have the pre-eminence in my heart? Does He have it in my life? Does He have the place that He should have in my household? Does He have it fully in the local assembly? These are all questions that arise at the present time and require to be addressed. The Lord Himself said in @John 12: 32, "and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". What an Object for our affections! The fact is that in the sovereign workings of God He becomes an Object of affection to those who are called. He becomes the
{258}
gathering point, and John's gospel brings out particularly the fact that He is the Centre, and, as we have been taught, things are held in John, not by outward trappings or official arrangements, but on the principle of attraction, and that is how things are to operate at the present time. The church, as we often remind ourselves, is in ruins publicly, but God's purpose is not in ruins, nor are the ways of God in any sense deflected by what has come in through the failure of man. God is still maintaining His thoughts as to Christ and the place that He should have, and your blessing and mine lies in acknowledging that in every detail of our lives.
I read in @Isaiah 6 because it suggests the exercise of one who has to do with the Lord on an individual basis. He says, "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up". He had a distinct impression, typically, of the greatness of Christ, and that He was in the place that is suited to Him: a Person in authority and in a place of moral elevation. Now that was a good beginning. This refers, I believe, to a saint who had some understanding of divine things, though not as Jacob, who had some impression of God in his early days, and his comment was, "How dreadful is this place!" (@Genesis 28: 17). Now Isaiah was intelligently taking account of this Person, who was God, and it raised questions for Isaiah himself. He took account of the Lord, and of the functioning system that was around him. We should remember that the Lord Jesus at the present time in heaven is in glory and there are those who minister to Him; there
{259}
is a functioning system here which is active in the maintenance of divine things.
Isaiah is impressed by the atmosphere of the place and the holiness of the Person: "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory! And the foundations of the thresholds shook", and he says, "Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts". It is important to get a distinct impression of the fact that the Lord is in His rightful place, seated "on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens" (@Hebrews 8: 1). Nothing can assail that, or alter it.
But then, these things are intended to have an effect on each one of us. For example, we may think of Nehemiah, Ezra and Daniel, great men of recovery times. Each of them had an understanding of what God was doing. They were in the good of it, but they also carried a constant sense of the reality of the failure that marked the people and themselves. Daniel says, "whilst I was ... confessing my sin and the sin of my people" (@Daniel 9: 20). Because of what the Lord Jesus has done at Calvary, our sins are forgiven, if we have repented and accepted Him as Saviour in faith. But we must remember that we share in the failure that belongs to the testimony, and we must own our part in that. It would keep us humble, and save us from any sense of superiority, either in regard of other believers in Christendom, or of one another.
{260}
Isaiah says, "I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts". It is not that we should be constantly burdened with a sense of our own inadequacy and failure, but rather that, as we have a sense of the Lord's presence, what would go on with us would be a refining process. We would see, more and more, what was involved in the holiness of His presence and what is required of us in the way of self-judgment, and rejection of what is worthless and evil. We are surrounded by worldly influences that would appeal to the flesh in us, and we need to be renewed in a sense of the divine presence and what that presence requires, the holiness that marks it.
What we find, as soon as Isaiah was conscious of the need of cleansing, is a system of help: "And one of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar". It is remarkable that it was "a glowing coal". The present sense of God's judgment of sin was brought to bear on Isaiah and yet he was not destroyed or injured by it. We should remember that Christ bore the penalty; He bore our sins, and He was made sin. The severity of divine judgment was borne by Him and not by us. What marvellous grace! Constant self-judgment is not intended to make us depressed, but rather that we have some impression of the greatness of what has been done for us, and that we may have compassion on one another as we take account of shortcomings that may
{261}
appear.
"One of the seraphim ... said, Behold, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated". Well, what is to be the outcome? The point is, I believe, that the person is going to be serviceable. There is nothing the enemy likes more than to render persons unserviceable in the testimony. But here is one who has come into liberty: "I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send?" The Lord requires that persons should be useable, and never more so than today, when every single one is needed to fill out his useful part in the testimony. "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Is not that a high standard? Are we conscious as we seek to carry out any little service that we are doing it for Him? "Who will go for us?". We are to go in the sense of representing the Person who sends us. "He said, Go". Well, Isaiah became useable, as indeed the prophecy shows.
In @Psalm 132 we have again a suggestion of the Lord in His place: "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength". This was the exercise of one who desired that the Lord should have His place. It is apparent that the writer is increasing in his apprehension, typically, of who Christ is. He says, "Until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob". "We heard of it", he says, and then, "we found it". Well, that raises an important question: Have we heard of it? I suppose that might imply hearing something through ministry, and then the question
{262}
would be, What have we found? We have the truth of Scripture, we have the ministry, but what do you have that is substantial in your own soul? You might say that you have found the Lord. Well, it is good to know the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour. If I have found the Lord, I should also find what interests Him, and what fills His heart.
"We found it in the fields of the wood". The psalmist's understanding of what is involved expands immediately, and he says, "Let us go into his habitations". He has not only found the ark, great and wonderful as that was, but he has an impression in his spirit of God's thoughts as to the ark in its place, and that God would make His dwelling there. "Let us go into his habitations, let us worship at his footstool. Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength".
Then the psalmist says, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy". That would go along with Christ having His rightful place -- priests clothed with righteousness, a necessary part of the functioning of the divine system. From the divine side, God provides everything that is needed in His wisdom and in His grace, yet He looks for us to fulfil responsibility in the testimony. We have received the gift of the Holy Spirit to help us, and we have the Lord Jesus on high as our Head, and God is looking for such persons to maintain what is due to Him, to represent Him rightly down here. It says in the Old Testament, "to this man will I look" (@Isaiah 66: 2). God says, I will
{263}
look to this man who has certain characteristics. The Lord says in the New Testament, "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward" (@Luke 12: 42), and He goes on to say, "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus" -- the one who ministers a "measure of corn in season". Well, it is open to us to be faithful and prudent. That is one of the earliest lessons we have to learn in our christian pathway.
As Christ personally, and God's thoughts as to Him, have their rightful place with us, then we would be led on to further truths: "Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling". And the divine answer is, "This is my rest forever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it". Oh! you say, Is this what I have found? The place that God has chosen, his assembly, is a place where He is going to dwell, the place that He has desired. What a privilege it is to have to do with these things, and our knowledge and understanding of them flows from giving Christ His rightful place.
"I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy ones with bread". This was more than the psalmist had asked for, but God says, as it were, I know what is needed for the maintenance of these exercises that the saints have to carry; "I will satisfy her needy ones". How rich and wealthy a provision is this, so abundantly and fully supplied by God! Are there needy ones? As long as we are here there will be needy ones like ourselves. And, through God's rich mercy and grace, not only
{264}
are our needs met, but something is added: "I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy". Salvation, I believe, would suggest a full result.
It has been suggested that every exercise that God lays upon the saints is not fully completed until God has glory from it. It is not sufficient to work out some kind of arrangement; the matter is not complete until God has something from it that He did not have before. Is the enemy going to have the victory every time? Is he going to succeed in spoiling what is for God? No! God will triumph. God will have an answer that suits His own heart and God will have fruit from the exercises which the saints pass through. My earnest desire is that in the working out of these exercises we might be kept, and that none might be damaged, if it be His will. "Her saints shall shout aloud for joy".
In @Luke 24 we have, in the Lord's coming into their midst, the thought, it has been suggested, of a local assembly. Of course, we know that the Holy Spirit had not yet come, but at least the thought is there: "their midst". And He says to them, "Peace be unto you". When He comes in, He brings peace with Him. He has made peace at a cost to Himself beyond our calculation, and He would bring in the sense of that. Well, the disciples were confounded, but the Lord is very gracious. He says, "Why are ye troubled?" -- a word of priestly sympathy -- "behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself". He would remind them of what He had done for them. There is
{265}
immense comfort in the fact that the blessed, glorious Man who is in heaven is the Man of the gospels. "Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having". What grace, that He would allow those anxious persons around Him to touch Him, to reassure them that He was who He said He was! How wonderfully the Lord works with us at times, in detailed and gracious ways, to reassure us that all is well, that He is with the testimony, He is with the saints, He is looking after things.
The Lord continues, "Have ye anything here to eat?". The fact that He asked for something from them is confirmation to my heart that He values what He finds in local assemblies. "And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb; and he took it and ate before them". How reassuring and comforting that must have been to their hearts, that what they had for Him and gave to Him was acceptable.
In @John 20 it says, "Jesus came and stood in the midst". That suggests that He would lift up their minds and hearts into a sphere of things which was truly His, and again He says, "Peace be to you". The doors were shut "through fear of the Jews", hostile elements. Brethren, there will be hostile elements until the assembly goes to be with Christ. We might as well make up our minds for that, and we need to arm ourselves, as helped by the Holy Spirit, with what God has given us in Scripture and in ministry, so that we might be prepared to meet what the
{266}
enemy would do. He is a subtle and corrupting foe, and he would spoil the work of God, and response to God, if he possibly could.
Well, the doors were shut, and "Jesus came and stood in the midst and says to them, Peace be to you". Then it says, "he shewed to them his hands and his side". That went further than His saying, "Handle me and see". He showed them His hands, those hands that served them; and He showed them His side, which suggests the purpose of God, and I believe we get a touch of that at the Supper and what flows out of it. We find that what God has purposed -- wondrous, eternal blessings -- coalesce with what God is doing with each one of us in our day-today difficulties and exercises. We get some impression that God's purpose is being worked out through His ways, and that it will be brought to a perfect conclusion.
So the Lord says again, "Peace be to you" -- He would confirm it to them. What kind of peace was that? A fragile peace that could be broken in upon by the next difficulty? No! this is heavenly peace, and He says, "Peace be to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you". You see, the end in view is that persons should become useful vessels in the testimony, not bound up by the enemy's work, but set free. "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit", no doubt having in mind that they should maintain the character of the dispensation: "whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they
{267}
are retained". Remission comes first. May the Lord bless the word.

THE GARDEN OF GOD
J. Taylor
@Genesis 3: 8 - 10; @Song of Songs 4: 12 - 16; @Song of Songs 5: 1
It has often occurred to me that whatever God introduces in the way of testimony, He never relinquishes; although it may disappear for a time, it comes to view in the end. He has His own way of recovering it. Generally it is, that the thing is introduced in a material way, and as such it disappears; and then it is restored in a spiritual way. I say that, so that we may have before us that if we are recovered for God, we are recovered in a spiritual way. We are not recovered to be re-established on earth in a material way; we are recovered to have part in what is spiritual.
A Christian may be blessed in temporal things, or he may not be; that is entirely a matter of God's governmental dealings, but there is no doubt as regards his being blessed spiritually. If God has been pleased to work in our souls, it is that we might be blessed spiritually, and there is no uncertainty about that. The blessing which God has in store for us is, one may say, illimitable. He takes us up for the very greatest things. That is what is peculiar to this present dispensation. There will be a gospel after this present dispensation, but it will not be
{268}
characterised as the gospel of the glory (@1 Timothy 1: 11).
The "everlasting gospel" (@Revelation 14: 6, Authorised Version), and the "gospel of the kingdom" (@Matthew 9: 35, Authorised Version), are spoken of, but the gospel of the glory is the present gospel; it includes all the others, for no saint, whether in the past or future, will have anything in the way of spiritual blessing that God does not propose for us now. Of Christians it is written, "blessed us with *every* spiritual blessing" (@Ephesians 1: 3). That was a letter written to believers in Christ in the city of Ephesus; and it was said of them that God had blessed them with every spiritual blessing. Where? On earth? No; material blessings belong to the earth; there are those who will be blessed with material blessings in a future day on earth. Christians are blessed, not with those, but with spiritual blessings *in the heavenlies*. Now, that is part of the gospel. So that, if God has begun to work in you, He has in view that you should have part in what is spiritual; and that you should have part in that, not on the earth, but in heaven. That is the full height of the glad tidings.
So that, as I was saying, recovery is in a spiritual way; and if God reverts to the idea of a garden, it is in a spiritual sense. Now you can all understand what a garden is. If there is anything that marks Scripture, it is the simplicity of its similes. Everybody, from a child up, may form some idea of a garden: it is a distinct part set aside by the farmer, or the landed proprietor, for his special use. Now God
{269}
was pleased to introduce that idea. God has rights over all men. We must not limit the rights of God to believers; the Lord Jesus Christ has established His indisputable right to all, even though a man be an infidel. Do not forget that. He may not have put His mark on you yet; He would never claim you as His special property as an unbeliever; but He has a right to claim you. It is one thing to have a right, and it is another thing to assert it.
Now the believer has a mark put upon him. It is very important to determine whether you have that mark or seal. The gift of the Holy Spirit is referred to in three distinct ways by the apostle Paul in @2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22; he says, God "has anointed us"; that is to say, oil is poured on your head; you are distinguished; an anointed man is a distinguished man. The believer gets the Holy Spirit from Christ, and the possession of the Spirit distinguishes him from all others who have not the Spirit; he is anointed. Anointing is not an internal thing; it is an *external* thing; it is on the head.
Now, the next thing is that God "has sealed us". He has sealed believers. He marks them off as His own; it is for us to determine whether it is so. You remember how Paul raised the question with the Ephesian saints. There were twelve believers there. He says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" (@Acts 19: 2). It was for them to answer. It is a very pertinent question. You are a believer; or you are a professed believer. Where is the seal? God's thought is that you should be sealed
{270}
as one who is redeemed. It is a wonderful thought that God would put a distinct stamp upon you, and that stamp is the testimony that you are His. He has bought you; you are His. What is the price? The blood of Jesus. That is current money, speaking reverently; that is, the currency of the sanctuary. You are purchased by the blood of God's own Son; you belong, in that sense, to God, and you have the seal; but, as I said, it is for you to answer to that.
Then the next thing in regard to the Spirit is, that He is given as "the earnest ... in our hearts". That is not the external mark; that is something for *our hearts*. Do you not need something in your heart? The Spirit in us is the earnest of coming good things; things which "eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him" (@1 Corinthians 2: 9). Thus you have means spiritually. There are many people who have nothing to live on; and they turn to the world. What is the earnest for? That is something to live on. Is it not a handsome income? The Spirit is life, says the apostle writing to the Romans. 'Oh well', you say, 'I want to see a bit of life'. You want to taste a little of the world; you want to prove it for yourself. Ah! but you will not see *life*. You will see death there; "the dead are there" (@Proverbs 9: 18).
Well now, recovery is on this principle; and if God returns to the idea of a garden, He recovers it in a spiritual way. You may ask, 'What is the garden?' Your heart is the garden; that is the garden that God
{271}
is looking for now. I will come to that presently. He had a garden in Eden; planted eastward in Eden. He made it in every way suited for the satisfaction of the man; it offered every possible means of satisfaction for man; it was a place of delights. But then it was not only to be for *man*. *God* was to have something to say in it. I have thought of the river that flowed into it. You remember that a river rose in Eden; the river did not have its rise in the garden; it rose in Eden, and it flowed into the garden (@Genesis 2: 10). Now what that signifies is that God intended to influence the garden; a river is a source of influence; it flowed into the garden as *one* river, or stream, and it flowed out as *four*. Thus God indicated that the antitype, the gift of the Holy Spirit from heaven flowing into the hearts of believers, should be universal in its influence. Four is a symbol of what is universal.
As to the river in Eden, God intended to have a hold on the garden; He was to influence it; His river flowed into it, and flowed out of it; and, moreover, as the verse I read stated, God came into it Himself. Now I want you to dwell on that. The general idea is that God would have a special place for man, and He would influence the place for good. Think of the continuous stream flowing into it, influencing it with its refreshing power. Everything in the garden would benefit by that river; and then God Himself came into the garden. What I want to show you is this, that He found no response to Himself in it. The trees ministered nothing to God. Adam was so constituted
{272}
that they could minister to *him*; but they could minister nothing to God. God is a Spirit, and material things do not minister to Him; they are all to disappear. But there was something that God had placed in Adam that was not material; something that could respond to Him.
There is something in you, and in me, and in every one, that is not material; there is something that is in its nature spiritual. God had breathed into Adam; that was not material; He had breathed into him His own breath. You remember how Solomon tells us later that the spirit returns to God who gave it. The question is not raised as to what God may do with it; but the wicked are limited to the lake of punishment. The spirit returns to God who gave it, and the body to dust. But God had breathed into Adam, and it was the answer to this that God sought in Adam, but He did not find it; Adam had become corrupted. Man has become corrupted in his spirit, his soul, and his body. The spirit, that which was nearest to God, became corrupted. It is a terrible thing to think of it; and when it became corrupted, and the link cut between God and man, the whole being is lost. Adam said "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared".
Adam and Eve heard the voice of God, but their spirits had become corrupted. Is it so with you? Have you any appreciation of Christ, or of the things of Christ? If you have not, your spirit is corrupted. It is so with every unconverted man: he is corrupted in that part of him which is nearest to God, and thus the
{273}
whole man is lost to God. We think very little about what it was to God to come into the garden in which He had placed Adam, and to find no response. The voice heard indicated God's authority in the garden. He was stepping into His own garden. God never gave up the idea of a garden. He has it now in those who love Him. I need not dwell here on Adam's sin. You are all acquainted with the history of the fall, as we speak of it. All I wish to dwell upon is, that God reserves His right to come into the garden looking for response, and He found none.
Now, when you come to Solomon's Song, you find the simile of the garden again. It refers to the last days, as no doubt many of you here know; and the Song is a celebration of Christ's victory over His earthly people, His triumph over their affections in the future. In the course of the interchange of expression in the book, we arrive at the garden. Now I want you to consider this garden. I believe that most of you here are professed believers. You have heard the gospel, and most of you have professed to have accepted it. Now let me ask, What are you in the Lord's eye? He speaks of His spouse as His sister; a remarkable way to speak of her. A man's spouse is not usually his sister, but in this connection it must be so. You get the principle of it in Abraham, in Isaac, and in Jacob.
The speaker in the Song of Solomon says, "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed". There is no invitation in verse 12, but when you come to verse 16 there is an
{274}
invitation to the Beloved, "Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat its precious fruits". The Lord has reached His end; there is a garden now into which He can come on invitation. The Lord loves that. He has a right to the garden, but He loves an invitation to it. Now where is your heart? Where are your affections, dear young believer? Are you a garden enclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed? No one can go into a barred garden; nor is a spring shut up or a fountain sealed available to others. You have the water, and the fruits; you have the principles of these things in you, but who gets the benefit of them?
I have been raising the question as to whether you *have* the Holy Spirit. If you have the Holy Spirit as a believer, you have all these things in principle; but are you shut up? Now the Lord proceeds to say, "Thy shoots are a paradise of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants; spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices". How He honours you! He speaks well of you. Your neighbour could scarcely speak to you like that if the garden is barred up; He would say, perhaps, that you were selfish. The Lord honours you. He tells you how much you have that pleases Him. "Pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants; spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices". Everything that is delightful is there, but see
{275}
to it, beloved friends, that after you have the Holy Spirit, that the Spirit is not grieved. As possessing the Spirit you have all these things *in principle*; you have all that God delights in; all that Christ delights in He encourages your heart by telling you that you have them. I am saying that for the encouragement of the Lord's people, and for all, for everyone here present.
Well now, if it is shut up, or barred, if the fountain is sealed, what will the Lord do? Be on the watch; there is the "north wind"; and the north wind is the piercing wind. It says, "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden". Look out; the north wind is coming. Do you think that the Lord Jesus, having put all that there, is going to allow it to remain stagnant? Oh! no. He knows what He has put there. If there is anything I cherish it is that the Lord knows all about me; if He has put anything in my heart, He knows where He has put it, and He knows how to value it. Peter recognised that; he said, "thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee" (@John 21: 17). The Lord indicates that here; but He will not reserve all that enjoyment to Himself; He wants others to share it. You may say, 'The Lord knows what is in my heart'. Does He? Well, if He does, He will see to it that others shall know what is there also. Do not call upon the Lord too quickly in that way.
If you say the Lord knows there is something in your heart, the Lord may bring the winds upon you that others may know it as well. He has put it there
{276}
for that purpose. Everybody knew afterwards that Peter loved Jesus. But though Jesus knew it already He would have it made manifest to others; and before Peter passed out of the world, others knew he loved Jesus. The Lord passed him through the discipline; He caused the north wind to blow that others should know it.
One of the most common expressions amongst Christians is, 'The Lord knows all about me'. Well, if He has placed something within you for Himself, He would have others know it also. The word is, "Awake, north wind, and come thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow forth". The *spices*; not the flesh, the back-biting, the sarcasm -- no, the *spices*. The north wind does not bring out the flesh; the north wind brings out what God has put there, the spices; that is, love, sympathy, consideration for others, care for others; these are the spices that the Lord will bring out. How often one has seen in the discipline of Christians that the north wind, the wind of affliction, blows, and the hardened spirit becomes soft, and there comes respect for God, and the things of God, and respect for His people, appreciation of their sympathy, and response to it.
Now, when all that has taken place there is an *invitation*. You are prepared for the Lord to come into His garden. The invitation is to the Beloved. The One who has brought the north wind into activity is your friend. "Let my beloved come into his garden", she says, "and eat its precious fruits".
{277}
Do you say, How does that work out practically? Well, you have a place in your heart for the saints. If you do not want the *Lord's* people, you do not want the Lord. We were saying a few nights ago that Simon the Pharisee invited the Lord, but he did not invite His disciples. If you want the Lord in your garden, you will want His disciples in your garden; they are bound up with Him, that is the principle. And the next thing you get in chapter 5: 1, is that the Lord can invite His friends. He says, "Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, beloved ones!" The Lord can invite now.
Speaking in a general way, the garden really has reference to the saints. The Lord has a special spot here upon earth that He cherishes, and He desires to have a place in it. I would ask each of you before the Lord to look to it, as to whether your heart is open for the Lord, as to whether you have a place in it for Him, and for His people. If you have, you are answering to God's garden in the spiritual way. You are the Lord's property, and you give Him an opportunity, as it were, to invite others.
May the Lord help us in the apprehension of these things.

GENUINENESS
P. H. Hardwick
@Proverbs 25: 1 - 40; @Revelation 3: 7 - 11; @Revelation 10: 9 - 11; @Revelation 11: 1, 2; @Ezekiel 44: 15 - 18
It is in mind, as the Lord helps, to say a word about what is genuine as over against what is merely profession. Scripture helps us in considering this. Timothy, for instance, is spoken of as one who would care with genuine feeling how the saints get on (@Philippians 2: 20). Paul could trust him; and it is to Timothy that Paul speaks of laying hold of what is really life (@1 Timothy 6: 19). At that time the saints, according to Paul's ministry to Timothy, were being warned about what was false and apostate coming in. It is still more so today, so the injunction to Timothy is the more for our heeding at this time, that we might lay hold of what is really life.
Then we read elsewhere that love is to be unfeigned (@Romans 12: 9), or without dissimulation. We have hardly any need to say that in the world love is practically unknown according to what it really is as springing from God; but the saints know it, for they have the love of God poured out into their hearts by the Holy Spirit, so that there is liberty and ability, especially in the christian circle, for love to be expressed in its unfeigned purity.
I might mention, too, in thinking of what we are in our assembly setting, that the Lord hates indifference. I would seek your grace as I utter a word of warning, I believe I may say on the Lord's behalf, in regard to indifference. The Lord says to
{279}
the church in Laodicea, "because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spue thee out of my mouth" (@Revelation 3: 16). It is a figure of what is most obnoxious, for the Lord would have us take on His own feelings of hatred for what is neither cold nor hot but completely indifferent, indifferent to the best and brightest days of the truth. Therefore I believe we can see the need for genuineness, dear brethren; it will prove itself if it is there, for a person who is going on with God and with the truth will make his own way, and will be seen to be approved of God, known of God. It says, "if any one love God, *he* is known of him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 3). God has many things for those that love Him, but this is, perhaps, the sweetest of all, that God *knows* him. That is, He definitely establishes a link with such a person, and writes him in the books of heaven. The youngest of us may be in this book; we are in it as loving God; therefore let us love God.
This brings me to my scriptures, which I would use to bear upon reliability in our *persons*, in our regard for *ministry of the truth*, and in the *service of God*. @Proverbs 25 is a remarkable chapter which brings in a new setting. There are several in this wonderful book; the first section goes over about nine chapters, the second section begins with chapter 10, and the third section begins here, presented to us as being the "proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed". That is to say, they came to light in a day of recovery. Hezekiah's day presented a most remarkable
{280}
recovery, but there was opposition too. Sennacherib came up with all his scorn against Jerusalem (@2 Kings 18, 19). The enemy is coming up now with all his scorn especially in regard of the assembly. He has his ways of doing it: some are open, some apparently insignificant, but they are insinuating ways of darkness and hostility, all directed against the assembly. What Sennacherib could not take account of was that in that day God was recovering His people, just as He is doing in our day. We have been lost and are becoming recovered to the full light of the truth; and in transcribing these proverbs we are to understand, I believe, that we are coming into the very best things which the Son has caused to be written. Solomon says, "I was a son unto my father" (@Proverbs 4: 3). They are worth holding to, dear brethren, whether they are the high things, "the heavens for height", or the deep things, "the earth for depth", connected with the death of Christ. He descended into the lower parts of the earth, and then it says, He "ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things" (@Ephesians 4: 10).
How great are those depths and heights! These are amongst the things which come into mind in the day of recovery. God is bringing them into mind in connection with His Son. He does not blazon everything abroad; He conceals matters. Mystery is written over Christianity, and, we might say, over the Christian, or so it should be. A Christian is not understood; there is mystery attached to the public life and movements of one who is really Christ's.
{281}
This springs from God, for God conceals things.
If I speak to anyone here who is finding his life in the world, I may say, quite simply but truly, there is no mystery about you. You may think you hide things, but your life is open, your thoughts and pursuits are open. There is mystery about the believer, just as they said about the manna, "What is it?" (@Exodus 16: 15). That is its name; it was never described in any other way but by that mysterious name, Manna, "What is it?" We never see through the life or Person of Jesus; there was always something mysterious even in His public teaching, something which we can never fathom, and in character it is the same with the believer. God has hidden things for us, and as we search them out He tells us. The Holy Spirit, who is God, searches them for us, for He searches the depths of God. How wonderful it is to be a believer! I trust all here, including the children of the saints, are believers. These meetings are not merely for the grown-up persons; the children sit with their parents and the great desire is that all may be believers, and be found in the company of those who have these marvellous privileges.
One trait of a genuine person in Christianity -- and I speak of Christianity though I have read from Proverbs -- is that he judges himself. That is something which a man in the world never fully does, the reason being he has no power to do it. A believer has power, he has the knowledge of God, and by means of the Spirit he is able to show himself
{282}
a genuine person by judging himself. He takes away "the dross from the silver", and leaves a "vessel for the refiner". I would ask the dear brethren to ponder it. Jacob took away the dross from the silver. Every time God spoke to him, a little further work was done, until at one time God came down and stayed with him and spoke to him in a way of holy friend-ship, and then went up from him (@Genesis 35: 9 - 13). Think of God coming down to a person like any one of us, as with Jacob, and staying awhile, talking, putting impressions into the soul, and then going up. That is worth far more than the best that this world can offer you, education or anything else. Education never leads us to God, nor provides a basis for God to come down and be with a man.
If we come to our own day, how wonderful were Peter's experiences, cleaving to the Lord while owning his sinfulness (@Luke 5). What but a spiritual experience could bring us to such a state of things as that, asking the Lord to go away, and yet cleaving to Him? Likewise Jacob wrestled with the man and said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" (@Genesis 32: 26). The "man" was really God, and this is Jacob speaking to God, not God speaking to Jacob.
These people are people who learned to judge themselves, and as such they come out as vessels for the refiner. It does not mean that all the refining is done; it does not mean that the first touch with Jacob, with Peter or with ourselves completes the work; there is much more to be done. But the vessel is now in the right hands, it is in the hands of the
{283}
Refiner, and He will do the rest gradually. Some of it will be tender service like the "washing of water by the word" (@Ephesians 5: 26); some of it will be drastic like "a refiner's fire and like fuller's lye" (@Malachi 3: 2), which has a sting about it, but we are such that we need this. God is not concerned with disciplining persons in whom He has nothing; He leaves them. He says, "I hated Esau" (@Malachi 1: 3) -- a very solemn word.
A genuine person in the Revelation, as we have read, is referred to under the title of the Jew. The term Jew here does not mean the Jew nationally, it refers to the genuine person (@Romans 2: 29 refers to the person in this way). There are those according to @Revelation 3 who say they are Jews and are not; they lie; so we are not thinking about Jews nationally, but we are thinking about genuine persons in our day. In Esther's day the Jew was the genuine person coming under the preserving hand of God, Mordecai and Esther being helped together practically to provide a way of escape, life and preservation for the Jew.
In this passage in Revelation the Lord Jesus is addressing a company in Philadelphia -- meaning 'brotherly love' -- and He is saying that He really has not anything against them: on the contrary He is encouraging them. It is remarkable that in the two addresses to companies in whom He has nothing to find fault with, He warns them about the synagogue of Satan. I refer to Smyrna in @Revelation 2: 9: "I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich; and the railing of those who say that they
{284}
themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan". Then in the passage we read in chapter 3: "I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie ..." That is to say, the religious persecution under the title of synagogue -- and no doubt bringing in many terms and names common to Christianity, but being altogether hostile -- is very near; it is really at the door. So we are to warn one another that where there is genuineness it is sure to be attacked.
I understand that there are seven so-called sections of Christianity in these lands where the names, Father, Son and Holy Spirit are named, but the deity of Christ is not only disregarded but refused, and the atonement of the blood of Jesus is also refused. What is that but evidence of the synagogue of Satan standing right over against genuine persons whom the Lord here salutes as Jews -- Jews "inwardly", circumcised in heart and spirit, real believers. That the Lord should say this to two companies against whom He has nothing outwardly is very remarkable, and is to enter into our education lest we should get lulled into a kind of sleep.

MINISTERING COMFORT TO ONE ANOTHER
J. H. Trevvett
@Isaiah 40: 1, 2; @2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4
We have already had before us today the thought of service, and it is on my heart to speak of a service which lies open to every believer. You will have gathered doubtless from the scriptures I have read that the word "comfort" is in my mind. Every one of us must feel the increasing need amongst God's people for a ministry which brings in comfort, a ministry which will establish and which will comfort their hearts. Indeed, one of the earliest desires of the apostle Paul in writing to the Thessalonian believers was that they might "encourage one another, and build up each one the other, even as also ye do" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 11).
This need for comfort found early expression amongst the people of God. It will, I believe, find greater expression as the days become darker and increasingly difficult. It is said of Lemech that at the birth of Noah he said, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands" (@Genesis 5: 29). The saints in that early day, feeling the pressure of what was around, the curse being heavy upon the earth, looked on in the fervent longings of their souls to the coming of One who should bring in rest and comfort. Need I remind you of the time in which Noah lived -- this early comforter of the saints -- how he moved and how he built in times and under conditions similar to our
{286}
own? In his day there were abnormal men; it is said, "In those days were the giants on the earth" (@Genesis 6: 4). A giant spirit, alas! is abroad today in the earth; there is hero-worship on every hand, and men of renown. People of the world speak of their great ones, whether politically, or socially, or religiously. They are not ashamed to use superlative language in the description of earth's great ones or their activities. The unholy climax of all those activities, the apex of man's greatness as on that plane will be, as we know, the man of sin.
What are we to do in the presence of all that speaks of this giant spirit abroad? save that we should reserve our superlative language for Christ, the One who was marked, as it is said, by the mind to go down (@Philippians 2: 5 - 11). Let us refuse in this day of man's greatness to employ any such language in the description of such men. Let us be like the one spoken of in the Canticles who, when challenged as to her lover, describes him in befitting language; she is concerned to speak, as one may say, in the superlative degree. She says, "His head is as the finest gold ... his mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely" (@Song of Songs 5: 11 - 16).
So Noah, this early comforter of the saints, is marked by one outstanding feature that he *walked with God*. "This", it is said, "is the history of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God" (@Genesis 6: 9). He was not obsessed with what was around; he was not deterred from pursuing a path of righteousness
{287}
because of the influx of man's greatness, but he was perfect. He stands forth distinctively perfect in his generations; and it is said, "Noah walked with God".
I wish to emphasise at this time that the measure in which we comfort one another in these last days is the measure in which we are each prepared to walk with God, for behind this ministry of comfort there lies a wealth of experience with divine Persons, as walking in secret with God. Noah, thank God, was not the only comforter of the old dispensation; there were many of them, and they were concerned to speak to the heart of others. It is said in @Isaiah 40, "Speak to the heart of Jerusalem" (verse 2). May I plead for that in relation to our intercourse one with another, in relation to any service with which the Lord in His goodness may entrust us? Do we make an appeal to the heart? Do we speak to the hearts of God's people? Do we appeal to that which is the seat, so to speak, of every emotion, or are we content to address the minds by imparting information about divine things or divine Persons? I make bold to say that if we are concerned to appeal to the hearts of God's people, there will be response; if we merely appeal to the minds there will be no response.
I pass on to Joseph, who was another great comforter. It is said of him that when suspicion came into the hearts of his brethren when they doubted him after Jacob their father's death, he "comforted them, and spoke consolingly to them" (@Genesis 50: 21); he spoke words of kindness to them. He would disarm them as to the path that lay before
{288}
them; he would pour into their hearts a precious ministry of comfort so that they might know how to confide in him, and to go forward with every suspicion eliminated from their minds and hearts.
I refer also to Hezekiah in relation to this ministry of comfort. It is said of him in that day of wondrous recovery, that he "spoke consolingly to all the Levites" (@2 Chronicles 30: 22). Have we had such on our hearts, those engaged in Levitical service? Have we been preoccupied in our service, or have we been so obsessed with our own service that we have forgotten them? I well remember one of the earliest longings that I had in regard of divine service. It was that one might have part in that very privileged service by constantly praying for those who serve.
I commend that to you, dear young brother or sister. I believe promotion lies on that line, the line of being enabled to speak comfortably, consolingly to those who serve the saints, a service that is greatly needed amongst us, and a service that is to be coveted by us. Who knows what lies behind all the precious ministry, all the activities, and all the exercises that are gone through by those who serve? Shall we be, as it were, the beneficiaries at their hands, receiving of their spiritual wealth, and never be concerned about speaking words of comfort and words of encouragement to them?
*Barnet, June 1929 [1 of 2]*.
{289}
MINISTERING COMFORT TO ONE ANOTHER
J. H. Trevvett
@Isaiah 40: 1, 2; @2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4
When the children of Israel held the feast of unleavened bread seven days, it says that Hezekiah spoke consolingly to the Levites and such was the joy and greatness of that feast that they decided to hold another feast for another period of seven days (@2 Chronicles 30: 23). Then when Hezekiah, this great comforter of the Levites, recognised what joy there was in Israel, we are told that he gave a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep. He was not too great, though he was a king, to think of the Levites who served in relation to the heart of God. It is said in @2 Chronicles 32: 6 that he also spoke consolingly to the captains of war. He is concerned now, having secured the praise and the service of God, as to the conflict, as to this impious enemy who would come within the gates; and it is said he assembled the captains of war to him at the gate of the city and spoke consolingly to them. Have we had such in our minds? Have we wept with them? Have we sorrowed with those who have been concerned as to the maintenance of what is due to God, those who have had, as it were, the first hand in the conflict? Have we been near them in spirit? Have we prayed for them?
I remember an aged sister saying that one of her most privileged sights was to walk into a room where the beloved brother F. E. R. was, and to see
{290}
him weeping tears, priestly tears -- the God-given outlet, in times of conflict for the truth. Such tears are put into God's bottle. Are we concerned as to this, that we support and speak consolingly to those who serve in the conflict? It is said the result of those words of consolation was that the people de-pended upon the words of Hezekiah the king (verse 8).
Following upon that, for I want you to see what a ministry of comfort may bring in among us in the last days, it is said that Isaiah the prophet and Hezekiah the king joined in prayer (verse 20). What a sight for God to see the prophet and the king praying together and crying to heaven in priestly intercession in relation to the people of God -- the people to whom Isaiah was instructed to say, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak to the heart of Jerusalem" (@Isaiah 40: 1). What is this ministry of comfort that Isaiah the prophet would bring in? It is the introduction of the true Noah, the One upon whom Israel will lean, the One for whom the earth and the heavens wait during the time of the groaning creation, the advent of the true Noah who shall bring in rest, repose and comfort. "Every valley shall be raised up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ... And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed" (@Isaiah 40: 4, 5). What will mark that day, thank God, will be the feature that will delight the heart of every lover of Jesus that "Jehovah alone shall be exalted" (@Isaiah 2: 11).
I desire now to refer to the way this ministry of comfort has come down to us in our day. I need not
{291}
remind you of the way in which the Lord Jesus came in as in the synagogue at Nazareth (@Luke 4: 16 - 22). He reads, and as He reads He would leave the impression upon all that He had come in at a suited moment with a ministry of comfort. He said He had come to heal the broken-hearted. Is there not need for such a word today? Is there not room amongst men, amongst the saints of God for these words -- the gospel preached to the poor, the broken-hearted healed, the captives set at liberty? And as He moves here and there He is concerned as to bringing rest and comfort into the hearts of those to whom He draws near. He would have us restful. "Learn from me", He says, "for I am meek and lowly in heart" (@Matthew 11: 29). That is the kind of Person who is able to administer comfort, who is able to bring in in times of pressure, sorrow, and tribulation, just the word of comfort that is needed.
One loves to think of Paul, that great comforter of the saints, standing in relation to the whole assembly. He is concerned that the saints should be comforted. Pardon the repetition of the word, but I feel how essential this feature is in the closing days. We have abundant light; we have among us, as few other Christians have, the most treasured things; we are privileged to hear the most profound and blessed truths, but are we to be content to hear and never to pass on to others who compose part of Christ's assembly that which we have received? Paul himself stands in relation to all men. He had the desire to present every man perfect in Christ. What bowels of
{292}
compassion he had! just like his Master. He passes on, having the care of all the churches, daily concerned that the saints might be greatly comforted. He himself had in that early day of his conversion recognised comfort in a most marvellous way, and when he is subdued, he, who had once been the destroyer of God's people, so ministers comfort that we read, "The assemblies then through-out the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 9: 31). From that point his concern is, as it were, deepened. He had persecuted the church of God, he had been the destroyer of the saints, now he would fill up the time that was left -- every moment of it, for it was night and day work with Paul -- in a holy endeavour to comfort the saints.
So, too, the Thessalonians in their early freshness needed the constant attention of a nursing father and a nursing mother, and he would send Timotheus to them (@1 Thessalonians 3: 2). The very presence of Timotheus in a local gathering would ensure comfort for the saints. They had no room for him at Corinth. Paul says, "Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear" (@1 Corinthians 16: 10), indicating that the tendency at Corinth would be to quench what had been divinely entrusted to Timothy.
But at Thessalonica he is entrusted with the work, and Paul says he left him there in order that the saints might be comforted. Then it is said that he
{293}
also hoped to send Timotheus to the Philippian saints. It is not now a question of early freshness; it is not now a juvenile company, but a company of believers well on the way to maturity -- Philippian saints. Do we ever get beyond the need of comfort? And what kind of vessel, what kind of keeper of the sheep is this to whom Paul would entrust the work of comforting those Philippian believers? He says, "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on" (@Philippians 2: 20). Oh! for more genuine feeling as to how the saints get on, not as to how much they may know, but a genuine concern for their soul-health.
Then this great comforter Paul is equally concerned about the Ephesians. He has in reserve Tychicus and he would send him in order that he might comfort their hearts, that the Ephesians might be acquainted with all that was happening to Paul, and that their own hearts might be greatly comforted (@Ephesians 6: 21, 22). Likewise as to Colosse, Paul is concerned to know the state of the saints there, and he purposed to send Tychicus in order that he might know their state, and that he might comfort their hearts (@Colossians 4: 8, 9). It is not now the great apostle himself coming; it is not an official movement; it is Paul representatively; he sends this representative -- Tychicus. He is to pass into that local gathering, and find out their state and also to comfort their hearts.
One of the last acts of Paul, in relation to his line of service in comforting others, stood in relation to the comfort of those who were gathered around on
{294}
that island after the shipwreck. That is one of the last recorded acts of this devoted servant of Christ. It is said that Paul himself gathered sticks. I know we have often read it, and that we are acquainted with the scripture, but I make an appeal to every heart to reflect for one moment on the down-stooping of Christ that marked the beloved apostle, and the grace reflected in him, that he had seen in Christ. He himself is greatly concerned about the comfort of those who stood round during the time of the cold and "the rain that was falling", and it is said he gathered sticks (@Acts 28: 1 - 6). His objective was a fire that would comfort and warm the saints, and he knew that every effort of the enemy to frustrate it would find its full and final answer in the very fire that he himself would provide to warm the saints. He shakes off a viper, for the viper would destroy this minister of comfort among the saints. It is not said he killed it, but he shook it off into the fire.
I refer now to John, for the thought of comfort links up with John's ministry. He treats of the divine nature, and shows that we have wealth and power to deal with every difficulty, every problem that can arise in these difficult days. Jude speaks of certain men having crept in unawares; John says, "They went out from among us, but they were not of us" (@1 John 2: 19); they went out. The exposing power of John's ministry is such that evil cannot dwell where love is. The viper that would destroy those affections, that would militate against the warmth and comfort of the saints, can never exist in the
{295}
presence of divine love amongst the saints. We have in John's ministry the most precious bulwark against all the unholy inroads of anti-christian men today as they move about in this earth, and if John himself is confined to Patmos he moves out in an endeavour to comfort the saints, and says, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" (@Revelation 1: 9). If he himself is restricted as to his movements, he refers to one whose movements are unrestricted, for he is like Paul, he leaves behind a keeper of the sheep. Paul leaves a Timothy to keep the sheep, to protect them on church lines and to comfort them in relation to the assembly and the affections proper to it. John, too, is concerned about his keeper, and in that connection he refers in the most touching way to Gaius (3 John).
Gaius is found as one who has a house, and a house that is a home. What marks him, having the spirit of John, is that he is greatly concerned, not so much how the brethren come into his house, but the manner in which they go out. I commend that to you in all simplicity, that we should have deeper concern about the way in which the saints leave our houses. Are they, as those who have visited the house of Gaius, the better for having been in? Are they comforted? Have they received all this spiritual warmth which is contained in John's ministry? Are they sent forward in a manner worthy of God? John is greatly concerned about the family life of the saints. He would comfort the saints in that relation -- that is, as the family of God. The family of God is
{296}
left down here in a hostile world, and if the world loves its own, let us see to it on our part that we love our own, that in those family affections we should be concerned as to the outgoings of divine love.
One of the earliest, and certainly one of the sweetest impressions that one had of the saints in the path of separation, as first moving amongst them apart from the systems of men, was to go into a meeting where they were singing, 'Whom have we, Lord, but Thee?' (`427:1). I confess that it left upon my spirit an indelible impression. It was no appeal made to the senses, no disorder, but waiting in simple dependence upon the movements of divine Persons.
Another impression of which one would speak was that one had found a company where the Holy Spirit was free. May it be so to the end! Let us be preserved from the intrusions of man's mind, from the mere assertion of things as light, or the mere passing on of information. Let us see to it that we are content to wait upon the Lord Himself for guidance, and that in our deliberations together over the Holy Scriptures, and on every occasion when we are found together, we may leave room for the Holy Spirit. There is that left to us today, the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and one speaks of it with intense joy.
In closing I refer to Peter. Peter's great concern is to comfort the saints in relation to their kingdom sufferings. He leaves to Paul the line of the assembly, the one who was filling up that which was
{297}
behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake -- the line of suffering, which, one feels ashamed to say, we touch so little. Peter's suffering stands in relation to the kingdom. We are to arm ourselves against every unholy intrusion of the flesh, forasmuch as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh. John's sufferings, I believe, stand in relation to the spirits of the believers, as being found still in a hostile and anti-christian system of things, but Peter is concerned about the souls of the saints. He says, "abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul" (@1 Peter 2: 11).
Peter is concerned about soul-health. He would have the saints prospering in their souls, and so he brings in a word of comfort in relation to any who may be suffering, suffering on the line of the kingdom, and his greatest and deepest concern in view of his departure, of his decease, is that the saints might be greatly comforted. Would he leave the sheep without a keeper? Would he pass off without leaving the saints a precious legacy? I believe he leaves the legacy to us in the one whose salutation he speaks of when he says, "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son" (@1 Peter 5: 13).
One has derived comfort from that thought, that in a place like Babylon you have Peter, shortly to put off his tabernacle, as he says, and you have Mark. Ah! we cannot do without the kingdom; we need to be maintained in the exercises relative to it; we need to be maintained in the joy and power of it. Let us
{298}
never assume, God forbid! to rise so high that we forget the line of Peter's ministry relative to the kingdom, and so he speaks of "Marcus my son".
I would refer briefly for a moment to the legacy that Mark has left behind in the ordering of the Lord in his gospel. It has sometimes occurred to me that in Mark's gospel we have portrayed more deeply than in any other, the feelings and sensibilities of Jesus. I believe that Mark was a man of deep feeling and that consequent upon his early failure he would be in direct touch with divine Persons. When he is restored and strengthened, he is spoken of as being profitable for the ministry, and his gospel is a precious legacy handed on to us, a gospel in which the feelings and sensibilities of Jesus are treated of in a most delicate way by divine inspiration through "Marcus my son".
These were the thoughts that were on my heart, suggesting how the line of comfort may be continued by us in a difficult and a dark day, and that one of our greatest concerns may be to "speak to the heart of Jerusalem".
I leave one word with you in closing. "But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope by grace, encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word" (@2 Thessalonians 2: 16, 17).
*Barnet, June 1929. [2 of 2]*
{299}
"UNTIL WE ALL ARRIVE"
M. R. Cook
@Ephesians 4: 8 - 13; @1 Peter 2: 1 - 5; @Ruth 1: 14 - 19; @2 Peter 3: 10 - 13
I desire to draw attention to the fact that "he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day" (@Philippians 1: 6). It is very blessed to contemplate what the saints mean to divine Persons, and that They will attain Their end in us: "until we all arrive ...", as we read in Ephesians. But there is our side in responsibility too.
I believe it has been said that, while our place in the Father's house may be according to divine sovereignty, our place in the kingdom is based on our responsibility. And my desire is, dear brethren, while encouraging on the one side that these things will be attained and that the divine end will be reached, that we seek to be actively engaged in furthering what is for the divine pleasure in our souls.
The Lord's coming is very near, and divine Persons would be urgent that each of us might be found here at His coming in a pathway which is pleasurable to Him, committed to Him and His interests in the place where He has set us, and promoting what is for His pleasure there.
In @Ephesians 4 it says, "He that descended". Let us be affected by the lengths to which divine love has gone, and of the way that the Saviour has been to secure each one of us. Oh! what depths have been plumbed; what sorrow, what pathways sore, the
{300}
Saviour has passed through that He might secure each one of us. Not only has He descended, but He "has also ascended up above all the heavens". What a place He now fills! What blessing has been given to the believer, not only in the forgiveness of sins, but in the gift of the Holy Spirit too, in order that he may be here for the Lord Jesus in the scene where He has been rejected.
Well, the work of God is to go on in our souls, and gifts have been given from the ascended Christ in view of this wondrous work going on to completion. It is an evidence of the love of Christ to the assembly that these gifts have been given. The Lord delights that what is of Himself should be formed in the saints, and He has given one and another a distinct impression of Himself, and the ability to convey it in the power of the Spirit, that others might be attracted to the Lord Jesus and be formed after Him. How wonderful is the variety of gifts the Lord has provided that the divine end may be reached: "for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ". Oh! let us make way for the operations of the Spirit, let us put ourselves in the current of divine speaking, the ministry which the Lord is pleased to give with a view to the perfecting of the saints, that we may become like Jesus.
"With a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ". Is it not a wonderful service to edify, encourage and build up
{301}
the saints? "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God" -- how great He is, that glorious Person. Think of the glory that is His, of all that has been expressed in Him of God, of all that has been secured by Him for God, and we are to arrive at the knowledge of this blessed One. Soon we shall see Him, we shall know as we have been known (@1 Corinthians 13: 12). How wonderful it is to take account of what divine Persons have in mind for every saint that forms part of the assembly, that each one will arrive at this glorious end, "at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". Oh! what language Paul uses: "the full-grown man". Well, it is being worked out now. Are we making way for the Lord and the Spirit to promote this formation in our souls? Every provision has been made from the divine side and the end will be reached, but let us be those who are seeking to promote actively this formation in our souls at the present time.
Well, we have a responsibility to answer to these matters if we are to come into them. Have you tasted that the Lord is good? Have you tasted of divine things? Do you find them attractive? Is there a desire in each of our hearts to go in for divine things? Peter says, "to whom coming". You might say this is initial, so it may be, but I believe that it is something we can be continually doing. May I challenge each one again, myself included: When did you last come to Jesus? When did you come with a real desire for some impression of Himself? The Lord said, "him
{302}
that comes to me I will not at all cast out" (@John 6: 37). He will furnish an impression to a hungry soul that is looking for something of Himself. Oh! dear brother and dear sister, when you go down on your knees ask for an impression of Jesus, seek something of that living food. You might say, 'I am but a babe'. For such there is "the pure mental milk of the word", and there is provision for every stage of growth in divine things; and "solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil" (@Hebrews 5: 14). That is what divine Persons are looking for: full-grown men, those that are taking character from Christ, are feeding on Christ Himself, and are growing in the knowledge of Him. They are "coming" to the One who has been "cast away indeed as worthless by men".
We are passing through a scene, beloved brethren, which has rejected the Saviour. Let us seek, therefore, that He may be really precious to each one of us, and that we are taking character from Him. I do not think it is by chance that this was written by Peter (or 'stone'), who had his name changed according to what was of Christ in him. Is there that which Christ can name in you and in me which is of Himself? Is there that which He can take account of which is of the character of a stone, suitable material for building? The Lord speaks of building: "on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18). Are you, dear brother and dear sister,
{303}
making yourself available to be built into this, or are you holding back? Have you some interest here, some ambition to be fulfilled, before you give yourself fully to divine things? I challenge my own heart and those who are young amongst us. What are our ambitions; what are we set for? When the Lord comes, what will you have that will go through into eternity? What have you of the character of a stone which the Lord will be able to take up and display in the coming day? Oh! let us not hold back, let us not make anything else the centre of our interests other than being here for the Lord Jesus:
<blockquote>'To be for Thee where Thou hast been, <br> Until we reach Thee in that scene, <br> Where Thou wilt own us Thine'. (`180:3) </blockquote>
Is there that in your soul of a permanent character which is growing and is precious to the heart of Christ? It is by coming to Him that what is of Himself is formed in you as you give place to Him. But then you find too there is that which is attractive amongst the company of the saints. Thank God for what He has in the saints. Do you find the company of the saints attractive, or do you, like Orpah, want to go back? Naomi said of Orpah that she "is gone back to her people and to her gods". Is there something which has dominion over us? Surely Christ is to have the first place with us, and the company of those who are precious to Him is to be precious to us too, as seen typically with Ruth who clave to Naomi: "Do not intreat me to leave thee, to
{304}
return from following after thee" (verse 16). Is there a longing in your heart to be in the company of the saints, to be where Jesus is loved, where He is remembered in the breaking of bread? The Lord looks for committed persons, brothers and sisters who remember Him in the breaking of bread, and who want to be in the company of those that love Him. Chimham, whose name means 'Longing', wanted to be with David. He passed over the Jordan and went with David, but Barzillai "returned to his own place" (@2 Samuel 19: 31 - 40). Let us each have the spirit of Chimham, longing to enter into divine things, to be found in the company of the saints, that we may be blest.
Ruth says, "whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God". Oh! how wonderful it is to find the company of the saints so attractive to you that you want to be with them, you want to be found in company with those that are like Jesus. Paul says of the Lord, "that *he* might have the first place in all things" (@Colossians 1: 18). He is to have it in the company of the saints -- but does He have it in your heart and mine? Do we enjoy the company of those who are near to the Lord Jesus? Do we, like Ruth, glean daily: "Where hast thou gleaned today? and where hast thou wrought?" (chapter 2: 19). Do we feed on Jesus; do we come, typically, to Bethlehem, 'the house of bread', in the company of the saints? God has "visited his people to give them bread" (chapter 1: 6). Oh! dear brethren do we long to feed on
{305}
that bread, do we long to feed on Christ? What a wonderful field of blessing opens up to those who come into the company of His own, where we may find the Lord, the true Boaz, the mighty man of wealth. Have you found Him in the company where you are set? Have you found that in the reading meetings there is wealth coming in from Christ, as He ministers to His assembly? He would seek to give something for your heart; He would tell you to keep your eyes "on the field that is being reaped" (chapter 2: 9). Oh! keep in the company where the Lord has set you, and enjoy the food which the saints are feeding on. Be not found in "another field"; keep in the company of the saints and you find much for your spiritual blessing and prosperity in their company.
In @2 Peter 3, the question is asked, "what ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements, burning with heat, shall melt?" Well, those who are marked by "holy conversation and godliness" will have that which the fire cannot touch. Have you that which the fire cannot touch? Paul writes to the Corinthians as to gold, silver and precious stones (@1 Corinthians 3: 12), spiritual things which are of value under the divine eye and which can stand the fire. Oh! let us treasure these precious and eternal things; they are worthless to men, but precious to those saints who find them, who value the knowledge of divine Persons and
{306}
what has been opened up in truth. Let it become part of our spiritual fibre; let us fill our souls with the fulness of all that divine Persons have given; the fire cannot touch it, and it will remain with us into the day of God.
"According to his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth". What is going to be displayed in the new heavens and the new earth? -- what has been wrought of God in the hearts of His people. Is there something of Christ in your heart that is permanent in character, something which is eternal and abiding? Do you find in the company of the saints, particularly on Lord's Day morning, that you are taken up and totally absorbed with what belongs to that world? In the Father's presence everything speaks of Christ, and our entrance there is furnished through Christ and by the Spirit. We have access to the Father and so much unfolds by way of divine blessing and fulness, and we realise our place in Christ, as "chosen ... in him before the world's foundation", and "taken ... into favour in the Beloved" (@Ephesians 1: 4, 6). We touch that which in character is of new creation and we find there is that in our souls which answers to it, and we are free in our spirits and responsive. God is looking for that day; are you, dear brother and dear sister, looking for it too?
Peter says, "Wherefore, beloved, as ye wait for these things, be diligent to be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless" (verse 14). Well, let us be devoted to the Lord and to His interests here,
{307}
walking in the company of those who are pleasurable to Him, in the dignity of sonship, in a scene which is contrary. How wonderful it is that we can be found thus "waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God". I believe that is practically how it is worked out.
Well, the divine end will be reached; we are all to "arrive at the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ". From the divine side it is assured. Let us go in for these things more, that our portion may be the richer, and what is for the hearts of divine Persons may be fuller and sweeter. May it be so, for the Lord's sake.

GENUINENESS
P. H. Hardwick
@Proverbs 25: 1 - 40; @Revelation 3: 7 - 11; @Revelation 10: 9 - 11; @Revelation 11: 1, 2; @Ezekiel 44: 15 - 18
The Lord then says, I have kept a door open for you. There is no door open like this in Russia: scarcely one open like this in eastern Germany [1953]. We can go on with the service of God, so that we find an opened door spiritually, not only publicly; this is what the Lord has in mind, and no one can shut this door. "Because thou hast a little power". How often Samson has been brought forward in this, one in utter weakness, but it says, "the hair of his head began to grow" again (@Judges 16: 22). There was life
{308}
there, a little power, and that life showed itself in power. Let us not be ashamed of the life that is there; let it come into expression. In Samson power revived in outward weakness, and in principle brought down the whole world of the mind of man. Think of the whole Philistine world being demolished by one man, not strong, but strengthened. What one man may do in such a setting!
The Lord goes on to say, "and hast kept my word". We should need to look into the Scriptures to see what that means as to detail, but amongst other things it means that we value the truth as it comes. The Lord's word indicates His mind, and His word comes out in ministry. It includes the great matter of the Lord's supper. The Lord says of Philadelphia, thou "hast kept my word". Could *we* say that? Think of the Lord saying that. He credits them with that, that they have kept His word. He said as to the Supper, "this do in remembrance of me" -- then let us do it. If we have not yet taken away the dross from the silver, let us do it that we may keep His word. The footnote *i* to @1 Corinthians 11: 24 is interesting. It says, 'For the calling of me to mind': not '*a* calling me to mind', but '*the* calling me to mind'. There is really no other. It is part of the Lord's word. "And hast not denied my name". Abigail did not deny David's name. David said, "go to Nabal, and greet him in my name" (@1 Samuel 25: 5), and we know the result: Nabal scorned and flew upon them. The religious world does that, but we are
{309}
to keep true to the name of the Lord. A young man came forward that day and told his mistress, Abigail, there was going to be trouble, as the name of David had been shamed, subjected to ignominy. So a remedy had to be found, and was found by this woman Abigail going down, not empty-handed, for she had food.
That is the way to start, finding our place as real persons answering to what the Lord credits us with in the place of all the activity of the enemy. The Lord says, I will reward you: "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial ..." One would not like to prophesy about future events, but one is sure about one thing, and that is that the great tribulation, the hour of trial, "which is about to come upon the whole habitable world", will not find us here. The Lord does not say, You will enter it and I will take you out of it, but "*I* ... will *keep thee out of* the hour of trial". It is, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience". I feel greatly tested as to that, for like many we have thoughts in our minds as to what we should like to do in personal activity: like to go here and there, like to be free from restrictions, free from discipline, or get into a settled position. The Lord does not approve of that spirit. According to the prophet even He Himself says, "I will wait for Jehovah" (@Isaiah 8: 17). Christ is presented as coming according to the word of God; and if the Lord Jesus is waiting, by the help of the Spirit we can be waiting too. We cannot do it by will power, or by stifling our feelings. It is "the word of *my* patience"
{310}
in us by the Spirit. The ministry helps us too, as enlarging these great thoughts.
In @Revelation 10 John takes the book and eats it. It is a book of prophecy which need not detain us in detail now, but in our day too we have prophetic ministry, not dealing with times, or seasons, or coming events, but concerning the truth, and I think it would do us good to take it and eat it, so that we feel it inwardly. We say about some of our meetings for ministry, 'That was a good meeting. I was glad to hear so-and-so's word'. That is like its being sweet in the mouth, but during the ensuing time it is to work into the inwards of our being. The belly is the inward part of the man where the word is to operate, whence the Spirit is to flow, where things are to be formed, and as the word gets further down and operates there may be reduction with us, a bitterness, but formation and an appreciation of what is genuine. So John is told to go now and measure what is genuine. A man like this, eating the book, is able to discern. "The spiritual discerns all things" (@1 Corinthians 2: 15), but himself is a mystery; he is discerned of none.
So John is told to "Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it. And the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not". The outward thing can be left, as if God would say, I am not concerned about that; presently I am going to judge it; you go on with what is genuine and measure it. How interesting it is to see real souls coming to the meetings and saying,
{311}
I never knew such things existed. How delightful to see somebody coming along and beginning to measure, and finding genuineness there. So these two things help one another. The prophetic side in ministry helps us to appreciate the worshipping side, the priestly side, and then the priestly side helps the prophetic word again. This is genuineness in regard to the effects of the ministry, that we may be able to measure what is of the truth.
My last remarks are about the sons of Zadok, as bearing on the service of God. "But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall approach unto me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to present unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah". I suppose I speak for all when I say we should like to be amongst them. They are wonderful persons. The Levites are spoken of here as having gone away, and Zadok represents those who replace them in genuineness. It says in chapter 43: 19, "the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok". That is where we want to be. Then in chapter 44: 10 there is reference made to the "Levites who went away far from me". So we have to begin to measure what is genuine in connection with the service of God, and to leave out what is not genuine. God will help us in that. We have been hearing a good deal about the grace of the dispensation and its operating. We are all being forgiven; our links with one another are far more gracious than they have ever been. The
{312}
brethren are making it as easy as possible for us to get into the best, but along with that there is the call for reliability, so that we have to judge the *state* of things as well as the *words*.
These sons of Zadok had a very illustrious father, Phinehas, going back through Eleazar to Aaron himself. It says of Phinehas in @Numbers 25 that he "rose up from among the assembly, and took a javelin in his hand" (verse 7) -- a weapon for what we might call very close conflict, not an arrow for distant battle -- and went into the tent where it was necessary for things to be dealt with, and thus saved the brethren. Zadok, too, carried the ark when Absalom was seeking power, and remained in Jerusalem with it (@2 Samuel 15: 29). He showed his genuineness by being ready in times of conflict. So God says, I have noticed all that, and in this great matter of my service going on these are the ones that shall have the charge of my sanctuary.
We are now in the days of the best. There has never been a time when the service of God has gone so high or been entered into by so many, as at the present time. Inquire amongst the localities where the saints are and you find the story is all of a piece; they are being helped to respond to God in the greatest levels. If you inquire a little more closely you will find that certain things have had to be discarded, some of our old well-treasured impressions, perhaps, born of sentiment, like the wool which produces heat. There is to be no heat in the service of God, no "sweat". There is to be the
{313}
coolness and spiritual collectedness suggested in the linen on the head and on the loins; the mind and strength are to be controlled. Peter brings them together; he speaks of "the loins of your mind" (@1 Peter 1: 13). Ezekiel makes them separate, the mind and the loins; they are both to be kept under control so that God's service is not spoiled, but kept in all its wonderful height and wealth. These are genuine persons, and the simple desire behind this word is that we might be among them in power, not merely in appearance. God is looking now for the glory, purity and spirituality of His service, and the Spirit is here, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of adoption, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father -- we may say, the Spirit Himself is here to help us in all these things now. May we be helped so that we have our part in these things now.

TIMOTHY'S SERVICE
H. F. Nunnerley
@Acts 16: 1 - 3; @1 Thessalonians 3: 1 - 3; @1 Corinthians 4: 13 - 17; @Philippians 2: 19 - 23; @1 Timothy 1: 3 - 5; @2 Timothy 1: 2 - 6; @2 Timothy 2: 1, 2
I suppose there is not one of us who is not perfectly acquainted with the name of Timothy; yet the Spirit of God has not recorded a single word Timothy ever spoke, nor has there been a sentence from his pen, that has been embodied in the inspired writings.
In the first passage we read together, it is
{314}
recorded that when Paul came to Derbe and Lystra, he found a certain disciple named Timothy, "who had a good testimony of the brethren", and "him would Paul have to go forth with him". One would like to speak to the younger men in relation to the possibilities before them in the service of God. If the Lord is pleased to tarry, the continuance of the testimony depends, under the Lord, upon the rising generation; and as we look around, we realise how much valuable material there is, if it is wholly committed to the Lord Jesus.
Timothy is first introduced to us by the Spirit of God, as one who was commended by the brethren. The language of the Holy Spirit is, he "had a good testimony of the brethren in Lystra and Iconium". They were prepared to put their hands upon him; and it is a great matter that the younger brethren who would aspire to service in the house of God should start rightly as commended by the brethren. Timothy had another immense advantage, that is, he had a peculiar link with the great vessel of the testimony at that moment. Paul refers to him as his child, and before Paul's course was ended, he urged Timothy to entrust what he had learned from Paul to faithful men. What an immense advantage to be brought up under Paul! Think of the intermingling of affection that existed between Paul and Timothy, and how he had been formed by Paul's doctrine and manner of life. How the spirit of Paul had taken possession of Timothy so that he proved to be of great spiritual value in his service in the house of God! Paul, as a
{315}
spiritual father, would give status and dignity to all such as came under his parental authority; so that they would be formed for the service of God.
In the verses we read in @2 Timothy 1, Paul refers to Timothy on the maternal line. He speaks to him in relation to the unfeigned faith that dwelt in his grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice, and he was persuaded that it was in him also. That is a great point in relation to service in the house of God -- that there should be purity of spiritual succession, so that one is known as trustworthy -- fit to have things handed down to one; this great feature marked Timothy. As we think of the continuance of the testimony, of how divine things are to be preserved till the coming of the Lord, we need, not only those well spoken of by the brethren, but those who come under Paul's teaching, and are formed by it: those who are marked off distinctively as having faith; of having it in their moral fibre. The beloved apostle could speak of the unfeigned faith that dwelt in Timothy's grandmother and his mother, and Paul could say, "I am persuaded that in thee also".
Following that, we would like to refer briefly to the various assemblies in which Timothy carried on his service, as indicated in the scriptures we read in 1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, Philippians; and, finally, as carried on at Ephesus; so that in 2 Timothy he becomes the great model for service in the last days; the pattern workman for everyone who would serve in the house of God at the present moment.
{316}
Turning to the first epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says in chapter 3, "we ... sent Timotheus, our brother and fellow-workman under God in the glad tidings of Christ, to confirm you, and encourage you concerning your faith, that no one might be moved by these afflictions. (For yourselves know that we are set for this)". These beloved Thessalonians were the youngest assembly in the New Testament; they were but babes in Christ, and at the opening of the epistle, the apostle can refer to them in a unique way, speaking of them as "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 1). And then we are reminded of how Paul had carried on his service in their midst. In chapter 2, he refers to himself under the figure of a nurse, speaking of his service in that way, that he had been gentle among them as a nurse cherishing her own children (verse 7). And so Paul becomes the great model in relation to service in the house of God.
A nurse is concerned about three things: the first, is the suitability of the food. If we are to be nourished and grow up to manhood in the house of God, it is of all importance that we should have suitable food. Then next, her concern would be as to the kind of atmosphere in which the child would thrive. It is an immense advantage for the younger brethren to be brought up in the right spiritual atmosphere. Then the third thing which the nurse is concerned about is the clothing of her children. As serving in Thessalonica, that spirit would be
{317}
reflected in Timothy.
In the third chapter Paul speaks of Timothy firstly, as "our brother", for that feature takes precedence of all service. A brother brings in a vital element amongst the people of God, adorning the house of God with the brotherly spirit, bringing in an affection which is eternal amongst the people of God. So the very base of all our service, as it was with Timothy, is what Paul speaks of when he says, in relation to Timothy, he is "our brother". Then, secondly, he refers to him as a "fellow-workman under God". Paul could see, so to speak, the pure gold in the soul of Timothy; he could take account of the work of God in that young man, and so refer to him as "our brother, and fellow-workman under God in the glad tidings of Christ".
What a congenial atmosphere it is in which we are called upon to serve! -- an atmosphere of love and affection, even as amongst these young saints at Thessalonica. You will notice what Timothy's service was. The apostle sent him "to confirm you and encourage you concerning your faith". There is a younger generation growing up amongst us, and there is a great necessity for this kind of establishing ministry, such as Timothy carried out towards the saints in Thessalonica. As coming into touch with these babes in Christ, how great the character of his service, as seeking to establish them in the faith, and bring in divine comfort to them. We should ever bear in mind the necessity for the great foundations of our faith to be deeply laid in the souls of the
{318}
younger brethren.
I would now turn to the first epistle to the Corinthians. In chapter 4: 14 Paul says, "Not as chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish you. For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings. I entreat you therefore, be my imitators. For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus". What a different sphere Timothy was called to serve in at Corinth! In this assembly the enemy had brought in the spirit of division. Alas! there existed in the assembly at Corinth the spirit of rivalry and emulation; there were those who were saying, "*I* am of Paul; and *I* of Apollos", and others "*I* of Cephas", and then there seemed to be a kind of super-spiritual party who said, "*I* of Christ" (chapter 1: 12). It was into this atmosphere that Timothy was sent, and what a searching thing it must have been to serve where there was rivalry and jealousy, and an absence of the spirit of Christ. It became a great test to Timothy's own spirit.
At the end of this epistle Paul bids the Corinthians to receive Timothy that he might be with them without fear. To the Corinthians Paul says, "as my beloved children I admonish you". Think of the great parental heart of the beloved apostle, the intense affections he had for these Corinthians! He told them he would gladly spend, and be spent for them, though the more abundantly he loved, the less he was loved.
{319}
Paul appears here as a grieved spiritual father: the very depth of his affections had been touched by their behaviour to him. Think of the heartless way in which they had treated one who was their spiritual father, to whom they owed everything. The beloved apostle reminds them that though they had ten thousand instructors -- and there were a great many rival instructors in the assembly at Corinth -- yet they had only one spiritual father, for he says "in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings". The gospel was the instrument the Spirit of God employed in the hands of Paul, so that these Corinthians were begotten through the gospel. He did not write these things to shame them, but he says, I write to "admonish you".
In the second epistle, he tells us of the tears which he shed over these Corinthian saints. He gives them an insight into the depths of his spiritual affections and intense love for them. Think of their shameful conduct! How they dishonoured the name of the Lord Jesus, and misrepresented their spiritual father, so that he has to say to them, "I entreat you therefore, be my imitators". Then, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord". That is a fine commendation! We have spoken of the commendation of the brethren, and of Paul's commendation of Timothy to the saints at Thessalonica, as a brother and one who is a fellow-workman under God; but here he speaks of him in a two-fold way, as his "beloved and faithful child in the Lord".
{320}
How important in relation to all ministry, and in the carrying on of the service in the house of God, that these two features should be present in every servant -- that he should be both beloved and faithful in the Lord! The great idea of faithfulness is, that we will not deviate one hair's breadth from the principles of the house of God. If Paul came into the assembly at Corinth, he would not for one moment lower the standard, but would maintain the truth at its spiritual height, and so it would be evident that he was faithful in the Lord. The apostle says to these Corinthians, that Timothy's particular service at Corinth, was not to unfold some fresh doctrine, but to bring to their remembrance Paul's ways which be in Christ.
One of the great features of the ministry today is the spirit in which it is rendered. Does the spirit of Christ have such an effect upon us, as to revolutionise our whole moral being by changing our outlook, bringing us into a spiritual environment and giving us to taste the fatness of God's house?

{321}
CONDUCT IN GOD'S HOUSE
J. Taylor
@1 Timothy 3: 14, 15
What I desire to speak of is that in which we are called to set forth divine behaviour. I do not intend to enlarge on the behaviour, but rather to show the sphere, or the character of the sphere, in which it is to be carried out; and that sphere, as you will observe in this epistle, is God's house. Now I desire by the Lord's help to say a word in regard to God's house viewed in that light; as the sphere in which Christian behaviour is to be manifested. And what I shall have to say centres largely in the house as formed by Paul's ministry. My apprehension of it is that the house is properly formed by Paul's ministry; I shall come to that directly, but I wish to point out a feature or two of the house as indicated in the Old Testament scriptures.
As you will be aware, the first mention of the house of God in Scripture is in @Genesis 28, and there you have indicated a very important feature of it. The house of God is connected with the earth, and is introduced primarily in connection with Jacob. There are two features which appear in the introduction of it, which are carried all through; indeed, in every subject introduced in the Scriptures you will find the salient features at the outset. There are two features which appear in the introduction of it, which are carried all through; indeed, in every subject introduced in the Scriptures you will find the salient features at the outset.
{322}
Now what appears in @Genesis 28 in connection with the house is divine interest in man upon earth; that is, Jacob was an object of interest to God. The heavens were opened upon him as he lay a lonely wanderer upon the earth with a stone for his pillow; he was the object of the interest of heaven; and then, his appreciation of the house consisted in God being in it, and hence it was none other to him than the house of God and the gate of heaven. That is to say, although it was a terrible place to him, because of his state, nevertheless he recognised that it was God's dwelling, and that it was in close proximity to heaven; indeed, it was the "gate of heaven" (verse 17).
Genesis in that way presents to us the house; although not actually formed as a structure, nevertheless it is presented to us abstractly. God had, as it were, indicated His mind in regard to Jacob, and you will find that when God introduces light, those to whom the light is given have to go through a course of exercise until they are formed according to it. Jacob came back to Bethel, but the full course of exercise only ended with David. At Ephratah (@Psalm 132) David had received light in regard to the house, and he connects the light that he received with @Genesis 28; he would build the house; he would give no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he found out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. The light that David received at Ephratah was connected with the light that came to Jacob as he fled from his brother Esau. David referred to that.
{323}
Now I want to dwell for a moment on two features that come out in connection with David and the house. The first is, that the foundation of the house was connected with sacrifice, and the fact that at that place Jehovah's sword was sheathed. You will recall that when David numbered the people (@1 Chronicles 21) he brought down the wrath of Jehovah. But God in grace directed him to rear an altar to Him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. There David offered sacrifices, and there Jehovah accepted him; hence David instinctively recognised that that spot was the only proper location for God's house.
If you will look at @1 Chronicles 21 and the beginning of chapter 22 you will observe that David decided that that spot was to be the site of the house. In other words, the foundation of the house is in the place where sacrifice is accepted. It is laid in the death of Christ; the judgment of God is there exhausted. I am not saying that judgment may not be connected with the house, judgment begins there (@1 Peter 4: 17), but God's house is properly immune from judgment; its foundations are laid upon the spot where the sword of Jehovah was sheathed. You will notice that, the site being indicated, David prepared with all his might to rear a structure.
Now another feature that came out in connection with David is that he was not allowed to build the house. He had the desire to build it, but the house of God is not built by a man of war. It is built by a *son*. I want you to take notice of that; it is built by a *son*.
{324}
You will remember that the first child of Bathsheba died under divine judgment. David would have saved the child; he lay all night upon the earth, in hope that God would have mercy upon him and spare the child, but the child died, and David bowed to the judgment. He said, "now he is dead". The child was never to be revived; "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me" (@2 Samuel 12: 23). He says, virtually, 'Not only has the child died, but I am going that way also'. He bowed to divine judgment, and then there is another child; and Jehovah named that child. Jehovah loved that child, and He sent by the hand of the prophet Nathan and named him Jedidiah, which signifies *The beloved of the Lord*. It is the son, the beloved of God, that builds the house. We speak of Solomon and his glory, and he is a type of Christ. He is Christ in relation to the millennial world; but we must not overlook that Solomon was a son. Solomon was the object of affection, and the house is built by the beloved of the Lord, and what a house!
You will remember that Solomon spoke of everything in creation from the cedar-tree to the hyssop (@1 Kings 4: 33). He was acquainted with nature; he was in that way qualified to head the millennial world. All the beauties of nature and the secrets of nature that men spend their lifetime and their means to bring to light now will be spoken of definitely by Christ. He will show what they signify in regard to God. Solomon spoke of all these things, but he was also *the son*, and it was as such that he
{325}
built the house. Now, beloved friends, that is what the house of God is; these features that I have intimated suggest to us what the house is; and I would specially dwell upon the fact that it is built by the Son.
Now that leads me to the Acts of the Apostles, where you have the development of the course of the testimony; and I take it that in the earlier chapters of Acts we have that which refers to the city and its walls. It seems to me that it awaited the ministry of Paul to bring in the house according to its true character, and my reason for saying that is this, that Paul preached *the Son of God*. That is, he brought in Christ, not exactly officially (although you find that also in his preaching) but he preached the Son of God. He says, "God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (@Galatians 1: 15, 16). That is, Paul preached a Person who was in relationship with God as Son, and the effect of his gospel is to bring in *sons*.
The house is formed in view of relationships which involve affection; a man's house is not an official place; his house is a place of relationship; a man's house is where his affections flow, and in order that you should see God's affections in flow, you must see the Son as man in relationship with Him, and you must see the sons who are brought in as His brethren.
Now what I see is, that the house of God, although upon earth, is composed of what is
{326}
heavenly; not simply of that which has come out of the death of Christ, but also of that which is heavenly. It is composed, in other words, of those who are the companions of Christ. As the companions of Christ, we are the companions of a heavenly Man. You will remember how that the Lord said to Mary Magdalene, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father" (@John 20: 17); thus intimating that all links henceforth should be with Him in connection with heaven, or rather as the heavenly One. He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". He is the ascending One; He is the One who is in all the liberty of the house. He has the title to ascend, and He does ascend. None but the Son could speak thus! He says, "I ascend". He is the glorious One, beloved friends, of whom we are the companions. He is the Son, and hence He is in the liberty of the house; and He goes to the highest point. In John it is not that He is *received* up, but He *goes* up; it involves the liberty of sonship: and we are the companions of that glorious One; and it is as the companions of Christ in heavenly glory that we form the house of God upon earth.
Now, in confirmation of what I have been saying, I refer to the assembly at Ephesus, in which assembly Timothy was when this epistle was written to him. Ephesus is the end, as it were, of the course of ministry that began in @Acts 9. Paul began with announcing that Jesus was the Son of God; he had received heavenly light into his soul; it was a light
{327}
from heaven that entered into Paul's soul. That meant that there was a new centre, and that light was now emanating from it; a heavenly centre, not an earthly one. Jerusalem as a centre was abandoned, and everything was now from heaven. The light that came into his soul from heaven works out in a ministry that places believers -- the sons -- in heaven. You will never understand the assembly in any of these features unless you see that its position is in heaven. Hence Ephesus is the end of that course of ministry. Chapter 20 of the Acts is the great climax of Paul's testimony, and in writing to these Christians he tells them that they were not only raised *with* Christ, but seated in the heavenlies *in* Christ.
That is the first half of chapter 2 of his epistle to the Ephesians; the second half shows that these same people are here upon earth as a habitation of God; in other words, a heavenly people upon earth. In these people you get all the features indicated in the house in the Old Testament; but there is one feature of supreme beauty, and that is, that in that structure Jesus is the chief corner-stone. "Ye ... being built", says the apostle, "upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone" (@Ephesians 2: 20). God placed Him on high, as Peter tells us; the One that the Jews refused is made the Head of the corner (@1 Peter 2: 7); but He has now obtained that place in the affections of the saints. Christ is supreme in that circle. He is the Head of that structure -- the chief Corner-stone. That
{328}
is to say, Christ is the Son, and He is honoured as having the supreme place in that circle. God dwells in it. God dwells there in *affection*: he that dwells in love dwells in God and God in him (@1 John 4: 16). The ministry of Paul brought about upon earth a company of people formed in divine affections, that is, formed in the affections known in the Son. Affections flow from relationships, not relationships from affections. The relationships are made known in the gospel preached by Paul; he announced the Son, and affections were formed according to the light of the relationships, so that there was a circle in which divine affections flowed. God dwelt there. God dwelt at Ephesus; He dwelt in that company; there Jesus was the chief Corner-stone. It was a wonderful triumph of the gospel.
Now you may ask me how I know that Ephesus had reached that point. Well, there are various answers to that question, but the most conclusive to my mind is that Paul was loved at Ephesus. He was not generally loved at Corinth; the Corinthian saints were not characterised by love for Paul; but at Ephesus Paul was loved. You remember how he sent from Miletus to Ephesus and called for the elders; and he calls their attention to the character of his ways and of his ministry; these were after Christ (@Acts 20). Paul was a vessel entirely formed after Christ. I do not believe that we shall rightly understand his position unless we see this, for as so formed he was a test for the saints, and hence you will find that he frequently refers to himself as such.
{329}
You will find it in his letters to the Corinthians habitually, and in his appeal to the elders of Ephesus. Speaking to the Ephesian elders, he concludes with recalling the word of Christ, with which he was in full accord; that "It is more blessed to give than to receive". He says, "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive" (verse 35). There you have the character of Christ, as it were, condensed, and Paul was entirely in accord with it; his ministry and his ways were in complete agreement with that character. I need only refer you to his letters as a proof of what I am saying -- he was Christianity livingly expressed.
The elders loved Paul -- they fell upon his neck and wept sore. Notice it was the *elders*. Difficulties invariably arise from the leaders, so that we may conclude that seeing the elders loved Paul the mass of the saints loved him also. I take it, therefore, that the Ephesian saints were formed by Paul's ministry. There are other evidences; namely, his epistle to these saints; the character of the truth set forth in that epistle shows that the Ephesians were advanced in the truth, that they loved God, and they loved Christ.
Well, now, if you have followed what I have said you will have some idea of the circle in which christian conduct is to shine; and I refer to it for a moment so that we might be exercised as to whether we are equal to it. Paul's word was, "if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to
{330}
conduct oneself in God's house". We ought to take note of the word *delay*. It puts us to the test. You will remember how Saul was tested by delay; he could not wait for Samuel (@1 Samuel 10): and so we are tested by the absence of Christ. So Paul says, "if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how to conduct oneself". It is not simply that Timothy should know, but that we *all* should know how one ought to behave oneself in the house of God. What a dignified position to be introduced into! The passage was written with a view to acquainting Christians as to conduct that is suitable in the house of God.
I cannot enlarge upon it, and I did not intend to; my thought was to show, as I said, the character of the house, and if the character of the house is rightly understood you have the divine standard. The divine standard of everything is Christ -- the Son. He is the Model. It is as One in the affections of the Father; One who could lift up His eyes to the Father and speak to Him as Son. It is the Son in the presence of the Father that is the Model. See @Matthew 11: 25 - 30. He is the Standard, and it is beautiful to see how Paul was in accord with that Standard; he was formed after Christ.
Another beautiful touch which I would call your attention to is this; that Timothy was formed after Paul; Timothy was begotten by Paul's testimony. You will never understand Timothy's position in the Scriptures if you do not see that he was Paul's son in the faith. The Corinthians were naughty; they were like naughty children in a house; they knew not how
{331}
to behave themselves in the absence of authority. Now Paul says, I am not coming to you, but I am sending my son Timothy to you; he is like me; he is my son, and he will put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ (@1 Corinthians 4: 17). Only a son could do that. One might learn the apostle's doctrine and expatiate upon it, but who can put you in mind of Paul's ways as they were in Christ? Paul would suggest Christ to you; he was formed after Christ, and Timothy was formed after Paul; he was Paul's son, and hence he could suggest Paul to the Corinthians.
What we require, beloved friends, is that our ways should suggest Christ: that is the test before men; it is a question of how we are formed by the truth; it is not what we say, as we have often heard, it is what we suggest; it is what we put people in mind of; if we are like Christ, we remind people of Him. I have referred more than once lately to Gideon's interview with the Midianitish kings after having vanquished them. He said, "What sort of men were they that ye slew at Tabor?" Their reply was, "As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the sons of a king"; and Gideon answers, "They were my brethren, the sons of my mother" (@Judges 8: 18, 19). That is, they had taken character from their mother, as Gideon had. Now we Christians have all one mother, and that is "Jerusalem above" (@Galatians 4: 26); it is *that* which gives character to us. Jerusalem above is really formed in the light of sonship; it has reference to liberty; "Jerusalem above
{332}
is free, which is our mother". God's house is composed of those that are like Christ, hence you have there the shining out of God. If we are not formed after Christ, we are likely to be unruly, like naughty children; but if we are formed after Christ, we maintain divine order and we are in sympathy with God. As I was saying in regard to @Genesis 28, heaven is interested in earth. God is interested in all men, and so he would have the saints interested in all men. God is shining out in Christ towards men, and as formed after Christ we are sympathetic with God in His desire "that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth" (@1 Timothy 2: 4).
Well, now, all that is to be in the house of God. And then it is "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth". That I take to be a kind of check, or safeguard, for in evangelical desire we might go beyond the truth. Many are evangelical at the expense of the truth. The nearer we are to God the more divinely evangelical we shall become; but being in the light of the assembly as the pillar and base of the truth becomes a safeguard, for you cannot do violence to the truth if you recognise that the assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.
May the Lord use these truths to form us; light is intended to form us; it is intended to exercise us; and as there is exercise there is formation.

RECOVERY AND REVIVAL IN POWER
P. H. Bodman
@Judges 16: 20 - 22; @Acts 15: 36 - 41; @2 Timothy 4: 11; @Psalm 73: 1 - 3, 11 - 19, 23 - 28
I desire to say a little as to recovery and revival in power. There are some very well-known instances in Scripture of persons that failed, that departed from the divine way, and were recovered. David sinned grievously, and @Psalm 51 records the depth of his feelings and repentance. Peter was sure of his love for the Lord, and felt that if all others failed, he would not (@Mark 14: 29). From one point of view Peter failed more than others, but he was recovered and he served the Lord very successfully and prominently at the outset of this present dispensation. But the three persons that we have read of today are not such prominent persons, and perhaps they might bear a little more likeness to our own experiences. We may not be prominent like David or Peter, but I believe we need the assurance, if we fail, that there is a way of return, and that God delights to have us return.
Many of us had the experience in 1970 of realising how seriously we had failed the Lord, not just in one matter, but over a period of years and in a very serious way. It was a great comfort to find, as it says in Romans, "God has not cast away his people" (chapter 11: 2). It is wonderful in such circumstances to take account of the value of the work of Christ -- the work of redemption and the putting away of sins. These things we learn initially, but we are to know
{334}
them more deeply and fully as we proceed in our christian pathway. Sometimes our failures help us to appreciate the work of Christ that is able to cover the most heinous of sins.
Samson had a rather chequered history, but God used him. His strength was particularly given to him of God; he was "a Nazarite of God". Failure had come in, for he had given away his secret to a Philistine, to Delilah: "I am a Nazarite of God ... if I should be shaven, then my strength would go from me" (verse 17). The Nazarite was to be distinctive in his or her committal to God, and to be separate in view of what was for God's pleasure. How telling it is to read that "he knew not that Jehovah had departed from him". That was a very serious thing, and it says, "the Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gazah, and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he had to grind in the prison-house".
The discipline that Samson endured in that prison-house was not an easy experience to go through. But God was over it, and there is a beautiful result: "But the hair of his head began to grow after he was shaved". Grace was exhibited in that; he had given away his secret, he had lost his power, but God was fitting him so that he might be used again. We may look upon things as final, that cannot be altered or improved, but God can work and bring about through the power of life something that is for His own pleasure. And so here it leads to Samson showing by his strength what he could do to
{335}
take "vengeance upon the Philistines" (verse 28). It was used to bring down the power of the enemy in a very distinctive way. It then says, "he had judged Israel twenty years" (verse 31) -- what is positive is taken account of by God.
John Mark would have seen something of Paul's progress amongst the saints, and he had been with Barnabas too, but it speaks in @Act 15 of a time when he "had abandoned them, going back from Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work". That may not appear to be very serious, but in Paul's mind it rendered Mark unsuitable at this point in the testimony, and that resulted in "warm feeling" coming in between Paul and Barnabas. Barnabas was a good man. He was used distinctively from the early days in the Acts right up to this point, but, it says, "Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus".
Now, Paul, Barnabas and Mark had previously been in Cyprus (@Acts 13: 5, 6), and perhaps Barnabas thought that they would be blessed in service there again; but it is sad to note that there is no mention of Barnabas after chapter 15 in the Acts. It suggests to my mind that he was influenced in regard to Mark and it led to him going back, so that neither of them were present at what we might call the climax of Paul's ministry in the Acts, when he goes to Europe and opens up the truth to the saints (chapters 16 - 20). Mark, as we know, was recovered, but we have not any reference to Barnabas being recovered, and maybe that should be a word to us.
{336}
We may go astray; it may not be in a serious matter, it may be in what we think is something minor, but we might influence someone else. We may get right ourselves, but there can be lasting damage done to others. In verse 40 it says, "but Paul, having chosen Silas went forth, committed by the brethren to the grace of God". There is simplicity and yet reality in the way that Paul went forth, doing what he could to help the brethren. In verse 36, Paul's exercise was to "return ... and visit the brethren ... and see how they are getting on". I would suggest that there is scope for that sort of exercise amongst the saints today. It might not be thought a very distinctive service, but I believe each one of us might find our place in doing that. Paul, as taking up that exercise, was of much help to the brethren: "he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies".
We read in @2 Timothy 4 of the beautiful end of Mark's history. Various persons turned away from Paul, possibly through feeling the difficulties of the way. There was reproach linked with Paul in prison; some might have been offended by that, and they might have lost the appreciation of the distinctive character of Paul's ministry. "Mark", says Paul, "is serviceable to me for ministry" -- a wonderful word -- not merely that he is happy amongst the saints, but "serviceable to me for ministry". No doubt it would link with @2 Timothy 2, where Paul speaks about one who purifies himself being "serviceable to the Master" (verse 21). That should be the exercise of each one of us, to be "serviceable to the Master". Well,
{337}
Mark is serviceable to Paul for ministry. How delightful that is, and how it would comfort Paul's heart when in the prison, to find Mark serviceable, as recovered. How beautiful to think of Mark's appreciation, as contained in his gospel, of the Lord Jesus as the perfect Servant -- the One who was supremely serviceable, who was here for the will of His Father.
In @Psalm 73 Asaph never actually left the path-way of faith, though he nearly did. I believe that is probably the experience of many believers: we may be affected by what we see, and this may result in our being stumbled, or taking a wrong path. Asaph very helpfully sets down his experiences, and we may learn from them. He begins with the assurance that "God is good to Israel, to such as are of a pure heart". When we are first converted, we get some impression of what God is like: how good He is, and that He is "a rewarder of them who seek him out" (@Hebrews 11: 6). But then, as time goes on, we may look around, and become somewhat disheartened. That is what happened with Asaph. He looked around and saw the prosperity of the wicked, and his "feet were almost gone". He became envious of the arrogant.
We all have to do, to a greater or lesser degree, with these features that mark men in the world, and we may become affected by them. They prosper, and say, How can God know? They will do anything in order to obtain material possessions; money becomes their god. Let us not be deceived; it is very easy for us to be affected similarly, particularly if a
{338}
certain amount of prosperity has been vouchsafed to us, for we may seek for more. One may have a wife and children and property, and may seek for things which are material, feeling that they are necessary. Satan is very adept at deceiving, at making things look attractive; he deceived Eve at the beginning. Conditions in the world may become more prosperous, and we may become lax in our judgment of what is necessary for our needs. Ministry given at the end of the Second World War exhorted the saints at that time not to give themselves to acquiring this world's goods and take on too much overtime work, if it was at the expense of what was for the Lord, and involved missing the gatherings together of the saints.
A beautiful change comes about with Asaph: "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end". That is where we really see what is of value, in the sanctuaries of God. It is wonderful to be amongst the saints, to experience together the value of spiritual privileges. You start to appreciate then what is of real value and what is merely of passing value. What men in this world are occupied with is but of passing value. They hold "gain to be the end of piety", but the apostle says, "piety with contentment *is* great gain" (@1 Timothy 6: 5, 6). There is something more valuable than the greatest treasure that can be earned or inherited upon earth.
"Thou settest them in slippery places, thou castest them down in ruins. How are they suddenly
{339}
made desolate!" How fragile this world's system is. It speaks in @Revelation 18: 17 of it coming down "in one hour", a very short period. The providential dealings of God embrace thousands of years, and yet a period of one hour is noted.
Asaph is brought back to an appreciation of God Himself and of His guidance. "Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel". Oh! what a wonderful thing that is. You may say, How am I going to get through here in faithfulness to Christ? How am I going to manage? "Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel". It is a wonderful thing to put our confidence completely in God as to how He is going to bring us through.
Many have experienced extremely difficult circumstances, including the experience of losing their jobs because of faithfulness to the Lord in the matter of trade-unionism. We need to remember what persons have gone through in the past -- how are we behaving now? Are we prepared for whatever the Lord might have in mind for us? In @2 Corinthians 6 there is an appeal as to what is suitable to a believer, and at the end it says, "I will be to you for a Father". God is prepared to act in a fatherly way towards those who are faithful, to look after such, to care for them, and give them what is needed. It may not be what we want, but have you ever met a person who has gone on with God in simple piety who is discontented? No, you find they appreciate their lot. They may not be prosperous according to men's standards, but there is something of value worked out in their souls. Piety makes way for what
{340}
is spiritual.
So Asaph says, "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee". The praise that comes out of his heart is almost a doxology. "God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever". What recovery comes about in Asaph. Instead of looking at the wicked, he is looking at God. And what does he find? He finds something that satisfies him, something that is worthwhile. Instead of being discontented he becomes contented. He says, "as for me ..." Oh! that is a good word. "As for me and my house ...", Joshua said, when it was a question of whether persons might turn away from God (@Joshua 24: 15). Whatever anybody else is going to do, let us commit ourselves like this: "As for me, it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, that I may declare all thy works". There is not only something for God, but there is something in the way of testimony too. I believe that will be the result if we are preserved in fidelity to Christ, there will be not only what is for God, not only what is for us, but what is for the benefit of others too.
May the Lord help us in these matters, for His Name's sake.

TIMOTHY'S SERVICE
H. F. Nunnerley
@Acts 16: 1 - 3; @1 Thessalonians 3: 1 - 3; @1 Corinthians 4: 13 - 17; @Philippians 2: 19 - 23; @1 Timothy 1: 3 - 5; @2 Timothy 1: 2 - 6; @2 Timothy 2: 1, 2
What was the source of Paul's "ways"? We turn in spirit to the four gospels. In Matthew, the way of righteousness is prominent. Matthew's first recorded utterance of what fell from the holy lips of the Lord Jesus is, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (chapter 3: 15). So the very keynote of Paul's ministry at Corinth -- the great dominating principle that he maintained in that assembly -- was righteousness.
In the gospel of Mark, the great levitical gospel, in which we get the absolute perfection of the service of the Lord Jesus Christ, the great feature is that the Lord trod the way of suffering. How it bows the heart in worship, and calls forth the deepest spirit of reverence and adoration from the hearts of the servants, as they see the Lord Jesus treading the way of suffering! Mark, of all the evangelists, gives the most precious details in regard to the holy sufferings of Christ. There is great need of that spirit amongst us. It would give mellowness of spirit, and would have an effect on any part we take in the house of God if we were treading in the way of suffering.
In the gospel of Luke, there is the way of wisdom. What a necessity there was in Corinth for the way of wisdom! Man's wisdom was corrupting the assembly of God there, bringing in features that
{342}
were destructive of the true dignity and glory of the house of God. Paul's ways in Christ were ways of wisdom. What a necessity there is in the companies of God's people for wisdom's children to adorn the house of God. In the book of Proverbs it says of wisdom, "Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace" (chapter 3: 17).
In the gospel of John, what is opened up to us is love's excellent way, the greatest of all. If we follow the Lord Jesus, particularly from chapter 11 to chapter 19, and to the yet deeper darkness of the cross, we see the lustre, the dignity, the surpassing glory of love's excellent way! Brethren, are we treading it? Are we treading the way of righteousness, so that we maintain inviolate every divine principle in the house of God? Not allowing the intrusion of man in the flesh, lest we mar the way of righteousness; not recognising the mind of that man, lest we set aside the way of wisdom; but then, are the saints treading together the way of suffering; and that greatest of all ways, the way of love -- the more excellent way? Think of the majesty in which this way was trodden by the Lord Jesus! He never appeared greater than when He trod love's excellent way; every step in it rising up as incense to God: a path filled with glory; and, as Paul says, a "a way of more surpassing excellence" (@1 Corinthians 12: 31), for when faith and hope cease, love will still abide. We can see what it meant to Timothy to step into the assembly at Corinth, amid the bickerings, jealousies, and party spirit that existed there, and be there as a
{343}
model among them, labouring to recall to them Paul's ways in Christ, when he had been among them.
Turning now to @Philippians 2: 19, we see what a congenial sphere of service is opened up to Paul's child as he came into the assembly at Philippi. I suppose there was no company that yielded so much to the heart of the apostle. One of the outstanding features of that company was the way they were marked by the spirit of Christ, the most precious thing on earth. One would love to see in regard to each company represented here, the features that marked the Philippian company: their support of the beloved apostle, their attachment to his person, and their fellowship in his service, which is spoken of as fellowship in the gospel. In such delightful surroundings, such a congenial atmosphere, in such a flow of affection, Timothy was privileged to serve. You will notice that he served in three relations. The apostle speaks of him as his own "child". He gives him this commendation, that he had "no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on", he singles him out with this commendation. We would have greater spiritual prosperity, the service of God would be enriched, and the response to God greatly added to, if there was in every local company, one who cared with genuine feeling how the saints were getting on.
You notice in connection with the second commendation it is said, "all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ", but Paul goes on, "ye
{344}
know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings". One would like to see that spirit reproduced, to see this wonderful spirit dominating the saints. One often thinks of the beloved elder brethren, those who bear the true features of spiritual fatherhood -- how the younger need to learn to serve with them, as a child with a father! We need all the wealth and experience of a father, combined with the energies of youth, to get the full value of service in the house of God. What a delightful service! What a lovely atmosphere to serve in! What congenial surroundings in the company of saints redolent with the spirit of Christ! But we have to learn to serve at Corinth, as well as at Philippi!
In @1 Timothy 1: 3, we have a far more testing character of service. It is one thing to serve among the young, for in one sense there is nothing more delightful than to serve among those who have been newly converted, and have all the early freshness of love to Christ. It is testing to step into such an assembly as at Corinth, and carry on the great service of reminding them of Paul's ways in Christ. What an elevated service it was at Philippi, and what a delightful atmosphere in which to serve; but the most testing service of all was at Ephesus.
Timothy, though a young man, was called to service in the most enlightened company that the New Testament presents. They had, at Ephesus, all the light of the counsels of God. There had been unveiled to them the whole range of the divine
{345}
purposes, and Timothy was serving among his equals -- a very testing thing for a young man to do. The elders at Ephesus stand out as the great representatives of those formed by Paul's ministry. Timothy stepped into the assembly at Ephesus to take up the service, and it was a very testing matter. The apostle sent him there to maintain his teaching at its height. Elements were coming into that assembly, bringing in disruption, and the apostle's word to Timothy is this, "that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach other doctrines, nor to turn their minds to fables and interminable genealogies, which bring questionings rather than further God's dispensation, which is in faith". I would appeal to all, the elder as well as the younger brethren, that in fidelity to the Lord Jesus Christ we might still maintain Paul's teaching. There were elements that would corrupt the saints, and set aside Paul's teaching, but the great end of Timothy's service was that he might maintain the true features of God's dispensation which is in faith.
Turning to 2 Timothy, our attention is called to Timothy's universal service, which is not now limited to any particular assembly. He adorned each sphere of service with the spirit of Christ, and we find him here as one who is the great model for service in the last days; a pattern for every servant amid the abounding corruption in Christendom. It was in view of the present state of things that Timothy was called to serve.
Paul first refers to him as "my beloved child",
{346}
saying, "I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day". What an immense stay that must have been to Timothy! One often thinks of the life of Paul -- a life of absolute devotion; there never has been a greater, in the history of the assembly. The Lord Jesus must, of course, ever stand alone. His service was absolutely unique, and there can be no comparison with it! He must ever stand alone in His unique, solitary dignity, and glory. There is nobody in the universe who could compare with the peerless worth and beauty of the Lord Jesus! But next to Him, and perhaps the greatest servant that Christ ever had, was the one who is our apostle, the great apostle of the Gentiles; and he tells Timothy that he has him in his prayers night and day! Many of us feel the lack of prayer. There would be more power amongst the people of God, a richer expression of the spirit of Christ, and an enrichment in the way of divine service, if there was a greater service of prayer amongst the people of God. One would desire that all might step into the ranks as men of prayer, that there might be the continuance, in freshness, of the testimony till the Lord comes.
A simple incident happened in England, after a father and mother had taken two of their little boys to a fellowship meeting, at which the subject of the meeting had been the continuance of the testimony. The mother had put the little boys to bed, and as she left the room she heard the younger one, Jim, ask his brother, What did the brethren mean by the
{347}
continuance of the testimony? The answer was, Well, it is just like this: in our meeting we have two old brothers, they are very old, and the Lord is soon going to take them home, and then father and mother will carry on; and in years to come, if the Lord leaves us down here, He will take them home, and then you and I will carry on.
I would like to appeal to the young ones. If the Lord tarries, many of the aged brethren will soon be taken home, and the call is to the next generation, to rise up and serve in holy dignity in the house of God. The service of God is to be carried on in undiminished power. I would like even the children to catch the spirit of that little boy who said, You and I will carry on.
Just to refer to our last thought in @2 Timothy 2. What an inexhaustible reservoir it is! No matter what confronts us in the testimony, we have a reservoir from which the stream flows without any possible limit. The word to each one of us today is, "Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus". In the book of Genesis, Abraham is the great father of the testimony, and then it was handed to Isaac in the dignity of sonship, and Jacob adorned it as a worshipper, and we see its climax in Joseph; for every phase of the testimony always ends in the glory of the throne. We get four generations in this scripture. Paul adorning it as no one else has ever adorned it, in the lustre and dignity and the shining out of the spirit of Christ; and then Timothy's devoted service as a young man, who
{348}
filled this unique position in the holy testimony of the Lord Jesus. Then we see how it is handed on to faithful men, for the truth has never been kept by the public body. The pure stream of the truth has been maintained by a succession of faithful men; then finally it is passed on to "others also". May we all be amongst those who thus treasure the truth.
It is not that we would call attention merely to Timothy, but to Timothy's Lord. We would desire to exalt the One whom he served until, as we think of the great service rendered to us, we all bow down in a feeling of holy reverence and worship in the presence of the One who has loved us, and served the assembly with undying affection. Even since He took His place at the right hand of God, He has never ceased for one moment His service of love, throughout all the phases of the assembly's history. That service will soon be crowned in that supreme day, when He will present the assembly to Himself, glorious, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.

THE BODY OF CHRIST
M. W. Biggs
In the latter part of @1 Corinthians 12, the Spirit of God alludes to the human body and uses it as an illustration to show each believer his place in the body of Christ.
It is important that we should regard ourselves not merely as sinners who have been forgiven and
{349}
justified and who are now accepted in Christ, but as members of the body of Christ, livingly linked with each other and also with Christ in glory.
We are told that this living link has been formed by the Holy Spirit (verse 13) and is therefore indissoluble; it cannot be broken. We may be ignorant of it, or, if we know it, may deny it practically, but the fact remains.
In this brief paper I wish to draw my readers¬ attention to a few practical points with regard to our place, privileges and behaviour while on earth as forming part of the body of Christ.
Before doing so, however, I would again emphasise the fact that every believer -- i.e., every person who has received the Spirit of God, *is* a member of that body. It is not optional with him. *God* has set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased Him (verse 18). We are losers indeed if we ignore this fact and rob ourselves of many happy privileges; and on the other hand, it is a serious thing for any one to refuse to recognise his position as set in the body, for the place has been given him by *God*. It is vain for any to plead individual liberty to the denial or evasion of responsibility as a member of Christ's body. The words are clear, and I beg my readers¬ prayerful consideration of them: "God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased him", and "Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular" (verse 27). It may be added that whilst this truth is of universal application to all Christians it
{350}
particularly refers to those in any given locality.
The question then before us is, what are the believer's privileges as being a member of the body of Christ, and what should mark him in his ways practically? The two sides of the question go together, for every privilege carries with it a corresponding responsibility.
There is a side of privilege which is not developed in the first epistle to the Corinthians, but we shall not consider that side in this brief article, but restrict our attention to what may be termed practical privileges -- i.e., privileges granted to us to carry out in our ways down here.
First we may notice in verses 21, 22 that we are privileged to recognise *every member as necessary*. As the eye of our body cannot say to the hand, "I have not need of thee", so no one of us can say of another believer, I have no need of him. We cannot be independent of each other. We are not mere units, but members of a body. This is very encouraging, because some of us may think that we are not nearly so useful or necessary as So-and-So, yet we must remember that God has set us in the body, and if we isolate ourselves we shall deprive ourselves of benefits we might derive from others, and on the other hand we shall not fulfil the work which God has designed for us as being needful members of the body of Christ. Each member is needful. That bed-ridden saint, as well as that much-used evangelist; that sister, whom so few know or notice, as well as that prominent servant or gifted brother.
{351}
"But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker *are necessary*".
Secondly, God has tempered the body together so that *everything is comely* (verses 23, 24). How often we view things otherwise! We take account of each other according to what we are as natural men born of Adam's sinful race, with weakness and failure, instead of as forming part of Christ's body, each member being comely. God has thus tempered the body so that there should be no division in it. We have already noticed that we are linked together by the Holy Spirit. What is natural and of the flesh must tend to divide us. It is interesting to recall that the curtains of the tabernacle were coupled together with loops of *blue* and clasps of *gold* (@Exodus 26: 4 - 6). That is, to apply the type, what is heavenly and divine unites us. Let us ever remember this and recognise happily our bond with every member of Christ's body and view each with honour and as comely. We feel how often what is of the flesh intrudes into little gatherings of Christians, and the natural result ensues -- divisions, cliques, etc. How can it be otherwise? Social distinction and position, as well as many other things, if brought in amongst a gathering of Christians must distress and cause trouble, whereas what is heavenly and divine unites all, for our bond is spiritual.
In conclusion, we may observe that it is our happy privilege *to care for one another* (verse 25). All are to suffer if one does; all are to rejoice if one is honoured. *Self* can have *no* place, for its every
{352}
movement must grieve the Holy Spirit and He it is who unites us all. If we are spiritual we shall naturally do these things, and do them, let us note, in our own locality first and also wherever we may incidentally come across a member of the body of Christ. What a privilege is ours indeed! We are to care for every member of the body of Christ! It may be replied that we know so few. Well, let us care for those we *do* know. It is useless to speculate as to what we might do if we could come in contact with more members of the body of Christ when we are neglecting what we may do with regard to those we *are* acquainted with. *Love* will show us how we can care for one another. May the Lord lead us to realise our privileges and be alive to our responsibilities as members of the body of Christ. Each member is necessary, every one is comely and we may care for *all*.

STABILITY AND UNITY
P. A. Gray
@Exodus 25: 10 - 22; @Exodus 26: 6, 15 - 30; @Exodus 27: 1, 2; @Exodus 28: 28
I desire, if the Lord will, to speak of the tabernacle system as marked by stability and unity, because the centre of the tabernacle system is the ark, which speaks of Christ Himself. The Lord is the Centre of what God is doing, and He ought to be the Centre of the lives of saints -- our "life is hid with the Christ in God" (@Colossians 3: 3).
God introduced the tabernacle system as a pattern of what would be established in Christ. In the centre of the tabernacle system was the ark, which was small, and which had staves so that it could be carried in the wilderness in accordance with the divine indication. It was made of acacia-wood -- a wood that was durable, and speaks to us of the manhood of Christ. It measured "two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof". It is not to say that Christ in manhood is within our compass; the half cubit would remind us of the greatness of His Person. Now, because He is the Centre of all God's operations, we can be certain that what God has set on will be preserved and will go through for His pleasure.
The ark is a wonderful vessel and appears in many references in Scripture. It is worth following up the different titles that are ascribed to the ark. In the days of Samuel, when the rights of God were not being widely acknowledged, the ark was referred to
{354}
often as "the ark of God" or "the ark of Jehovah". God is able to maintain and sustain what is for Himself even in adverse circumstances. Even when the ark was taken into captivity and one could say that the glory was departed, yet in the house of Dagon, the god of the Philistines, Dagon fell "on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah" (@1 Samuel 5: 3, 4). The ark was later brought by David to a place where it was valued, into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite (@2 Samuel 6: 10, 11). There is blessing for every house that values Christ and honours Him. What is valued in our houses comes into expression when we are together.
Here in @Exodus 25 it is "the ark of the testimony". God had made a covenant with the people of Israel. The covenant which He had made in the law becomes His testimony -- a testimony to who God is. You might say, How is the law a testimony to who God is? Well, it involves an understanding of the heart of God that lies behind it. We get in @Exodus 20 the setting out of the law, and in chapter 21 the Hebrew bondman, who says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free" (verse 5).
Of the ark it says, "thou shalt overlay it with pure gold". We speak of gold in relation to the divine nature, and in the mercy-seat there is a testimony to the nature of God and to His righteousness in the way in which Christ has been set forth.
Then there are four rings of gold for the ark, and there are staves. Now we should all be exercised in
{355}
relation to carrying the ark. The staves were made of acacia-wood overlaid with gold. Think of the way in which divine Persons carry us! Scripture says, "unto hoary hairs I will carry you" (@Isaiah 46: 4). And we know a Saviour who has carried us and who will continue to carry us, who will bring us, as the psalmist says, to our "desired haven" (@Psalm 107: 30). But it is also for us to be exercised to carry what the Lord may lay upon us, "that the ark may be borne with them".
"And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold". The mercy-seat rests upon the ark. There are cherubim there; God's rights are acknowledged. The setting forth of Christ as a mercy-seat involved that Christ had to die. God said, "And there will I meet with thee, and will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim ... everything that I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel". God's rights are upheld, and He speaks from above the mercy-seat. What an impression it should give us of the heart of God, that He chooses to speak from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim. God would look down on that mercy-seat and see the blood that had been sprinkled upon it, and from there He would speak to the people, "everything that I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel". Everything would come from there. It would come to us as God speaks in the light of what Christ has done. So that it is not God speaking in judgment. How blessedly God speaks to us, how carefully He
{356}
speaks to us. How He would commend Himself to us in what He says as He speaks to us in Christ!
In chapter 26, we read of "fifty clasps of gold". The detail of the tabernacle system is interesting. In relation to God coming out in revelation, so to speak, from the centre, the ark is first, then there is the table of acacia-wood for the shewbread, then there is the beaten work of the lamp-stand and surrounding all that we have the curtains. Now what is particularly in mind is that there are fifty clasps of gold, and the curtains are coupled together with the clasps "that the tabernacle may be one whole". We sometimes link the curtains with principles -- I believe that is right -- and they are all needed, and they are held together in order that the tabernacle may be one whole. That is to say that one principle is not taken to supersede another; every one is needed.
"Thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains together with the clasps". So that the nature of God is seen in the way in which these things are applied and held together. The detail of the curtains is interesting: "And thou shalt make curtains of goat's hair for a tent over the tabernacle", and there is the "covering for the tent of rams¬ skins dyed red", which would remind us of the death of Christ. Red was not the natural colour for the rams¬ skins; they were dyed red -- they went through a process. "And a covering of badgers¬ skins over that"; that would be the outward protection.
There are boards for the tabernacle, and there are
{357}
a number of things to consider about them. First, they are made of acacia-wood. In the saints, we should look for manhood according to Christ, formation after Christ. Then they are "standing up". God made man upright and God desires that man should be found upright in His presence. There was one whom the Lord had to meet who was bowed down; but the Lord cured her so that she might stand up (@Luke 13: 11 - 13). "Ten cubits the length of the board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of one board". These are boards of substance and of value. And the saints are persons of substance and of value. They are standing up and they are great persons; not great in man's scheme of things, but great in God's scheme of things. Think of the word of Gideon when one said to him, "each one resembled the sons of a king". He says, "They were my brethren" (@Judges 8: 18, 19). Well, these are like the boards, made of acacia-wood, standing up.
"And thou shalt make forty bases of silver under the twenty boards". It is interesting to consider the number of things in the tabernacle system that have bases. They are not there just as a haphazard collection of items put together. There are pillars for the veil with bases; there are these boards with bases. They stand up and they are secure. It would remind us again of the stability of the tabernacle system. Forty bases of silver remind us that each one of us is standing on the ground that Christ has redeemed us. "Two bases under one board for its two tenons, and two bases under another board for
{358}
its two tenons" -- two bases, not one. That is to say that God would bear witness to us of the value of the death of Christ and of His rights over us. The Holy Spirit would give us to be in the good of the forgiveness of our sins through the redemptive work of Christ.
Then there are bars of acacia-wood -- five bars for the boards of the tabernacle. I particularly wanted to refer to the middle bar in the midst of the boards "reaching from one end to the other". Each of us has his or her individual link with the Lord, but also what I do affects my brethren, and what they do affects me. We might apply that negatively and say that if I misbehave it has an effect on all the brethren. Well, that is so, and I do not make light of that at all; I have my responsibility in relation to that. But the other side is that we are all held together, we are all bound up in the bundle of the living (@1 Samuel 25: 29). There is a bar running from one end to the other. And, "if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it" (@1 Corinthians 12: 26).
"Thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make of gold their rings, the receptacles of the bars, and shalt overlay the bars with gold". So everything in this system of things speaks of the glory of the divine nature. The saints are representative of how God has come out in testimony: "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children" (@Ephesians 5: 1). It is all overlaid with gold. God takes account of the saints as set together and, as it were, overlaid with gold.
{359}
"And thou shalt set up the tabernacle according to its fashion, as hath been shewn thee on the mountain". It is a good thing to look at the saints and to see them as God sees them: "the brother for whose sake Christ died" (@1 Corinthians 8: 11). When we come to glory, who will we see there? We will see the Lord. But we will also see those whom His love has secured, for whom His blood was shed; we will see those who, like these boards, who have stood up in difficult circumstances as well as in good circum-stances, who have stood at the corners when they needed to stand at the corners, who have defended what is for God and delighted to do it even if it involved a path of suffering. We see God's glory shining in the face of Jesus Christ, but we see it reflected in those whom love has secured, we see it shining there.
Beloved brethren, we have an opportunity to see it shining now. In whom can we see the glory of Christ? It shines every day; it shines through pressure, it shines through joy, it shines in the faces of the saints. It might become covered over by things, it might become dim for a time, but let us look for it, and if it has become covered over let us work to uncover it again. There was a time when it says in the prophet, "How is the gold become dim!" (@Lamentations 4: 1). Well, if it has become dim let us work to burnish it back to its full glow. Think of the time when two were going on the way to Emmaus, and, as it were, the gold had become dim. They were disappointed and sorrowful and sad; but the Lord
{360}
went with them every step of the way, and brought the gold to light again. "Was not our heart burning in us?" (@Luke 24: 32). Think of that! The gold was there on that long journey, when they had trudged all the way back to Emmaus, but it was not a burden to return to Jerusalem for the joy of being amongst the Lord's people again.
And then we come to the matter of the altar of acacia-wood. "Five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth" -- man's responsibility has been perfectly met in Christ. "The altar shall be square": suggestive of the universal value of what Christ has done. "The height thereof three cubits": speaks of how He has come out in resurrection power and burst the grave. "And thou shalt make its horns at the four corners thereof; its horns shall be of itself, and thou shalt overlay it with copper". There was power with Christ to meet every matter that stood between man and His God. Think of His suffering, anticipatively, in the garden of Gethsemane -- "his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth" (@Luke 22: 44). I believe, and I speak simply, that when the Lord rose up to go out of the garden of Gethsemane, the enemy was a defeated foe. He had brought before the Lord anticipatively all that he could of the suffering that lay ahead of Him, and the Lord was restful in doing the will of the Father.
In closing, I refer to chapter 28 because for this system to operate the priests had to be there. As to the matter of unity, "they shall bind the breastplate
{361}
with its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod". The saints, typically, were on the priest's heart "when he goes in to the sanctuary" (verse 29), as they are on the heart of Christ every moment of every day. Well, we might say, Judah would be there, and Joseph and Benjamin, the ones of whom we might immediately recall things that are positive. But they were *all* there, including Issachar and Daniel Think of the Lord, when He says, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer" (@Luke 22: 15). With whom? With Peter who would deny Him? -- impetuous Peter. With Matthew the tax-gather? With Andrew who said, "There is a little boy here who has five loaves and two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many?" (@John 6: 9). The Lord desired to have him there too. Philip, to whom he had to say, "Am I so long a time with you ... Philip?" (@John 14: 9) -- he desired to eat the passover with him, too. Some, whose names we know as disciples, we hear very little or nothing of after that, but the Lord desired to be with them. He did not let one of them go. "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished" (@John 17: 12). Thus the breastplate was not loosed from the ephod.
One's desire is that we should have stability in our souls as seeing that the Centre of the divine system is Christ; as seeing that every saint stands on two sockets of silver, and all are bound together with
{362}
the bar that runs from one end to the other; as seeing that everything that has been required has been met in Christ; and as seeing that the breastplate is not loosed from the ephod. Let us ever keep the saints of God in our affections, and give Christ the place that God has given Him as the Centre of all that He does. May we be encouraged that He carries every one whom love has secured upon His breast, and brings them in before God as a memorial continually, for His Name's sake.

WHAT IS PROPER TO BRETHREN
A. J. Gardiner
@Genesis 4: 1, 2, 8 - 11; @Genesis 14: 13 - 20; @1 John 3: 10 - 17
I wish to speak, dear brethren, of the brother and what is proper to us as brethren. And when I speak of the brother, I include, of course, sisters. That is, I am thinking of the saints as spoken of as the brethren. "We love the brethren", it says (@1 John 3: 14). And I am speaking of the brother as an individual member, whether a brother or a sister of that company which Scripture speaks of as the brethren. The term, I think, is intended to convey what we are in our affinity with one another as born of God. That is, we are of the same family, as being born of God, and therefore have the affections and feelings proper to that family.
God has set us in relation to one another as brethren, I think for a two-fold purpose. First of all,
{363}
as here in this world and the children of God, we are here in testimony to what God is in His nature and attributes. That is, God is to be known in His children. The children of God are the brethren. That is one thought connected with children, that they normally convey some feature of resemblance to their parents; and the children of God are in the world as those who are born of God, in order that they might express in their life and conduct what God is in His nature and attributes, especially love, which is His nature, and righteousness, that is, the pursuit of what is right, morally right. Those two things are the two outstanding things which the epistle of John speaks of.
Now as seen in that position of testimony, we are likely to incur opposition and hatred in the world, and therefore the second object in mind in being set here as brethren, is that, as in a scene of hostility in testimony, we should be of mutual support to one another. That is, that we are not intended to be in it in a merely isolated, individual way, but as moving together with the affections and mutual care proper to the family to which we belong. And therefore the circle of the brethren is provided as a means of support to those who are in the world in the testimony. We have already alluded to it in our readings on the Acts, that when Peter and John were threatened by those who were opposed, it says, "And having been let go, they came to their own company" (chapter 4: 23) -- their *own* company. There was no other such company in Jerusalem. It was the
{364}
company of the brethren, and Peter and John being let go went, it says, "to their own company", and the whole company took up the matter in prayer with God.
Well now, I said that what we are as brethren from this point of view stands related to what we are in relation to one another as born of God, as being of the same family. There is, of course, a higher view of the saints as brethren of Christ. It says that, "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (@Hebrews 2: 11). That is, the saints are regarded as of the same order as Christ, and I believe that consists in the fact that, not only are we born of God, but that we have received the Spirit of the ascended Man. The Holy Spirit whom we have received is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and I believe it is that which constitutes us heavenly and of the order of Christ. You remember that in @John 20 it is said of the Lord that He breathed into the disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (verse 22). That is, He set them up in that way, and so, being all of one He is not ashamed to call us brethren. And so we read in @Romans 8 that, "whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" (verse 29). That is, it is sonship that is in God's mind; it is that to which He has predestinated us, the pattern of it being seen in Christ Himself, and the full thought of sonship is realised when we are conformed to His image in
{365}
every way, and there God will have Christ before Him pre-eminent among His brethren, those of His own order.
But I wish to speak now of what we are as brethren of one another -- as those who are born of God. And that involves that we are to love one another, and that involves too that we are to care for one another's souls. It is interesting that at the outset, as we read in @Genesis 4, God makes so much of Abel being *a brother*. Adam and Eve had been recovered, you might say, to God. God had brought home to them their guilt, and then He had clothed them with coats of skin, so that, typically at any rate, and I have no doubt in some measure of consciousness of acceptance, they were now set up as being instructed in righteousness, having a judgment of sin, but there as in the value of redeeming love. I am not speaking of how far they were intelligent, but that is what we can see in it: that they had been convicted of sin, and that God had provided them with a righteousness based on the death of a substitute, so that they were really set up now as a witness to righteousness and a witness to redeeming love.
But now Cain is born and Eve thinks she has acquired a man from Jehovah; she thinks that the seed of the woman has already arrived in this son Cain who was born, and she names him Cain, meaning 'Acquisition', and saying, "I have acquired a man with Jehovah", but she was mistaken; her son turned out to be the beginning of the line of "the
{366}
wicked one" -- that is what John's epistle tells us, that "Cain was of the wicked one". So that God having recovered Adam and Eve and set them up in this world as a testimony to righteousness and love, the devil now contests the matter. He brings on the scene a man who was going to prove himself to be characteristically of the wicked one. But then it says of Eve, "she further bore his brother Abel". The second one that was born was a brother. God saw to it that a brother was brought on the scene, and moreover it says, "And Abel was a shepherd". The first brother was a shepherd, and that is an important matter, showing that one idea connected with a brother is that he is to care for the souls of the saints. He is first of all to learn to care for his own soul.
We read in the first epistle of John that, "he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him" (chapter 5: 18), therefore we have to learn first of all to care for our own souls, and that I believe is illustrated in David's history as a young man. You remember how he tells Saul, when he was proposing to go to meet the giant, that he was keeping his father's flock and a lion and a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, and he says he went after them and smote them and he rescued the lamb from the lion and the bear (@1 Samuel 17: 34 - 36). Why he did it was because he accepted responsibility for every lamb in the flock, which belonged to his father, and he put his trust in God.
I believe the lamb is really a picture of one's own
{367}
soul, that we have in early history to learn how to preserve our own souls, because Satan will try to ensnare us. He will try to capture us. He will try to rob God of the portion that He has a right to in each of the souls of His own; and therefore he will come against us in one form or another. It might be the terrifying form of a lion, the intimidating idea, or it might be the more seductive form of the bear; but whatever the form of his attack, we have got to learn to meet him. The way we meet the devil, dear brethren, is by just maintaining what is right. Overcoming in spiritual things is not a matter of something heroic, it is a matter simply of not surrendering or compromising what is right. And God's support and the support of the Spirit are proved as we are on that line.
You remember how the Lord met the devil in the wilderness. He did not meet him with divine power, but he simply met him in a way that is proper to a man, He says, "It is written" (@Matthew 4: 4), and He would not allow for a moment any departure from what was written, and He met Satan on those lines, that He maintained what was right in a man in his relations with God, and Satan was thus defeated. And therefore, as I was saying, we need to learn first of all, to keep our own souls, and David proved faithful in that respect in regard of the lamb, he recovered it, and hence it says in @Psalm 78: 70, 71 that God took him "from the sheepfolds ... to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance". That is, having proved faithful in that which is least, he
{368}
became advanced to have charge of that which was great.
So, as I was saying, the first brother was a shepherd. And so in these verses we have read, from verse 8 onward, six times Abel is spoken of as Cain's brother. The thought of the brother is emphasised, and Jehovah tells Cain that Abel's desire would be toward him. I think that means that Abel loved Cain. There was that element there in Abel. These features of righteousness and love were there in Abel. He was maintaining the truth for the moment: that is, he approached God with a sacrifice which was in keeping with the way God had clothed his parents with coats of skin, and he was loving his brother. He was maintaining righteousness and expressing love, and that is why he became the object of the hatred of this one who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother. Cain says to God, "am I my brother's keeper?" That is exactly what we are, dear brethren, we are our brother's keeper, and that is what we shall come to in the first epistle of John, that the brother is intended to have his eyes open that he may see his brother having need, and he is not to ignore it, for according to chapter 5 of the epistle, he may see his brother sin, and if he sees his brother sin, a sin not unto death, he is to ask for him. He is not to ignore it, he is not to say to himself that it is not *his* affair, he is to get to God about it, because we are our brother's keeper.
Each one of us is responsible for the souls of those that are near to us, and this particularly applies
{369}
in any locality. We cannot, of course, in any practical way, be the keeper of the souls of all the brethren, but we can accept responsibility for those amongst whom God has immediately placed us, and therefore in any locality there should be developed among the brethren the care of one another. First of all, pray for one another. Keep our eyes open and see what the need is. Pray for those who are getting on, that they may get on still better, and pray for those who are not getting on, that the Lord may exercise them and help them. But then, if we are to be an influence for good among our brethren, and if we are to have power with God, in our prayers, we must see to it that we are going on ourselves. That is of the greatest importance. And of course, it is a very serious matter for anyone to stumble a little one. That is another matter which the older brothers and sisters, especially, have to beware of, the great seriousness of becoming a stumbling block to one of the little ones. And so as I was saying, the brother is a shepherd, and he is responsible for his brother's soul. "Am I my brother's keeper", Cain says, but God does not answer his question, but the Scriptures show that the thought is that we are to accept responsibility in regard of our brethren.

"GO WITH HIM TWAIN"
F. S. Marsh
@Mark 8: 22 - 26; @Matthew 5: 41; @James 5: 16 - 20; @John 9: 35 - 38
"And we shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah" (@Hosea 6: 3). With these striking words Hosea prophesied of a living character of things, in which there can be no stagnation. Our scriptures confirm this thought, for each of them anticipates "following on". In @Mark 8 it was the Lord's second touch; in @Matthew 5 the disciple's second mile; in @James 5 the servant's second prayer; and in @John 9 the second interview with the Son of God. There had been a first touch in each case, but each is suggestive of something to follow. We have not reached finality, and the need of each is known perfectly to the Lord. We may be sure that in the activity of His love He has ever something more in His mind to which He would lead us, beyond the point we may have already reached.
The first scripture has rightly been referred to as indicating that wonderful operation of God by which the Holy Spirit is given to those who have trusted in Christ. For the moment, however, let us apply it as suggestive of the Lord's present movements; for He has His own way of dealing with each one of us, and we freely acknowledge that each one needs a further touch from Him. The Lord has touched us, but He has not yet finished His work in us. He has some-thing more to do with each, and we need to be prepared to own that we have not reached this until
{371}
we receive *the second touch*, and see "all things clearly".
Perhaps some of us need a further touch of grace and delivering power from the hand of Jesus to enable us to be preserved from seeing men as trees walking. We greatly desire that the Lord would touch each of us now, that we might see all things clearly. Do we not often feel that we have not that clarity of vision which we should have? things are not always as clear to us as we should like them to be. Sometimes we long for One to put His hand on us and make us see all things clearly. We need to be honest before the Lord, and if He asks us if we see anything, to own it, if we see men as trees walking. We may have an abnormal vision, perhaps an extravagant idea of man, and we may attach importance to ourselves that the Lord could never support. We need a further touch from the Lord, and to come under His power, that we may look up; for when the Lord touched the man the second time, he looked up and "was restored and saw all things clearly". He would not then have a distorted view, for he would see a man as a man, and not as a tree walking.
When the man had that second touch, he would see Jesus, too, in all His beauty. Think what it must have been for that blind man who desired Jesus to touch him! He had longings -- typical of soul desires -- but he could not see; he needed One to put His hand upon him that he might see. The Lord Jesus would never turn away from a longing like that. Every spiritual desire in any heart has been
{372}
implanted there by the Lord Himself; every desire to please God, or movement in the direction of God's glory, is a product of the work of God. The Lord, as the perfect Servant in this gospel of Mark, recognised this man as one who had longings, and He put Himself at his disposal. Let us visualise it for a moment. Think of the Lord Himself taking him by the hand, and leading him out of the town! What a movement of grace by God's Servant! God had said, "Behold my servant" (@Matthew 12: 18), and we would adoringly behold Him! We would desire to have the skill to take by the hand those who have soul longings, but who are blind and have no true perception of God or of Christ, and we would bring them to Christ. We would lead them out of the town, where man's glory is recognised, to the seclusion outside, where, alone in the presence of the Son of God, they may receive that heavenly touch.
How frequently we find in the gospel of Mark that the hand or the touch of Jesus is referred to. The evangelist seems to magnify the grace of this perfect Servant, who not only did such wonderful things, but did them in such a beautiful way. That blind man would never forget the grace of the touch of Jesus. Nor will you ever forget the grace of Jesus that touched and led you out of all the confusion in which you were found, into seclusion with Himself. You never get clear spiritual eyesight in the town. In man's world we shall never get the right vision. When the touch of that hand leads us out of the town, then we shall be on the highroad for spiritual
{373}
vision.
When the Lord first touched him, there were evidences of the work, for he had sight; but he could not see clearly. The first touch had taken place, but as yet he saw men as trees walking. Now He who has begun this good work in him will complete it. The Lord would touch each one of us, to deliver us from any distorted vision, He would adjust us, so that anything we may not have seen clearly before, we might see now, and not by the working of the human mind, but by the living touch of Jesus the Son of God, for
<blockquote>'How all things shine in light divine, <br>For those who've seen His face' (`12:1). </blockquote>
Do not let us assume that we have seen all that there is to apprehend. It is possible to have some measure of sight, and yet not have the right proportion. Do we not all need our vision to be clarified? Some may attach too much importance to their homes, others to their business, and all these things need adjustment. The same living, powerful, skilful hand that touched us the first time would make us see all things clearly. While we value one another's counsel, and are thankful to the Lord for the mutual help we are to one another, it is only the living touch of Jesus that can give that clear vision. "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 2: 9, 10).
The next advancement is on our part, and is
{374}
suggested in *the second mile*. This is a practical question, for it is a true mark of the spirit of subjection to the Lord. In Matthew, the Lord is teaching His disciples, and in the course of His instruction He makes use of this very remarkable expression, "whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain" (Authorised Version).
This second mile is very testing. You may say, 'I did not even wish to go the first mile, and yet I was compelled to go' -- but this second mile is a greater test. There may be a compelling influence to which we have reluctantly submitted, but when we reach the end of the first mile we should naturally say, I am going back now!
There is, however, a principle in that exhortation which will have its own effect upon our lives if we will bow to it. May we reverently say that the Lord Himself was compelled to go the first mile when He was taken by wicked hands. But He voluntarily went the second mile, right down into death itself. What a journey that was! They compelled Him to go the first mile, though He said, "thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?" (@Matthew 26: 53). He could have gone back to the glory without dying, but His was the grace that would show to men the movements of divine love. He went the second mile, right down into death and judgment; yet before He died, He prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (@Luke 23: 34). No one compelled Him; it was grace
{375}
that caused Him to go the second mile.
A Christian is normally a subject person, who does not put his own mind and thoughts forward, but is submissive: when compelling power is exerted, instead of reluctantly bowing, he says, I will go further, for he desires to show that he belongs to the One who surrendered everything for God's glory and man's blessing. He would go a mile under compulsion, but He was ready to go yet another mile to express the goodness of God to men. If you are a follower of Jesus, there will not be much time in your life to gratify yourself. Under compelling influence your own will must be surrendered, but then you will gladly go further in that path to give expression to the love of Jesus.
This principle may be applied practically to many circumstances, for it may be that it will cut right across a cherished plan. If we are ready to bow to the ordering of God, and to let our plans be altered, we should not only accept His ordering, but be prepared to go that second mile. It may be that some things are not yet clear to me which are clear to others. Then this principle would cause me to sacrifice my own personal thoughts, to show the spirit of yieldingness, and to manifest that spirit which would give glory to God. We might inquire why that perfect One should go to the cross, but it was the will of God, and thus He became "obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross" (@Philippians 2: 8).
May the Lord give each one of us a deep concern
{376}
about this second mile, and wisdom as to its practical application. It is a question for our prayerful consideration as to how far we have the super-abundance of grace which the Lord Jesus indicated when He said, "whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain".

ADD TO KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE
J. B. Stoney
The end of knowledge is to furnish one with skill to act rightly in every circumstance. The great advantage of knowledge in a world of evil is that it tells a man how to find the true and holy path through it. Hence "the knowledge of the Holy is understanding". The coming in of sin by man eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil only made it necessary that he should be taught of God in order to be preserved from the evil which he had introduced by acting in his own will. This then is the path which the vulture's eye hath not seen, the path -- the "wisdom" -- of which "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning" (@Proverbs 9: 10). The greatest and most eminent course for any one in this scene is to be so intelligent in the mind of God as to know how to keep separate from all that is foolish and evil.
The glory of knowledge is that it shows me this wondrous path, and conducts me by divine skill away and apart from the snares and pitfalls and vexations which are on every side, in this world. "I have more understanding than all my teachers; for
{377}
thy testimonies are my meditation" (@Psalm 119: 99). One cannot conceive anything grander than to see a man so instructed that he is never at a loss how to act; and though he has to refuse many things, he does not feel aggrieved; he sees that it is right and wise for him to do so, and that the way of wisdom is the path of pleasantness and of peace.
The use of knowledge is to inform a man what he may do and what he may not do, and hence we are to add to knowledge temperance (@2 Peter 1: 6). According as you have knowledge, you know how to steer clear of things which would otherwise hinder and check you. "Every one that contends for a prize is temperate in all things" (@1 Corinthians 9: 25). Divine knowledge teaches us how to be temperate.
The desire to be wise was part of the temptation which led to the eating of the forbidden fruit. The desire to know more exists in the natural mind. To exalt and to minister to oneself is man's continued effort, and mere knowledge peculiarly contributes to it. Nothing so exalts a man above his fellows as knowledge, and hence there may be a labour and pursuit to acquire even the knowledge of the Scriptures, without having the conscience exercised by this simple principle, that for every increase of knowledge there is an increase of responsibility. It is plain, as man has turned everything here to self- aggrandisement, that as I hear the word of God and receive it, so must I break away from the things in their endless variety which this world presents to me. The world is an organisation by which every-
{378}
thing is arranged to suit and to add to man's greatness. It is order, but an order to suit and to please man, and all human knowledge has been used to this end, to form a system entirely suitable to man; and for this end Christianity has been adopted by man. God is not really before the mind, but the benefit of society.
Now the culmination of this world is Babylon, where there will be the best of everything, with entire and unequivocal independence of God. The calling of the saints is, "ye are not of the world" (@John 15: 19), and yet we are in it; and we are taught of God in it, and as we learn and understand the mind of God, the better and the more distinctly do we keep clear of the world. A saint of full age has his senses exercised to discern good and evil. We are to regard ourselves in this world as ships at sea. Unless properly guided the ship will surely be wrecked, and all the learning and knowledge of the mariner is to keep it safe, and to find a clear path, where it is exposed to dangers and adverse elements on all sides. The master of the ship understands very well that his knowledge is of little use unless he can apply it to the navigating of his ship.
That is just the way a saint is to regard all knowledge; he has to apply knowledge to a definite point, and that is, to steer his way safely through elements that he cannot trust, and which are often set dead against him. The first thing for a saint is to accept in his conscience that he is in a world where everything is against him, and where there is only
{379}
one true path, the path of life, made and walked in by our blessed Lord; and therefore that all light points out this path. It shows us what we are to avoid, and what would divert us from this path; for our calling is to walk as He walked. Divine knowledge instructs us to turn away from man's principles and tastes, and to adopt what God approves, so that I have fulness of joy, because I am in the path of the One who knew all God's mind, and who walked here entirely separate from everything not of God.
Thus, as my knowledge increases I am either more unworldly, or I get a bad conscience. It sets knowledge in a very high place when we see that the end of it is to direct our steps to the one only divine path, the path traversed by the blessed Lord from infancy to glory. Thus there are two things for us to accept; first, that the world in its very rudiments diverts us from God; secondly, that the light of Scripture is the only guide to the path of life. We are perfectly incompetent to act, even in the most ordinary duty, till we are taught of God, and therefore the more we are taught of Him the more distinctly we are kept apart from the world. The word is the guide.

MIXED CONDITIONS
27 February 1890.
My dear brother, -- In reply to yours of 25th I send a line to try and explain what I mean by 'mixed conditions'.
The truth is that a Christian is of new creation before he has done with the old; he is heavenly before he has done with the earthly; he has eternal life before he has done with his responsible life as a man down here. Hence while on the one hand we are a new creation in Christ where old things have passed away and all things have become new, on the other hand we have to run a race, to continue in the faith, to see that sin and flesh do not reign in us.
In Ephesians we see our new creation state, in Romans our responsible life as still here in old creation condition and circumstances, but justified and indwelt by the Spirit. This makes the mixed condition, and it is of all moment to see these things in their distinctness or we fail to see either the true character of the new creation order -- or to appreciate the grace by which we are supported in our responsible life while here. It is somewhat like a dissolving view; the new picture has come on to the scene before the old has completely passed away.
I trust this may help to make the matter plain.
Your affectionate brother, <br>F. E. Raven.
