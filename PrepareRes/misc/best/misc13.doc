FELLOWSHIP
W. R. Mason
@Acts 2: 42 - 47; @Acts 4: 32 - 35; @1 Corinthians 1: 9; @1 John 1: 5 - 7
One's desire is to say a few words about fellowship. This will be a subject well-known, no doubt, to many here, a fundamental subject too, but always of importance to us as Christians, because, if we are enjoying Christianity as we should, we would be enjoying fellowship in some measure. God would have us enjoy a full measure of it in so far as we can enter into it in these closing days of the church's history here.
What the Holy Spirit brought here at Pentecost He still holds for the whole assembly, for all God's people; He has not dropped one feature of it. Like the servant who came to secure Rebecca, He has all the treasure of His Master under His hand (@Genesis 24: 10). The Holy Spirit came here with all the wealth of heaven behind Him, the wealth of the Father and of the Son, and brought all that fulness down to fill the church and the hearts of God's people until the Lord would come for them again. Nothing of that fulness has gone back to heaven; it is still here in the Spirit's keeping that you and I might have access to it.
One of the great things that the Spirit is in charge of is fellowship, the fellowship of the saints. We have read about it in three connections, first as experienced by the saints at the beginning where it is called the "fellowship of the apostles"; then Paul,
{2}
coming on the scene later, opened out the matter further, and he refers to it in writing to Corinth as the fellowship of God's Son. But John, writing for days of breakdown, is very unofficial and he just speaks of how in certain conditions "we have fellowship with one another". That is the real thing. Now the apostle Paul, writing to the Philippians, speaks of this as the fellowship of the Spirit (@Philippians 2: 1); again, writing to the Corinthians he speaks of the communion (or fellowship) of the Holy Spirit (@2 Corinthians 13: 14). He also speaks of it as the fellowship of Christ's blood and the fellowship of Christ's body (@1 Corinthians 10: 16). All these give us various aspects of the one thing.
It was never the intention of the blessed God in taking up poor sinners to leave them lonely and isolated. The psalmist could say, "God maketh the solitary into families" (@Psalm 68: 6). It is very good of God to think of men in that way, that they should have happy, profitable associations down here in the midst of a wicked world, and that there should be a great association of life, not of the world, but in the midst of it, a circle enjoying eternal life and in touch with heaven. That is God's plan for every saint at the present time; they should be enjoying the portion of the saints in light, delivered from the authority of darkness, from Satan's power, from the power of the world, and be brought into the bundle of the living where they can enjoy a heavenly portion. It is the greatest company that you could be found in, the fellowship of the Spirit. It is energised by the Holy
{3}
Spirit, maintained by Him and supplied by Him. It is protected by Him and, in the measure in which we walk in the Spirit, we know the power and greatness and wealth of that fellowship.
Now at the beginning of this dispensation it was a very obvious fellowship. Where we read in the Acts there was no church breakdown; there were no sects, there were no divisions and there was no scattering of God's people. All were together and had all things common. "Not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own". All their material resources were available for the good of the whole company, the whole fellowship; and that was quite apart from the world. It was not a heathen organisation; it was not a Jewish organisation. It was completely different from all that men had experienced before, and it was greatly favoured in having Christ's companions serving it. That is an important point. These early converts "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles". They had been converted through Peter's preaching; he preached repentance and baptism, and they had responded. They were all baptised "and there were added in that day about three thousand souls" (chapter 2: 41). That is, they had accepted death to the world and to the whole sin system; they had committed themselves to a rejected yet glorified Christ and they were added to the assembly; they were added to what God had here, what the Spirit anointed on the day of Pentecost.
There were many forces against them. There was
{4}
the pull of Judaism, that ancient tradition they had been born into and brought up with. God had originated what they were identified with, though it had greatly deteriorated in the hands of men. The scribes and Pharisees and the corrupt priesthood had ruined what God originally set up. Nevertheless, the Lord identified Himself with His earthly people, though, at that time, the recovery of Nehemiah's and Ezra's day had long since broken down; it had become an order of things that was all profession, outward rites and rituals, but lacking heart, lacking reality and which eventually rejected the Son of God Himself. So He had to say, "your house is left unto you desolate" (@Matthew 23: 38).
But what has encouraged me in looking at the gospels is that the greatest things that ever men saw or heard were brought out in the midst of a ruined revival. That is the background, as to context, of the life of Jesus as seen in the gospels. That recovery from Babylon was effective under Zerubbabel and Ezra and Nehemiah and the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, but it had become corrupted and ruined by man, so that in Malachi's time they would not even shut the doors of the temple without payment (@Malachi 1: 10). They brought the blind and the lame to offer to God, things they would not give their governor. The law was broken on every hand; unfaithful against the wife of their youth, they broke the covenant that God had made with them. But there was a remnant of the Spirit. "The remnant of the Spirit was his" (@Malachi 2: 15), and the Spirit
{5}
looked after that remnant right till Jesus came in. It appears in the gospels in Anna and Simeon and those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem, Joseph and Mary, Zacharias and Elizabeth, the godly remnant of the Spirit. Jesus appears in the midst of them and as He grows up, and takes up His ministry, He calls others to Him, and there is a little remnant following Him, loyal to Him in the days of His flesh, in the midst of which He brings out the greatest things that earth could ever have known. The full revelation of God came out in the midst of a ruined recovery.
So let us not be discouraged, dear brethren. We live in days when a wonderful recovery has been ruined, broken up, split and fragmented all over the earth. We are not to be discouraged. It was in moral conditions like that that the full revelation of God was brought out. All that man could know was brought out and portrayed in the Son of God, and God's purpose made known that men might be in sonship with Him. The glory His Father gave Him He gave to the men whom the Father had given Him out of the world (@John 17: 6, 22). So let us be prepared for great things in the day of brokenness in which we live, because the Spirit, as I remarked at the outset, has retained all that He brought from heaven.
Well, these people were part of a fellowship that was distinct from all around in the pagan world and in the religious world, and it was marked out by heavenly character. The whole stream of life was
{6}
against them; all the traditions were being cut across. Jerusalem would have been full of their relatives and full of their religion, having many synagogues and the temple; but it says "they persevered". That is what we need, perseverance. There is much against us today too. Are we going to give up and fold our arms like the sluggard in Proverbs? We shall find ourselves impoverished. "So shall thy poverty come as a roving plunderer, and thy penury as an armed man" (@Proverbs 6: 11). We do not want to be robbed of our inheritance, beloved. Let us persevere, let us hold fast what we have that no one take our crown.
We have known what it was to have had many other burdens laid upon us, unprofitable burdens. The Lord's mind is, "I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast" (@Revelation 2: 24, 25) -- and we have much, through grace; much has been recovered to us. We have been blessed with wonderful blessing, wonderful light and truth. Oh! to be true to it, and to be exhibitors of it. The testimony is only preserved in those who are the exponents of it. The testimony is not on the book-shelves or in the libraries; it is in the personnel, the saints, who have God's mind and are walking according to it. So "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles". That would be no easy matter because the apostles¬ standards would be very high; they would be no less than Christ's standards. These men would give colour and character to the fellowship that made it the quality that it was.
Then there is the teaching. The teaching and the
{7}
fellowship go together. We can have this because the Spirit is still here. We do not have apostles now, but the apostles¬ fellowship in character would still be here. The youngest brother who preaches the truth will have divine authority behind him because he is speaking God's mind. How else could you preach the gospel if you could not get up with certainty and ask never-dying souls to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved? You speak with divine authority, otherwise your audience may say, 'That is just his opinion'. No, the youngest believer who is preaching Christ and God's gospel is preaching with divine authority.
Well, this was a very wonderful fellowship and what they did in it was governed by this heavenly teaching, and it was a safe fellowship. The apostles were there to protect them from false teaching and false practice. Then Satan sought to infiltrate deception through Ananias and Sapphira. Peter was quick to discern it and to protect the company from that evil. What a solemn event occurred in the death of that couple! God asserted Himself for the protection of the holiness of His house and the integrity of the fellowship into which He had called His people.
It says also, "They persevered ... in breaking of bread and prayers". I think it is a wonderfully balanced situation here; the teaching and fellowship, and then the breaking of bread and prayers. We need to keep on with the breaking of bread. One thing I feel I need more than anything is the breaking of
{8}
bread, the Lord's supper, what He has asked us to do. "This do in remembrance of me" (@Luke 22: 19). How can any Christian really do without that for very long? Some have had to do without it for quite a while on account of circumstances, but I believe that a true lover of the Lord, truly exercised, would not be left very long without the Lord's supper.
Let us persevere, beloved brethren, and not give it up easily. And the prayers are needful for us to be kept dependent. Pray for ourselves and households, for the saints and all God's interests here. What a wide range of interests there is to go over in our thoughts and prayers! Keep at it. The devil would have us give up. When you give up prayers you are on the danger list. The prayers make way for divine power to maintain us in life and in victory. That is why this company continued in such buoyancy and with such a sense of well-being. What quality and wholesomeness marked them so long as they maintained these features! When they were given up, failure came in, alas.
"Fear was upon every soul". Not that they were afraid of God or afraid of the apostles; that is not the idea. I do not think Peter or John would induce fear in people. No, this is holy fear of God, fear of offending the blessed God. I believe the most happy intimate relations existed between the apostles and the brethren. I do not think the apostles used the rod in their teaching of God's people. If you read the Acts you can see what intimate, affectionate relationships prevailed between the apostles and the
{9}
saints. The service was carried on in the most respectful way; the saints were respected and the teachers were respected. There was mutual respect and mutual love amongst the brethren but no mutual fear or mutual antipathy. This was a real fellowship.
"Many wonders and signs took place through the apostles¬ means. And all that believed were together, and had all things common". I think the Spirit records this for us to show the beautiful state of things in simplicity at the beginning. It speaks of them here receiving "their food with gladness and simplicity of heart". Every day they were "constantly in the temple with one accord"; I do not think that they were in there engaged in Jewish worship. This is in the general temple buildings (see footnote d). They preached there; you find the priests laying hands upon them there for their preaching (@Acts 4: 3). But they are there "with one accord"; they are inwardly in agreement; their hearts are knit and they are praising God and are in favour with all the people, and the Lord was pleased to add. Now if we could just recover in some measure some of those conditions, do you not think the Lord would be pleased to entrust others to such a company? That is a safe company, the best company on earth to be committed to; and the Lord was pleased to add the subjects of His mercy daily.
I just added those verses in chapter 4 as showing how this thing had been continued for some time; "the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one". Oh! what unity. The Spirit
{10}
maintained this. It was not only an outward unity, an outward compliance; heart and soul were involved in it. The affections and the feelings, the depths of the people were in it in full committal. So they were one, "and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own". The idea is that all that they have now is available to the Lord and to His people. This is a basis for the great witness of the apostles. "With great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus". Those men, as they preached, could point to the company behind them and say, 'Look, here is the evidence of His having risen'. You have a company on earth, elect of God, holy and beloved, full of bowels and compassions, full of those real affections and feelings that the Jewish system was devoid of. The reason for it was that their hearts were filled by a living, glorified Christ. The apostles had that kind of background.
Now we do not have that today; we could not go out and witness as the apostles did because all we can point to publicly is a broken church. We have often said, If a Chinaman came in and got converted, where would you send him? Where would you tell him to go, if he wanted christian company? The only thing you can do (as for yourself also) is to send him to the Lord and say, 'Go to Him; He is the only One who can direct you'. He gives you inward direction, inward leading. When you get that you are safe. If you have not got it you will always be unsteady, uncertain and unstable. The apostles could point to a
{11}
great system of oneness and love that gave power to their testimony. They were not just preaching objectively the great facts of what Christ did and what He was, but they could point to the results in the company. "Great grace was upon them all".
Now in Paul we have the wise architect of the church. To him it was given to complete the word of God. The twelve had learned a great deal from Christ; they were a wonderful repository of truth but they did not have it all. Paul was brought in to complete the revelation (@Colossians 1: 25), to bring in the topstone of all that God would have us understand of His will, His mind and His purpose. Paul brings in the truth of the mystery, and opens up the heavenly calling, the truth of sonship, and the service of God, and he shows the workings of the house of God in the most remarkable manner; he shows what the fellowship of God's Son really ought to be; he gives it this beautiful title. He is writing to a company much beloved of him; he had laboured there for many months and there had been real results, a large number secured for the testimony. The testimony of the Christ was confirmed in them and they came short in no gift; they were awaiting the Lord's coming. But the devil had got to work and brought in sects amongst them, schools of opinion. "Each of you says, *I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ" (verse 12). They were breaking bread in the same locality. All had chosen favourites whom they followed. Paul says they are ordinary men, and the Corinthians were following men. "Has
{12}
Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?" (verse 13). He sought to get their eyes away from men and fixed on the Son of God. Paul brings in Christ here to offset the petty, childish goings-on of the Corinthians.

REMEMBRANCE OF THE LORD JESUS
J. Taylor
@1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 26; @Genesis 40: 14, 23; @Genesis 41: 9; @Exodus 32: 1
Well now, we are told that the cup-bearer forgot Joseph; but the time arrived when it seemed that it might give him an increased favour with his master, and then he remembered Joseph! Now how do you remember the Lord Jesus? Do you remember Him selfishly? Do you speak of Him only before the saints? Well, there is not much reproach in speaking of Him among the saints; the Lord Jesus is held by them in affectionate regard, they love to hear about Him. How do you speak of Him outside? What kind of designation do you use? Does it denote One whom you love, or is it just that of a benefactor, a public benefactor? The apostle spoke of Him as "my Lord" (@Philippians 3: 8). Mary Magdalene said, He is mine; "they have taken away my Lord" (@John 20: 13). Did you ever say that publicly? That is what I regard as affectionate remembrance. It is a designation that denotes One that has a place in your heart.
{13}
The cup-bearer, as I was noting a moment ago, called to mind his faults; that was not calling Joseph to mind. I would emphasise that, to call to mind your faults is not calling Joseph to mind. It is quite right to judge sin, but calling Joseph to mind would be the remembrance that Joseph told him to keep with him, and that he did not keep; he made not even a note of it, so that he forgot Joseph. He did not forget the event, it was an historical event that he could never have forgotten. Do you think for one moment he forgot he was in prison, and this captive Hebrew revealed to him his dream? But he forgot Joseph in the sense in which Joseph intended him to remember him.
Now that too was the case with the Israelites. The same principle appears in @Exodus 32. It was when Moses had left them. You always find it is when God leaves you to yourself, it brings out just where you are. The Israelites were left to themselves for a little while, less than six weeks; it was not very long. See what kind of memories they had! They had seen Moses go up into the mount, but they could not tell where he was. Now let me say to you that if your remembrance of the Lord Jesus is such as theirs was of Moses, simply that he had led them out of the land of Egypt, you will very soon lose all sense of where He is; you can give no account of Him. They say, "this Moses ... we do not know what is become of him!" (verse 1). "This Moses", they say; it was the very opposite of affectionate regard and esteem. Yet they remembered the historical event, he had led
{14}
them out of the land of Egypt. He had been their leader, they admitted it, but what account did they give of him? "We do not know what is become of him!" You remember the day of your conversion, but what about every day since that? The second day of your conversion ought to be a brighter day than the first; and it would be if you had the Lord Jesus in affectionate remembrance, for things increase. The affectionate remembrance in which you hold Him, as having converted you, would be brighter, and so on; as the days are multiplied your remembrance increases, and your joy increases.
They said, "We do not know what is become of him!" During those forty or thirty-nine days they had not taken account of the provision Moses made for them, in leaving Aaron and Hur to look after them (@Exodus 24: 14). If I had been there with the light I have, I should have looked at Aaron as Moses¬ provision. They had Aaron and Hur. I should have looked at Hur and said, That is Moses¬ provision for me; but what did they say? "This Moses ... we do not know what is become of him!" Now it is as sure as anything can be that if there is not affectionate remembrance for a person, somebody else will take his place; that is so in the history of Christendom. Presently, some one else is coming in to take the place of the Man who is held in regard only in an historical light. The Lord said, "if another come in his own name, him ye will receive" (@John 5: 43). The way is being prepared for him. The seed was sown long since that has borne
{15}
the crop which is preparing for his advent. "This Moses", what did that mean? There might be another equally good if not better. Is it not so with regard to the Lord, that in the minds of men He simply ranks with other men in the present day? That is the situation. I have seen His name put up with other men, with great leaders of thought in this way; we have not got Him, we may as well have another.
Now the Lord's supper saves you from all that. Do not say you have not got Him, and that you do not know where He is. If that is the language of your heart you will look for another. John the baptist said, "Art *thou* he that is coming, or are we to wait for another?" (@Luke 7: 19). Christendom is looking for another already. Let us take it to heart. The word has gone forth that Christianity is a failure; they are looking for someone else. The thing is simply a fact in an historical light, the Lord Jesus Christ is not in their hearts. The way is being prepared for another, for they would have another to come.
Well, I do not dwell further on that, but I turn to the Lord's supper. The Supper is brought to us Gentiles from heaven, by one who valued it. The apostle Paul does not use dry doctrinal language. He says, "*I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread". This is his own language; the structure of the sentence is his own. We must not assume that he quoted from Luke; Luke quoted from him if anything. The Supper is presented to us couched in the language of one
{16}
whose affectionate regard for Christ is conveyed in it. "The Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread". When Paul was amongst them he had delivered it to them. I have no doubt that the first breaking of bread at Corinth was by him; he says, I delivered it to you. One would have loved to have seen Paul break the bread. The Lord Jesus was in his heart; the night on which He was betrayed was in his heart. How all that scene would come in power into the heart of Paul as he broke the bread at Corinth! He says, I also delivered it to you.
We must not think this is the first time they heard of the Supper; he calls attention to what he had delivered to them. And how far they had got away from it! so far that he says that what they were doing was not the Lord's supper: 'the Lord's supper is what I delivered to you; your supper is sectarian, the rich eating before the poor, that is not the supper of the Lord'. One would have loved to have been there when Paul spread the supper table. He would take the loaf and break it and call to mind, using the Lord's exact words, "this do in remembrance of me". Not an historical event, it is the Person; it is "in remembrance of me". It was as if Paul, like Joseph, had left it with the Corinthians so that they might have it by them, a remembrance of Christ. How far away they had got from it! Sectarian views, carnal jealousies and pride, all that in the holy Supper of the Lord Jesus! He says, It is not the Supper. He does not say what it may have been; he could have said much. He says, This is the Supper, what I
{17}
delivered to you. It was delivered tangibly by his own hands in their own sight; they had moved away from it. I believe the Lord would lead us back to the simplicity of the Supper, so that it might be with us, as Joseph desired it should be with the cup-bearer, a remembrance of Him. Till when? Till He comes. "In like manner also the cup". That word "manner" is very suggestive; "in like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me".
Now I just want to refer for a moment to the end of the Scriptures. In the last chapter of Revelation the apostle John says, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus" (chapter 22: 20). There is the same affection that he began with, but it had become intensified, if anything. The Lord at the end of the book announces Himself to the assemblies. He says, "*I* Jesus" (verse 16); not appearing now as the long-robed Personage of the first chapter of the book. It is "*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies"; "to you", not to the angels of the assemblies now. He speaks directly to us now, and what is the regard in which the assembly holds Him? It is triumph to dwell on this, it is the triumph of His care and attention all the way through the dark night. He is now the Morning Star; things are brightening into day. He says, "I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". What does the assembly think of Him? What do you think of Him? "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". That is the
{18}
Man they have come to admire. Antichrist is not admired; antichrist is the opposite of that Man, and he is not admired in the assembly, he is admired elsewhere. The remembrance the Lord Jesus left has been effective. He has not been forgotten, thank God; the assembly has come back to the remembrance of Him, as if to say, You are the Man. It is the Person she wants.
Now just to make the point clear, you will observe in regard to Enoch, that, though he was translated, he did not speak in his prophecy about translation. Enoch was a prophet. We are told in @Genesis 5, that he walked with God and that "God took him" (verse 24), and we are told in @Hebrews 11: 5 that he was translated, but he says nothing about it. What Enoch said was, "Behold, the Lord has come" (@Jude 14). Faith looks on to the scene of testimony here that must be occupied. If Enoch goes, the Lord comes. Does He come with Enoch? No, with ten thousands of His saints, with the holy myriads. What joy and strength that would be to the heart of Enoch amid all the terrible corruption that surrounded him! Think of the Lord coming with holy myriads!
The assembly does not speak of her translation, the Lord is coming; that is her witness. Is antichrist to hold sway? Is he to prevail? No, he is not to prevail. The Lord is coming in with holy myriads, they are to occupy the ground. He is to take vengeance on those that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. So the assembly is not telling us about her translation, she is occupied
{19}
with the coming in of the One she loves, the One of whom she has had the remembrance in her heart all the time. Then John, too, to add to the position after all He has said and done, says, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus". It represents the affectionate regard in which the Lord is held on earth through grace.
May the Lord enable us to give Him that place. I believe He is seeking it; as I was saying elsewhere, it is before our translation that He would bring about a state in us that is pleasing to God. "Before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God" (@Hebrews 11: 5). Before it. So that there is the affectionate regard in which John holds the Lord. He does not say, Lord, take us; no, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".
Now just another word; David says, "let all the people say, Amen" (@Psalm 106: 48). Well, that is what the Holy Spirit would bring about. If there is anything right and true, and surely the truth of the coming of the Lord is, it is what is needed all around us, "let all the people say, Amen". Let us not be divided about that, "let all the people say, Amen". So John says, "Amen"; he wishes the Lord Jesus to come.

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH OF GOD NO. 5 -- THE HOUSE OF GOD -- ITS RESPONSIBILITY
M. W. Biggs
It is scarcely necessary to state that if there are many and blessed privileges known by believers as constituting the house of God, there are at the same time corresponding responsibilities. In our last paper we considered some of the privileges, in this paper the responsibilities will be before us.
The epistle which particularly deals with this side of the subject is 1 Timothy. The behaviour suited to the house of God is there dwelt upon. It is doubtful if we shall answer to the responsibilities attaching to the house of God unless we enjoy something of the privileges. And, on the other hand, if we do not answer to the responsibilities we shall become dull in our spiritual sensibilities and incapable of enjoying our privileges. Both sides must be maintained.
The conduct insisted upon in the first epistle addressed to Timothy supposes the doctrine and the privileges of the epistle to the Ephesians. Ephesians gives us the inward spiritual relationships and privileges more particularly, while 1 Timothy insists upon the maintenance of right behaviour.
The apostle Paul, in writing to his trusted, but apparently young, servant, Timothy, gives certain instructions as to detail, and concludes these remarks by saying that he wrote thus that Timothy might know how one ought to behave oneself in the house of God (@1 Timothy 3: 15). Hence we may rightly turn to
{21}
such an epistle to learn what is the suitable behaviour to those who compose the house of God.
(1) The "end", or desideratum, of what is brought before us is "love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith" (@1 Timothy 1: 5). Moreover, Timothy is exhorted to maintain "faith, and a good conscience" (verse 19). Some had swerved from this state of soul, even in the early days of Timothy's time, and consequently departure of a more serious kind followed.
The standard by which all has to be judged today is the "sound teaching, according to the glad tidings of the blessed God" (verse 11). God has been revealed, and by this revelation and in the presence of God we answer to His mind and possess these essential qualities -- love, a good conscience and faith.
Love is the divine nature; a good conscience can only be kept as our conduct answers to what we know to be right; faith is that which gives the enjoyment of the light of the revelation of God. In our experience these qualities would possibly come in the reverse order. Faith is the light of revelation in the soul; conscience regulates conduct accordingly; and, our hearts being thus morally purified, we love God who first loved us.
We may rest assured that these qualities are of immense importance. They are the foundation *in the soul* of all practical Christianity. They are the outcome of what is revealed to us by God and of His work in our souls, and are the moral basis of all right practice.
{22}
We feel persuaded that all departure has its beginning in a defect in one or more of these moral qualities. Unless faith is in exercise, the soul is practically in darkness; if our consciences are not kept sensitive and good, we shall fail to answer to the light we have; love is the response in man to God. It is useless to consider anything further if these primary and essential elements are wanting.
(2) In the house of God His attitude towards man is set forth in a practical way. Those who form the dwelling place of God are exhorted to have a prayerful interest in men. Hence the love and grace of God, who is known as Saviour, are manifested. *How can we pray for people we do not love*? Our hearts will condemn us if we assume to do so. But in the enjoyment of God's love, our hearts are filled with love to men¦, and we pray for them.
In the Philippian gaol the apostle and his companion were marked by prayer and praise (@Acts 16: 25)! Stephen prayed as his murderers battered him with stones (@Acts 7: 59)! *We* are exhorted to pray -- to pray for all men; for in this way God's heart and attitude towards man will be manifested. He desires all to be saved. Do we? Are we concerned for every one -- for all men? We stand between the living and the dead! The character of God is to be seen in us, for we are His house. A prayerful interest in man is the first manner in which
¦See also @Titus 3: 4, "love to man", and footnote a.
{23}
this becomes evident.
Moreover, *Christ's* position is declared. He is the Mediator (@1 Timothy 2: 5). We do not pray unintelligently. We are in the light of what has been accomplished. God and man have met in the Person of the Mediator. Presently the testimony will be of power; now it is of grace.
But not only is prayer to mark God's house in a general way, it is especially to mark *men*. This is the proper position of man. Men are to be characterised by prayer, by dependence. Men like to be independent. But to be truly dependent on God is the most morally exalted position a man can possibly be in. Women are exhorted to be in due subjection and to be marked by good works.
(3) We next find the two *offices* in God's assembly alluded to, so that there might be godly care and order. The elder or "overseer" was one who exercised oversight and sought the spiritual good of those in the assembly (@1 Timothy 3: 1 - 7). It was a simple matter in early days to recognise the elders of an assembly, for the church was one. But it was evidently not the mind of God to continue these offices in a merely formal way. No elder was told to ordain other elders. Apostolic succession is merely a human idea. No such thing is suggested in Scripture, and it was never intended to exist in fact. Titus was to ordain elders as an apostolic delegate (@Titus 1: 5); and the apostles themselves ordained them (@Acts 14: 23).
But why, then, are we given such detailed
{24}
instructions in 1 Timothy and Titus? The reason is plain. We are told the characteristics so that we may recognise those who possess them and honour such; then, too, those who seek to take care of the assembly should be exercised that these qualities and traits may mark them. God knew that departure would come in almost at once, in the apostles¬ days, and hence gave the characteristics of those who would truly seek to take care of the church.
The deacon, or minister, was to be occupied with the temporal cares of those in the assembly (@1 Timothy 3: 8 - 13). Deacons are first alluded to in @Acts 6.
It is very interesting to note the comprehensive character of these two offices. They were not "gifts", but offices of a purely *local* nature. The one sought the spiritual good, and the other ministered to the temporal needs of those in the assembly¦.
May God give every one who seeks to serve Him in either of these ways to see that he possesses the qualifications, and may we all be more ready to recognise such and render them honour.
After giving these instructions the apostle states
¦It must be carefully observed, that while an elder had the oversight of an assembly, he in no sense assumed a distinctive priestly position. To have done so would have been to have committed the sin of Korah (@Numbers 16) - a servant assuming priesthood. Has not this been done? How can any servant, however gifted, assume to arrange or conduct worship? It is a slight on Christ, the great Priest over God’s house.
{25}
the object of his epistle (@1 Timothy 3: 15). It was that Timothy might know how to behave in God's house.
It is thus evident that the first three chapters give to us the formal outline of that which should mark the house of God. The church is the pillar and base of the truth. It is to be the practical witness to the truth, to that which came out in Christ. Chapter 1 brought before us the *moral* qualities necessary to all who compose God's house; in chapter 2 we have the attitude of God as Saviour set forth in the saints; and chapter 3 gives us what should mark those in the offices which existed (in normal circumstances) for the well-being of an assembly.
"Mysteries" were usually associated with temples and shrines in heathen Ephesus. But the "mystery of piety" (@1 Timothy 3: 16) was that which was enshrined in God's house. "*God* has been manifested", etc. We do not understand this to refer to what is essential to Deity. Such, in fact, has not been manifested and still remains inscrutable. What is here referred to and stated is the mystery of piety, or godliness. That is what is of God revealed in a Man here on earth and having its answer in glory.
We shall not be surprised to find that Satan was determined to corrupt, if he could not destroy, such a witness to what is according to God. The Spirit of God expressly taught that departure would take place, and such has come to pass.
But what is to be the reply to this departure? Controversy? Dogma? No! Only that which was to have been the abiding testimony -- *godliness*. That
{26}
which is according to God, maintained in our lives here, is an unanswerable reply and a standing rebuke to all departure. Theological disputes have not the living character about them that is possessed by a life bearing the traits of Christ!
Details of a practical kind are referred to, but the key word of all is *piety*.
Oh! for piety -- practical, living, daily Christianity. A slave can beautify his pathway in this manner, and none of us have a calling quite like that today. We can, we ought, all to show piety. The name of God and His doctrine are at stake.
Men of the world are after money. Self, in some way or other, is the ruling influence. The believer is called to godliness, and godliness, with contentment, is great gain. Christ is his power, and the life of Jesus that which is to be seen in him daily.

GOD'S PURPOSE AND OUR RESPONSE
F. Ide
@Genesis 12; @Genesis 13: 14 - 18; @John 3: 35 - 36
I read these scriptures, beloved brethren, with the thought that they might help to steady us, and, maybe, adjust us, in regard to our movements here. I suppose we would all agree that we have been taken up -- called of God -- so that we might find ourselves here in accord with all His thoughts and purposes, available to Him that He might fulfil His eternal desires in regard to us; and, being available to Him as we move through this scene, there is satisfaction
{27}
and joy for His own heart.
There is a tendency for us to stop short; we may think of being divinely taken up as being merely for ourselves, that we should be freed from all that rested upon us; but the more we look into it, taking into account types from Genesis onwards, we shall find that in all God's dealings in relation to men, every provision made for them, is that they might be available to Him for His satisfaction and joy. Before man had any thoughts at all, God purposed to bring him into being; to set him up on the earth, a scene got ready, suitable for him, that he might be here wholly for the pleasure of God. Man fell; but God was not defeated in His eternal thoughts, but showed that He could secure His desires in relation to men. This involved the death of His beloved Son.
I read this scripture with regard to Abraham, because I think it will exercise us, and adjust us, that we may be kept steady in the path of faith. Abraham stands out as one who had a special place with God; in fact, he is the first one to whom God indicated what His purpose of blessing was for men. In connection with Eve and Noah, God showed that man could be recovered; but to Abraham He disclosed His purpose for men. How necessary it is for us to be established in regard to God's purpose for us. What I mean is, that we should see there is something *more* needed for us than to be merely moving here as having links with God, on the side of what is pious. We shall see, I trust, that it is necessary for us to have our desires and hearts fixed
{28}
in regard to that which is spiritual and eternal.
We find Abraham here as one called of God, told to go out of his country, etc., and to move into that land which God would show him. Abraham moved in faith, he left his country; he made a move in accordance with God's purposes for him; God disclosed His mind with regard to him, gave him light as to the position, and Abraham moved in relation to it. What one was struck with in reading the scripture is that Abraham was impressed, as we often speak, only in an objective way; he followed up in faith what God had presented, he moved into the land and set up an altar -- he committed himself wholly to the position; but what is seen is that Abraham *passed on* -- it was not a question of *abiding in* the land, he moved through it. He took account of all God's purposes for him, as far as light was concerned; but what comes after is this, that although he was severed from all that held him previously, he *moved* on southward -- he was not wholly occupied with that which God had presented to him.
How many of us talk about the purpose of God? The apostle Paul had two prayers on behalf of the Ephesian saints; first it was that they might be brought to view objectively that which was in accord with God's purpose, including the wonderful position which God had purposed for the saints (chapter 1: 15 - 23). But his second prayer (chapter 3: 14 - 19) was that there might be that produced and formed in them which would answer to it, that they might be
{29}
able not only to take an objective view, but also to take account of it all -- "the breadth and length and depth and height". It is viewed, I take it, from the One, and in the presence of the One, who was the Centre of it. It was only as they were formed in the love of Christ that they could be equal to the wondrous sphere of blessing which God had purposed, and which they had observed from the objective standpoint; so that everything might be filled out in the assembly, in which the glory of the blessed God is to be eternally.
Now that is what one is endeavouring to show in regard to Abraham. You see the necessity. We often have the things in the way of light and talk about purpose, of things we look forward to, all eternally established on the basis of the blood-shedding of Christ; but how much are we entering into it at the present moment, how much are we formed by it as those who live in it, those that form that wondrous company, that vessel that had been purposed in eternity? How much are we available in regard to it, so that there is going up to the blessed God, even now, that which is for His satisfaction and joy?
The mere knowledge that we are set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus is not sufficient to keep us. God told Abraham all that He had purposed for him, and, in fact, Abraham entered into it in some measure, he put his hand to it and set up an altar twice (@Genesis 12: 7, 8).
But Abraham passed through the land, and where did he go? He found himself in Egypt, he went *down*
{30}
to Egypt; that is, beloved, he left all the moral height and privilege, that of which he had the light; he had not got his heart sufficiently set upon it. He went *down*, and found himself in Egypt. What a serious thing it was! We would not disparage Abraham, for God has recorded that He delighted in His servant; but we may see in an example like this, how we may be preserved, that we might not find ourselves like Abraham, with all the light of the purpose of God for him, and yet in Egypt.

A WORD TO THOSE WHO SERVE
F. S. Marsh
It is earnestly desired to encourage young brothers and sisters who would serve the Lord in any capacity.
Many of the tasks in the Lord's service might be esteemed as commonplace, but it is stimulating to have in mind, in every detail, that "ye serve the Lord Christ" (@Colossians 3: 24) which implies THE DIGNITY OF SERVICE -- a dignity which, if realised, would stir deeply the spirit of the servant. The title LORD implies His authority over, and His affection for, His servants, involving our subjection to Him in every detail of the work; the title CHRIST tells of the anointed Head of the glorious service of God, all of which is to be rendered in the power of the anointing of the Holy Spirit of God.
The task may be menial in the eyes of men, but it
{31}
is glorified by its being a part of that system of glory and it is to be carried through as being rendered to Christ.
Elisha, was content to pour water upon the hands of Elijah (@2 Kings 3: 11), but the manner in which he carried out that lowly service (usually the task of a menial slave) secured such promotion for him that it could be said of him that "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha" (@2 Kings 2: 15).
There is also the word, "By love serve one another" (@Galatians 5: 13), and this is THE SPRING OF SERVICE.
What can be acceptable if it does not spring from love? The Lord Jesus Himself was the Antitype of the Hebrew servant who said "I love" (@Exodus 21: 5), and this is the secret of every true sacrificial service. "Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another" (@1 John 4: 11). Love finds expression in service. How the Lord Jesus has served His assembly in love!
The voluntary character of any service expresses that you are prepared by love to serve your brethren. Let this encourage you that even if you are called upon to "serve tables" the word says, "he that in this serves the Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men" (@Romans 14: 18).
There is, however, a spiritual condition essential for acceptable service. Hence the prophet Isaiah says, "be ye clean, that bear the vessels of Jehovah" (chapter 52: 11). It is holy hands that are lifted up and serve. It is sanctified vessels that are needed,
{32}
"serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" (@2 Timothy 2: 21). The vessels are holy and it requires holiness on the part of those who are called to serve the "holy brethren".
It is the service of God who is holy; sustained by the Lord Jesus, the Holy One empowered by the Holy Spirit of God, and guided by the precepts of the Holy Scriptures. It is THE HOLINESS OF SERVICE which makes it so great, and yet so solemn, to have even the smallest part in such a service. May the Lord help us to be consistent with it!
One thought more, prompted by the word "Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as doing it to the Lord, and not to men" (@Colossians 3: 23). This urges THE ENERGY OF SERVICE. You will be called upon to expend much energy if you go forth to serve the Lord, but the exhortation is: "take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" (@2 Timothy 2: 3). Not only is willing obedience necessary, but an alacrity, a readiness of mind, a spirit of sacrifice, that the one who serves may not "faint in well-doing" (@2 Thessalonians 3: 13). Thus will every service go up to God as a sweet savour of Christ -- God's perfect Servant.

DIVINE RESERVES
R. Gray
@Luke 10: 33 - 35; @1 Kings 19: 9 - 18; @Judges 15: 18 - 20; @Malachi 3: 8 - 11, 16 - 18
What is in mind, beloved brethren, is to speak, with the help of the Holy Spirit, of divine reserves, the provision God has made in view of the maintenance of the testimony. But these scriptures speak of what is special; they refer to what is additional in the way of resource that God brings in, in order to meet need as it arises. God has committed Himself to the continuance of the testimony according to the standards that marked it when He set it on, and these scriptures, I trust, will serve to bring that out.
In our first scripture, @Luke 10, much was available already. There was the oil and the wine, the Samaritan himself, of course, and his beast, the inn, and the innkeeper, and there were the two pence (denarii). We might say that was a very full and complete provision in view of every need being met. But what I want to dwell on for a moment is what the Samaritan said: "Take care of him, and what-soever thou shalt expend more". Now, I believe that bears very much on the present time. We might say, Is there not sufficient in these resources that we have gone over? Christ is suggested in the Samaritan, and there are suggestions as to the activities of the Holy Spirit in the innkeeper, and the thought of the assembly is implied in the inn. All these things were present. What the Spirit of God would bring out, however, is that always with the blessed God there is
{34}
something additional in reserve to meet the special needs of the moment. I believe that should be an encouragement to us.
The idea of holding things in reserve is not a new one with God. He spoke of it to Job, saying, "Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail, which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?" (@Job 38: 22, 23). God has great reserves, held in abeyance at the moment, in view of judgment. But that is not my theme. The thought is that God has in His mind and heart just what is needed to meet the current conditions in the testimony.
I believe that this is important, because there is no doubt that there is a side of things which today might well cause depression and even doubt. Not that we doubt the blessed God -- never! But still, we might be concerned as to how the testimony will work out. How will our children be preserved, what is there for them? Well, there is the fulness of the blessing that is offered in the glad tidings; there is the fulness of God's thoughts in privilege for all His own in the light of what we have and hold as to Christ and the assembly; there is the divine favour of sonship, and so on. God is honoured when persons apprehend these things and take them up, and fill them out in the power of the Holy Spirit. But we should be encouraged as we understand that there are divine provisions that are specially made available to maintain saints in the good of these
{35}
things in a dark day.
I go on now to @1 Kings 19, because here we have Elijah, a great servant of God's. He was one of those who was greatly honoured by appearing on the mount with Christ (@Matthew 17: 3, etc). But in the pass-age read, he was, we might say, in extremity. Elijah was a remarkable man; he was, to use a simple expression, one we might look on as 'a tower of strength'; one who was well founded in the truth, who served God fearlessly, and was committed entirely to divine interests. But he came to a point when it says, "he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness ... and requested for himself that he might die" (@1 Kings 19: 4). What he was saying was, I cannot go on. Now we might wonder at such a one as Elijah giving such an impression. But the Spirit of God in His faithfulness and wisdom has recorded it for us, that such a one as he, and with his knowledge of God, and his record of successful service, came to the point when he "requested for himself that he might die". He was not complaining about the testimony; he was not speaking against God in any sense; but he had come, as he thought, to the end of his resources.
Well, God meets that. What a gracious God we have to do with, who would take us up and sustain us in the testimony, passing us through tests as He sees fit, as it is His sovereign right to do, and yet sustaining us. Think of how the blessed God condescended to meet the exercises of this devoted servant: "and behold, at his head was a cake, baked
{36}
on hot stones, and a cruse of water" (@1 Kings 19: 6) -- what a service: God, through His angelic agency, served the needs of His servant! The blessed God calculated in His care exactly what was needed. Elijah, it says, "ate and drank, and lay down again. And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, eat; for the journey is too great for thee" (verses 6, 7). How divine love and consideration calculates what we need, and encourages us to take it up! Well, he "went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights ... and went into a cave". You see, God took him up, just as he was, and supplied what was needed.
But there were further lessons to learn. God showed Elijah that the methods that he might have chosen to use were not God's methods. It speaks of the "strong wind", the "earthquake", and the "fire". Now, these might have been considered to be suitable agencies to deal with a rebellious people who were seeking Elijah's life. God passed them all before him, saying, as it were, That is not how I am working. Then it says, "And after the fire, a soft gentle voice". I believe that God would say to Elijah, I am not changing the way I operate in regard of My people, even in the light of their state. This was a speaking of grace. I know Elisha fills that side out more fully. But here it was, the "soft gentle voice", and God says, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" -- why are you here? What a test this would be.
I read an interesting remark recently where the author believed that the standards of judgment at the
{37}
judgment-seat (@Romans 14: 10; @2 Corinthians 5: 10) were the standards that were set out in the gospels; that is, what was seen here in Christ, the standards that He operated by, were the standards we would meet at the judgment-seat. In a sense, Elijah was at the judgment-seat; God was asking him, "What doest thou here?". Well, sometimes we are asked a question like that; God would speak to us and ask us to give an account of ourselves. That will be so at the judgment-seat. We will then be in our bodies of glory, of course.
I was very interested recently in Paul's remark as to Onesiphorus: "the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord in that day" (@2 Timothy 1: 18). What day was that? Another has suggested that will be the day when Onesiphorus has to do with the Lord at the judgment-seat; and he added, it would appear that the matter of mercy goes on as far as the judgment-seat. I am saying these things because I feel that all of us have been searched in recent times by the Lord as to what our real motives are -- all of us. We can look at others and point to others, but there will be no one else to point to at the judgment-seat. And I believe Elijah was going through something like that here; God was testing him, and Elijah answered in an open and manly way, spreading out his exercises before God.
Well, God listened to what Elijah had to say, and then He said, "Go". That would be a word for us, I believe: Go on! Elijah had felt like giving up, and God was saying, as it were, Go on, there is work to
{38}
be done. And, in the detail that He gives as to Hazael and Jehu and Elisha, I believe God was reassuring Elijah that there was no detail of the testimony but what He had His eye on; He was in control of it. God in effect said to Elijah, Be at peace; I have My hand on every aspect of the testimony -- nothing has escaped Me, nothing is being overlooked -- and I have made provision for it. He said, "Go". And then God added a very solemn word about the sword of Hazael, Jehu, Elisha. What God was saying, I believe, was, Not only do I have My hand on every aspect of the testimony, but My government is running on unfailingly; nothing is being overlooked. For myself, I fear that, because there may be but a few brethren in my locality, in my mind there might be, almost unconsciously, a lowering of standards. We must not think that God is allowing the testimony to fade out. No such thing. God has His hand on every aspect of the testimony and His government runs on unfailingly, it misses nothing, and it deals with everything in its own time (see @Ezekiel 10: 12).
God concludes His conversation with Elijah and says, "Yet" -- what a comforting word this is -- "I have left myself seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him". What God was saying was, I still have seven thousand true hearts, persons of uncontaminated affection. How many? - seven thousand, not six and a half thousand. A full representation of what would speak to us of the
{39}
assembly. God says, I have those for Myself. It was not a question of man's service or man's efforts with the seven thousand, rather that God had reserved them for Himself. God will maintain what is due to Himself and for Himself. Our desire should be to have our part in it, if it be His will.
In @Judges 15 we have another resource spoken of. Samson had secured a most remarkable victory with the "fresh jawbone of an ass" (verses 15, 16). We have records on our bookshelves of past conflicts for the truth, but they are completed. What now? Well, we need to be marked by an overcoming spirit today. How can we be if, like Samson, we are thirsty, and if there is not available to us refreshment as it is needed? It says, "God clave the hollow rock which was in Lehi, and water came out of it". I do not suppose any one knew about that before. But what I see in it is this, that God would have us to understand that the Spirit came after Christ had suffered and gone on high.
I believe God would remind us of the preciousness of what Christ has done, and of the preciousness of the gift of the Spirit. He would bring into our souls a fresh impression that is suited to the present phase of the testimony. I think in the light of these things we should be distinctly encouraged, because it says that Samson "drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day". En-hakkore means, 'the caller's spring' (footnote c). Maybe we are needing to learn more and more to
{40}
call on the Holy Spirit. As we go through our lives in this world, contaminated as it is, and we meet with difficulties and problems, let us call on Him, the Caller's Spring. What a service divine Persons render to us! Christ was the water Carrier as we have been taught, for the Rock that followed them was the Christ (@1 Corinthians 10: 4). Here we have the Spirit of God as a means of instant succour, of instant help whatever the difficulty. When temptations arise -- who of us does not have them? -- what do you do? Call on the Spirit. What is in view is the continuance of the testimony, and it says that Samson "judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years".
In @Malachi 3 we have the thought as to "the whole tithe". What is really in mind in the way of divine reserves here is the blessing which is poured out from the windows of the heavens. It says, "Will a man rob God? But ye rob me. And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee? In tithes and heave-offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse". Well, that is strong language. We might say, Does it apply to me? These are the questions we need to ask ourselves sometimes. I am not suggesting the matter of curse applies to the saints, but would I rob God? Would I give Him short measure? You see there may be the tendency with us, when we get a little older, to take things easier. Well, this question would come up, "Will a man rob God?" You see, when Paul wrote to the Galatians, he evidently had a difficult task, as the scripture would show, and he had to use quite strong language to them. He did not go over the truth with
{41}
the Galatians as he did with the Corinthians. To the Corinthians Paul set out the teaching as to the word of the cross in considerable detail. What he said to the Galatians, on the other hand, was very short and very severe: "Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree" (@Galatians 3: 13). Paul used such language, I believe, to awaken the Galatians to the fact that they were trifling with things that were of infinite value. Well, I am not, as remarked, charging the brethren at all, but just having a desire that we might be stimulated to bring to God all that is due to Him in these difficult days.
But God has something special for these conditions. He says, "prove me now herewith ... if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it". No doubt, God has something special for the present time, but He is ready and willing to pour it out. He not only promises the blessing, but He adds something: "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time".
Well, these are things to be treasured. I will just close with a remark on the final section read: "they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure". We have spoken about God's reserves, what He has
{42}
specially in reserve to maintain the testimony. What a fine thing it would be if there was something special that the blessed God received from us in return, out of the present circumstances! "They shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him". What else? "And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not". God, along with the blessing that He has promised, would grant this blessing also, that His standards will be maintained amongst the saints at the level at which they were set on in the first place. Discernment and judgment are things to be maintained.
Well, that was all one had in mind. May the Lord encourage us with the sense that there are reserves available to see us through in the light of His thoughts and purpose for us, and may there be a suited answer from each one of us, for His Name's sake.

FELLOWSHIP
W.R. Mason
@Acts 2: 42 - 47; @Acts 4: 32 - 35; @1 Corinthians 1: 9; @1 John 1: 5 - 7
I have often thought of 1 Corinthians as like the woman in @Luke 15 who lost the coin and who, when she went to seek it, lit a lamp and swept the house
{43}
carefully until she found it. I think that is like Paul in 1 Corinthians. He lights a lamp here in these first nine verses as to their calling, and he brings light to shine on the local situation there. Then chapter after chapter he goes through the house sweeping in every corner, dealing with all their problems. What a lot of dust was removed! When you come to the second epistle you can see that not only was the coin found but the house was cleaned in the process. The coin is found, so, "assure him of your love" (@2 Corinthians 2: 8); 'Get him back into circulation'. The house is much cleaner, and Paul can open up the great things of Christianity there.
Here Paul draws attention to the fellowship into which they were called by God, and this is true of every Christian. God has called us by the glad tidings into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This Person is the Head and the Centre of it; He gives character and dignity to it. What greater fellowship could there be? And how could we really belong to any other, once we are called into this fellowship? Every fellowship of man is beneath the dignity of the members of the fellowship of God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. How beautiful it is! Every believer, if he has the Holy Spirit, is called into this and belongs to it. Whether he is enjoying it is another question, but it is his in title and it is his by calling. He did not work for it, he did not invite himself into it. Let us hold that in the faith of our souls for all our brethren; all the saints of God are called into this dignified, glorious fellowship. It is
{44}
theirs by divine giving and divine calling. How to get the good of it is the exercise. I think that is where John helps us.
Paul later speaks of this as the fellowship of Christ's death and shows how it will be kept pure as we are in line with the death of Christ and disallow those things that Jesus died to put away. Then the fellowship will be kept uncorrupted. It is the fellowship of His body -- "Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body" (@1 Corinthians 10: 17) -- bringing out the organic character of it, speaking to us of love and life and holy sentiments. Then it is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit; He is the One who energises it, gives life and meaning to it, and keeps it in its integrity for our enjoyment. This is a spiritual fellowship. The outward association of saints has been broken up, but the fellowship of God's Son remains, and that is what He calls men into.
In the passage we read in @1 John 1, John shows how we can get the practical realisation of it, and he makes it very simple, too. We have often remarked that John is unofficial; he writes in this epistle as a father to his children. He says, "I write to you, children" (@1 John 2: 12). "Children, keep yourselves from idols" is how he finishes (@1 John 5: 21). He addresses a letter to the "elect lady" and another to the "beloved Gaius". He leaves the official side in the background, and yet he was as much an apostle of Christ as any one of the twelve. He says, "And this is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you". He had a message direct from
{45}
the lips of Christ when He told him that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all". That is the character and nature of God who is light, "in him is no darkness at all". "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him" (@1 John 4: 16). What a word for us in a day of departure! "If what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal" (@1 John 2: 24, 25).
Now John says, "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth". John is a most loving man; he was formed in love, he knew what it was to be in the bosom of Jesus (@John 13: 23); but he uses very direct language to give us a jolt as to the realities that we have to face. John was meeting professors, persons who had been once amongst the saints and went out: "They went out from among us, but they were not of us" (@1 John 2: 19). They had "got in unnoticed" (@Jude 4). Peter speaks of those who brought in destructive heresies (@2 Peter 2: 1).
John says, "If we say that we have fellowship with him" -- that is our profession; people may say that -- "and walk in darkness, we lie". That is strong language. You see, he is comparing things; John would say, 'We must check up'. The Lord said, "By their fruits ye shall know them" (@Matthew 7: 16). Here John says, "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth".
{46}
In the next chapter John brings out the matter of hating your brother: "he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes" (@1 John 2: 11). That shows how we must judge hatred of any Christian. We cannot possibly hate a Christian and walk in the light. One cannot be marked by hatred for any of God's family and be clear about his pathway, or even about the doctrine, "because the darkness has blinded his eyes". Such will not see things rightly. We will not express the truth if we hate anyone who is of the family of God. Indeed, we should not hate any man. "Love your enemies", the Lord said, "... pray for those who use you despitefully" (@Luke 6: 27, 28). You have to hate sin, hate evil, hate the garment spotted by the flesh, but do not hate people. No matter what they do to you, do not hate them. Jesus kept on loving, did He not? Looking on the young man who wanted to enjoy eternal life with his wealth, but who was not prepared to sacrifice and become a disciple, Jesus loved him. That man went away sad, for he had large possessions (@Mark 10: 22).
The apostle Paul was hated. Jesus said, "Ye shall be hated of all on account of my name" (@Matthew 10: 22). Even Paul was less loved, yet he abundantly loved them (@2 Corinthians 12: 15). Hatred is a malicious thing, but it is petty. It only brings out the smallness of a person; one who cannot rise above a wrong-doing, an injustice, an injury. One who is enjoying the purpose of God and the love of God
{47}
can rise above all these things. Mephibosheth said of Ziba, "Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house" (@2 Samuel 19: 30). In type, he just wanted Christ to have first place in all things, and nothing that anybody did to him was a worry to him. As long as David was back in full control, Mephibosheth was glad. He was not worried by what Ziba or anyone else did.
That is the way we want to be, beloved brethren. We want to be so happy in the Lord and the things of the Lord that injuries, wrongs and injustices are all put aside; you will not worry about them; you will go on loving people, shining on them. If they turn their backs, you will just shine on their backs. God acts like that to us. If God had hated me after I had gone out of dozens of gospel meetings unbelieving, where would I be today? I would still be on the way to hell. But God kept on and shone on my back; He will shine on your back, dear brother, dear sister. He loved you in spite of your neglect of Him. We often sing,
<blockquote>'Yet with love unchanged by cold neglect <br>He is seeking you again' (`439:3). </blockquote>
That is the way He keeps on.
Now we are to be like that; we are to be children of God, and to "set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light" (@1 Peter 2: 9). Beloved brethren, if we are in that light, let us walk in the light, practising the truth and not deceiving ourselves. If we say we have no sin, John says, we are only deceiving ourselves; the
{48}
truth is not in us. Let the truth into us and it will expose what we really are. I know if we look into our hearts, what a lot of wickedness we see there. They will be that way until we die or until the Lord comes and changes our bodies. Thank God that evil heart does not have to dominate you; that is the flesh. You have the Spirit now in charge. You walk in the Spirit and the old man is suppressed and rendered inactive. You are characterised now by the new man: "having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (@Ephesians 4: 24).
So John says, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another". Is that not beautiful? You do not have to apply for it, you do not have to suppose it is there. If you walk in the light as God is in the light, you have it; it is there right away. You feel an affinity with somebody else who is walking in the light as you are walking in the light; you walk together agreed, you are one. The thing is a divine operation; the Spirit fits you in. I believe that is very much how we find fellowship practically in these last days. Of course, you must be self-judged; you must be clear of selfish motives or anything corrupt in your mind; place-seeking or anything like that must go. You must be really desirous of pleasing the Lord and being for Him, calling on Him out of a pure heart, and I think you will find an affinity with others like-minded. It is largely by a sense of affinities that we find our way in this day of confusion. You can find agreement
{49}
with others who are thinking as you do, who are following the same principles under the Lord. Two walk together because they are agreed. "Two are better than one ... For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow ... And if a man overpower the one, the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken" (@Ecclesiastes 4: 9 - 12). That brings out the value of fellowship.
Well, here we arrive at it through our walk, not through our knowledge or whether we have read so many books of ministry. Many of these books are bought, but are they read? We want to get the truth into our hearts so that we are formed by it, and get clear of mere formality into real unity, dear brethren. We are to walk in the light. God is in the light; He has come out in Christ in full display; His heart has been laid bare; His character has been made known and the holiness, the truth, the grace and the patience that marked Him. What a combination of beautiful features are seen in God in revelation! That is the light in which we are to walk, and we are to walk as Jesus walked.
We need to be characterised by those features which He displayed so beautifully and attractively. Walk in that light, dear brethren, and if you find others doing the same, you immediately have affinity and fellowship with them. If you made a mistake, as you may do, if you sin, as you may do, "the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin". The blood is always there. Do not be afraid. Sometimes young people think when they err and do
{50}
wrong, giving way to Satan, that all is up, that they have lost their salvation. No, they have only lost their peace and their joy. You never lose your salvation, because it is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. It is fixed there in the heavens. Your salvation does not depend on you; it is held by Jesus for you. He is our Saviour from the coming wrath. You lose your joy and peace when you sin; Jesus is the Advocate, interceding for you that they might be restored to you again, that you might judge yourself, finding that all-efficacious blood ever available to cleanse you from all sin.
Thus the fellowship is protected; it is kept clean and pure; and, beloved brethren, I think we know a little of this. Even if it has been greatly reduced in latter years as to our experience, nevertheless the reality of it is still there, and a more lovely thing you could not find on earth. Some of us have had our whole being renewed in recent years in recapturing the blessedness of fellowship in the light in the last days. That is what God intended it to be, a holy, happy fellowship where we can walk together in the light of God in revelation, where we can enjoy eternal things as God intends them to be enjoyed, where we can enter into eternal life, and speak about and enjoy heavenly things. We can build up, nourish, edify and comfort one another. Oh! what a real thing fellowship is.
Fellowship with one another means that you value the personnel; every one is precious to you. You are set to be for their good. You would never
{51}
think of tripping up or undermining anyone in this fellowship. They are all set for one another because they are in partnership, a going concern in Christianity in the last days. It is a wonderful partnership. Paul said to Philemon, "If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner with thee" (verse 17). That put him on his mettle, did it not? 'Are you a partner with me, Philemon? You know the way I work; you know the way I do things; you will have to adhere to the terms of the partnership, be marked by generosity, liberality and self-sacrifice'. That was Paul's life.
So this is the fellowship that God would have us enjoy in these closing days, beloved brethren. It is a great reality. One would encourage each one of us to look out for it and to walk in the light. You will find you have it; your brother, your sister is doing the same thing. You feel an affinity; you feel a sense of unity there; it is a living order of things.
Well, these are just a few thoughts which came to one's mind. I trust that the Spirit will put them in order in our souls so that we might have a better understanding of what God has called us to, and that we may seek the reality and power of it in these days, for His Name's sake!

AGUR'S REFLECTIONS
P. Lyon
@Proverbs 30: 1 - 4, 18 - 20
I have in mind, dear brethren, to follow up the inquiry of Agur as leading up to four things which he describes as too wonderful for him, for I believe they may be taken to illustrate certain features of the truth discernible in our day.
Agur's name means 'a gatherer', that is to say, he is not a man with mere academic questions; he seeks a divine answer to his inquiries. He has in his search an eye for gold; he is a noble Berean in that way (@Acts 17: 11). And then he finds others with whom to pursue his inquiries. Ithiel is said to mean 'God is', and Ucal, 'God will prevail'. You can well understand that persons marked by the faith implied in the names of these men will furnish the suited atmosphere for the unfolding of the mind of God through prophetic channels as indicated in @1 Corinthians 14. So that, as in that chapter, the man coming in will own "that God is among you of a truth" (verse 25). Agur is content to unfold what he has gathered to two persons, and God helps him; for we are moving on figuratively towards the crowning issue of all true ministry, namely Christ and the assembly, as suggested in the husband and his wife, the virtuous woman, of the next chapter.
Agur pursues his inquiry in lowly and comely feelings; "Truly *I* am more stupid than any one; and I have not a man's intelligence. I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the
{53}
Holy". How wholesome are these sentiments, for if we are lacking in this essential feature of humility we shall be equally bereft of the substance God delights to give to the humble. To such a one taking thus his place in the lowest room, the Lord would say, as in Luke, "Friend, go up higher" (chapter 14: 10). Such a spirit of acknowledged weakness, seen also in Paul as weak among the Corinthians, is calculated to awaken inquiry and support with those who are of the generation of faith, and thus the very lowliness of this speaker but invites the greater attention, on the part of those of kindred mind, to the wealth which he has gathered. Such are not slow to detect the divine credentials found with a true servant of the Lord, who is marked by the meek and lowly spirit of his Master. Thus Agur, and those with him, may be likened to the element of temple inquiry in which alone we get divine help as we look into the truth together.
We come now to verse 4: "Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended?" This would refer to the Lord Jesus. He ascended far above all heavens to fill all things. He has gone up in the majesty and dignity of His Person. He has ascended, but He also descended. In what love He went up, but then in what love He went down, even into death and into the lower parts of the earth, in that dignity which alone could be His as He went forth bearing His cross!
Then we read, "Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?" The wind in this scripture no doubt would
{54}
refer to the power of the enemy, but then, what power there is with the Lord! The enemy raises storms, but in His fists the Lord holds the winds. This is exemplified on the Lake of Galilee when He said "Peace, be still" (@Mark 4: 39, Authorised Version), and there was a great calm. Then again how the Lord in His death bound the waters of death in a garment! Also it says, "Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?" You can well see that there is a veiled reference here to God's great operations of divine love and power universally, as given effect to by the Son of His love -- His going up in majesty and dignity, His coming down in infinite love, and the power now that is His in regard to the winds blowing against His people. He has bound the waters in a garment, the garment conveying the thought of the Lord in manhood, having the mastery over death, as binding its waters. How engaging are His movements among us in this character on the first day of the week!
How various are the features in this chapter which come under the thoughtful consideration of this inquirer! He is an observer marked by the knowledge born of reflection, and thus given to spiritual thoughtfulness. His audience may be small numerically, because what is casual and superficial easily catches the popular ear, while the depth of feeling which attaches to spiritual thoughtfulness is at a discount in Christendom. This but adds value to the presence of those two listeners, challenging us as
{55}
they do as to whether we are of their company. If there are two of such the Lord may be pleased to add more, and we would covet to be among them. How necessary is this spirit of discernment between good or evil if we are to have our living part, as in the next chapter, in the understanding and pursuit of what is good as seen in the virtuous woman, who, as commanding the confidence of her husband, does him good and not evil all the days of her life!
Think of the value, too, in heaven's sight, of a life devoted to doing good to the Lord Jesus. Perhaps one here may say, 'I set aside the Lord's Day wherein to do the Lord good', but which of our few and brief remaining days can we afford to let pass devoid of this service of love to Him? Let us give Him daily something positive and refreshing to His heart and the heart of the blessed God. Then we shall not lack in serving love to others.
In regard to the second scripture, Agur comes to what is too wonderful for him. He has under-standing, but now he comes to something that is beyond him; and there is a reason for that, for he belongs to an earlier economy, and has not the knowledge of who this wonderful Person is. John, although emphasising the inscrutability of the Person, presents Him in the first chapter of his gospel as the Word become flesh. And then he presents Him as the ascending One in the twentieth chapter, and as the descending One in those wonderful chapters 13 to 18, treading love's glorious way into death.
{56}
John's ministry, as that of the other apostles also, would enable us to see that these things are not too wonderful for us; wonderful they are, but not too wonderful; that is, as having the Spirit indwelling us in liberty, we have some understanding of what this means. The Lord would not make things easy to the spiritual inquirer, for He intends to promote with him diligent search as with those of old at Berea, who thus acquired nobility in the view of heaven (@Acts 17: 11). "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing" (@Proverbs 25: 2). There is what has come to us in the simplicity of the Gospel, but then love is tested in following up matters in thoughtful and diligent temple inquiry and appropriation.

GOD'S PURPOSE AND OUR RESPONSE
F. Ide
@Genesis 12; @Genesis 13: 14 - 18; @John 3: 35 - 36
The first thing Abraham did in Egypt was to deny his relation to his wife; she was to be his sister. We are powerless as in the world to render testimony as to the assembly; though we have a great interest in the preaching of the gospel, yet have no room for the assembly, no delight in the great vessel of purpose. Why is this? They can preach the gospel, they have committed themselves up to a point, but they have no room for the assembly. There is no place in Egypt for it. If you are in Egypt, you cannot give any testimony, any expression, in regard to that into
{57}
which God has brought us in relation to His purpose.
So it was with Abraham. He found himself in Egypt, and denied his wife. Pharaoh came in -- God in His government overruling things, intervening. God will have His servant preserved according to what He has purposed, so He comes in. How is Abraham recovered? He owns his wife. Pharaoh comes to him and says, What have you been doing, why did you disavow that she was your wife? He admits it; that is the point of recovery. The result is that Pharaoh says, "take her, and go away". What a deliverance! His relation to Sarah meant his preservation, and he found himself back in that which was in accord with the purpose of God.
Do we own our relation in regard to the assembly, that wondrous vessel of purpose? Are we known as those who have living links with it? If so it means preservation from the world, deliverance from it. Pharaoh says, Take your wife, and go away. What a deliverance, as I said, that Abraham might again take up and enter into that which was in accord with God's purpose for him; it goes on to say in the thirteenth chapter that Abraham was back in Canaan. What are your links in regard to the assembly? Every one who has a link with Christ forms part of it. Have you taken up, definitely, your links in relation to it? This includes fellowship. Dear brethren, if you take up your links with that which is in accord with the purpose of the blessed God, there will be no room for you in Egypt.
And so one would speak to young people. You
{58}
may not know much about the purpose of God; but He would have you wholly and practically committed to that of which you form part; if you have a link with Christ, He would have you to take up that link here, practically. It would mean salvation to you, preservation from the world's system, and it would enable you to enter into all the thoughts of God. We find here that Abraham goes back to Bethel, and God comes to him again and tells him to take a view of the land "northward and southward and eastward and westward", to walk through the length and breadth of it.
What a blessed joy it is to enter into the purpose of God! And it was to Abraham, he dwelt in it (chapter 13: 18). There is no question of leaving it now. Abraham's moves onwards from this point were generally in accord with the thoughts of God. God could come to him, He could now visit him and unfold His mind to him, preserving him and honouring him. You will observe the great difference in Lot, who was evidently damaged in Egypt; he preferred the plain of the Jordan, he seemed to think this like the garden of Jehovah, linking it with Egypt (chapter 13: 10). How did he know anything of Egypt? Abraham had taken him down there. What serious consequences and effects often occur because we have not got our hearts set in accordance with the purpose of God, not only with ourselves, but to others, as we see Lot here!
You may ask, How may we be helped to come into these things? I read the verses in @John 3 to this
{59}
end. They convey something of the spiritual feelings and emotions of John. He has been going over, in his gospel, much that transpired with regard to Christ; he has spoken previously of John the Baptist, how he could say, I have heard the Bridegroom's voice, and my joy is full (chapter 3: 29). And, as John the Evangelist goes over it, as he takes account of the movements of that blessed Person, he breaks out, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". His soul was enwrapped with the greatness of that Person; he could see how He stood out in all His blessedness and perfection in regard to the Father. With his heart set upon such a Person, you can understand that a man like John would be preserved; you will not find John moving down into Egypt. Why? Because he is satisfied, he has entered into the thoughts of God, how all was going to be established and brought in by this glorious Person.
John is taking account of all that, and his soul overflows in those spiritual emotions, and you can see he would be preserved as to the purpose of God. He is one who brings in those living affections and emotions which would characterise the wondrous vessel of purpose, the assembly. He was sustained and preserved! Would you like to be kept in regard to all that stands in relation to the purpose of God? You may say, you young people, How can I be? Well, John shows you the way of it. As his soul was absorbed with the Person of Christ, do you think he would be deflected or go astray, and forget all that had come to him as light? Never! What God has
{60}
purposed in eternal love would be brought into effect through the Person of whom John speaks; "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand"! That is the way of love and wisdom, and John was absorbed in Him who could effect all the mind of God and be the Centre of the whole domain of glory.
In Abraham's history you will find from @Genesis 22 that he moved, typically, in the good of resurrection. No turning aside now, for his heart was set upon Isaac, the one who would typify the blessed Person of Christ, the Man out of death, the Man in resurrection, in whom everything was to be established: what was promised to Abraham and established in Isaac. So it is with the Lord Jesus. Our hearts are filled with the knowledge of the love of Christ -- it "surpasses knowledge" (@Ephesians 3: 19). As knowing it, we get some impression of all that He has secured and brought us into it in regard of the purpose of God -- the breadth, length, depth, and height of it -- the expanse of glory you look out upon from the centre. Who is the Centre? That blessed Person, as I said. Have you ever been with Him, known what it is to stand by Him in spirit in His present circumstances, and look out on the expanse of glory, the result of what has been secured according to the purpose of God? If you have, you can speak of the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge. That would hold you.
May the Lord help us to enter into these things *now*, and be formed by them, and have our hearts
{61}
overflowing. The more we understand the blessed-ness and eternal joy of all that has been purposed for us by the blessed God, the more we shall understand the glory and the love of the Lord Jesus Christ, and apprehend His greatness, His pre-eminence, and know the love that surpasses knowledge. We often find ourselves holding the truth merely objectively, as I said, but knowing what it is to have our life connected with the joy God has set before us, and established in Christ, then we shall be able to break out with spiritual emotions, and speak of that wondrous Person, and our hearts shall go out in praise and adoration to the blessed God.

JUDGMENT-SEAT OF GOD AND OF CHRIST¦
J. N. Darby
I am not aware that this expression, "the judgment-seat of God" or "the judgment-seat of Christ", is found anywhere else than in @Romans 14 and @2 Corinthians 5: in the first of these two passages with a view to prevent individual judgments; in the second with a view to provoke to do good.
The subject in itself is one of the most solemn and at the same time most blessed, and this so much the
¦The best editions read in @Romans 14: 10, "judgment-seat of God".
{62}
more as we understand it rightly. I believe that each act of our lives will be manifested then before the tribunal, according as the grace of God and His ways with us in connection with our own acts will be known then. We read (@Romans 14: 12) that "each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God"; and the word, in this passage, mentions the tribunal in connection with the exhortation to brethren not to judge one another in respect of days, meats, or any other such thing.
I am disposed to think that the acts alone will be subject to manifestation; but all the private acts of our life depend so intimately upon our inward feelings, that it is, in a certain sense, difficult to distinguish the acts from the simple thoughts. The acts manifest the power of the thought or of the feeling. I believe that the whole of our acts will be detailed there, before the judgment-seat, not for us however, as if we were in the flesh, and thus to our condemnation, but to make evident to our own eyes the grace that occupied itself with us -- regenerate or unregenerate.
In the counsels of God I am elect before the foundation of the world; hence I think that my own history will be detailed before the judgment-seat, and, parallel with it, the history of the grace and of the mercy of God toward me. The why and the how we did this or that will be manifested then. For us the scene will be declarative, not judicial. We are not in the flesh before God; in His eyes by His grace we are dead. But then, if we have walked according to the flesh, we must see how we lost in blessing
{63}
thereby, and what loss we have incurred; and, on the other hand, the ways of God towards us, all ways of wisdom, of mercy, and of grace, will be perfectly known and understood by us for the first time. The history of each one will come out in perfect transparency; it will be seen how you yielded and how He preserved you, how your foot slipped and how He raised you up again, how you were drawing near danger and shame and how He by His own arm interposed.
I believe this is the bride making herself ready, and I consider that moment as a wondrous one. There will be no flesh then to be condemned; but the new nature will enter into the full knowledge of the care and of the love, which, in true holiness and in righteousness and even in grace, have followed us step by step all through the running of the race. Some parts of our life, till then entirely unexplained, will be fully disclosed and become altogether plain; some tendencies of our nature, that perhaps we do not judge to be so pernicious and deadly as they are, and for the mortification of which we are perhaps now subjected to a discipline that we may not have interpreted aright, will be then perfectly explained; and, what is more, the very falls that plunge us now into such bitter anguish will be seen then to be that which God used to preserve us from something more terrible. I do not think that until then we shall ever have had a full knowledge of the badness of our flesh.
How blessed for us to know that then it will be not only all over with the flesh in the counsel of
{64}
God, but that the flesh will no longer be attached to us! On the other side, I doubt not, the manifestation of God's grace toward us individually will be so magnificent that even the sense of the perversity of the flesh that we had, if it could possibly enter there, would be excluded by the greatness of the sense of divine goodness. Why do we not deny and mortify the flesh when we think of that hour? The Lord grant that we may do so more and more to the glory of His grace. This great subject of the judgment-seat brings the soul to a very full knowledge of our individual standing.

THE DEW AND THE MANNA
The dew prepares a clean place for the manna to fall on; it cannot fall on the earth; there must be a preparation for it; it falls on the refreshed affections of the people of God ...
If we do not gather what He gives we become feeble. And it [the manna] had to be gathered before "the sun became hot" (@Exodus 16: 21).
The sun represents the influences of the day, and if saints do not get the dew and the manna before the influences of the day come upon them, they will not be provisioned for the day's needs.
It would have been a bad day for an Israelite if he had overslept! Alas! we often do that, and the apostle warns us that "it is already time that *we* should be aroused out of sleep" (@Romans 13: 11).

{65}
THE PRECIOUSNESS OF THE ASSEMBLY TO CHRIST
R. D. Painter
@Matthew 13: 45, 46; @1 Samuel 25: 39 - 42; @Song of Songs 4: 6 - 16; @Song of Songs 5: 1; @Revelation 19: 6 - 8; @Revelation 21: 2, 9 - 11
The Lord Jesus, as a blessed Man, has in the assembly that which is for Himself. My desire is to occupy us with what the assembly is to the Lord Jesus, because I believe she is foremost in His heart's affection, the one for whom He has given Himself.
In @Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus is presented as "a merchant seeking beautiful pearls", a Man who knew the value of that for which He was looking, and He finds "one pearl of great value". I would like us to consider the value of the assembly to the Lord Jesus. Value is not a matter of price; it is what an object is to the one who has it, or who desires it. He "found one pearl of great value" -- in type, the assembly -- and He expressed what that value was to Himself by the price that He was prepared to pay for it: "he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it". Do you appreciate that the Lord Jesus has paid a tremendous price to secure the assembly for Himself?
Paul tells us that "the Christ also loved the assembly and has delivered himself up for it" (@Ephesians 5: 25); and he exhorted the elders of Ephesus to "shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own" (@Acts 20:28).
{66}
The purchase price was the blood of One who before God was perfect and who had fully satisfied His heart. He has bought it; the rights to it belong to Him; it is precious to Him. The assembly should become more precious to us as we appreciate how precious she is to the Lord. It is important that each one of us gets a richer and fuller appreciation of the value that Christ has of His assembly, and that should help us to be more faithful to the Lord Jesus at the present time, and enhance our valuation of one another as those who have part in what Christ has secured for Himself.
Where we read in @1 Samuel 25, the day is very similar to the one in which we live; David was in rejection. Samuel had died, Saul was thinking only of himself, and those that had come under the benefit and influence of David, typically, Christ, did not appreciate him. "Who is David?" Nabal says (verse 10), and yet Nabal's young men could testify to the kindness of David's messengers (verses 14 - 17). We live in a land where much benefit has accrued to men as a result of the Person and the work of the Lord Jesus, and yet it is not much appreciated. Against that background, there was this woman Abigail who was "of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance" (verse 4). She was a woman of discernment, and, in contrast to Nabal, she knew who David was, and she knew God's thoughts in relation to him: "the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God" (verse 29). She knew that David was going to be king.
{67}
At the present time, the assembly too is to be marked by discernment, and understanding that Christ is going to reign supreme. So there is to be an answer at the present time among those who are prepared to be associated with Him in His rejection, and to be a present comfort to Him. I would like to encourage each of us to contribute to what is a present comfort to the heart of the Lord Jesus. May there be in our hearts a greater appreciation of what He is in the sight of God, and let us be identified with Him, and separate from this world where He has been rejected.
David appreciated the features that marked Abigail. No doubt her beauty was very attractive, but what was particularly precious to David was that she was prepared to minister to him and to his men. That, I think, is what we are called to do at the present time, beloved: to be prepared to minister to the Lord Jesus and to His people. Maybe we need to sacrifice in order that the saints might be served, to go on in subjection and humility, prepared to be here for the Lord Jesus. This is not just something that is individual; there is to be a united response from the hearts of the saints to the Lord Jesus. It is particularly when the saints are together that they afford this present comfort to the heart of Christ.
So it says very simply as to Abigail that she "went after the messengers of David, and became his wife". What a comfort a wife is! David here, typical of the Lord Jesus, had one in whom he can confide. The assembly today is to be considering for Christ
{68}
and His interests, responsibly and intelligently; there is to be nothing haphazard in the way that matters are dealt with amongst the saints; what the "woman of worth" does in @Proverbs 31 is regulated and prosperous. Let us be encouraged to consider for the present comfort of the heart of Christ.
In the Song of Songs we come to what is peculiarly precious, "my spouse" suggesting the assembly as the companion of Christ in secret communion. What delight He has in this companion! How precious the assembly is in His sight! You think of the beautiful features that are portrayed here: "Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee". She is of Himself and like Himself and is for Himself, and there is nothing in her that is unsuited to this blessed Man. As typifying the Lord's appreciation of the assembly, that is something that we can enjoy particularly as gathered together at the Supper on the first day of the week. You will remember that it says of Isaac that he led Rebecca "into his mother Sarah's tent ... and she became his wife, and he loved her" (@Genesis 24: 67), suggesting the enjoyment that Christ has in His assembly, what is for His heart alone. How precious it is to Him!
There are features of the spouse in @Song of Songs 4 that suggest to us the delight of the Lord Jesus in His spouse, the assembly. "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse". You think of the heart of the Lord Jesus as a Man ravished with what He has in the assembly. Those words show the
{69}
pleasure that is in His heart; His affection for the assembly is no less now than when He "delivered himself up for it" (@Ephesians 5: 25). It is an active love, and there is something that is responsively for His heart's satisfaction, and He is enjoying it. May we have our part in what He is enjoying! "Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes ... How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse!" How fair it is! He appreciates the responses that flow back to Him, that tell Him of the love that is in the heart of the assembly for Him, the united affections of the saints which have been preserved for Him. "How much better is thy love than wine!" It says that "new wine ... cheers God and man" (@Judges 9: 13), but the love of the assembly for Christ is better than wine. There is nothing like it to the heart of Christ, so let us give it to Him.
"A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed". How much care is needed that what is for His heart is preserved for Him, "A garden enclosed". Are our affections "enclosed" at this time for Christ, for His satisfaction? Then there is "A fountain in the gardens" and "A well of living waters". I believe the Spirit would strengthen and stimulate us so that what has been wrought by His service in our affections should be released for the refreshment and delight of Christ. "Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat its precious fruits". There is to be no reservation in the affections of the saints as united in
{70}
their desire to give pleasure to the heart of Christ. "I am come into my garden ... I have gathered ..." What pleasure the Lord Jesus finds in the responses of the assembly! Do not let this become diminished, beloved. Let this be stimulated amongst us. Let our affections flow out to Him. How much has been gathered up in your heart, and in mine, that, as set together amongst the saints, can be released for the praise of the Lord Jesus, for the satisfaction of His heart? Oh! Let us be stimulated as to it because He is looking for an answer and He would delight to come where love is. May we be preserved in it.
In @Revelation 19 we read of "the marriage of the Lamb", and, it says, "his wife has made herself ready". How precious to consider the assembly as suited to Christ, the Lamb, the One who has suffered, and that she has made *herself* ready. I believe that what we have already been considering is contributing to her preparation. "It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints". The righteous acts of the saints, in the working out of their daily lives here in faithfulness to Christ, all contribute to that lovely garment of "fine linen, bright and pure".
"The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready". The reference to the "wife", is remarkable, for the assembly is viewed as wife before she is as bride. "Wife" relates to her affectionate, responsible caring for the Lord's interests at the present time, the time of His absence.
{71}
In @Revelation 21: 9, 10 we see the bride, the Lamb's wife, coming out into display as "the holy city ... having the glory of God", representing what she has acquired throughout this dispensation that is suitable and pleasurable to God and the Lord Jesus. What a display of glory there will be in the assembly! What a reflection of the glory of Christ! The assembly comes down "out of the heaven from God ... having the glory of God. Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone ..." I believe that would be a reflection of what is in Christ. Let us understand that the assembly is to be a reflection of what is seen in Christ testimonially at the present time. The "crystal-like jasper stone", speaks of the absolute transparency that was seen in the Lord Jesus. He was the One who could say that He was "Altogether that which I also say to you" (@John 8: 25). The transparency that was so pleasurable to the heart of God in Christ here will be seen in the assembly in that glorious day of display.
In @Revelation 21: 2 we see the assembly "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband". How wonderful, adorned for Christ! I wonder if we have reflected on this matter of adorning. Are we acquiring moral features in our lives at the present time, features that will be for the glory of God eternally? You think of that word as to wives, "whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel; but the hidden man of the heart, in the
{72}
incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price" (@1 Peter 3: 3, 4). Such a spirit is not of value in this world, but it is of great value to Christ and to God.
I would just like to leave these thoughts with you, beloved, to consider and to be stimulated in relation to them, as appreciating the value that Christ had of His assembly, so that He gave Himself for it, that He might have the comfort of a present, intelligent and affectionate response to Him. The assembly will be seen in the day of display, the day of Christ's glory, as His bride, one who is suited to be with Him in His glory. The Holy Spirit, I believe, is working to this end, that the features so pleasing to the Lord Jesus might be formed in the saints. We sang at the outset to the Spirit
<blockquote>'For in Thy holy keeping <br>The bride of Christ must be' (`355:2). </blockquote>
What a work the Spirit of God is engaged in, that there might be a suited bride for Christ's glory. May we all be stimulated in relation to these things, for His Name's sake.

THE HILL COUNTRY
J. Taylor
@Luke 1: 39, 40; @Philippians 3: 20
I wanted to bring out the thought of the "hill country". Scripture speaks of it, as you will observe in the verse in @Luke 1; and it speaks of it elsewhere,
{73}
as I hope to show. The example set by Mary, the mother of the Lord, in this respect is to be followed. Her movements before the Lord's birth, one might say, are more spiritual than those after His birth, and the example she sets us here is to be noted and to be followed. She "went", we are told, "into the hill country with haste".
The Lord also paid attention to the hill country, and in the epistles we have that which corresponds to the hill country in the gospels; especially the passage I have read from Philippians. It denotes the spiritual hill country, and I want to show that the tendency of the spiritual is to repair to that country. Our citizenship is there. The apostle had been there himself, so he is a competent witness. We have heard of climbers; people who climbed Mt. McKinley¦, or the Himalayas. They can give some account of the character of the atmosphere in these high altitudes. Now the apostle had been in this altitude of which he speaks here. You will all remember how in his second letter to the Corinthians he tells us that in Damascus he was let down over the wall in a basket (chapter 11: 33). It is remarkable that he should tell us it was in a basket. There is more in it than the mere historical fact of his being let down in such a manner. He was not caught up to heaven in a basket. In the next chapter, @2 Corinthians 12, he is said to have been caught up into Paradise. Certainly
¦Highest mountain in N. America.
{74}
the law of gravitation had nothing to do with that! He says; "whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows" (verse 2). He knew of the basket. It was a humiliating thing to be reminded of the basket, but the humiliating things go before the elevating things. You never could ascend without descending first. The descending is the humbling thing, and all the humiliating circumstances connected with the descent are impressed on the mind. It is of God that they should remain in the mind.
The question is raised more than once in the Old Testament as to who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? (@Psalm 24: 3). I wonder if that question has ever been raised in your soul? It is most noteworthy how much is taken for granted by young people. In the Old Testament the questions young people were to raise are provided for. The Israelites were fore- armed in regard to the questions of the young people, in @Deuteronomy 6: 20. I wonder, young people, if you are accustomed to ask questions. Your parents, as Christians, are supposed to be able to answer. It is a very serious matter to have children. Parents must not only feed and clothe them, they must answer their questions; and if the Spirit of God is working with your child he will put questions to you. You must answer them. The book of Deuteronomy prepares the ground for the questions of the children. The difficulty in this country very largely is that there are no children in the true sense. I do not mean by that that there are not babies, and
{75}
girls and boys, but the idea of a child, subject to and deriving a character from the parent is greatly lost sight of in this country. Indeed in every country now, but especially here.
But I was speaking of descending. If you are born into a house in which there is no unleavened bread you never think of it; you will not think of *going down*. You think of *going up* in this world. You think of acquiring means, and a position in the social world. Happily a child sometimes makes it for himself, but this is exceptional. The right and safe thing for parents is to have the unleavened bread in the house, and the unleavened bread is sure to raise a question in the minds of the children. Why this? Why do you not have something that inflates the bread like other people? Is not that what a child would say? Well, there is a reason for it, and it is the parents¬ privilege to explain the reason. Look at Lot's children. Do you think they had any relish for that bread he baked for the angels (@Genesis 19: 3)? Would they go out of Sodom? To his sons-in-law this was mockery. They had been too well accustomed to leavened bread to have any taste for unleavened bread.
Beware, young man, of the food of Sodom! Have respect for that unleavened bread even if your father has only begun to bake it! Have respect to it, and if he explains it aright he will tell you that your baptism does not mean you are to be a man of this world. It means that you are to be a "little one" as in this world; but the other side is, that you are to be
{76}
exalted in God's world. That is what it means. Well, now, in order to ascend into the hill of the Lord you have to learn to descend, as I said. You have to give up all those high thoughts of which the natural mind is fruitful. The thoughts of the human heart ascend up to heaven itself. Capernaum was "raised up to heaven" (@Matthew 11: 23). That was inflation of thought indeed.
Now the first thing, as I said, is to go down; you have to go down in the eyes of your fellow-work-men, your neighbours and your acquaintances, but God will lift you up. Paul says: "I know a man in Christ". It is not merely a historical thing he is referring to. He does refer to the historical incident, but he refers also to *what he knows*. "I know a man in Christ". Do you know a man like that? That is a very serious question. If I do not know in myself that I am a man in Christ, it is unlikely that I shall discern another. Paul knew one. I think if he had known any in Corinth he would have said so. "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago ... such a one caught up to the third heaven". He knew that man. Whether caught up in the body, or out of it, he did not know, but *he knew what was there*. Think of that! Caught up into Paradise! He was truly in the hill country! He heard wonderful things; things that were not lawful for a man to utter. Paul is thus a competent witness as to the character of the "hill country".
Now I wish just to give descriptions of certain eminences in the hill country. I call attention to the
{77}
cities of refuge in Canaan, not in Bashan, but in Canaan. There were three cities of refuge on either side of the Jordan (see @Joshua 20). The three that were in Canaan were in the hill country; one in the hill country of Naphtali; one in the hill country of Ephraim; and one in the hill country of Judah. They were all in the hill country. Now that is very significant, and I want to come back to it in a moment, because the cities of refuge have reference to those who are under the influence of heaven, who reflect what is in heaven, that is, the assembly. I will dwell on that just in a moment, but I wanted to come to the eminences in the hill country which may be scripturally designated.
The first one in the gospels is what may be regarded as the *legislative* hill. It is found in @Matthew 5. The Lord Jesus is pleased to go up into the mountain, it is said. The Lord was owned by the Father; attention was called to Him; and He attracts disciples. We are told in @Matthew 5 that He went up into a mountain and called His disciples and opened His mouth to teach, and we are told what He taught; what He laid down in His teaching had reference to the principles by which the people of God and the kingdom of God were to be governed and regulated.
Now remember, it is not enough to be a disciple. You have to learn to govern. You do not learn it in the plain. The Lord might have spoken on the plain, but He did not. He took the disciples to the mountain to speak. Now, you say, I am not in a position to rule; but you are, and you have to *begin with*
{78}
*yourself*.
One of the most important lessons to be learned by a believer is how to rule himself. You do not get the ideas from [the US] Congress, nor even from Moses. Time after time the Lord insists; "*I* say unto you". Are you listening to what He says? If you do not listen to what He says you will never rule yourself, and if you do not rule yourself you will never rightly rule another. And yet the Christian, in the mind of God, is intended to rule the universe. He is intended, according to Paul, to judge even angels (@1 Corinthians 6: 3). How serious! Have you learned to rule yourself, to govern your own spirit? You must go to the mount of legislation for that, and you must go up with the Lord. How important to be withdrawn from the influence of the plain! Those friends of yours whose acquaintance you have made in business; the children of your father's neighbours; these are found in the plain. If you stay there you will never learn to rule yourself. You must isolate yourself and ascend with the Lord Jesus, and listen to those wonderful pronouncements of His. "*I* say unto you". How worthy of attention is such legislation as that!

AGUR'S REFLECTIONS
P. Lyon
@Proverbs 30: 1 - 4, 18 - 20
It is to be noticed that there is an allusion to what is inscrutable in these four things (verse 19). Now I wish
{79}
to make it clear, dear brethren, that I am seeking only to make an application, and do not assume to interpret the passage, which seems divinely intended to be in measure veiled, but I would suggest that it bears prophetically upon the present dispensation.
The first thing mentioned is "the way of an eagle in the heavens". This thought is set forth in the Lord Jesus. As He says, "no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven" (@John 3: 13). The eagle in its unrivalled power of flight has, so to speak, the liberty of the heavens; it can go anywhere it will. And so the Lord is presented as the ascending One -- He had in His person that inherent right, a divine right unique to Himself.
But then the ascended One has now opened heaven to us in the Spirit's power. John is in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, he can soar; that is the time to soar, when conditions are divinely favourable. If we do not soar then, shall we do so as found in prayer, or in spiritual inquiry together, or in the meeting for ministry? We are to soar in spiritual power as a bird does in the open heavens. It has the inherent power that assures its liberty in a realm from which others are excluded.
Then we have "the way of a serpent upon a rock". You will understand that I am referring to a rock here not as representing the Lord personally, but rather the situation resulting from the presence of the Lord in manhood here, a situation in which the tactics of Satanic opposition were brought to
{80}
bear upon Him.
"The ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing" (@John 14: 30). The Lord discerned his every move. He detected what was behind Peter's defection and met it with that word of rebuke, "Get away behind me, Satan" (@Matthew 16: 23). He knew Judas from the beginning, saying "of you one is a devil" (@John 6: 70). The descent of the Lord Jesus in grace into manhood, one would say with reverence, gave opportunity for the serpent's attack. His foes in their subtle questions sought to wrest His words, but all to their confusion. Think again of the tremendous power brought to bear against Him in the temptations, and finally at Gethsemane, but then all this has resulted in the serpent's exposure and defeat. The blessed Lord stood His ground here, even to the death of the cross. "That through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil" (@Hebrews 2: 14).
But then the Lord would set us up individually in spiritual power to detect and resist the enemy's devices and to stand our ground against him -- as the word is "prove the spirits, if they are of God" (@1 John 4: 1). And again, "every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him" (@1 John 5: 18). How impregnable, also, is the assembly, as of the rock against which the gates of Hades shall not prevail (@Matthew 16: 18)!
The next thought is "the way of a ship in the midst of the sea". I would suggest that here we have
{81}
an allusion to the testimony going through victoriously. We need have no fear as to this, for He who once went through this scene of death in triumph, freighted with all the treasures of divine love, will preserve His own. "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition" (@John 17: 12). And then again the word to the disciples is "be of good courage: I have overcome the world" (@John 16: 33). Thus Paul had no fear but that the testimony would go through. He was concerned that Timothy should continue, for many then, as now, were among the deserters. But Luke had stood by. "Luke alone is with me" (@2 Timothy 4: 11). Deserters here are seldom reinstated, but such is the dispensation of grace that a Mark who fled from Pamphylia is recovered spiritually to acceptable service. "Take Mark, and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry" (@2 Timothy 4: 11).
The ship of the testimony is homeward bound. Let us be livingly in it. We cannot be mere passengers on that ship. There is no provision for such. Paul made no secret that there were storms ahead, as indicated in the second epistle to Timothy, and elsewhere. But the ship is going through triumphantly under the hand of the Lord, who is the Defender of the testimony. We are told of many ships starting across the Lake of Gennesaret, but we only hear of one reaching the other side, the one the Lord was in. There are many denominational ships today, but they are not seaworthy; they are
{82}
water-logged from the start. How blest and safe to be in the same barque with Christ!
Now, one word as to the last thought, "the way of a man with a maid". We think of the Lord ascending far above all heavens; we see Him descending in love; we see Him in the testimony as Defender of it bringing the church through many a storm into the desired haven, and now we have this thought, "the way of a man with a maid". May this not be viewed as a veiled allusion to the relations of Christ and the assembly? His love so expressed -- "This is my body, which is for you" (@1 Corinthians 11: 24), and then love's answer -- "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (@2 Corinthians 11: 2)!
How different by contrast is the woman in verse twenty, representing as she does the great imitative system marked by marital unfaithfulness, which she would seek to cover in hypocrisy! "Such is the way of an adulterous woman". But she is exposed in her attempted assumption of the feature of inscrutability marking the previous four. The Lord's ascent on high, His descent into death, His passing through in triumph -- all these activities of love converge on His relationships of love with the church.
The man with the maid conveys the thought of the overtures of love in which the man leads -- takes the initiative, as it were (otherwise there must be disaster even in natural relationships). This relationship of love will develop and abide to eternity, where there are no winds to be held in His
{83}
fists, when those who are allowed to raise adverse winds here shall have been cast into the lake of fire, and there shall be eternal peace, unruffled by the storms of the foe. What we are here considering will abide eternally -- Christ for the assembly and the assembly for Christ.
In closing I would briefly illustrate these thoughts as seen in Acts. First as to the way of an eagle in the air. The Lord as the ascending One appeared among His disciples for forty days (chapter 1). How He would set forth the liberty of that scene to which He belonged, before His disciples, set up as they were through the gift of the Holy Spirit (chapter 2), in the liberty of heaven! What a favour is ours in having such an outlet Godward! We have thus the power to rise and in the spirit of sonship to cry "Abba Father" (@Romans 8: 15). "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" (@John 8: 36).
Secondly, how well Peter was able to detect the movements of the enemy in @Acts 5! In Ananias and Sapphira the foe has come very near, but Peter foils the enemy's attack.
What a comfort to feel that the subtle movements of Satan, apparently so baffling, will be exposed! The gates of Hades are not going to prevail, and however subtle and skilled the foe may appear to be (as he is described by the prophet, @Ezekiel 28: 11 - 19) he is but an instrument in the hand of God. He has sinned from the beginning. There is no forgiveness for the tempter -- there is for the tempted; such is the
{84}
discriminating fairness of God.
Then in @Acts 7 may we not liken Stephen's spirit to a steadfast barque upon a stormy sea ploughing its way through the winds and waves of opposition and eventual martyrdom? What an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom was his! Was there ever such pressure in suffering, save in the unparalleled sufferings of the Lord Himself at Gethsemane and at Calvary? The storm increases round Stephen, but he enters harbour in full sail. He went right through in triumph and at the end he used what strength his enemies had left him to pray for them. Was there ever such a victory, save with his blessed Master Himself? The ship of the testimony is also seen in chapter 8 and thereafter continuing its onward course. All this leads up to the thought of the man with the maid -- the mystery of God regarding Christ and the assembly, as implied in the Lord's utterance from heaven to Saul, "why dost thou persecute me?" (chapter 9: 4).
We have then these four features: first the liberty of heaven afforded the saints in the gift of the Spirit, the power to rise given them at Pentecost; secondly, the ability to detect the foe as seen in Peter when he marked his deadly attempt to enter in amongst the saints; thirdly in Stephen and Philip and others, we see the ship of the testimony making headway though the storms increase; and finally, we come to what introduces us to the great issue of all these, the truth of the mystery as implied in the Lord's use of the word "me" in @Acts 9: 4. Christ is in heaven and
{85}
the assembly here. Paul has of course his part in all these thoughts, but the first three features are all in view of the crowning issue, the man with a maid. How Paul developed that thought in his ministry!
May the Lord in His grace encourage us to move on in all that this suggests, so that we may grace that heavenly vessel, the assembly, in the gain of all these spiritual experiences!

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 6 -- THE CANDLESTICK
M. W. Biggs
Very allied to the truths relating to the responsibility of the house of God are those which refer to the church of God as the candlestick or light-bearer. We have seen in a previous paper that the church occupies this place of light-bearer during the time Israel is cut off as the people of God and while Christ is absent. It holds a position of responsibility, while Christ is in heaven, to maintain the light of God on earth. Hence in @Revelation 2 and 3 the church is seen under the figure of seven golden candlesticks (see @Revelation 1: 20).
It is in no sense the object of the writer of this paper to expound these two chapters in Revelation. All that is desired is to draw attention to the fact that the church is thus presented there and to consider a few practical thoughts in this connection.
{86}
The Lord Jesus said to His disciples in view of His rejection, "*Ye* are the light of the world" (@Matthew 5: 14). And He Himself indeed had occupied this position. He said so, as we may read in @John 8:12. But Jesus was going to be rejected. The pure and heavenly light which ever shone in Him was to be extinguished as far as the malice of man and Satan's power could do so. It was indeed to vanish as far as Jesus Himself was concerned. He was going back to heaven and the world would see Him no more. But the power of man and Satan combined are no match against the power of God. And it was God's will to continue the light which had been exhibited in Jesus. The disciples, who afterwards became the church, had the privilege of being the "light of the world".
The seven golden candlesticks are the seven churches, we are told. The idea suggested by the number seven is completeness, or perfection, and therefore we gather that the church is presented in its entirety under the figure here employed. And the church is set in this position to exhibit the light which was seen in Christ. It is not that she is to shine with her own light, as if she were the source of it, but with the light of Christ. Just as the moon reflects the light of the sun in the night time, when that greater orb is hidden from our view, so the church is to reflect the light of Christ during the night of His rejection. And it is only as the church enjoys the light of Christ that she herself is luminous.
What an honour to confer upon any company!
{87}
What could be a greater privilege than to be the continuity of the light of Christ?
The light has not been extinguished, for Christ has His own here. The Spirit of Christ has produced Christ-likeness in those who belong to Christ. And through the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ the light which shone in Jesus is maintained in His own.
Blessed privilege to be for Christ here! May it be ours to shine more brightly!
But although, through the power of the Spirit of God, the light which shone in Jesus will ever be maintained, yet, as a corporate and responsible witness to the truth, the church as a whole has very seriously failed. We cannot read @Revelation 2 and 3 without seeing this. The Lord is there seen as scrutinising that which is the responsible vessel of light and His eyes of flame detect departure.
We need scarcely remark that everything committed to man's responsibility ends in failure. And it is not long before the failure begins. Adam quickly lost Eden. Noah soon failed to govern himself. Israel speedily departed out of the way and made the golden calf. And so we might cite case after case. Failure is always found with responsibility whenever man is concerned. Christ, blessed be His name! is the grand exception. He stands alone!
The failure does not commence with overt signs; the *heart* is the beginning of the trouble. The works, the labour, the patience and the intolerance of evil seen in Ephesus speak of outward order and a zeal for christian propriety; but the *heart* was dull, and
{88}
out of the heart proceed the issues of life. "First love" (@Revelation 2: 4) had waned. Objects other than Christ engaged the heart so that He had not the place of ruling supremacy.
Now let us observe that this was so quite early in the church's history. We believe that in the addresses to the seven churches of Asia we have a prophetic view of the history of the decline of the church from the days of the apostles. The declension as it began is set forth in the address to Ephesus, and it culminates in Thyatira, Sardis and Laodicea. That which should have exhibited the pure light is rebuked by Christ because of failure. The Lord ever abides the same, and His position in the midst of the seven candlesticks necessitates that He must notice departure. What a solemn reflection this is!
Satan at first tried to put out the light altogether by opposition. Persecution fell upon the followers of the despised Nazarene. But this could not be done. The persecution was rather used by the Lord, who permitted it as discipline, and many saints were encouraged by the words, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life" (@Revelation 2: 10).
Extermination proving impossible, the adversary resorted to corruption. This, alas! did succeed only too well, as far as the church as the collective wit-ness to the light was concerned. Where opposition failed, flattery and corruption gained the victory.
History tells us how Christianity began with a despised and persecuted company. But its followers
{89}
became popular and worldly, and the profession of Christianity was embraced by emperors and the world. Hence that which bears the name of Christianity today is not what existed at the beginning at all, but is a mixture of heathenism and Judaism with the form and name of Christianity attached.
But has the light gone then? Has God been defeated? If the church as a whole has failed to shed forth the light of Christ, is there no witness now?
Impossible! Although the corporate testimony of the church has been corrupted, God has always had His witnesses on earth.
*Individuals in the church* have been these witnesses. Hence it is we read of the various promises to those who overcome. This is very encouraging. If the whole church is corrupt there is no reason, dear reader, why you and I may not shine as brightly as ever.
Let us be quite clear as to this. From the very beginning of the departure, individuals have been God's witnesses. It cannot be doubted that the church as a whole has entirely failed to answer to God's mind as the light-bearer. There has never been a wholly true collective witness to the light on the part of the whole church since the earliest days. All testimony depends upon individual faithfulness after the failure of the church as a corporate witness. The responsibility of the whole company remains and God is slow to judge, as we may learn from @Revelation 2: 21. And, indeed, the testimony itself
{90}
remains the same¦; it is corporate in its character. But we reach this testimony individually and it is dependent practically upon individual faithfulness.
To be a true witness and to really shine as a light for Christ it is necessary to overcome amidst all the failure which exists in that which bears the name of Christianity -- failure which has resulted from that first departure, "thou hast left thy first love". May the Lord keep our *hearts*! It is there the trouble always begins. Outward order may be maintained, a true ecclesiastical position rigorously held; but where is the heart? To Ephesus the solemn word comes, "thou hast left thy first love".
It is no wonder that at the end the Lord has to knock at the door from outside (@Revelation 3: 20). We are not surprised that wickedness like Jezebel's is seen, that doctrine like Balaam's is held, that deathlike formality and cold profession, like that portrayed in Sardis, marks the church. All is the outcome of first love waning; all departure begins at the heart!
Presently the Lord will spue the false witness out of His mouth (@Revelation 3: 16). An insipid lukewarmness marks everything. And along with this there is a religious pride which can boast of riches and feel
¦Let the reader seek grace to hold the balance of truth carefully! God’s testimony has not changed and it implies unity. We cannot restore the testimony as it existed in the beginning; but individually we must seek grace to walk according to that which is proper to the whole church of God.
{91}
need of nothing. Oh! what a condition for the church to have come to. The Lord says it. He sees it so. It must be true. He cannot lie!
We wish again to remind the reader that we are considering the church as seen in the outward profession of Christ's name. The Lord will soon take His blood-bought people home, and then He will judge the mere profession of His name. There is no wonder at the need to overcome!
We should have been surprised that all could have become what it has, had not the Lord told us beforehand. It would be bold indeed to claim that that which bears the name of Christianity is really setting forth in practice and character that which Jesus exhibited! The church as a whole, as a corporate responsible witness has failed to express the character of Christ and shine for Him. One may with real sincerity inquire, Where are the true followers of the rejected Son of man?
May God give both reader and writer to seek to be such and to be living witnesses to the light which God will maintain to the end in spite of all the failure of man!

EDUCATION IN VIEW OF SERVICE
J. H. Trevvett
@Acts 6: 5, 8; @Acts 11: 1 - 5; @Acts 13: 6 - 12; @Romans 12: 12
Peter says, "I was in the city of Joppa praying", not preaching, nor being entertained by Simon the tanner; but the first thing in his mind was that he was
{92}
in the city of Joppa praying, and he became "in an ecstasy". Our service as amongst the brethren, and even those that may contend because they fail to understand what is said, needs to be marked by this precious feature of patience. Peter stresses it; he says, "in your faith have also virtue ... in temperance endurance" -- or patience (@2 Peter 1: 5, 6). He encourages the saints to be patient in relation to all that they are passing through. Again, Scripture reminds us of the long patience of the husbandman: "having patience", he waits for the early and the latter rain (@James 5: 7).
Peter was able in moral power to silence the contenders; and we should be ready to serve like that. Much has come before us of late that is of inestimable value, and the ministry has given us a fresh and spiritually enhanced view of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if it is not understood, shall I contend? If there are contenders, we have need of patience, yet, in that patience, surrendering nothing that has come to us by reason of the operations of God, and the operations of the Holy Spirit. He operates in those that teach and in those that minister, and we must see to it that we take heed to these things.
I now refer briefly to Paul, who was serving, as I have said, in a scene of hostility. He was serving in the glad tidings, and the scripture says that at Salamis "they announced the word of God" (@Acts 13: 5), but there is no record of any results. Now, I believe the patience of Peter finds expression
{93}
in Paul, in relation to this service amongst men. It says, "having passed through the whole island", the whole of it, as if to say they were combing it out. And when they came to Paphos, there was there an intelligent man, Sergius Paulus. The Spirit of God designates him thus -- "an intelligent man". This man called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. Would that there were more like that today!
Paul is in the public sphere; he is serving men along with Barnabas, and as he seeks to serve, the enemy becomes increasingly active. I believe we are surrounded by this kind of thing today. There was a man named Bar-jesus; what a fine name that seemed! How many of the simple and unsuspecting ones have been deceived by names like that -- Bar-jesus -- son of Jesus. He is with the proconsul -- an influential man. The Spirit of God unmasks him, calling him "Elymas the magician", saying, "for so his name is by interpretation". He withstood Barnabas and Saul, "seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith", not now contending about certain things, but here as a direct and definite opposer to the truth, and opposed to the gospel preachers. How is that kind of thing to be met?
We meet this kind of person time after time in our course through this world. There are the sorcerers, there are the spiritists, the scientists who label themselves Christian; there are the millennial dawnists. How are we to meet these deceivers? How did Paul meet them? Would Gamaliel have helped
{94}
him here? Anything he had learned at the feet of Gamaliel (@Acts 22: 3) would be useless in such a crisis as this. Paul did not attempt to meet him as come from a school of modernism, or from a theological institute, or from the universities of the world; he came from Antioch, where they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting. In that spiritual atmosphere, charged with piety and dependence, the Holy Spirit had said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" (verse 2). Then it is said that the brethren "fasted and prayed", not that they prayed and fasted, but "fasted and prayed". The brethren would be careful to fast *before* they prayed, so that they might ask right things in relation to this unique, this hitherto unknown, service upon which Barnabas and Saul were now to embark.
"Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go" (verse 3). They did not say, When these men are gone there will be more room for us. I have not the slightest doubt that in their hearts they were sorry to lose these valued servants, but they let them go. They bowed to the sovereignty of a divine Person in His choice, and laid their hands on them and let them go. That is where Saul and Barnabas had come from, and so as this position arises, the Spirit of God, speaking of Saul, says, "But Saul, who also is Paul". Paul the *little*; see what strength he has, what moral power he has acquired! "filled with the Holy Spirit ... said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of the devil". He
{95}
names this sorcerer according to his right designation. He did not root him up. He left him as he said, "thou shalt be blind ... for a season". Such was Paul's power, and I believe we may have something akin to that in these last and difficult days. We may ask, What was the secret of this great power wielded by the apostle? The secret of it was prayer. He began with it. "Behold he is praying", is what was said to Ananias (@Acts 9: 11), and he finished up with praying; for in the second epistle to Timothy he reminds him that he prayed "night and day", having in the meantime exhorted the Thessalonian saints to "pray unceasingly" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 17). Do we pray night and day? Paul says, "how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day" (@2 Timothy 1: 3). That was the kind of servant Paul was. His power in a hostile scene came that way; he was a man of prayer.
I would remind you in closing of that remarkable expression in @Romans 12: 12 -- "As regards hope, rejoicing". That was seen in Stephen; he was rejoicing in hope. He was soon to be actually taken up, for he could say, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit". What kind of spirit was that? A spirit ready to be transported. Are our spirits like that? We must often feel how much mellowing is needed to take place in our spirits. But Stephen says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (@Acts 7: 59). He was rejoicing in hope, and that in regard of "the glory of God" (@Romans 5: 2).
Then we have "as regards tribulation, enduring". A remarkable and much-needed word in these last
{96}
days, when the pressure falls heavily on the saints, as upon men in general. No doubt this is governmental amongst men. But we need patience in serving amongst the brethren. Then finally there is to be perseverance in prayer, so that our service publicly amongst men might be marked by moral courage and power, so that we might rebuke what is unholy and not of God.
We need skill to watch over and guard carefully the work of God, however faintly it may appear; for we are reminded in the two persons, Sergius Paulus and Elymas the magician, of two results from the preaching: the one an "odour from life unto life", and the other an "odour from death unto death" (@2 Corinthians 2: 16). Sergius Paulus was as a plant which the Father had planted; a prudent man, desiring to hear the word of God. As he saw the effect of Paul's power and teaching, he believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord. But alongside of this delicate plant, there is this noxious weed, this deadly poison, and how much skill is needed so that we should secure the good and discover the work of God in souls.
May the Lord help us in these three things, so that we shall be found in our service, "as regards hope rejoicing; as regards tribulation, enduring; as regards prayer, persevering".

THE HILL COUNTRY
J. Taylor
@Luke 1: 39, 40; @Philippians 3: 20
Now the next mountain is that in which *servants are taught how to serve*. Mark gives us that mountain. Matthew, as you all know, is the great administrative gospel; Mark gives us the mountain in which servants, or Levites, are taught how to minister. It says, He "calls whom he himself would" (@Mark 3: 13). Now mark that. It is not now the disciples simply. Every disciple must learn how to rule. Every one, young and old, must learn how to rule himself. You have no place in the assembly if you have not learned how to rule yourself, no place in the kingdom. But when you come to levitical work the Lord reduces the number. Not now simply a disciple, He "calls whom he himself would". I am referring to @Mark 3. You cannot go up if you please in this instance.
We cannot all be preachers or teachers, but we are all disciples. If you are not a disciple you are outside of the pale of Christianity. But when you come to levitical work it is "whom he himself would". So He selects twelve and He takes them up, we are told, to the mountain, in order "that *they might be with him*". That is a different idea; "that *he might send them to preach*, and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons" (verses 14, 15). How different from the modern ideas of service acquired by a course in a divinity school! Titles are conferred in religious colleges, but the Lord titles
{98}
His servants. I would not accept a title from any one but Christ. He has titles to give, but He gives them to those whom He knows. He selects them deliberately.
In one gospel we read that He prayed all night before He selected them (@Luke 6: 12, 13), but in Mark it is the *sovereignty of His choice*; "whom he himself would". He takes them up to the mountain in order that they might be with Him. Do not miss that. He took them with Him up there on the mountain in order that they might be with Him; not now to hear His laws; not even to hear His teaching, but to have His company; that they might learn from Him by seeing how He did things. It is in the hill country of Scripture. It is away from the plain and from the valley. The valleys lie in the mist, you know; lie covered with mist and fog. We all know how the summit of a mountain may be in the clear sunshine, whereas the valley below is in a fog; a description of this world on man's level. The Corinthians walked as men. They walked there on the plain. They did not ascend into the clear atmosphere of the hill country.
These disciples whom the Lord chose were with Him on the mountain and we are told that He gave titles. He called Simon, Peter. He gave him the name of Peter; and James and John, the sons of Zebedee, He called Boanerges, "Sons of thunder". These are simply illustrations. It does not mean that others may not have had names. The point is that the Lord confers the titles; He confers the name that indicates what should be set out in each person who receives
{99}
it. So that you come down from the mountain with these impressions and you carry out the service down here where the evil is. You carry it out in the dignity of one who has been in the hill country with Christ.
Now the third hill is, as I said a moment ago, the *high* one. It is the most exalted altitude, and that is the mount of transfiguration. It is called *high*. That, I would take the liberty of regarding, as the mount of privilege. It is the mount of contemplation, really. He took three only up there. You see there is reduction as you go on. First there are disciples; then there are certain ones especially selected; taken up, and then a reduced number; three taken up, and they are taken high. Finally it is reduced to one. Paul went higher than all of them, to the third heaven. That is the greatest altitude in the hill country.
Now the "mount of transfiguration" is, from the disciples¬ point of view, the mount of contemplation. There is little said as to the hearing after all was over. It is true the disciples heard the Father's voice, and they were to hear the Son, but it is not hearing on the mount of contemplation so much as *seeing*. He was transfigured *before them*. They were to see this. John says, "we beheld his glory". That is contemplation. Peter says, "having been eye- witnesses of *his* majesty" (@2 Peter 1: 16). John says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" (@John 1: 14). What a sight to behold! To ascend the mountain involved exercise. That is what we lack. The apostle says, "I
{100}
keep under my body". He knew how to keep his body under. His body did not hinder him. It was subordinate to his judgment; it never ruled him.
The Lord took the disciples "up into a high mountain apart" (@Matthew 17: 1); a *high* one. That required exercise. Young people, in coming into fellowship, often think it is all nice easy sailing. You do not get anything in your soul without exercise. If you want to get hold of things you must be exercised about them. Certainly Peter, James and John could never have reached that altitude without exercise. But they reached it, and they saw wonderful things. Peter says, "having been eye-witnesses of *his* majesty ... being with him on the holy mountain". Now these are the three mounts that one has taken the liberty of designating. You can easily trace them. They stand out prominently in the range, as we may say. They are the peaks of the range and the highest one is the mount of contemplation.
I just refer one moment in closing to the cities of refuge. You see it is those who have visited these mountains that I have spoken of who, with others, ultimately formed the cities of refuge. This is worth noting. If a man is to flee for his life, we would let him run down hill if possible. He could run easier; run faster, but not so in Scripture. The anxious question, "What shall we do, brethren?" (@Acts 2: 37) shows there was exercise. The avenger of blood was abroad. The blood of Christ had been shed. The Jews had become the murderers of the Lord Jesus, and the avenger was abroad. "What shall we do, brethren?"
{101}
That was the question; they were exercised. The cities of refuge were in the hill country of Naphtali, the hill country of Ephraim and the hill country of Judah (@Joshua 20: 7). If they were to escape for their lives, so to speak, they had to climb that ascent to get to the city of refuge. Those who say, "What shall we do?" were exercised. The climbing had no terror for them. Exercises are most exhilarating experiences spiritually. The greater the climb, the more the strength, the better the air; where this exercise is, the Lord helps. The Lord helped them. "The Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved" (@Acts 2: 47). That is an allusion to the city of refuge. Was it on a level with the temple in Jerusalem? No. Morally, it was elevated. To the true Jerusalem the *tribes go up*. You go up to the house. Solomon is the great leader in that; there was "his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah" (@1 Kings 10: 5).
The Lord, in adding the repentant ones in Israel to the assembly, those who were exercised, had *placed them in the hill country*. Peter and John are in the dignity of it. Mount Zion represents this dignity. "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (@Psalm 133: 1). That marks the hill country. It is in Zion. There is one high peak, mount Hermon, towering up into the clouds where it catches the dew and throws it off on to Zion. How dignified the expression, "the dew of Hermon that descendeth on the mountains of Zion" (verse 3). Brethren were dwelling together in unity in
{102}
*that* hill country, and the Lord commanded the blessing just there, "life for evermore". So that Peter and John, it says, went up to the temple *together* at the hour of prayer. They were in the dignity of the hill country. There was unity there, and Peter and John were in it. They were *together*. They represented in their relation to each other the spirit of the hill country. Hence Peter says to the impotent man, "Look on us" (@Acts 3: 5). There was something to look at.
Now mark that, He does not say, Look on the Lord. He says, "Look on us". But on whom? Those that were truly *together*. They were together in the spirit of affection one for another, and in testimony to Christ. They had nothing of that which marks the man in the plain at all. "Silver and gold"he says, "I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee". Where did he get that? In the hill country. He got it in the sphere of unity. He had been on the mountain with the Lord Jesus. "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene", he says, "rise up and walk"; and the man rose, and he walked and leaped and praised God. All this is really connected with the hill country.
I have ventured to say all that in regard to the cities of refuge, because Peter and John represent the spirit of the cities of refuge; they lived, so to speak, in the hill country. As to the man that was healed, do you think he would have any difficulty in going up to mount Ephraim, or to the hill country of Naphtali or Judah? Look at the ability he had now. He was crippled before; but now he can walk and leap and
{103}
praise God.
I have not touched on the two passages read. I only read them to suggest the subject. You see how Mary, the mother of the Lord, had received a wonderful communication from the angel and directly he leaves her, she went in haste to the hill country, and visited Elizabeth. Elizabeth lived there. She was a spiritual woman. She hid herself five months there. The epistle to the Colossians is the great hiding epistle! It is a good thing to be hidden. You do not want to be under the eyes of men; you do not wish to be a public man or a public woman. It is contrary to spirituality. Those whose minds are set on things above, not on things of the earth, are said to be dead, and their life hid with Christ in God. Now that was Elizabeth. She was a good companion to seek.
Where do you seek your companions? If the Spirit of God speaks to you, you seek a spiritual person, and you seek him where he lives, and that is in the hill country. He lives away from the influences of this world, his associations are outside of it. Hence Mary went in haste. She knew where to go. The Lord had touched her heart. A wonderful communication had been made by the angel, and she went in haste, we are told, to the hill country of Judah, where one of the cities of refuge had been, and she found a companion there in Elizabeth, one who honoured her, who recognised the great honour that had been conferred on her by the Lord. And so it will be in your case if you repair to the hill
{104}
country, my young brother and sister, you will find some one there who will recognise your true dignity. You have dignity although you may not know it. If you are a believer in Christ, you have dignity, but you do not get any credit for it in the plain. If you go to the hill country, they will recognise you there. They know you, they know how to estimate your dignity, and they honour you.
If you read the verses that follow those which I read you will find how Elizabeth honoured her cousin Mary. What holy and happy communion there was between those two women in the hill country of Judah! And so today, to make it very practical, there are such places. The apostle indicates all this to the Philippians. He says, "*our* common-wealth has its existence in the heavens" (chapter 3: 20), not on the earth. He had just been speaking about people who "mind earthly things", and he says, "they are the enemies of the cross of Christ". He had been speaking about those people, and it says he spoke about them, weeping. People that mind earthly things caused tears to flow from the apostle, from the man who had been in the third heaven; well they might; he had been up to the highest altitude of all, into Paradise, he says. He uses the word Paradise to show the *blessedness* of the place and he used the term "third heaven" to show you the *altitude* of the place (@2 Corinthians 12: 1 - 4).
Do you wonder he sheds tears over those who grovelled in the plain, in the valley? He says, I speak of them, weeping: "they are the enemies of the cross
{105}
of Christ". He does not say they were enemies of Christ. There was not outward opposition to Christ, personally; but man as in the flesh was recognised, and earthly things were fostered. The apostle goes on to say, "*our* commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour". That is the great hill country for Christians. We realise it in some measure as we come together, as we recognise the Holy Spirit. There is a moral elevation where we realise through the Spirit the influence of heaven, and it has a great effect upon us afterwards.
May the Lord grant that, however feebly the subject has been presented, each one may follow it in the Scriptures, and not balk at the exercise. Exercise is needed in order to realise what I have presented. It is easy enough to live in the plain, but there is exercise required to live in the hill country.

SITTING
A. J. Gardiner
@Luke 8: 35; @Luke 10: 38 - 42; @1 Chronicles 17: 16 - 27
I wish to call your attention to three persons who are recorded as sitting. In the first two cases sitting at the feet of Jesus, and in the third case sitting before Jehovah. These I believe, present to us certain features that God looks for in those who are of the assembly. First of all, the feature of moral excellence as taking character from Christ, seen in
{106}
subjection and being clothed; then secondly, the feature of intelligence, which, I think, is what is in view in Mary; and then thirdly, the feature of the spirit of worship. I think God would look for all this in the assembly.
In each case, as I say, the person is spoken of as sitting -- a spiritual habit which we need to cultivate -- the ability to sit; not listlessly, nor self-indulgently, nor self-complacently, but sitting in subjection, and at the same time, in alertness. That is a thing to be cultivated. Perhaps there never was more need of it than today, because the tendency in present-day conditions, with things moving at a great pace, is for the mind to move continually from one thing to another, and it is often difficult to acquire a quiet mind; a mind that is alert, and at the same time restful. That, I believe, is essential -- a quiet mind and a quiet spirit -- if we are to have our part acceptably in the assembly.
While the Lord Jesus Himself is presented to us as sitting, it is not quite in the same way as it applies to us. In the case of the Lord Jesus, His sitting position speaks of exaltation, and of the completion of what He has done. As it is said, "But *he*, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at the right hand of God, waiting from henceforth until his enemies be set for the footstool of his feet" (@Hebrews 10: 12, 13). And then again in Colossians, "seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God" (chapter 3: 1). We are to have the light in our souls that Christ is sitting at
{107}
the right hand of God as indicative of a position of exaltation consequent upon His having completed the work of redemption, and also in order that our minds and affections might be carried to where He is, so as to understand that there is a system of interests connected with Himself where He is, to which we are to devote our attention. He is also presented as sitting as a Refiner (@Malachi 3: 3). That is intended to convey to us the idea that He has a matter in hand to which He is giving deliberate attention, so He sits down to it and attends to it carefully, and deliberately; He is sitting as a Refiner. That is going on amongst His people in this time, especially amongst those in any degree walking in the truth. The Lord's activities as a Refiner are constantly going on, and wisdom lies in recognising it and submitting ourselves.
Now to come to these three. As I said, we do not want to get the idea of sitting, as applying to ourselves, in any listless or self-indulgent way. We read of Eli grown old, sitting by the wayside, his heart trembling for the ark, but having no power to stem the course of evil that was over-running Israel. Then it says, he fell backward and broke his neck, "for the man was old, and heavy" (@1 Samuel 4: 18). We do not want to become like that, through lack of spiritual exercise. Then we read of Saul who was sitting under a tree at Gibeah, his spear in his hand (@1 Samuel 22: 6) -- a man who would gather others around himself, and was marked by motives of self-seeking.
{108}
Now the first of the three who are sitting according to God is the demoniac, or rather the man out of whom the legion had departed; he sets forth the first results of the teaching of grace. He had been brought into touch with the Lord Jesus. He is presented as an extreme case -- one possessed of a legion of demons, but an extreme case is presented in order to show what the divine intention is, that each of us should be marked by the features that marked this man. They come and find this man sitting at the feet of Jesus. Obviously in a position of subjection, and now under a new control; he was clothed, and was now possessed of certain positive characteristics that did not previously mark him; for previously he wore no clothes; he was exposed in his nakedness. Finally, he was sensible -- in his right mind.
Now it may be an elementary thing to say, but it is well to understand that none of us is a free agent, nor is it intended that we should be. Apart from the grace of God, whether men know it or not, they are the slaves of sin. In @Romans 6 it says, "But thanks be to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed" (verse 17) -- ye *were* the bondmen of sin. God's way in grace to secure men and women for the assembly, which is the great object of God's operations in this time, is to bring them under the sway of Christ. He has no other way. It is not God's intention that any one of us should be lawless or marked by self-will. His one way of
{109}
delivering souls from lawlessness, and securing them for Himself and His own pleasure and the assembly, is to bring each one under the influence and sway of Christ.
Now this man was there; he was sitting at the feet of Jesus. It says in @Romans 6 that we were the bondmen of sin, but "have become bondmen to righteousness" (verse 18); not become free agents to do what you will, but you come under the sway of that principle -- righteousness. The world is a great system of sin, where every kind of will and fancy of man is catered for. Now the Lord Jesus has come in and died to sin once, in order that we might understand that God has set us free from the dominion of sin; grace entitles us to reckon ourselves "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus". "He has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God" (@Romans 6: 10, 11).
God has brought in, in Christ, a Man great enough in His own moral excellence to transform everyone brought into touch with Him. Never was it more seen, I suppose, than in the case of the apostle Paul. He was taken up by God to set forth livingly every feature of the truth. He was a pattern sinner, an insolent overbearing man; the kind of man that you would not find it at all easy to get on with. In addition, a blasphemer and persecutor who breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, but what does he become? We all know what Paul became. "I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ" (@2 Corinthians 10: 1).
{110}
He says, "I myself, Paul", as though he would set himself before them. They all knew well what his history had been, but he could now set himself before them and say, "I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ". If Paul had not himself been marked by a spirit of meekness and gentleness, he would not have dared to say that.
I know this is fundamental, but I would urge it upon you, and young believers especially. Do not think, because you have trusted Christ, and received forgiveness of sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, that that is everything. God has indeed forgiven your sins, and you are entitled to rejoice in His favour, for He is holding nothing against you, but has brought you into favour in Christ, the Beloved. You can be in the enjoyment of the love of God, but He intends that you should understand that the One who has redeemed you is the One to whom you are to live.
Christ "gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous for good works" (@Titus 2: 14). You notice what it says, "to himself". Henceforth the believer's attitude of mind and spirit is towards Christ. What a subduing and sanctifying effect that has. You begin to discover in you some element of self-seeking, perhaps seeking a reputation even amongst the people of God, for "The heart is deceitful above all things, and incurable; who can know it?" but then, "I Jehovah search the heart" (@Jeremiah 17: 9, 10). Thank God He does! In faithfulness
{111}
He discloses what is in our hearts, and at the same time freshly reminds us that He Himself went into death that it might be for ever set aside from before God. Our blessing lies in living to Him. As the element of self-seeking or wanting a reputation arises, the Lord speaks to you. He reminds you that He was in the form of God, that He is God; He did not think it robbery to be equal with God -- "did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form" (@Philippians 2: 6, 7).
The Lord reminds us of these things, counteracting what comes to light in our hearts by what is resident in Himself. This man was sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed. He had previously been naked -- worn no clothes; all the wretchedness of the flesh was openly manifest in him. They now find him sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed. What kind of clothing would you like to appear in? God has indicated the Man in whom He delights; it is because of the moral excellence that has come to light in Jesus that God has "highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow" (@Philippians 2: 9, 10): the name of the One who made Himself of no reputation and took a bondman's form. That is the extent to which love would go.
God wants His assembly to be composed of persons who have taken on the features of Christ and of no other -- this is essential. When He had in mind to bring in deliverance for His people Israel in view
{112}
of His house, He raised up David, a man after His own heart. Saul was outwardly head, but he was not the man of God's choice; God found David a man after His own heart and set him up over His people, and in result they all came to appreciate David and repudiate the other man.
This man in @Luke 8 is found sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and sensible. I do not think that supposes a large measure of intelligence, but that his mind is in the right direction. Previously his mind was entirely wrong, under the influence of evil, and @Romans 6 is very much occupied with getting our minds in the right direction. You yield yourself to God, you take account of yourself as "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus" (verse 11). Grace having set us in that position -- bondmen of righteousness -- you are wholly yielded to that principle.
A bondman is completely yielded to the person to whom he is bondman. As yielding ourselves, our "members instruments of righteousness to God" (verse 13), we become bondmen of righteousness, and then it says, "bondmen to God" (verse 22). There is nothing to be ashamed of in being bondmen. Each of the five apostles who have been taken up to write to us, Peter, John, James, Jude and Paul, speaks of himself as a bondman, John in the Revelation, and the others in one or other of the epistles. There is nothing to be ashamed of in being a bondman of righteousness, a bondman of God, a bondman of Christ -- "the freeman being called is Christ's
{113}
bondman" (@1 Corinthians 7: 22). To be bondmen is God's way of completely delivering us and securing us for His pleasure.

PROMOTION
H. P. Wells
@Psalm 75: 6, 7; @Proverbs 22: 4; @Philippians 2: 5 - 11
The thought before me in the above scriptures is that of promotion. The many times in which the Lord Himself makes mention of this subject is, I think, evidence as to the delight it gives to the heart of God to advance those who love Him. By advance, I mean grant them spiritual promotion by the true know-ledge of Himself.
I read the verses in @Psalm 75 because I think they afford us help in a negative way to counteract the natural thoughts that so often actuate us.
Promotion in the world comes in the main in one of two ways -- either by dint of one's efforts, or by influence. The former involves a man's activity and industry, while the latter generally savours of favouritism.
These two principles are very apt to cling to us even in divine things, and without perhaps realising our motives, tend to colour our outlook and ways.
It says, "promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south" (@Psalm 75: 6, Authorised Version). I judge the first two refer to the rising and setting of the sun -- covering, as we may say, the span of man's daily effort and activity. It says, "Man
{114}
goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening" (@Psalm 104: 23). The south, or pasture land, would perhaps convey the idea of ease and favour.
Now if God points out that promotion comes neither by the one way nor the other, we may depend upon it that there is a natural tendency with us to think that it does -- hence the need of the instruction.
It is to be observed, however, in the verse referred to, that there is no reference made to the north, and I venture to suggest that by inference one might conclude -- though it is implied so gently and tenderly, doubtless so as not to cause fear or discouragement -- that promotion does in fact come from that quarter; so that the omissions of Scripture are as important as its statements.
The thought of the north would carry with it the searching character of discipline -- although, let us never forget, it is even so the product of divine love. As in nature the roots of plant growth are promoted and stimulated by the winter, so the roots of the soul are the more firmly founded in the love of God as we come under His gracious education. He in whose school we are found, through grace, alone knows how to temper the north wind with the south and cause our hearts to delight in both. The bride in Canticles could say, "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out" (@Song of Songs 4: 16).
I should like now to refer to Moses as showing how the thing works out with us, for the second scripture I read says, "The reward of humility and
{115}
the fear of Jehovah is riches, and honour, and life".
His position was akin to many of ours. How little we know what the protective hand of God has done for us from our infant days until now, countering on every side the relentless efforts of the destroyer, ceaselessly engaged to submerge us in a thousand ways! Should we not value more deeply the nurture and admonition of the Lord in which we have been brought up (@Ephesians 6: 4)? It has been rendered through our parents, as indeed it was in the case of Moses (@Acts 7: 20), but it is God who has been behind it; for He has kept us with an end in view, and that end is that we might grow by the true knowledge of God.
Now there comes a great break in the early years of Moses. Evidently when quite young he is suddenly plunged from the shelter and influence of a godly home into the midst of the court of Egypt. The seeds sown in childhood are there, however, carefully embedded in his heart, and they start to germinate. He has come to years -- forty years actually -- and he goes out to look upon the burdens of his brethren. What searchings and exercises of heart must have preceded that momentous action!
Oh! that God would give us all a desire to go out and regard the brethren. It is one of the first actions of a man according to God.
But Moses had much to learn! Desire is a great thing, and if the Lord has implanted a desire in our hearts, He will assuredly bring us to the realisation of that desire, but in *His* way, and not in ours.
Moses sees an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew -- one
{116}
of his brethren -- and his whole soul is aflame! He looks this way and that way and rises up, smites him and slays him. This I suggest corresponds to "the east" and "the west". Moses must learn that pro-motion does not come from fleshly activity. It says, "he thought that his brethren would understand that God by his hand was giving them deliverance" (@Acts 7: 25). Looking this way and that way is a dangerous expedient, as Moses himself proved. *Looking up* is surely the only direction from which divine guidance is likely to come.
As the result of his precipitous action we find him in Midian -- caring for a few sheep and leading them to the back side of the desert. But God is over our mistakes! What a comfort this is! We might think, what a come-down for Moses! So it might be in man's mind; but, dear brethren, "The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches, and honour, and life". So he is content to care for a few sheep, for in this way he is to learn in seclusion with God what meekness and gentleness are. Forty years pass (@Acts 7: 30), and with his lessons learnt, he has a wonderful appearing -- so wonderful that the sense of it remained with him, and grew in his soul, until in his departing moments he refers to it -- "the good will of him that dwelt in the bush" -- as being the very climax of all blessing (@Deuteronomy 33: 16).
I would like now to refer for a moment to David, as illustrating this same principle. His introduction to us is as the youngest of eight sons -- in fact, so little thought of that his father hardly considered it
{117}
worth while to bring him before Samuel. He too is keeping his father's sheep.
Notwithstanding all this, however, he had been under secret observation, not only by heaven, but by one, at any rate, of Saul's servants. Saul did not know him nor did Abner; but he had undergone some wonderful experiences with God, unknown to the world at large or even to his brethren. Now the moment comes for God to bring him forward as the deliverer of Israel. Apparently he had kept his experiences to himself until forced to disclose what God had wrought through him by the taunts of his brethren and of Saul. It reminds one somewhat of Paul in @2 Corinthians 12.
There stands David, in the midst of the trembling hosts of Israel, undaunted and with his soul deeply founded in God. Listen to him as he speaks! "Thy servant fed his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and also a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock. And I went after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I seized him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God ... Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine" (@1 Samuel 17: 34 - 37).
What words indeed! What confidence and bold-ness in God! How God delights to promote such a
{118}
man by using him in the service of His saints!
I say no more as to David except this, that he was pre-eminently a man who learnt God in secret, and in discipline, so that when he comes to the end of his pathway, he can speak of himself as the "sweet psalmist of Israel" (@2 Samuel 23: 1)
See too, in what terms he can speak prophetically of Christ! No one could speak like that who had been with God. He says, "he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, a morning without clouds; when from the sunshine, after rain, the green grass springing from the earth" (@2 Samuel 23: 4). What a conception he must have had of coming glory!
More might indeed be said, but this will suffice to bring out the point, that all the discipline through which David passed served but to pave the way for his promotion and enrichment of soul.
In conclusion I would refer to the blessed Lord Himself. He must always be our Pattern and our Guide; so that as the apostle meditates upon the perfect pathway of Jesus, His voluntary downward movements of love, from unsearchable heights to those unfathomable depths, he says, "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus". After detailing His descent, in that pathway which led to "the death of the cross", he adds, "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings, and every tongue
{119}
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to God the Father's glory".
As we delight to sing,
<blockquote>'Gazing on Thee, Lord, in glory, <br>While our hearts in worship bow, <br>There we read the wondrous story <br>Of the cross, its shame and woe' (`302:1) </blockquote>.
This, beloved brethren, is the character of the path the Lord would have us take -- "humility and the fear of Jehovah". Let us not aspire to any prominence or publicity, but rather avail ourselves of every open door to serve such an exalted family as the saints of God in however seemingly humble and obscure way, for "The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches, and honour, and life".

ASSEMBLING
A. H. Griffiths
@Luke 3: 2 - 9, 15 - 17; @Acts 1: 1 - 5, 21, 22; @Hebrews 10: 25
The thought of assembling characterises in a very definite way the present dispensation. The very inauguration of it as recorded in Acts is remarkable, in that it speaks of the Lord Jesus assembling with them during the forty days, as if He would indicate to them this great thought of assembling, and how it should be done, as a feature that was going to characterise the whole dispensation. Indeed it has done, and does; so that we can understand the
{120}
exhortation of the writer to the Hebrews that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together. Then at the end of the dispensation, when the Lord Jesus returns from the glory, we read that He will descend from heaven with an "*assembling* shout" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 16). We are getting very near to that great final assembling, and so it is important that we should examine the thought and become intelligent as to it, and the way it is done.
It has been impressed upon my mind that the aim of the enemy in what is transpiring at the present moment is to frustrate the assembling of the people of God. He has endeavoured on that line in certain parts of the world, and perhaps, alas, to a great extent succeeded. There are great forces at work in the world of a political character, and we know that behind those forces is the power of the enemy that has not just merely political boundaries in view, but the overthrow of the work of God. We need to be aware of this, and to be definitely on our guard in regard of it.
The first feature of being on guard is prayer. "Persevere in prayer" (@Colossians 4: 2), the apostle says, and we need to be watching in prayer that there might be preserved to us these privileges of assembling. Secondly, that we should not too readily surrender them. The enemy will attack in a very insidious and subtle way in his suggestions in regard of them, and we need to be on our guard not to surrender them too readily. As long as the way is open, let us pursue it, let us go forward, let us not
{121}
have a heart of fear, or look too much at the circumstances, but let us bear in mind that what is behind it is a definite attack of the enemy on this matter of assembling. We have for many years enjoyed great privileges under the Lord's good hand. His people have been together much, and we may little realise what God has done in these gatherings, how His work has been proceeding as His people have been assembled together.
I refer now to the character of this assembling, because coming together in a certain place in a physical way is not sufficient in itself. In order to assemble rightly there must be a previous history with God that has brought about certain features and a right spirit, and I believe that the ministry of John the Baptist is a great help in this regard. We may regard his ministry as the closing up of the old dispensation, and in one way it is, but I believe it also lays the basis for the new. The Lord lays much stress upon it. He refers back to it in @Acts 1: 4, 5, and it is mentioned again when the question is raised as to one to take part in the ministry of the apostles: it must be one who had assembled with them all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them, beginning from the baptism of John.
The great feature that marked John the Baptist's ministry was repentance. It had in view the complete and entire disallowance of the flesh -- a ministry that we do not like naturally, and that is not countenanced at all in the great religious world around us. It was not countenanced by the scribes
{122}
and the Pharisees; consequently we read in @Luke 7 that they refused the counsel of God against themselves, because they had not been baptised by John. They were very great men in their own sight, righteous indeed, and very much so in the sight of men, but the ministry of John would cut out all that pretension, taking the ground from under it all. So in the religious world around us the ministry of John the Baptist has no place, and consequently there is not this feature of assembling. But then we need, each one of us, to be preserved in it, and the only way is by the recognition of what the ministry of John would ensure: complete disallowance of every feature of the flesh. It was a baptism of repentance. It is not that we just repent once and then leave that principle behind us. If we are going to be here as assembling rightly, we must maintain the feature of repentance. We must be alive to every feature of the flesh, and there must be in our souls the spirit of repentance in regard of it. Not only that, but it must go in Jordan's water; the death of Christ must be applied to it.
If we are to get the benefit and the gain of our assembling together, it can only be as the flesh is judged and excluded. What kind of exercise marks me before I assemble with the brethren? Do I examine myself? Do I go over soberly in the presence of God the kind of features that have been marking me? And if there have been features of the flesh, do I repent in regard of them and apply the death of Christ? If so, then I am going on towards
{123}
right assembling. So that it says, "every gorge shall be filled". It might be that one brother or sister has the sense that he or she has no importance at all in regard of this assembling. Beloved brother or sister, that gorge should be filled up. You have your part, your place, for we are to think soberly of ourselves. Then that "mountain" or "hill" -- it may be that in a greater or lesser degree one has a sense of importance in relation to the coming together -- that mountain or that hill is to be brought low. Such features cannot be found in the assembly; they are to be dealt with. That crooked way is to be made straight. If my pathway during the week is marked by crookedness, it must be straightened: otherwise I cannot assemble rightly. Then the rough places must be made smooth. If I am marked by a hasty spirit, or an uncontrolled temper or any similar feature, that must be made smooth, or I cannot assemble rightly. In deep exercise of soul before God we need to have these exercises before us in the spirit of repentance.
John goes on to say: "begin not to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham". If we are going to assemble rightly we have to recognise the sovereign rights of God. We cannot say: I have been in the meeting for many years now, and my father before me, and I have a right to a place of prominence. "God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham". He can move sovereignly in raising up whomsoever He will. If we recognise that, we are on
{124}
the line of assembling rightly; but if we are going with a sense of our own importance or with any sense of our natural genealogy as giving us a place there, then we need to have the axe laid to the root of the tree. Every feature of the flesh has to be removed, and entirely different features are to be brought into evidence.
John's ministry is not only negative; he goes on to speak of the "mightier than I" that is coming, "the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to unloose". As assembling we are moving towards the place where Christ is supreme. So John the Baptist speaks of His greatness. He had a profound sense of the greatness of Christ. The greater sense we have of the greatness of Christ the more qualified we are to assemble. John says: "*he* shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire". That is necessary in view of assembling and of coming to the place where Christ is supreme, where every action is in the power of the Holy Spirit, and where the fire of holy judgment is in evidence. It is no light matter to face this assembling, and it behoves us indeed to face it with right exercises in a sober way, remembering that His fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing-floor. No chaff will be countenanced there.

THE CROWN OF LOVE
C. A. Coates
@Ephesians 3: 14 - 21; @Revelation 2: 4; @Revelation 3: 7 - 11
I desire to bring before our hearts the exceeding greatness and blessedness of what the Father would bring us into, not only for our joy but for His own joy and satisfaction.
What we get in @Ephesians 3 is really the crown of everything; you could not conceive anything beyond it. The apostle prays that the Father would grant them according to the riches of His glory to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man. Think of that! The riches of the Father's glory! And it is according to that that we are to be strengthened with might by the Father's Spirit. Now do not let us think that these things are mere sentiment. It is a great moment for every one of our hearts when we come to the sense that divine things are real; they are great realities.
In addressing Philadelphia the Lord says, "Thou hast a little power". It is not a reproach. It means that in the midst of a profession where there is absolutely no strength at all, there is a little company who know what it is in some measure to be strengthened according to the riches of the Father's glory and by the Father's Spirit. That is the source of the "little power" of Philadelphia. I think if our hearts were awakened to the great thoughts of divine love, we should find there was illimitable power, measureless power, to bring our hearts into the crown of the blessings. It is a great thing morally for even one
{126}
heart to enter into the secret delight and pleasure of the Father's heart. Now it is open for every one of us to go in for it. It is greater than any gift; the Father's glory, the Father's love, the love of Christ, lie behind all gift. The most wonderful privilege lies within the reach of each heart. Are we really awakened by the grace of our God to go in for it?
The apostle prays that He would grant them "to be strengthened" by the *Father's* Spirit; that is, the very Spirit of Him who is the Source of all the counsels of love, and it is according to the *riches of* His glory. The Father's Spirit is to be *in* us, and we are to be strengthened with power in the inner man. And what is it for? It is "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God". Oh! what immense things these are. They are the very crown of the blessing. The divine nature, the love of Christ, that is the very crown of the blessing. Cast your little sounding line in and see if you can gather that!
In @Revelation 2 we find that this church (Ephesus) has lost the crown. What the apostle set before the Ephesians might have *attracted* but did not *command* their hearts, and so the Lord has to say, "I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love". They had lost the very crown. You find how faithful, how diligent they were, but they did not
{127}
know these great things -- what it was "to be strengthened with power by his Spirit". Now, beloved brethren, that is just the history of the church; she has lost her crown, she has lost the crown of *love*.
What is so very interesting in Philadelphia is to see that there is a little company at the end to whom the Lord gives back the crown; they have got the love of Christ. What marks them is that they have a little strength, they are strengthened by the Spirit of the Father, and the result of it is, "thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". We find these Philadelphians displayed these things; they kept His word, which is the expression of all that He is in Himself, and His *name* includes His glory. Now, beloved brethren, think of what a thing it is to have enshrined in our hearts His *word* and His *name*! The true distinction of such a company as that is the knowledge of the love of Christ. So He says, "I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee". That is the true distinction of the church, to be *loved by Christ*. And I say, the knowledge of that love is the very crown of the blessing.
The love of Christ is a secret now, a perfect secret between the heart and Christ; but there is a day coming when it will be made public. What a solemn word we have in verse 11, "hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown". If we know what it is to have that crown given back to us, He
{128}
says, 'Hold it fast, do not let any one take it from you'.
Beloved brethren, if our hearts are crowned with divine love, you may depend upon it that all the power of Satan and all the influences of the world will be against us. The great effort of the enemy is to take away the crown. The Lord keep us true to Himself till He come!

FRAGRANCE
W. Findlay
In a certain valley in Romania there is a most beautiful garden containing nothing but roses of most exquisite colour. These are grown specially for the Vienna market. When the season is at its height the perfume of those blooms is such that, if you visit the garden, and come back to the city, people know at once where you have been. You carry the fragrance with you.
Is it not, then, as true, beloved, as we frequent the presence of God, delighting in the beauty, glory, and excellencies of Christ, we may come back to the city and shed the fragrance of that holy scene around? This, too, would give added power to our lip testimony. "They recognised them [Peter and John] that they were with Jesus" (@Acts 4: 13).

SITTING
A. J. Gardiner
@Luke 8: 35; @Luke 10: 38 - 42; @1 Chronicles 17: 16 - 27
Well now, when we come to @Luke 10 we have an advance on chapter 8, and I believe intelligence is more particularly in view in this chapter. In chapter 8 it is a question of subjection especially, and as a result, taking on moral features that are pleasing to God, which are derived from Christ, but chapter 10 is a question of intelligence -- characteristically listening to the word of Christ. The chapter raises the question as to what the Lord looks for and finds in places where His people live. He does not find the same conditions in one place as He does in another. The exercise is, what kind of conditions He is going to find in this place or that? The chapter begins with the Lord sending out seventy, two by two, "into every city and place where he himself was about to come". That is a serious consideration! The Lord sending out the seventy has specially in view Paul's ministry, that is something additional to the ministry of the twelve in chapter 9. The Lord is coming to see what the result is, to take account of what is there as the result of the ministry that He has given.
Well, one cannot dwell on the chapter now, but an important point is that we are to rejoice that our names are written in heaven (verse 20). That is, we keep our mind in that direction, we take account that our calling is heavenly, and this will give its character, lustre and dignity to what there is for God in the place. As in Ephesians -- "walk worthy of the calling
{130}
wherewith ye have been called" (chapter 4: 1). That is, you test things; you test your behaviour in the assembly, you test what is going on in the assembly; is it in keeping with the heavenly calling? Then in the parable of the Good Samaritan, as we speak of it, the Lord shows the spirit in which His interests in the locality are to be cared for -- "Take care of him" (@Luke 10: 35). The spirit really of the new covenant, the spirit of grace; the spirit of supply and not demand; not the official spirit of the priest and Levite, nor the legal spirit of the lawyer; and all in view of the Lord coming to see what there is for God.
In the beginning of the next chapter we have the Lord praying in a certain place, showing the great place that prayer has in this matter, but in between we get this little incident as to the house of Martha, and Mary in it, and what the Lord commends. It says, "And it came to pass ... that *he* entered into a certain village". This is a village with certain per-sons there, and marked by certain features; the next village would not have the same persons and features. What does He find? He finds a spirit of unsubduedness, of activity that is not rightly controlled. Activity for the Lord is good, but let it be rightly directed. Here Martha's activity was out of place, and it brings into relief the attitude taken up by Mary. It says, "she had a sister called Mary, who also, having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word". That is, it was characteristic of her. That is important if there is to be intelligence -- we are to be habitually marked by listening to the
{131}
word of Jesus; as in Colossians, "Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly" (chapter 3: 16). "The Christ" is the anointed Head, the glorious Head of the assembly, and He is always speaking to the assembly. Let us see to it that the ministry which He gives, that which is distinctively from Himself, has a definite place in our lives. That we will not just read it if we have time, but we will *make* time, and not just go to the meetings if we have time, but *make* time. I am not, of course, ignoring unavoidable circumstances that arise to hinder, the Lord knows about that, but I am only urging that this attitude of mind -- listening to the word of Jesus in a spirit of subjection, sitting at His feet -- should characterise us.
The word of Jesus is what comes to us, maybe through the local brethren, through gifts the Lord raises up, or through what is published, but the thing is, to be characterised by listening to the word of Jesus. I do not think we can expect that God will have the pleasure that He desires from the assembly if it lacks in intelligence. In Ephesians it says, "he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence, having made known to us the mystery of his will" (chapter 1: 8, 9). How much do we know about the will of God? Epaphras laboured for the saints at Colosse that they might "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (chapter 4: 12). Let us ask ourselves how much we understand of the will of God. Not so much His will in relation to our pathway, though that has its place, but how much do
{132}
we understand of the will of God which really centres in Christ and the assembly? God desires that we should grow up in intelligence, and that can only be secured as Christ is livingly held as Head in the affections of the saints, and His word is recognised in that light. We do not come to listen to this brother or that brother, but come in the faith of our souls that the Lord, as the living Head of the assembly, will take the occasion to speak, and His word is to be listened to. We have of course to prove all things. The Bereans are commended for that, they are contrasted with the Thessalonians as being more noble because of "receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so" (@Acts 17: 11).
Now the apostle, in writing to the Thessalonians, draws attention to that feature that was lacking in them, and says, "quench not the Spirit; do not lightly esteem prophecies; but prove all things, hold fast the right" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 19 - 21). The feature that was marking the Bereans is the feature that the apostle specially mentions to the Thessalonians when he writes to them. And so the epistle to the Colossians develops this thought of the headship of Christ, and the intelligence that is to flow from it. He warns the saints against "philosophy and vain deceit" (chapter 2: 8), and then says, it is "not according to Christ". That is to say, everything that is presented is tested in that way -- is it of Christ? Is it according to Christ? You notice the Lord commends Mary in saying, "there is need of one" (it really is, that is the
{133}
one thing that is needful); "and Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her".
If in any degree we have become marked by the features of the man in chapter 8, let us see to it also that we seek to take on this feature of characteristically listening to the word of Christ, that we may become intelligent in the mind of God, for God has nothing less than sonship in mind: and that involves affection and intelligence. A father and mother take pleasure in their young children and delight in their affection and simplicity, but they delight in seeing intelligence develop; they rejoice in the time when their children can converse with them intelligently and sympathetically. So God is like that: He wants His children not to remain babes, but to enter intelligently into His own thoughts, and respond to them according to His mind.
Now when we come to Chronicles we have depicted what is greatest. I can only touch on it for a moment, but it says, "king David went in and sat before Jehovah". It was a deliberate movement on his part. He had it in his heart to build a house for Jehovah, but God intercepted him through the prophet Nathan and told him that he was not to build it: it would seem that something was necessary before it could be built. David understands. What is in view now is the assembly as the great vessel of praise and worship Godward; the place where God is served. Are our gatherings together worthy of God? Is our response worthy of the blessed God, is all that takes place in our gatherings suggestive of the
{134}
assembly of God -- the privilege, and dignity, and liberty, and intelligence of such a company? I believe intelligence and subjection are the two great features that should be seen publicly in the assembly as convened. Subjection should be seen in brothers as well as sisters; but I believe sisters are intended to set forth especially the great feature of subjection. Brothers too are to be marked by subjection -- "spirits of prophets are subject to prophets" (@1 Corinthians 14: 32) -- subjection that is governed by intelligence, but intelligence is specially to be seen in the brothers. They should be able to speak intelligently, and move intelligently, whether in the service of God, or ministry towards the saints, and sisters are to set forth the great feature of subjection. So you will remember in @1 Corinthians 14, where the apostle is dealing with the assembly and what is to mark it, he speaks largely of intelligence and understanding, but he insists on the sisters being silent in the assembly and being in subjection (verse 34). Those two features are to mark the assembly: intelligence and subject-ion. In so far as they do, it is worthy of God.
Well now, David as having in his heart to build the house, but being told he must not do it, goes and sits before God. In doing so he sets before us that, if we would develop in the ability to respond to God in a true spirit of worship, we must learn to sit before God, and allow God, so to speak, to become greater and greater before our eyes and hearts, as we take account of what *He* is going to do. Because, after all, God must be supreme; He must be greatest; and the
{135}
more He becomes great before our eyes, the more there will spring up in our hearts the spirit of worship. So God deflects David from the movements which would have occupied him with what *he* was going to do, and he goes and sits before God, and allows what God has said to sink into his mind and heart, and to be impressed with the fact that it is all what God is going to do.
When we apply this idea to ourselves, I have no doubt we find the answer in Ephesians. If the answer to @Luke 10 is in Colossians, the answer to this is in Ephesians where we find the apostle in a spirit of worship; and what is causing the worship? He is really imbued, as he writes that epistle, with a sense of what God is pleased to do for His own pleasure and according to His own glory. "Paul", he says, "apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will" (chapter 1: 1). Then he speaks of "the good pleasure of his will" (verse 5), and the One "who works all things according to the counsel of his own will" (verse 11). "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved" (verses 3 - 6). What great thoughts they are, emanating from God Himself! Only God could have
{136}
conceived them. They are not called forth by any condition of need on our part, for they were formed before the foundation of the world. God would display what He is in His greatness, but more than that, He would set forth what He is in the blessedness of His own heart: sons of men in the place of sonship; involving that a divine Person, in fulness of time, should become Man, accomplishing redemption that we might be brought into it by the grace of God, and stand before Him as sons.
The glory of redemption has shone out -- "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace" (verse 7). There is not only the glory of His grace, but the riches of God's grace, and the incoming of sin has involved that God has shone out in a way that could never have been known otherwise.
There has been a display of holiness, righteousness, grace; there has been a display of mercy and of power, in bringing in everything on the platform of resurrection, and we, as taken up according to divine purpose, are intended to sit down before God and let the sense of the greatness of God sink into our hearts, that there might be produced more real substance, more real, intelligent appreciation of the blessed God, that there might be worship Godward that is worthy of Him. I believe that is set forth in this chapter. David speaks in a real spirit of worship. He says, "Who am I ... ?" and then verse 19 -- "according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness"; and then in verse 20 --
{137}
"Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee"; in verse 21, is the thought of redemption, and how David glories in it; then in verse 24 -- all that God has said, "Let it even be established, and let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, is God to Israel". That is, He is not only the God of Israel, but God *to* Israel. Israel holds Him now in their affections in that regard.
That surely, dear brethren, is our portion -- "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Ephesians 1: 3). He is God, He is that to us, so that as worshipping the Father in spirit and truth, what we come to is that the One we worship in this holy and blessed way, knowing Him as sons, is God, thus known, and He becomes the great theme of worship of His people. God becomes all in all. God would bring this about in the assembly now, that a greater sense of the grace conferred upon us -- that we should be taken up to form part of the assembly -- should be with us. I believe we are to cherish above everything, that we belong to the assembly. We have everything in Christ and the Spirit to enable us now to seize every thought that God has in His mind for the assembly, and we should be developed in our affections and intelligence, and learn to sit before Him, that the sense of His greatness might sink into our hearts. May the Lord help us to cultivate the spirit of sitting at the feet of Jesus, and sitting in the presence of the blessed God!

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 7 -- THE CITY AND THE BRIDE
M. W. Biggs
It is refreshing to look beyond the time of man's brief sojourn here, with its responsibilities and failures, and glance into the period when God will display all that is according to His mind, all that is secured in Christ.
To do this with reference to our own individual career and soul history is encouraging; and it is especially cheering to every one who loves the church of God to do so with regard to the assembly itself, the assembly which Christ will present to Himself without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.
The object of this paper is to direct the heart to that blessed time, and, indeed, beyond or thence-forward to the fixed and unalterable blessedness of eternity.
The Lord Jesus prayed (as we read in @John 17) that there might be a testimony on the part of believers that the world might believe that the Father had sent Him. We believe that prayer has been answered. The testimony was brief, and was soon marred by the heart and hand of erring man. But it existed, and in the days of @Acts 4 it shone brightly. Unselfishness and unity, with great grace and great power, were the marks of that happy company! But it was marred, let us repeat, alas! marred, and the testimony thenceforward became dependent upon individual faithfulness.
But the Lord also prayed that His own might be
{139}
"perfected into one", and that the world might *know* that the Father had sent Him and loved them as Christ was loved (@John 17: 23). This prayer has not yet been answered. The request awaits fulfilment. It will be answered in the age to come.
The church of God as the candlestick, or light-bearer, is the responsible vessel to display the light here while Christ is absent. That it has failed to do this faithfully we have already seen. Testimony is dependent upon the faithfulness of individuals¦, and to answer to the mind of Christ we must "overcome" in the midst of that which professedly bears His name. Thus only can we shine for Him.
The church of God as the city -- the holy city, Jerusalem -- is that in which the light of God's glory will be seen in a coming day. It will be central to a world of righteousness and joy in which all that is of Christ will be displayed.
The church as the light-bearer ought to shed forth the light today: as the city it will do so in a coming day.
We shall not attempt to prove that the holy city is a figure of the church. Many a time has this been done. We shall content ourselves by drawing a few practical lessons from the description of the city in @Revelation 21.
¦A path of collective privilege is still possible, but this is quite another subject, and also the testimony itself is not altered in character.
{140}
(1) The prophet-apostle John sees, in vision, the holy city descending from heaven, having the glory of God. The vision refers to a future time when judgment will have fallen on apostate Christendom and the false witness will have been rejected by the Lord, as He so plainly said in @Revelation 3: 16. It is a solemn reflection that this is the end towards which professed Christianity is hastening.
The present world, too -- that is, the world system -- will have been brought to nothing, and earth itself will have been cleansed from the defilement of sin by the judgment of God. Then it is that the church, the holy city, descends from heaven and comes with Christ to reign over the earth. We need not remark that before this could take place the Lord will call His own to be with Him. The Bridegroom will come and take home His bride. @1 Thessalonians 4: 15 and @John 14 are two passages which clearly refer to this blessed fact. The immediate hope of the church is the coming of Christ to take her to be with Himself. Today it is a time of fasting for the believer, for the Bridegroom has been taken away (@Luke 5: 34, 35). But His word assures us He is coming again. What joy unspeakable it will be when we see His blessed face!
@Revelation 21 is after this; in fact, the first eight verses refer to eternity, verse 9 commences a detailed description of God's holy city.
First, then, the city is heavenly. It comes down from the place to which it belongs. It is to be feared that we forget that we are a heavenly people and that
{141}
our interests are heavenly. We do not say that they *ought* to be, but that they *are* heavenly, for this is the way scripture speaks (@Philippians 3: 20).
How slow we are to realise this and to take up our own proper interests! The church, that is, the company comprising all believers today, is a heavenly company -- heavenly in its calling and character. We are not of the world, and presently Christ will come and take us to be with Himself in heaven.
It is saddening to a degree to observe how eagerly the political and other interests of this world are pursued by those whose interests are really heavenly, and who at any moment may be taken to heaven by Christ. How deadening, too, is earthly-mindedness! The apostle wept as he spoke of some who were characterised as "minding earthly things".
The church is to be taken to heaven, thence to return with Him when He comes again to reign over this earth, where He is at present rejected. And God is forming us now, forming our souls, with a view to our fulfilling our part as the holy city, which comes down from heaven and will be the centre of interest and influence in that day. It descends from heaven and bears a heavenly influence.
(2) The next feature we may notice is that the city has the glory of God.
By glory we understand the expression of excellence. God has been revealed. His holiness, mercy, grace and righteousness, as well as His nature, love, have been declared in Christ. God's
{142}
excellence has been expressed, and, in the passage we are considering, what came out in Jesus is seen characterising the holy city. It shines with light which is derived not from any improvement of fallen man, but from the glory of God. Christ is its light!
The light will be pure and unalloyed then. There will be no sin to darken, no will of man to pervert the clear shining of God's glory through this chosen vessel, the church.
This glory is enshrined in the church today. "Ye are the temple of God", says the apostle, in @1 Corinthians 3: 16, and in God's temple every whit utters His glory. We should bear that character now.
(3) Flowing from this, and dependent upon it, we read that there is no need of any natural light.
The greatest natural light is eclipsed by that glory which is above the brightness of the sun. It was this glory, this light, which arrested Saul of Tarsus, and thenceforth Paul, the "bondman of Jesus Christ" (@Romans 1: 1), is superior to the need of any earthly light, light of mere human intelligence and learning.
In the epistle to Colossians the apostle seeks to place believers in the advantage of this superiority now. The imaginations of the natural mind, the searchings of philosophy, the fleshly efforts of a legal soul, are viewed as not only an uncertain light, and therefore worse than useless, and they are a slight on Christ, they draw away from Him. All fulness dwells in Him. He is the Head, as we have before remarked, and, if only we are in touch with Him, all earthly light grows dim.
{143}
This will be so actually with the church in the day of glory. The glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the vessel through which every ray of that glory is given.
(4) We must not overlook that nought that defiles can enter the holy city.
Great details are given as to the walls of the city, and their height and foundations are carefully noted. And although the gates of the city are always open, all entrance therein is guarded. It is the holy city. God is there! And nothing that defiles can enter. It is not merely that it may not, it cannot enter. It is not possible for defilement to be there. What a clear, untainted atmosphere this is! Our renewed souls long to dwell in such a place and to breathe such air!
The city is heavenly, it has the glory of God, it is superior to all natural light and it is secure from evil!
<blockquote>'O bright and blessed scenes, <br>Where sin can never come; <br>Whose sight our longing spirit weans <br>From earth, where yet we roam' (`64). </blockquote>
We noticed a verse in 2 Chronicles lately. It reads: "And he set the door-keepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that no one unclean in anything should enter in" (chapter 23: 19). Are not good door-keepers needed today? Have they always been watchful at the gates? We fear not, alas!
But in the time we are considering the church will be without spot. It will be a 'glorious church'. And no evil will be therein.
{144}
What an influence, what a power, such a heavenly company will be. We believe the church will impress the character (which she herself will derive from Christ) upon all who walk in the glorious light which she will shed abroad.
Let us see beyond the mere figure used here, otherwise we may become material in our thoughts. Every soul saved from Pentecost to the Rapture will go to make up this glorious assembly. The influence will be a spiritual or moral influence. The traits of Jesus will have been reproduced in us.
The precious stones, the beauty and the elegance of the holy city are being formed today. The Spirit of God is forming Christ in the souls of those who have believed the gospel. The work is steadily going on and is a divine work. It is not visible yet, but in the day of glory all will be manifested.
It is difficult to conceive the wonderful place the church will occupy in the world to come, the coming day of glory, unless we see that it is the reproduction of what is of Christ, the fruit of the work of the Holy Spirit. It will be the medium of heavenly influence over the earth. God's throne will be there. Christ will be there. His presence will be enjoyed and His character expressed. "They shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads" (@Revelation 22: 4).

THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK -- A GOD-GIVEN CONCEPTION
C. M. Menzies
Considerable uncertainty exists in the minds of many dear believers as to the Lord's day (@Revelation 1: 10), which is the first day of the week, and the Sabbath day which is the seventh day of the week. The fourth commandment (@Exodus 20: 8) is often made to refer to the Lord's day, though actually it refers solely to the seventh or last day of the week. In the early church no such confusion existed between the two days until the fourth century, when the Roman Emperor Constantine legalised the keeping of Sunday and theologians began to tack the name of Sabbath on to that day.
The keeping of the Sabbath by the Jews was allowed by their Roman conquerors. It would have been easy for the first Christians, most of whom were Jews, to have continued to have observed that day and avail themselves of the Roman clemency in regard to the seventh day of the week. Instead of this we find that the first day of the week was observed from the very first inception of Christianity. This remarkable fact is a most striking testimony to the truth of the resurrection. The Sabbath day had been kept by the Jews because God had rested on the seventh day (@Genesis 2: 3); the Lord's day was observed by the Christians because it was the day the Lord Jesus rose from the dead. This stupendous miracle, the resurrection of Christ, has given colour to the whole of the christian dispensation and,
{146}
marking the importance of His rising from the dead, the day on which He rose has been divinely selected as the special occasion of the assembling together of the church.
We find the disciples behind closed doors on that first Lord's day, when Jesus came and stood in the midst and said, "Peace be to you" (@John 20: 19). Eight days after (which is the Jewish equivalent to our week, the first and the last days being each counted in calculating the eight), again the disciples were found within, and again they were favoured by the presence of Christ in their midst. Thus, at the very inauguration of the present dispensation, our blessed Lord delineated in a way clearly apparent to faith that it was His wish for us to be found together on the first day of the week. The disciples were found assembled two Lord's days in succession, and on each occasion the Lord vouchsafed His presence. It is thus not difficult for us to understand when the same writer, John, speaks of being in the Spirit on the Lord's day, that he is referring to the first of the week and not to the Sabbath or any other day.
We have now seen how on two successive first days of the week the Lord Jesus drew attention to the day by His presence. A few weeks later heaven called attention to the first day of the week yet once again. It was surely no accident that God had ordained that the feast of Pentecost should be observed on the first day of the week. In @Leviticus 23:16 it is distinctly commanded that the feast was to be kept on "the morning after the seventh
{147}
sabbath". This shows us that seven weeks from the resurrection to the very day, was the date selected on which the Holy Spirit, another divine Person, would come and take up His dwelling place in the church. We are told that this occurred when they were all together in one place. It is again a first day of the week, again they are gathered together in a house, and that was the day chosen by heaven for them to be all filled with the Holy Spirit.
A few years later, the apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians an inspired epistle instructing them as to church order. At the end of his letter he gives injunctions as to the collection (@1 Corinthians 16: 1, 2). He instructs them that each week, as the Lord had prospered them, each was to lay aside at home. He definitely names the day on which this was to be done. It was the first day of the week.
If we turn to the twentieth chapter of the Acts, we see that the assembling together of the church in a place on the first day of the week was the recognised custom of the saints in those early days. Moreover, they assembled on that day for the breaking of the bread (verse 7): "The first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread". It is to be noted that the keeping of the Lord's supper was not an occasional act held a few times each year, but weekly, and at the beginning of each week.
Scholars tell us that the word used for "Lord's" is a special one in the original Greek and only used in one other place in the whole of the Scriptures. The second occasion is in @Revelation 1: 10, where the
{148}
identical word is used for the *Lord's* day. The Spirit of God in utilising this special word has linked the two thoughts, the Lord's supper (@1 Corinthians 11: 20), and the Lord's day (@Revelation 1: 10). This is confirmed as we find the brethren at Troas meeting to break bread on the first day of the week. Scripture in itself is sufficient for the obedience of faith of the Christian.
It may however be remarked in passing, that early church history amply evidences that Christians regularly observed the Lord's supper on the Lord's day. The Sabbath day had thus been set aside just as had other Jewish festivals and ordinances. They were not under law but under grace. In fact, the Colossians were told to let none judge them "in matter of feast, or new moon, or sabbaths" (chapter 2: 16), and the Galatians were rebuked for returning to Judaism and for observing "days and months and times and years" (@Galatians 4: 10).
When the history of the church on earth will be terminated by her rapture to heaven (@1 Thessalonians 4: 16, 17), God will again operate with His earthly people and Israel will revive. The keeping of the Sabbath will be again resumed and have divine approval. When the image of the beast is set up in the temple, the faithful Jew is told to flee to the mountains. He is moreover to pray that his flight is not on the Sabbath day (@Matthew 24: 20). On that day they would be limited in the distance of their flight to that of a "sabbath day's journey" (@Acts 1: 12), hence the need for prayer that it might be a day other than the Sabbath which they will then have to
{149}
remember and keep holy.
For the Christian the Sabbath day as an ordinance has been put on one side. It belongs to the Jewish economy and not to the church. We have been made dead to the law by the body of Christ that we might be to Another, who has been raised from among the dead (@Romans 7: 4). The Christian cherishes the Lord's day -- the day his Lord arose -- a day specially marked out for him by God during the present church period on which he gathers with his brethren to break bread. Let us be thankful for the providence which has so ordered the laws of the land as to enable us to be free from the mundane claims of other days to devote ourselves to the Lord in a special way on the first of the week. Let us yield ourselves to Him; then the remainder of the week will be coloured by a right beginning on the first day.
Present-day conditions call for the constant exercise of reverence. This should particularly mark us in a manifest regard for the Lord's day. The one-time regard for religion, which treated the day as sabbatic and rigidly demanded a punctilious sobriety in clothes and behaviour, has now largely passed. On every hand we observe a falling away even from the formal recognition of God. Sporting clothes and frivolous manners are the new fashion. What is to be the attitude of the Christian in the face of the godless change of the past quarter-century? Should he chameleon-like change with a changing back-ground? When the enemy shall come in like a
{150}
flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him (@Isaiah 59: 19). Let us not drift with the flood-tide of evil, but seek to show by our dress, deportment, and holy conversation that we reverence the Lord and the Lord's day, not in stiff legality but as unto Him. We are in the world that has refused Him, and nailed Him to a cross. Though in that world we are not of it, even as He is not. By maintaining separation from the world, others too may take courage who may be clinging to the driftwood of Christendom. The Lord would have us to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works (@Titus 2: 14).

EBEN-EZER
J. B. Stoney
@1 Samuel 7: 1 - 17
It is important for us to consider and apprehend how prayer is used in times of great difficulty. Samuel is himself the gift of prayer, as his name declares (@1 Samuel 1: 20, and footnote c), and he, in his service toward Israel, uses prayer above any of his predecessors; in fact, he introduces and proves to us the power of prayer. Other servants of God were distinguished for works of another kind; Samuel peculiarly for prayer, and hence his ways are very instructive to us. Other powers had been used and other works wrought by devoted servants of God. Samuel sets forth the power of prayer. What made
{151}
man something is now set aside in Israel, because of their failure. What God can be and do for them when called on is now declared and shown out by Samuel. He came in by prayer, and his power and the secret of his successful rule in Israel is prayer. We therefore cannot fail in obtaining from him how we ought to use prayer. We prove that we have used a thing rightly by the effect it has upon us, the good fruit shows that that from which it came was good.
There is the sucking lamb offered up wholly as a burnt-offering; this represents Christ, the ground of our acceptance. It is the day of acceptance; *the accepted time* (@Isaiah 49), a great encouragement to prayer, as well as the ground of it, and then Samuel cried unto Jehovah and Jehovah heard him, and as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel, but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited them, and they were smitten before Israel. "And Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, and said, Hitherto Jehovah has helped us".
When we have received mercy from the Lord it is most important that we own it. The monument that perpetuates the mercy is not the mercy itself, but the Eben-ezer is the acknowledgement of the heart of how God has helped and succoured us. The mercy conferred was great and singular -- a bright page in their history, a day ever to be remembered for the deliverance from the Philistines, and the marvellous
{152}
way in which it was effected for them. But it is not the thing done, nor the way the thing was done, that is the monument. The Eben-ezer is the testimony of the heart to the unfailing help of God. "Hitherto Jehovah has helped us". It is the thanksgiving which accompanies prayer. It is the acknowledgement that I know and own Him as my Helper hitherto. The mercy may remain or it may pass away; the Eben-ezer ever remains. I have not only received, but I know the One from whom I have received. I have a fixed judgment about Him, an Eben-ezer. It is the judgment I have come to and I record it, that is the monument, and this is the real strength of the heart. It is distinct and positive to me that it is His hand which has wrought. It is the basket of the first-fruits in Canaan. I believe souls lose immensely by not being able to record more distinctly that hitherto He has helped them.
In the addresses to the churches, Philadelphia and Laodicea (@Revelation 3), two things must be noted and kept much in mind. One is how Christ presents Himself to us in order that we may have true confidence in Him, and be enabled, because of what He is, to go forward in spite of all difficulties, and the other is, that we should not have self-confidence. Our tendency is not to have confidence in Him, and though we have prayed, yet we have but few Eben-ezers, few monuments, fixed judgments in our hearts of the power of Christ, and then we seek for confidence in ourselves which easy circumstances tend to feed.
{153}
One prays largely and fully in proportion as one has confidence in God as He is for us, if one feels, as he must, the contrariety of things here. If I can thank Him as knowing Him much, if I have a sure Eben-ezer, I can easily and simply look to Him. The one who is doubting or questioning is only at best looking for an Eben-ezer -- the one who knows Christ now as having the key of David, opening and no man shutting, is the one to whom an opened door is given. It is as he knows Christ in this power that he has the use and the knowledge of this power. If he does not know Christ as such he cannot know that he has an opened door.
I cannot enter into the blessing promised to Philadelphia if I do not know Him after this manner, and if I do, I must be conscious of His help and support, and I simply own it. I am not self-satisfied, that is Laodicea. In Laodicea there is no sense of wanting or of using help. If I feel I want it, and am using it, I am not Laodicean, and if I am using it I must know the value of it, and it is simple honesty for me to own it, but this is not Laodicean. The state in Laodicea is a senselessness -- at ease in one's circumstances, a need of nothing, no sense of the use of help, for there is no sense of needing it.
In Philadelphia there is a sense of need of help, and there is the knowledge of the gain of it. I am in the one case senseless, and therefore at ease with things as they are; in the other, I am using the help and the strength given me to overcome the difficulties in my way, and I therefore own the
{154}
favours conferred on me. It is not circumstances which afford me ease and confidence, it is success over opposing forces, a very different thing -- the results of conflict, the cheerful, but yet the known results of conflict and of aid conferred on me, while easy circumstances tend to make me self-confident and independent of God.
The great principle, as I may term it, of prayer, is that I know whom I am addressing, and I am reckoning on His help, whom I know can help me, and owning it, refreshing my soul, encouraging it with the fixed judgment -- the Eben-ezer -- I have of His help hitherto. If I ask, I must ask in faith, nothing doubting; it is expecting to receive and owning that I have received. We see this principle maintained in Solomon's dedication of the temple (@1 Kings 8). Whatever their difficulty, their eye is set on the temple that there should be help and relief, but then they knew what the temple was in its own place and glory. They owned its greatness and service as toward them hitherto while they returned to it now again for help; you see this in @2 Chronicles 20: 5 - 10.
In times of great difficulty, when the true-hearted are struggling out of the confusion, as with Ezra (chapter 9: 5 - 15), there is a full acknowledgement of how God has given us a Nail in His holy place and a reviving while seeking to be more conformed to the holiness of His name. You see he had proclaimed a fast and had sought the Lord, in @Ezra 8: 21; now with Nehemiah (@Nehemiah 9), the day after the separation
{155}
(another separation besides the one in the days of Ezra), he recounts all the wondrous ways of God with them, and confesses that their guilt was that they "refused to obey, neither were they mindful of thy wonders" (verse 17), yet "many times didst thou deliver them, according to thy mercies" (verse 28). The confession, it will be remarked, was consequent on the fast.
The same in @Daniel 9: 21 - 23; again in @Habakkuk 3: 19, the Lord God is His strength. We ought to regard prayer as the prelude to blessing. I know what and how God has helped, and am expecting and reckoning on His help. I find with our Lord, that great events occurred after prayer (see @Luke 6: 12 and @Luke 9: 18 - 28; so in the @Acts 13: 3; @Acts 14: 23), the precursor of blessing. It is not merely to own weakness and need, but to expect help and succour. If we pray, it is because our expectations are in God; Elias was a man of like passions, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain. If we ask anything according to His will He heareth us. We may forget that prayer is the great medium through which, as promised us, God now blesses. "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name" (@John 14: 13). It is to receive from God that I come to Him and to receive in addition to what I have already received, and hence there is encouragement of heart to pray for those who are progressing (see Ephesians and Colossians).
Prayer should be regarded as a mighty engine through which the resources of God are made available to us. As I have availed myself of this
{156}
engine, and as I exercise my heart in my fixed judgment, my Eben-ezer, as touching what He has been to me, the more am I encouraged and in faith able to pray. And our prayers fill the golden censer, therefore continue in prayer with thanksgiving.

ASSEMBLING
A. H. Griffiths
@Luke 3: 2 - 9, 15 - 17; @Acts 1: 1 - 5, 21, 22; @Hebrews 10:25
In the Acts of the Apostles we find the evangelist [Luke] writing to one the second time. As we have often been reminded, at the beginning of Luke's gospel he addresses this person as "most excellent Theophilus", but here the "most excellent" is omitted. The ministry of John and the ministry of the Lord had been effective with Theophilus, and that title of honour has disappeared. He is now a fit subject for assembling, the reduction of all that he was after the flesh has taken place, and he can be addressed simply by his name, Theophilus.
Then he is reminded concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach as presented in the gospel. I believe that the consideration of this would greatly further the preparation for assembling, for it affects the spirit and increases our appreciation of Him. It says, "all things which Jesus began both to do and teach", implying that the doing and teaching still go on. How beautifully He would do things for us and teach us in our individual pathways! How He would subdue our spirits by
{157}
what He does! I am sure that if during the week I have the personal touch of the Lord in something that He does for me, it will be with a very subdued spirit that I shall assemble. Look at the way He acted with that woman in @Luke 7 -- what an impression it must have left on her spirit! Look too, at what He did with that man on the Jericho road, as seen in the parable (@Luke 10). How tender was His touch as He poured in that oil and wine; how skilful He was as He bound up those wounds, and how tender the grace as He placed him on His own beast! Think of Him as Mary sat at His feet, listening to His word -- what an impression that must have left upon her spirit! Such persons were being qualified for assembling.
No doubt many, if not all, of these people spoken of in the gospels would be found amongst this concourse of disciples to whom the Lord Jesus showed Himself alive, and with whom He assembled. How subdued they would be, how their hearts would be filled with the greatness of the One who had taught in their midst! What sobriety would mark them in every movement as they came together! How beautiful to see the saints of God assembling together! It is not merely attending church or attending meetings. This feature of assembling is a most dignified thing, as the coming together of those to whom grace has been ministered by the Lord Jesus, those carrying with them features that have emanated from deep exercises of soul. So we find a wonderful concourse as the Lord Jesus
{158}
assembled with them. Various types of individuals -- an impulsive Peter, sons of thunder, men who had been jealous one of another; yet, under the influence of the Lord Jesus in what He did and taught, all those features had been subdued.
Then it speaks of His commandments. As we assemble together it is as governed by the Lord's commandments. In the epistle to the Corinthians we read: "the things that I write to you ... it is the Lord's commandment" (@1 Corinthians 14: 37). We have, alas, around us many of the Lord's beloved people who have rebelled against those commandments and thus have removed from the ground of true assembling. Features of the flesh come into evidence, the Holy Spirit does not govern the situation, and the result of it is that in the orderings and ordinances of man the Lord Jesus is displaced. How important it is that we should be subject to the Lord's commandments, so that we may be able to assemble rightly. So it says, He assembled with them. As we come together the Lord would desire to assemble with us. He says, "there am I in the *midst*" (@Matthew 18: 20).
Then we read that the apostle to be appointed in the place of Judas was to be one who had "*assembled* with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us". This one had to be qualified in regard of assembling; he had to understand it, to know its features, in order that this great thought might be carried forward in the dispensation.
{159}
I would like to draw attention to that word "came in". Suppose we were gathering together, assembling, and the Lord Jesus was assembling with us, how do you think He would come in? What kind of demeanour would mark Him as He came in? Many of us have been impressed by a spiritual man, one who is near to the Lord Jesus, in the very way he comes in. There is no evidence of pride, no prominence of the flesh; but a spirit of meekness, of lowliness, of grace, and yet of dignity, that marks such a one as he comes in. Whence do such features emanate? They come, beloved brethren, from secret history with God. They come from those deep soul exercises beginning from the baptism of John. They come from that constant service of the Lord Jesus in what He does and teaches, and from subjection to His commandments. It touches us as we think of how He would come in, and it tests us as to how we come in. This assembling is a dignified matter, and we should be desirous of being spiritually equal to it.
Then it is not only that He came in, but that He "went out". How the Lord Jesus would go out! Think of the dignity that would mark Him, not only in His coming in but in His going out. How it tests us as to how we go out! Is there with us that sobriety of spirit, that dignity becoming to those who have been assembled, who have been in the sphere where the Lord Jesus is supreme, where the Holy Spirit is in control, where everything is governed by the Lord's commandments? How do we go out? It is sad when things immediately drop down to an ordinary
{160}
level.
It says the Lord Jesus "presented himself living" (verse 3), and these are living movements. What dignity would mark a spiritual person in coming in and in going out! How completely in accord with the position it would be, and how pleasurable to God! God looks down with holy delight upon the assembling of His people when they are on this level, as He did during those forty days as they assembled, the Lord Jesus assembling with them. He looks for a continuance of those same features. He would have them continued right to the very end, and, as these features mark us, the work of God will proceed. Every time we come together there will be some furtherance of this work, some further increase of Christ.
"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together". We should jealously guard it, and be concerned about it; and "so much the more as we see the day drawing near". The day is approaching, and it is not far distant, when there will be that final assembling shout. Every feature of flesh will disappear, and we will go to meet the Lord in the air. We are learning how to assemble in view of that day, and we should do so more and more as the day approaches. The work of God will proceed as the result of it and there will be the increase of Christ.
Let us not, beloved brethren, forsake the assembling of ourselves together.

THREE ASPECTS OF THE FLOCK
M. W. Biggs
@Matthew 26: 31; @Luke 12: 32; @John 10: 16
There are three expressions in the gospels in connection with the *flock*: (1) "the sheep of the flock shall be scattered" (@Matthew 26: 31); (2) "Fear not, little flock" (@Luke 12: 32); and (3) "there shall be one flock, one shepherd" (@John 10: 16). There is the scattered flock, the little flock, and the one flock. The first expression is used in connection with the government of God, the second with regard to our place under the care of the Father and His good pleasure concerning us, and the third is linked with the thought of the good Shepherd, who gives His life for the sheep, and the unity known in all the sheep having one Shepherd.
Although the first expression had especial reference to those who were associated with the Lord as Messiah here, it also has an application to ourselves as coming under similar governmental dealings. Because of the state of His earthly people, God had to smite the Shepherd. This expression does not refer to atonement, though what wrought atonement then took place. It alludes to God's governmental action in smiting Christ as Messiah. Every possibility of blessing was presented in Christ to God's earthly people. But instead of appreciating God's gracious proposals, religious man desired to remain away from God. The Lord could say, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem ... . how often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens
{162}
under her wings, and ye would not!" (@Matthew 23: 37). Hence judgment, not blessing, must be their portion, and since they are to be judged, their Messiah has also to be cut off and have nothing. (See also @Psalm 102). How very deeply the Lord felt this! Many psalms speak of His sorrows in this connection; for the smiting was from Jehovah. "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, even against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts" (@Zechariah 13: 7).
How could there be unity if Christ be not owned? How could God allow His people to remain as one if He who was their only true Centre be refused? No, the Shepherd must be smitten and the sheep scattered. God could not allow to continue that which should have been a testimony to Him, if it cease to bear its true features, if Christ has not His place. If the staff "Beauty" is broken, if the relationship of the people with God is broken, the staff "Bands" can exist no longer; the brotherhood between Judah and Israel ceases (@Zechariah 11: 7 - 14).
Is there not a parallel to these circumstances in the history of the church? Could God allow the outward unity of the church to continue if He who is the only Centre be not owned? Hence, in the government of God, the divisions of the church have become a proverb. Its hundreds of fragments, and the scattered condition of the flock, speak of the solemn action of God's government. The wheels of God's government have rims so high that they are terrible! And therefore any attempt at outward reunion would be a rebellion against God's
{163}
government and would bring disaster.
We cannot ignore this. To assume the condition of the flock to be other than it is, to assume the glory of Jerusalem when only Galilee becomes us, is to find ourselves without support.
Galilee? Yes; there is Galilee. The Lord held out a very precious promise to His followers even in so dark a day as @Matthew 26, when He was betrayed and crucified. The sheep were to be scattered, and His own would have to share in the common shame. But He adds, "after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee" (verse 32). So again the angel in @Matthew 28: 7, "he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him". And thus it occurred. "But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them" (verse 16).
Far away from Jerusalem with its desolate temple, in the little-thought-of Galilee there was a spot where Jesus was seen! In Matthew's account there could be no gathering in Jerusalem. God had already set Jerusalem aside virtually. The Lord had left the temple; He had foretold its utter destruction; He had pronounced the severest woes on the religious leaders of the day. But there was Galilee. Who was in the secret to meet Him there? How little alive was Jerusalem to that wondrous meeting in Galilee! In that publicly despised place there was a mountain where a few of the scattered flock were meeting the risen Christ. Again we may say, What a meeting!
And this has an answer today. Is there anything
{164}
that answers to Galilee? There is. As we recognise the evil marking that which bears the name of Christ, as we realise that Christ is morally outside the Laodicean condition of a self-sufficient church, and as we hear the Lord's command that every one who names His Name should depart from iniquity (@2 Timothy 2: 19), we are enabled to take a path answering to meeting the Lord in Galilee. We may follow righteousness, faith, love and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. It is a despised position, as Galilee was; but we shall find support there.
In the triumph of His glorious resurrection He says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth" (@Matthew 28: 18). Only those who knew the rejected and risen Christ, and who had obeyed His commands, heard those wonderful words. And the Lord adds that He would be with them. The Sun of God's world, that great Source of power, was to faith already risen. What a change from the position of @Matthew 27, when crowned with thorns and robed in scarlet He was mocked by those who bowed the knee to Him. That was public. It was a thing not done in a corner. It took place in Jerusalem, the centre of the religious world. And therefore it could only be in Galilee that they could see Him. They obey His commands, they render homage to Him and they have His support.
So it is also today. Have you obeyed His commands, dear reader? Have you found this hallowed spot? It is a despised but a hallowed place.
{165}
And only if we obey the Lord's commands can we find it.
The "little flock" is spoken of in @Luke 12. In striking contrast to the covetous-prudence which marks the nations of the world, the Lord calls attention to the dependence on God which should mark His own. The chapter opens by showing the moral gain of fearing God alone, confessing Christ the Son of man, and depending upon the Holy Spirit. These features should always mark us.
An appeal by one of the crowd to the Lord that He should speak to his brother to divide an inheritance, affords the Lord an occasion further to develop the subject of dependence on God. The nations of the world seek after things of this life. Questions such as, What shall we eat? what shall we drink? how shall we dress? engage them. But the Lord's disciples are not to be so occupied nor to be in anxiety. Their *Father* knows they need these things. They are to seek His kingdom and all these things would be added. "Fear not, little flock, for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom", the Lord says. The kingdom of the Father refers to the heavenly side of the world to come. Hence the reference to providing treasures in *heaven*. Poor in this world, rich in faith, heirs of the kingdom, were to be their traits.
It has been remarked that the gospel of Luke presents the interest of heaven in men. Matthew presents what is dispensational and the rule of heaven on earth. In John what is in nature spiritual
{166}
and heavenly is brought before us, as well as what is divine manifested here below. But in Luke heavenly sympathy and the interest of heaven in men are seen, and man's place in heaven is suggested. Hence the "little flock" have a heavenly portion.
The little flock reminds us of the four things which are little upon earth, one of which is the ant who prepares its meat in summer (@Proverbs 30: 24, 25). How entirely new to a Jewish mind such a thought as providing treasure in *heaven* must have been!
The earthly inheritance is to be eclipsed by the heavenly. The wisdom of the ant is to find its antitypical counterpart. Our hearts are where our treasure is. This is one side. It is our Father's good pleasure to give us a heavenly portion. Rich in faith: our riches and interest are connected with heaven. On the other hand our Father will take care of us here. Nothing is so apt to hinder our enjoyment of heavenly things as seeking after earthly ones, or anxiety as to them. Our Father knows what we need. But He is not caring for us in order to make us more comfortable or better off here. He cares for us that we may be free from care, and hence at liberty to seek what is our real portion and set our minds on things above.
"Little flock". How the very words rebuke all earthly pretension. Anything great here is out of keeping with this. What failure marks the assembly in this respect. She is called to follow One for whom there was no room in the inn, who had not where to lay His head and who died on the cross.
{167}
As to the religious world, a position morally answering to Galilee should be ours. As to earthly things, the thought of the "little flock" forbids anything great. Heeding the teaching of the epistle to the Hebrews would place us outside the camp, bearing His reproach. This answers to Galilee. The exhortations in the epistle to the Colossians would lead our hearts from earth to heaven. Glory and display belong to another day; the little flock cannot be great here. Their treasure is Christ 'in a brighter sphere'. The closing utterances of Stephen in @Acts 7 show us our treasure -- Christ in glory; the baptism of the Ethiopian in @Acts 8, and the passage quoted from Isaiah, shew us our place here -- "his life is taken from the earth" (@Acts 8: 33).
"There shall be one flock, one shepherd". This expression is found in @John 10: 16. The Lord died to gather together unto one the children of God which were scattered abroad.
What we are religiously and naturally often prevents practical unity. The flock is one in *divine* life. Hence, to realise the unity of the flock in a practical way, it is first necessary for each to pass through experience answering to that of the blind man of @John 9. His is the history of a sheep being led out of the Jewish fold. We must move after the Lord individually. The Lord is outside and He calls us by name. How sweet this individual call by the Lord! It was a similar call that Peter had when he left the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus. If we do not have the sense of a call from the Lord, we may
{168}
easily return to that which we have professedly left. But if we hear His voice we follow Him and we could not go away from Him. (See @John 6: 68).
To follow the Lord as here spoken of is not quite following in His steps where He was, as the epistle of Peter says. @John 10 refers to following Him so that we find ourselves in His company and in the company of the flock. The Lord led His sheep, who were in the Jewish fold, out of these associations; and He brings His "other sheep" out of their associations. Everybody has some circle of associations in which he morally lives according to his natural life. It may be in religious, political or social associations. But in following the Shepherd, who has called us by name, we find ourselves outside these associations and within the circle of the "one flock". The sheep have all heard the Shepherd's voice and followed Him. "There shall be one flock, one Shepherd".
How encouraging it is to get this view of the saints! Whatever the place of outward reproach, even a Galilee, however little they may be here as to circumstances, there is a dignity and a greatness in the "one flock" that surpasses any religious glory or earthly importance. If we recognise this, it delivers the heart and lifts it above every religious or national distinction. The good Shepherd died for us and has called us by name and brought us to one flock. We cannot recognise anything less than this, and there certainly cannot be two flocks.
It is in this circle eternal life is known. "I give
{169}
them life eternal" (@John 10: 28). The various conditions that go to make up man's life naturally -- what is called life -- are but the elements of death. A man can live in those conditions -- religious, political or social -- and have no link with the Shepherd and no life morally Godward. All that is necessary to live in these conditions is the life he inherits from his parents, the stock of fallen Adam. But eternal life lies outside of these conditions. It consists in the enjoyment of the moral conditions which will obtain and be maintained in power in the world to come. In that day all will know God, all will be subject to Christ, and men will love one another. Victory over the power of sin and death will be known in the presence of Christ here, whose rule will be universally owned. Hence to know eternal life today we must in our souls reach these conditions, and thus spiritually anticipate the moral elements of the world to come. To have life we must follow Christ out of the conditions prevailing in this world which are morally those of death.
If we have heard the Shepherd's voice (whose voice is the voice of the Son of God) we are brought into the enjoyment of the conditions of eternal life; we pass out of death into life. We are in the light of God; we move as following Christ, and we find the company of the flock. The flock is the christian circle of which Christ is the Centre.
The gospel of John presents the flock from the divine standpoint. Every sheep is included in the "one flock". But although this is so, some questions
{170}
may rightly be raised. Have we realised our place in the flock? Are we recognising its unity in a practical way? Have we any experimental knowledge of eternal life? Or are we content with the mere statements that there is one flock, that the Shepherd gives to the sheep eternal life, without being exercised as to some realisation of the things themselves? This is surely not the object for which the scripture was written. Things are to be real and living. And whatever the outward break up of that which bears the name of Christ, "*one flock*" still subsists.
May it be ours, dear reader, accepting our position in the common shame of the church, to obey the Lord's command; to be marked by the features of the "little flock"; and, hearing the Shepherd's voice, to follow Him, proving the unity of one flock and experiencing the blessing of eternal life.

THE SON OF MAN GLORIFIED
J. Taylor
@John 13: 31, 32
I wish to speak at this time about our Lord Jesus Christ as Son of man, not in a general way, for He is so designated in many parts of Scripture, but to confine my remarks to John's presentation of Him in that character. The other evangelists, as you will be aware, refer to the Lord under this designation more frequently than John, particularly the official gospels, as I may call them, Matthew and Luke. But
{171}
in order to understand their references, and indeed, the references of the prophet Ezekiel, we have to understand John.
One is impressed, the more one considers John, that we have to understand everything now from his standpoint, and particularly this subject that I propose to dwell upon. For whilst he refers to the Lord in this way less frequently than do those other two evangelists, yet he refers to Him in peculiar connections, in connections that are intended to emphasise in our minds the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ under this title. I hope that in what I have to say, we shall each afford Him in this connection more place in our affections, because I apprehend that these verses in chapter 13 have reference to the place that He now has.
God has glorified Him in Himself, and He has done so immediately; and the immediate glory that has come to the Lord according to this passage, involves the place that the Father has given Him in the saints, that is, in ourselves, who form the assembly. The assembly, or the circle of the saints, as seen in John, is the sphere in which God operates now, and in which He glorifies His Son, the Son of man. The world is not yet the sphere in which to glorify the Son of man; and, as yet, Israel He has not, but He has the assembly. The Lord as He rose from the dead said, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation [assembly] will I praise thee" (@Psalm 22: 22). The assembly was that which God secured immediately, and which is
{172}
thus available for any display which He may make; and as He glorifies the Son of man immediately, it is obviously in that sphere, which He has immediately secured. So I hope the Lord may use what I have to say to enhance His own place in our affections as the Son of man.
Now the first reference to Christ as Son of man in John's gospel is in chapter 1: 51; it is the Lord's own statement, made to Nathanael, whom He Himself describes as "an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" (verse 47, Authorised Version). He said to the Lord, "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" (verse 49). Nathanael had come into the light of the second psalm, and as moving to Christ, the Lord describes him as an *Israelite indeed*. Nathanael says, "Whence knowest thou me?" Jesus says, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee" (verse 48). To Nathanael's mind the Son of God was present; the King of Israel was present. What a moment for an Israelite, to be brought thus face to face with the Son of God and the King of Israel!
And what that suggests to my mind is that the opening part of John introduces to us certain persons who apprehended Christ. The opening chapter is not so much occupied with direct divine statements, as it is with giving an account of what certain persons *apprehended*. It is a question, therefore, since John applies to our own time, of what we *apprehend*, and what is apprehended is the result of contemplation. The evangelist says, "(we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father),
{173}
full of grace and truth". They contemplated His glory as with the Father; He was apprehended as an only-begotten with a father. You see, the present moment is the outcome of God having wrought in certain individuals, who through contemplation came into the apprehension of Christ.
To enforce this great principle, John the Baptist tells us that in being sent to baptise with water, he was told how to locate Him who should baptise with the Spirit. For of what value is water baptism save there be Spirit baptism? Water baptism in itself can avail nothing unless there is One to baptise with the Spirit. We must couple these two things together. John says, "he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God" (verses 33, 34). Thus we see that this gospel introduces to us those who by contemplation acquired a knowledge of the Son of God, and John the Baptist bears record.
Now in the evangelist and those with him, and in John the Baptist, we have a nucleus which became the witness; the light of the knowledge of the Son of God was in their hearts and in their minds. Then we find that John the Baptist, looking on Jesus as He walked, says, "Behold the Lamb of God" (verse 36). He bore testimony to Him as an Object of attraction; and may I say that scarcely any one is too young to be attracted by a lamb! We read here that the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed
{174}
Jesus. Now there is a movement; we have a nucleus of light, as I said, of persons illuminated with the light of the knowledge of the Son of God, and I believe this corresponds exactly to our own times. There have been those who came into the apprehension of the Son of God, and they bore record. John represents the type of testimony that affects people at the present time. He says, "Behold the Lamb of God". He himself was affected; he was moved, and two of his disciples heard him and they followed Jesus. You will observe that I am speaking of the Son of God, because it is the Son of God who gives character to our dispensation; but I wish to show that, as He is apprehended thus, His place as Son of man is to be fully recognised in our minds and hearts. John the Baptist is, as I may say, a characteristic witness; he seems to be in the mind of the evangelist a model witness; he is moved by the testimony, by the light that has come into his soul, and his testimony draws others to Jesus.
Now in speaking of the Son of God, I may add another word, and that is that the Son of God is Christ on the *divine* side. John shows that it is, as it were, God approaching men with His beloved Son in His hand (you will understand me). Luke presents the other side; he shows you Simeon in the temple with the Babe in his arms. If God approaches us with His beloved Son, as He does, He is contemplated as with the Father, full of grace and truth. It is God approaching us with His Son, as it were, in His bosom, and His Son is full of grace and truth. He has
{175}
in Him the means of meeting men as they are, and setting them up suitably to Himself. That is what the Son of God means. God has His answer by Him. His Son is the adequate witness to His love: "God so loved ... that he gave his only-begotten Son" (chapter 3: 16). But when you come to the Son of man, He is seen in the arms of Simeon (@Luke 2: 28). It is not through the Son of man that God approaches us, but it is through the Son of man that we approach God. You will note that Simeon had Him in his arms. What a spectacle, beloved! Simeon is our representative; he is a man who came by the Spirit into the temple, and as he was there by the Spirit, Joseph and Mary came in with the Babe, and he took up the Babe in his arms. I stand behind him, as it were, and I see that Babe as He is there in the temple, and I say, How enriched the race is, how graced it is! He has come in on our side; and he who by the Spirit understands the position, takes Him in his arms.
If God comes in on His own side to meet us, to make known His love to us, He comes in with His Son, but if I am to draw near to God, it is with the Son of man. It is not, I may remark, by way of guarding these thoughts, that He intended to adorn man in the flesh, it was far otherwise, but nevertheless, coming into this world as a Babe He came in in connection with humanity, and Luke presents Him to us in that light; and Simeon, who is in the mind of heaven by the Spirit, takes Him in his arms. I do not know that I can commend anything
{176}
greater to you than that you should understand how to take Christ, viewed as Son of man, in your arms. You are then before God as belonging to the race of men according to all that Christ is.
Having said that much about Luke, I intend now to show how the Lord would bring in the thought of the Son of man to the mind of an Israelite; I refer to Nathanael. Whilst he is called an *Israelite indeed*, in whom there is no guile, he is nevertheless marked by those limitations that always mark a nationalist. Nationalism is one of the most potent elements there are even amongst the people of God, but the Son of man is not in relation to nations as such; He is in relation to *men*. Hence the Lord would emphasise to the mind of an Israelite the place that the Son of man has in heaven. He was an Israelite in all that the term signifies; but he was to see "greater things". That is a word that should come home to us. It is the "greater things" (verse 50) that deliver us from the lesser. The lesser is the national, the greater is the universal.
It is obvious that what Adam represented must be greater than what Abraham represented. Adam was a primary thought; Abraham represented the provisional thought. Very great indeed in its development is the idea of a nation and a kingdom, and God will develop these two features to their completion. We shall see a nation such as earth has never seen, and we shall see a kingdom such as earth has never seen; but those who are to have part in these things, great as they are, are to understand that
{177}
there are greater things. And the greater has reference to Adam, and so Adam's son, the Son of man, inherits all the glory that attaches to the race; and the "Israelite indeed" has to understand that these are greater things.
So the Lord says, in that well-known strengthened affirmative of John, "Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (verse 51). The Israelite is to know that heaven, instead of for the moment being occupied with Jacob, or with Christ as descended from Jacob, is occupied with Him as descended from Adam: "which was the son of Adam", Luke says, "which was the son of God" (chapter 3: 38, Authorised Version). Man has a wonderful place with God; He had him in His mind from eternity.

THE RESOURCES OF THE LOCAL ASSEMBLIES
C. A. Coates
@Revelation 1: 4 - 6, 17 - 20
Although the Lord has favoured us with a good deal of light as to the assembly, we still need to be reminded of the special place which local assemblies have in His mind. We are all apt to be too individual, and to forget that the Lord is concerned about assemblies -- local companies of saints. Such companies are of great interest to Him because this is the particular form which the work and testimony of God takes at the present time.
{178}
We may remember that Solomon is spoken of in Ecclesiastes as the Preacher, and in the margin of the New Translation the word 'preacher' is said to mean 'a former of assemblies'. The Lord would have us to consider Him in that light; it is the key to what took place in the early days of the church's history, and to what is taking place now. It is one of Christ's excellent designations that He is 'a former of assemblies'; when the voice of Christ is listened to, assemblies will be formed. It was so at the beginning, the speaking of Christ was heard, and the result was, not only that people were converted and brought into the blessing of the gospel, but local assemblies were formed; Christ was known to be the 'former of assemblies'. It was so at Corinth; Christ spoke in Paul (@2 Corinthians 13: 3) and the result of His speaking was that an assembly was formed in that city, and it became a "golden lamp" -- a vessel of spiritual light; that is the proper ideal of a local assembly.
The idea of local assemblies has very largely disappeared in Christendom. There are great national systems of religion, and sects, some with a little more light than others, but all constituted by influences other than the speaking of Christ. The local assembly viewed according to the mind of God is constituted by the speaking of Christ, and as a vessel of spiritual light it is spiritual in its constitution. We must begin with this idea; it does not do for us to derive our thoughts from the confused and disorderly state of Christendom; we
{179}
must view this matter according to the divine conception; if that is before us it will steady our souls. It is a help to get the thought that according to God each local assembly is a vessel of spiritual light, and there is but that one vessel of spiritual light in a city. There was such a vessel in Corinth, and it had its counterpart in every other city and place where the Lord's name was called upon. Spiritual light was there, and it was nowhere else; outside was darkness. It should be our desire to be identified with that which is locally a vessel of spiritual light; that is what we want to look for. We can understand how Satan would desire to obscure such lights, and to introduce into local assemblies elements of darkness, but we may be sure that the Lord will never give up the original divine thought, nor will He acquiesce in anything that is contrary to it.
We may learn from the verses read the kind of material of which the local assembly is formed; it is composed of persons who have the consciousness of the present love of Christ. In each local assembly you could hear such an utterance as this, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father". Those who can say that have a spiritual constitution. The first feature of the local assembly is that it is a company of persons in the conscious-ness of the present love of Christ; then they can say, He "has washed us from our sins in his blood". He sets us together in the very place where we had been sinners, in the complete cleansing which His blood
{180}
effects; all that made up our former history is washed away.
Then He "has ... made us a kingdom"; that intimates that we are not sinning now. Having been washed from our sins in His blood, He has made us a kingdom; He has constituted us a realm for God. To be a kingdom is a contrast to sinning; it is truly a blessed thing to be a realm for God. In every place where there is a local assembly there is a bit of territory which constitutes a divine realm. That is an important spiritual element, and, as we have said, if there is to be a local vessel of spiritual light, spiritual elements are essential to it. Anyone who loves God would delight to know that there is a bit of territory in the place where he lives that is an ordered realm for God, a realm where insubject or unruly elements are not tolerated, a kingdom -- not a democracy, and that as having been subdued to God by His grace he forms part of it. That is how Christ forms assemblies. As these spiritual features are present -- the consciousness of Christ's present love, of being washed from every stain of what pertained to our former history, and as constituted a kingdom -- there is the establishment in a company of persons locally of what is morally suitable to God.
As we walk together locally as a kingdom, a realm for God, and as delivered from the lawlessness of sin, we are free to understand that Christ has made us priests to God and His Father. That is another element; we have spiritual constitution Godward; that is the thought of priests. It is not
{181}
merely that we are spiritual enough to refuse the flesh and to be separate from the world -- that would be involved in being a kingdom -- but there is something further; He has made us priests to God; there is spirituality Godward. It is in taking account of these elements that we get a right and divine idea of the local assembly. When these elements are present there is a vessel of spiritual light locally, a number of persons who can stand in priestly service in the presence of Christ's God and Father, having ability to serve intelligently in prayer and praise and worship. The speaking of Christ leads to our having a place as priests with His God and His Father, though believers are often slow to follow the leading of Christ in this respect. If we read the gospels we see how the speaking of Christ was all designed to lead men in their thoughts and affections to His God and Father. One great end for which He came was that men might be constituted priests to His God and Father.
In the local assembly the headship of Christ is recognised. There are many large and fine buildings where the name of Christ is mentioned, but what spiritual persons would look for is the recognition of the headship of Christ. Where it is recognised, there is something locally that has assembly character, and priestly service to His God and His Father will be found there. Where these elements are found there will be locally a vessel of spiritual light -- a golden lamp. I trust that each one of us has a desire to be identified with what has that character, and to
{182}
contribute to it as being an integral part of it; surely none of us would care to be an unattached unit! We desire to be thoroughly committed to what is of Christ and of God, to be part of the local vessel of spiritual light, not merely to be near it, but part of it. This is a real exercise for young people and for any who have not definitely taken their part and place in the local assembly; it is for them to consider whether they are not robbing the Lord of His due and God of His realm. As we learn from Scripture the divine thought as to local assemblies it becomes our privilege and responsibility to confess the truth practically by identifying ourselves with those who also confess it. If one is not thoroughly identified with the practical confession of the truth one misses a great deal of divine grace that can only be realised assembly-wise.
It was before me on this occasion to dwell on the immense resources that are available for support in local assemblies. It is evident that assemblies *can* be maintained as vessels of spiritual light; we see that in Smyrna and Philadelphia, both of which came under the eye of the Son of man without rebuke. Our dear brethren who do not recognise the local assembly, and who do not identify themselves with it, miss the peculiar grace which there is on the part of divine Persons for the assemblies; I believe it surpasses the grace that there is for individuals.
This comes out here very plainly in verse 4: "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who
{183}
was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth". Think of that grace! Favourableness on the part of each Person in the Godhead, not here towards individuals, but flowing out upon the saints assembly-wise, for it is to "the seven assemblies". There is grace commensurate with the position, so that if much responsibility attaches to local assemblies as being golden lamps, there is corresponding grace.
God in His eternal unchangeableness -- "him who is, and who was, and who is to come"; God in His eternal faithfulness, is favourable to local assemblies. It is in writing to a local assembly that Paul says in @1 Corinthians 1: 9, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", and in chapter 10: 13, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear". It is the faithfulness of God as pledged to those who are walking in the fellowship that finds expression in the local assembly. The faithfulness of God is a very good 'ground of gathering'.
Then there is grace from "the seven Spirits which are before his throne". This is the Spirit of God not viewed as indwelling persons, or as the one Spirit baptising all saints in one body, but regarded in His relation to the throne. Perfection is there as intimated by the number seven, but seen figuratively as "lamps of fire, burning before the throne", chapter 4: 5. It
{184}
suggests the maintenance in a judicial way of what corresponds with the throne. The seven Spirits are viewed objectively in the unlimited power that attaches to a divine Person to maintain what is due to the throne. The fact that grace and peace come to the local assemblies from the seven Spirits would assure us of divine help in matters relating to the throne, that is, the rights of God. Questions do sometimes arise that are like an Amalekite hand on the throne (@Exodus 17: 16). The seven Spirits of God would not tolerate any defiance of divine rights, but They are favourable to the assemblies as being resource for us in matters which require to be judged as being contrary to the throne.

LOVE'S WAYS
R. Besley
When the relations between man and God were first broken, it was man who broke them, but it was God who became the Seeker, for Adam hid himself behind the trees. How deeply God felt the loss of the man! And He came down and walked in the garden in the cool of the day and called to the man to inquire where he was. Adam was afraid; he had sinned, he had turned his back upon God, from whom he had received everything, but God went after him in His goodness and He touched his conscience to awaken a sense of guilt, and also gave the sentence of death upon His wayward and sinful creature.
{185}
But at the same time He provided the coats of skin Himself so that the man and the woman should be clothed, and as God looked upon them He saw that which spoke of lives forfeited in the stead of their lives. Not only so, but they wore for a covering what spoke typically of the beauty and glory of Christ.
The man and the woman did not know what these skins spoke of, but God did, and He accepted them because of what He knew of the precious worth of Christ, who was to come. In our day, the believer is clothed in God's view with all the perfection and blessedness of what God sees in Christ and all His finished work. How beautiful the believer looks to God, and if only we understood this, what restfulness and happiness would be ours!
The same thing appears all through, all down the ages of time. Man has turned away, but God has followed him. Cain turned away from the light which God had given for faith, that "if thou doest not well, sin [offering] lieth at the door" (@Genesis 4: 7). The beasts had been slain to provide the coats for Adam and Eve; why then should Cain draw near with an offering in which no life had been forfeited? But God did not leave him in his path of self-will, He drew near. True He inquired for his brother and what he had done to him, but there was also the pleading voice, uttered, alas! without avail. Cain went out from the presence of the Lord to bear the sentence imposed upon him, because he would not repent and turn to God in self-judgment and
{186}
confession of his sin.
When David sinned it was God who moved towards him by sending Nathan the prophet (@2 Samuel 12); but, alas! the history of God's people all through is marked by their folly and sinfulness in turning away from Him. And yet the record abounds with instances again and again of God following them by raising up servant after servant to plead and appeal to them to return.
In Jeremiah's day God says, "I spoke unto you, rising up early and speaking, and ye heard not, and I called you, and ye answered not" (@Jeremiah 7: 13). Think of God speaking thus figuratively of Himself, as though it was a man speaking of rising up early. How touching is the earnestness depicted in this; rising up early to plead with a people who had turned away from Him. It should have been the people who rose up early in the morning to seek the blessed God from whom they had turned away. But, no, it is God who is doing this; He who had done so much for them all through their history.
It was God who came down at the beginning to bring them out of Egypt; it was God who divided the waters of the Red Sea. It was He who gave the manna from heaven to feed them, and the flowing waters in abundance to satisfy their thirst. It was God who drove out all their enemies before them and brought them to rest in the good land which flowed with milk and honey.
But it was the people loved and cared for by the blessed God, Jehovah, who turned away, and yet, as
{187}
I have said, He followed them, "rising up early and speaking" in order to bring them back.
Jeremiah says again that "Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, have I sent unto you all my servants and prophets, daily rising up early and sending them" (verse 25). So we see that it was not once, nor twice, but daily that God sent His servants, rising up early to plead with His wayward people. Such is the tender-ness of God's heart for His people whom He loves.
The apostle Paul had a great sense of this when he wrote to the Romans. He said, "But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing" (chapter 10: 21). All day long; not only as rising up early in the morning, but stretching out His hands all the day long to plead -- a most touching thought for believers who have got away from the Lord, and there are many of them. Isaiah speaks, as the apostle Paul says, of a "a people disobeying and opposing". What about disobedience? How much there is! Think of the many in Christendom who disregard the Lord's commandments. This applies to some who have professedly separated from evil. And yet the Lord has not given us up. He loves His people, He loves all of them, and if we do not seek Him in our failure and departure, He is seeking us.
Are you in the world enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season, having forgotten the Lord who bought you? The Lord is appealing to you in many ways, by this word which I am speaking, for He has
{188}
laid it on my heart to appeal to you through the pages of this book. He says, "Return, backsliding children; I will heal your backslidings" (@Jeremiah 3: 22). Note the word "children"! He has not given you up, although you may have given Him up. He thinks of you as among the children, He loves you and desires your affection for His own heart.
The Lord knows that He is being done without, even in the place where His name is professed. For in addressing the church in Laodicea He says, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking" (@Revelation 3: 20). The church at Laodicea refers to the state of the professing church today, and we are all in the profession.
He says, "Behold, I and at the door and am knocking". Behold! It is a thing to look at, to consider, the Lord Jesus *standing* outside the professing church. Think of Him having to stand; no one has had the care to give Him a seat. He is outside and He calls to His loved ones to behold it. Oh! look, beloved people of God, look at your Lord outside, and standing, and you are carrying on your services and meetings without Him. He feels it, but *He is* not turning away; He says even though He is outside and standing, "as many *as I love*" (verse 19)! Love is still there, it is there for you, for us all. It is there to the end. "Having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" (@John 13: 1).

THE GREATNESS OF THE GOSPEL
F. S. Marsh
How great is the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ! Not only is it great on account of all that God is accomplishing through it, and because of the mighty results for the blessing of man, but it is great in itself: it is the most majestic, powerful, and glorious gospel that has ever been proclaimed on earth.
Its greatness is conveyed in the various beautiful expressions which the apostle Paul employed to describe its many-coloured glories.
To the elders of the assembly in Ephesus he disclosed that the ministry which he had received of the Lord Jesus was to testify <br>THE GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD <br>(@Acts 20: 24), for that is its *character*. The first impression the gospel would convey to man is that God is approaching him in grace! With what joy the evangelist Luke presents the Lord Jesus as God's Anointed, the holy Vessel of divine grace! "And all ... wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth" (@Luke 4: 22); and His constant ministry of compassion is recorded that "the God of all grace" (@1 Peter 5:10) might be known; for God was "in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19). One of the most striking unfoldings of the grace of God fell from the lips of Jesus when He described the return of the prodigal, thus: "But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell
{190}
upon his neck, and covered him with kisses" (@Luke 15: 20).
When the same apostle wrote that profound, yet simple, treatise on the glad tidings -- the epistle to the Romans -- it is <br>THE GOSPEL OF GOD, <br>of which he wrote, for God is its *Source*. That epistle treats of the power of God, the righteousness of God, the wrath of God, the goodness of God, and the love of God. The object of the gospel, as unfolded in that epistle, is to bring a man into such blessing in the knowledge of God that he can be set up on earth in triumph and eternal life, for the glory of God, and that he should finally be "conformed to the image of his Son" (chapter 8: 29).
In writing to the Corinthians the apostle presents the gospel in relation to Christ, for he is prepared to suffer all things, lest we should hinder <br>The Gospel Of Christ <br>(@1 Corinthians 9: 12). Christ is its *Theme*. The same expression occurs in the epistle to the Galatians, when Paul wrote, "I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel, which is not another one" (chapter 1: 6, 7), for there is only one gospel -- that which exalts the Person of Christ and presents the value of His atoning work.
So, too, the Philippians were exhorted "Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ" (chapter 1: 27). It is as its transforming power is manifested in the lives of believers that Christ is
{191}
magnified and the gospel confirmed.
Another distinctive title of the gospel is given by the apostle, in his second epistle to the Corinthians, as he tells of "the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God" (chapter 4: 4), or, as this may be alternatively translated <br>THE GOSPEL OF THE GLORY OF THE CHRIST, <br>for that is its *dignity*. The perfect life of Jesus, His atoning death, His triumphant resurrection, have consummated in His glory at the right hand of God. The radiancy of that glory shines in His face today; for "God, who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (verse 6). What dignity there is in such a gospel! How worthy to be proclaimed far and wide, for it is the glad tidings of the glory of His Person.
Additional glories are indicated in the epistle to the Ephesians. In the first chapter it is described as the word of truth, <br>THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION, <br>for its *power* has been proved. What mighty results have been achieved by this gospel! As the people of old were instructed to "Fear not: stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah" (@Exodus 14: 13), so the Christian exults in a triumphant salvation. The complete victory has been gained, every enemy has been defeated, and the apostle can address the believer as "sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise" (@Ephesians 1: 13).
{192}
In the same epistle the inspired writer enlarges upon the untold resources of God unfolded by the gospel in the preaching among the Gentiles of the glad tidings of <br>THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST, <br>which are expressive of the *wealth* of the gospel. These riches are brought within the reach of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and though "unsearchable" can be enjoyed, by the power of the Holy Spirit of God, by the simplest believer in Jesus.
Finally, when writing to his child in the faith, Timothy, the apostle, with his heart moved by its magnificence, refers to <br>The Gospel Of The Glory Of The Blessed God, <br>which was committed to his trust (@1 Timothy 1: 11). This is surely its *fulness*, for the glory of the blessed God is the perfect revelation of Himself in the removal of the distance between God and man, from His own side. Thus God's great glory will witness to the greatness of the gospel when surrounded by the myriads of the redeemed (each one of whom has been reached and blessed by the gospel), He will "rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing" (@Zephaniah 3: 17).

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 8 -- A GATHERED COMPANY
M. W. Biggs
In our papers we have sought to meditate upon the church in some of the aspects in which it is presented in Scripture, as also to consider its formation and what it is peculiarly, namely, the body of Christ. But our idea of the church will be imperfect if we do not recognise that God's will is that His people should assemble, or "come together", as Scripture speaks. The members of the body of Christ are to enjoy what is proper to them, and the house of God is not to exist without any spiritual realisation of its privilege and practical recognition of its responsibilities.
The church of God may evidently be regarded in three ways:
(1) As actually existent on earth, whether universally or locally, and, as thus, embracing every believer, whether on the whole earth or in a locality.
(2) As a gathered company, that is, as a number of believers meeting together. It is thus presented in @1 Corinthians 11 - 14.
(3) In what is proper to it in its spiritual privileges.
It is clear that these are very distinct views of the same company of persons. For example, the earlier part of 1 Corinthians (with the exception of chapter 5) considers the saints in the first light. It is addressed to the "assembly of God which is in
{194}
Corinth", at the same time linking them with every other believer. But they are not viewed as "assembled", or come together, until chapter 11. Going to law, marriage, going to a feast, if invited, could not apply to the church as assembled. But our whole conduct must be regulated by what is abidingly true of us. We are always God's assembly, we have always to be true to the character of God's temple. Hence the corrective nature of the earlier chapters of the epistle, so that the conduct of each individual might be regulated by what is the calling of the whole christian company.
In chapters 11 - 14, however, the church, or assembly, that is, the Christians in the locality, are considered as "come together". We need only read the chapters to see this. We shall develop this later, if God will.
But it is also to be observed that believers are entitled to enjoy privileges of a peculiarly spiritual character. The epistle of 1 Corinthians does not allude to this side of the subject, but, as another has fittingly remarked, views the church as 'the assembly in the wilderness -- a separate and self-judged people in the world where Christ died'. Other parts of Scripture relate to this spiritual ground which we have the privilege to enter upon.
There is no doubt that the enjoyment of these spiritual privileges would greatly colour the order and utterance of all in the assembly as a gathered company. But the ground or region is distinct, and it would be quite possible for a believer to be in the
{195}
gathered company and yet not enjoy the spiritual privileges to which the assembly is entitled.
We desire to consider the subject of the church as "come together" in this paper. But we wish it to be fully recognised that spiritual privileges of the assembly are open to us on such occasions in an especial way. Happy, indeed, if in our souls we pass from the region of what is outward to what is spiritual and so take up spiritual ground.
The subject of the Lord's supper will come before us in another paper, if God permit, but we feel it to be necessary to state that the Lord's supper is referred to as *introducing* the section of the epistle which views the saints as "assembled". It is the Supper which calls us together. We "come together" to break bread.
Viewing the assembly in the light in which we have noticed it is presented in @1 Corinthians 11 - 14, we may observe:
(1) That the church is the body of Christ and hence is the *vessel of the activity of the Holy Spirit*.
(2) That "*love*", divine love, is to be the spring of every thought, act and feeling of all in the assembly.
(3) That "*understanding*", or intelligence, regulates all, that the church may be edified.
(1) In @1 Corinthians 12 the human body is referred to as a figure of the body of Christ, and attention is drawn to details with emphasis, clearness and simplicity which is striking to a degree. Have
{196}
we learnt the lesson God intended to teach us through this illustration? The prominent idea of the chapter is the manifestation of the Spirit's activities, and the "body" is introduced because it is there we find these activities. Let us remember that the chapter primarily views the church as gathered together. And as thus "come together" it is recognised as the "body of Christ", and the Spirit of God distributes gift to whomsoever He will in such a company.
We are amazed that Christians can so limit the Spirit's operations and manifestations that in certain circles of believers *one* member of the body can be selected as the only channel for the Spirit's activities, appointing a pastor or recognised minister or (more serious still) a priest. It may be the most intelligent member, as the eye is to the body. But it is only one member, and who can imagine the eye doing the work of the ear or nose, not to say hands or feet?
The "body" is not one member, but many. And the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit are in the body, not in one member only, however valuable the member may be. We feel that such a slight to the Holy Spirit must grieve Him and be very displeasing to the Lord; and the writer would earnestly ask every one who reads these lines if he is sanctioning, by his presence or patronage, any system or human organisation which so grievously ignores the presence of the Holy Spirit and His sovereignty to distribute to whomsoever He will. It may be replied
{197}
that there is opportunity for other members of the body of Christ to act in their individual service for the Lord, but one is appointed for the sake of order. But whose order is it? Clearly not scriptural order. And then the chapter before us is not dealing with the subject of individual service, but alludes to the church as gathered or "come together".
Do you know of such a gathering together, dear reader? I do not refer to coming to hear a sermon, but a gathering together of believers, of the members of the body of Christ as such. If not, I beseech you to seek the Lord's mind as to this passage and adjust your own conduct with reference thereto.
By one Spirit we have been baptised into one body, and by that same Spirit gifts are given according to His will. There must be liberty in any gathering of Christians for gift to develop and manifest itself through any member of the body, and the Spirit of God must be left free to use whomsoever He may please. If we make restrictions they will only be human, and hence a slight on the wisdom and sovereignty of God, the Holy Spirit -- a very solemn thing!
(2) *Love* is to be the spring of every act in the church of God as "come together"; indeed, we may say at all times, but our chapters primarily refer to the church "in assembly". -
What a simple yet searching portrayal of love -- divine love -- this is! "Charity" has a cold meaning nowadays, and does not at all convey the force of the word used here. It is love as in the heart of God, as
{198}
expressed in Jesus; love in its reality -- love divine! It is that which we are to add to brotherly love; it is the bond of perfectness.
God is love. Without love all else is nothing. The most eloquent orator, or the most tutored tongue, is but a tinkling cymbal. Without it the greatest acts of devotedness and self-sacrifice are unprofitable, the greatest mind and the most cultured intellect are nothing. Let us ponder the passage soberly. We quote the verses at length:
"If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing".
The next verses give us love's traits, what is positive:
"Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous of others; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up, does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil, does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails".
Oh! how our hearts are bowed as we consider love's traits. Jesus was the perfect expression of love. Love is of God. Its source is not found in the
{199}
human heart, but in God's. To know love and to act in love we must know God and the manifestation of His love to us.
Does love mark us, dear fellow believer? What an intensely solemn chapter this is! Our every act, our every thought in the assembly, if to be of service and acceptable to God, must be in love; no self-seeking; no vaunting oneself; no rejoicing in iniquity, for "hereby know we that we love the children of God when we love God and do his commandments".
All else will fail. All else will end. Love is the divine nature, for only as born of God can we love after this sort. The kindest and most amiable of human dispositions is nothing here. Love is *of God*. The church has received this divine life, and our measure and stature in God's assembly is the measure in which we give place to that life which we have received in the power of the Spirit.
How this would settle the many difficulties which, alas! arise in the midst of God's people. How often it would prevent them ever arising. Our state is so frequently an evidence of how little we have been thinking and acting in love. Love never fails.
(3) All activity in the assembly is to be regulated by understanding. We are to be sober. We fear this is overlooked sometimes. We again remark that the assembly is regarded as a gathered company in these chapters (@1 Corinthians 11 - 14). Verses 23, 26, 34, 35 of chapter 14 put this quite beyond question. The object before each must be the edification of all.
{200}
Apparently the Corinthians were making overmuch of the sign gifts -- tongues, for instance, and were exercising them to the exaltation of man, and not to edification. The apostle corrects this error and points out that the gift of prophecy was rather to be coveted. By prophecy we are not necessarily to understand the foretelling of future events, but the announcing the mind of God for the present moment. He who prophesied spoke to "edification, and encouragement and consolation".
"Tongues" were for a sign to unbelievers, and in the assembly the apostle would rather speak five words intelligently than ten thousand words otherwise. We do well to note this. Edification should be before us. And for this, those present must understand what is said. How can "the other" in the gathered company say, "Amen", if I speak inaudibly and they cannot hear what I say? How can simple souls follow if my expressions are difficult and involved? And how can ministry be for edification which is not understood? Let us face these questions, and remember that it is not sufficient to give thanks. Well, "the other" must be edified (@1 Corinthians 14: 17).
We may note that there are five things for which there must be liberty in the assembly gathered together:
(1) "I will *pray* with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding" (verse 15);
(2) "I will *sing*";
(3) "if thou *blessest*" (or give thanks);
(4) "that I may *instruct* others"; and
{201}
(5) we may add, "let two or three prophets speak", and "ye can all *prophesy*" (verses 29, 31).
So we find praying, singing, giving thanks, teaching and prophesying -- all to be in the spirit and with understanding. And let it be remarked that these activities are not to be restricted to any particular member, for we read, "ye can all prophesy".
We would again ask the reader, does he enjoy this happy liberty? Of course, we presume all pray silently, but this is publicly in the gathered company of believers -- the assembly of God. We cannot regard any gathering together of Christians as answering to the mind of God unless there is this liberty for any to take part in due godly order. Women are expressly forbidden to speak in the assembly.
We have already remarked that the chapters before us do not refer to the higher spiritual privileges proper to the assembly in which, surely, "sisters" as well as "brothers" are entitled to participate. 1 Corinthians relates to the order in the church of God on earth. This surely is not everything, but it cannot be disregarded, for to do so must grieve the Spirit who has given such detailed instructions for our guidance. And if the Spirit is grieved we are quite unable to enjoy the blessed privileges of the assembly in its proper spiritual ground.
May God graciously exercise our hearts so that we may seek to answer to His mind in these things, and
{202}
doing so not rest content with merely outward order, however necessary it may be, but in the power of an ungrieved Spirit pass from the region of what is outward to the proper spiritual ground of the assembly.

THE SON OF MAN GLORIFIED
J. Taylor
@John 13: 31, 32
Now the evangelist John in chapter 3 quotes the Lord as saying, "We speak that which we know" (verse 11). How great a thing it is to have One who can speak, who knows; One on our side too. Then He goes on to say, "no one has gone up to heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven" (verse 13). What we find there is that we have on our side One who ascends up to heaven, who came down from heaven, and who is, wonderful to say, in heaven. We are brought face to face with the mystery of His Person, and yet such a One as He is, is on our side; One who, although speaking on earth, could say, "the Son of man who is in heaven". Then further we read, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up" (verse 14).
I was saying there was no thought of His coming among men, as a man, to adorn man after the flesh, but to remove him. He is not going to take up the race as we know it; He is to bring in a race of men according to Himself, but ere He does that, He
{203}
glorifies God in respect of the race in connection with whom He came, for becoming man, He must deal with that. Personally He was immune from all that belonged to man in his sinful state, but as taking up His place in relation to man, He must deal to the glory of God with what lay upon man, and so He says, "thus must the Son of man be lifted up" (verse 14). What for? "that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal"(verse 15).
You see what we have on our side in the Son of man. He removes, as "lifted up", all that lay upon us, to the glory of God, and those who believe have everlasting life. In chapter 5 He says He has authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man (verse 27). We see how, as on our side, God, as it were, would place in Him the power to execute judgment. It is God's gracious consideration for us, for He who died for us and is on our side will surely judge righteously. He executes judgment also because He is the Son of man. Thus we see how clearly and instructively the subject is opened up by this great evangelist, so that the Son of man should have His place in the hearts of those who know Him as the Son of God.
Then in chapter 6 as Son of man He is sealed by God the Father to give us food that endures unto everlasting life (verse 51). It is as if God were to say, I am placing everything in His hands; the Son of man is sealed by Me to provide you food; all is in His hands and He is on your side. How it should shut out every bit of legal fear from our hearts, in regard of
{204}
God.
Then He goes on to say, "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves" (verse 53). Later on, when many who had heard murmured, He said, "Does this offend you? If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" (verses 61, 62). It is not here a question of the mystery of His Person as in chapter 3, but that He has title as Son of man to ascend up where He was before. He has lost nothing in the descent; His place on high is as great as ever; He ascends to where He was before. He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, but He is crowned with glory and honour. "Where he was before" was the place and glory that belong to Deity.
"The Word was with God, and the Word was God" (@John 1: 1). How marvellous, therefore, is His word, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" He has gone up as Man in all the dignity of His Person to where He was before, and He is there on our side. The Jews are referred to again in this connection in chapter 8. He says, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man" (verse 28). That is their side; they lifted Him up, and in consequence He is known. "Ye shall know", He says, "that I am he". The Spirit of God in this evangelist would lead us on to the apprehension of Him as Son of man, so that whilst we claim Him, and rightly according to God, as on our side, He is nevertheless One who ascends up where He was
{205}
before, and He is to be "known" thus as lifted up. "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he". The remarkable passage in chapter 13 affords a beautiful climax to this great subject, for it is the last mention of it in this gospel, so far as I know. We have in chapter 12 the coming up of the Greeks who desired to see Jesus.
What I am aiming at is that we might have this blessed Man in our minds so that we should be universal, that we should have men before us and not nations or favoured districts. There is nothing more destructive than to attach undue importance to a favoured nation or district. That has reference to the government of God, not to the revelation of God. Christianity is not based on the government of God, but on the revelation of God, and the revelation of God has reference to all men. Light shines on all: "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man" (@John 1: 9). Hence this great subject I am dealing with, rightly apprehended, delivers us from nationalism; it enables us to be with God in all that He is doing, and to have the mind of God for the moment.
So when the Greeks come up, the Lord says, "The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified" (@John 12: 23). But He adds, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit". Now we have arrived at the thought of God as regards the *kind* of race of which Christ is to be Head, and this kind of race has taken form in the assembly. The
{206}
"much fruit" no doubt includes the whole race which is the result of His death. It all looks on to the time when the tabernacle of God shall be with men. It was as if He said, If I am to have the Greeks, if I am to have the race, I am to have them as the product of My death, not as they are now. There are on every hand those who aspire to rule over men, to be great among men, but the Lord would disdain to head a race with such shame attached to it as the race of men now. He removes all the stain through His death; He removes all the shame attached to man. He brings in, through dying, a race according to Himself, the "much fruit". What joy must have filled His heart as He contemplated the "much fruit", the universal results of His death! And so He said, "The hour is come". That hour is still deferred, but it is hastening, when He shall be set over the habitable earth.
In chapter 13 it is not said, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified", but "Now is the Son of man glorified". It is not an hour; in the ways of God the hour refers to millennial glory. There is an hour fixed for the glory of the Son of man; it is on the calendar, so to speak. That hour had struck; it was His due, but He would only take up the race as having died; He would take up a race which is the fruit of His death, and His delights shall be with them. Are we not in sympathy with our Lord in view of what He shall have in that day as the fruit of His death on this earth? Think of the change that will have come about! As one moves about the
{207}
world one is depressed at times, as one sees the awful misery of men, the awful degradation of men, morally and physically, but what relief as one thinks of the day that is now nearing, in which the Lord will be set over the habitable earth, an earth filled with men who are the fruit of His death. The hour had come for that, but it is deferred; so in chapter 13 there is nothing said about an hour, but *now*: "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him".
I desire that we should apprehend the Lord in this light, that He has glorified God in respect of sin. In @John 13 the betrayer had just gone out to betray Him into the hands of sinners that He might be put to death. "Now", Jesus says, "is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him". The glory that He refers to is the moral glory that He acquired by dying in obedience to the will of God. He submitted to death, having the right and power to escape it. He allowed Himself to be betrayed into the hands of sinners by one of His disciples. He did not move a finger to influence Judas against his course. It was the will of God; and when Judas went out He said, "Now is the Son of man glorified". A halo of moral glory shone there, discerned and well-known in heaven, beloved, and it is for us to see it now. He laid down His life. He did not interfere in the least degree to dissuade Judas from his purpose. "What thou doest", He says, "do quickly" (verse 27). He was absolutely subject to His Father's will.
A halo of moral glory, as I have said, shone
{208}
round about Him at that moment when Judas went out. Then He says, "and God is glorified in him". As never before, God was glorified in respect of sin in the death of Jesus. So He says, "If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately". Thus, as I suggested at the beginning, the immediate glory has reference to what God has *now*. The assembly is the sphere in which He displays His glory; and He glorifies Christ as the Son of man in the presence of His beloved people at the present time. Stephen says, "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man" (@Acts 7: 56); He was in heaven; He was glorified in the eyes of Stephen and in the eyes of every Stephen since. Every one of them sees Jesus, and He is glorified.
That is what God is doing; He would glorify the Son of man in our minds and hearts; He would have the Lord in His place with us in His universal relation; He would have us to understand that the Son of man has reference to the whole race of men, and as He is glorified in us, we shall be sympathetic with God in regard to the whole race of men. That is something to be taken to heart. What I am contending for now is to hold to a right principle; it is principles that deliver us from error, from any narrowing influences such as that of any favoured nation. All these, severally or collectively, tend to shut out the place of the Son of man from our minds and our hearts; whereas John, in unfolding this great subject of the Son of God and eternal life, makes
{209}
abundant room for the rights of the Son of man, that we may see that what God is doing is universal, and so he says at the very outset, "In him was life, and the life was the light of *men*" (chapter 1: 4).

THE DEATH OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, AND THE PURPOSE OF GOD
J. B. Catterall
@Numbers 21: 4 - 10; @Proverbs 12: 28; @John 3: 14 - 17; @Romans 8: 2 - 17; @John 7: 28 - 39
My desire is to speak to you of the bearing of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the great purpose of the blessed God in bringing many sons to glory. It is very specially impressed upon my mind how that, as our Lord tarries, there greatly increases the need that we should understand our dignity. I can hardly see how any one who belongs to our Lord Jesus Christ can tread their pathway here for God's pleasure if they do not understand somewhat of the dignity that God has conferred upon them. If they do not understand the greatness of that with which the blessed God has connected them as His people, they will either descend to the things of the world or else they will tread their pathway through this world far more in legality of spirit and bondage than in the liberty of divine love.
I think that must largely arise from the fact that, while they understand the need of being separate and apart from this world, their separation is a thing far more decided by conscience than by the knowledge
{210}
of God. They have upon their spirits a sense that they are passing through an evil world -- and it is evil indeed! -- that they are passing through a world in which every influence is increasingly inimical to Christ and to His own. As they pass their way, judging of that which surrounds them in this world by conscience, they realise the need of being apart from its ways, apart from its systems, apart from its vanities, but they are following a path of separation which is not really and truly based upon the power of the Holy Spirit and the knowledge of the love of God.
There is all the difference between a separation that is legally performed and a separation that arises from the heart being set up in the knowledge of God. As we read the Old Testament scriptures, we see how the pathway of the people of God takes on a most peculiarly triumphant character from the hour of the lifting up of the brazen serpent; from that point, their pathway is regarded by the Holy Spirit as empowered by the love of God. There came out on the side of the people at that time not only the murmuring of the heart in its own nature and in its own course, but the Spirit of God touches very tenderly upon that incident, showing that their murmurings were the result of the fact that they had become weary of the way.
We may take a great deal for granted, and one of the things that we may take for granted is this, that amongst those with whom we walk, by reason of their light, there may be no weariness of spirit or
{211}
thirst or hunger. But I think that we have had every reason to understand that it is not the possession of light in the way of information that will preserve our spirits here from the tendency to weariness or to burden; what will preserve our spirits here is the knowledge of the holy love of God in the power of the Holy Spirit. They came to a point in their pathway in which there was expressed from their own side the weariness of their spirits by reason of the way. They were on the borders of Edom at that time, and I think I may take that fact as indicating that they were in close contact with that which was natural. Edom was their brother in nature; their links with Edom were purely natural; and I think that really our greatest tests in the pathway of divine love and divine pleasure arise in connection with what is natural.
We find ourselves in close proximity to that which is natural on every hand; even in our companying with the people of God we find ourselves in contact with what is natural; and I think I need have no hesitation in saying that whenever our spirits are affected by what is natural, we tend to become weary of the way. We look around, it may be, and see the progress that is made on natural lines; we may take account of those who have light from God and who move on natural lines, and witness the progress and the success and the gain they make, being natural, and we tend to be weary of the way.
I would challenge my own heart and appeal to
{212}
yours, that the only thing that will support our spirits in a path of true separation in this world is the deepening knowledge in our souls of the holy love of the blessed God. I know what it will mean to you, my dear young friends. If your separation be governed by conscience only, if it be not supported by the affections of your heart for Christ's sake, in a little while, when the tests of life arise, you will find your separation burdensome. You will look out in the view of nature upon things, and you may come to consider, as in the thoughts of men, that your path would be a path of greater prosperity on another line.
I find it a great comfort to my spirit to withdraw from theology. I cannot live on theology; I cannot water my spirit with it; I cannot govern my course by creeds. God purposes that my course be governed by Christ. I take it as a matter of comfort that we may contemplate afresh the greatness of the love of God told out in the dying of Jesus. Think of that great and holy love of the blessed God which takes up every element of contrariety connected with me personally, every feature of my natural heart, my natural way, my natural mind, and deals with it in the dying of Jesus for the gain of my soul. Every propensity of mine, apart from Christ, every feeling averse to God, every tendency of my own heart to create a world around itself, all are dealt with in the dying of Jesus. Everything with which I would surround myself, proudly or boldly, disappears in the presence of the dying of Jesus. In the presence of the
{213}
great truth of the dying of Jesus, all our tendencies to this present narrow time-defined world would pass away. The cross of Jesus brings to light the great purpose of the blessed God to have a people who have really made their exit from the world of man's ways to His.
Now let me speak of the lifting up of the Lord. I think we feel the significance and glory of it when we consider the Lord's own way of referring to that great incident, "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up" (@John 3: 14). In that statement of the Lord's there lies all the power and all the appeal of the love of Jesus, the Son of man. That He was Jesus the Son of God is blessedly true, but Jesus the Son of man was lifted up that all God's thoughts should be given effect to for eternity. Jesus the Son of man lifted up, Himself would come into man's place. Not lifted up apart from His holy acquiescence to the will of God, but lifted up as the Son of man in all His holy agreement with the will of God the Father. There is involved in that one statement all the intensity and the blessedness of the holy love of God, and all the sweetness and the power and the appeal of the love of Jesus. Put your soul, beloved, as I would put mine, in the presence of the love of God and the love of Jesus.
When Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, every bitten Israelite who looked to the serpent lived; and I would go back in thought for a moment to that great and solemn hour when, in our
{214}
soul history we looked away from our sadness and fears, guilt and sin, to Jesus. Let us go back in our thoughts to that hour, and let us face the fact that, little then as we thought of the purpose of God, God thought of it all. What we were consciously committed to was one thing, what the blessed God of our salvation committed us to was another thing. I would go back, as the apostle Paul went back to it in his thoughts, when he said, "but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me, and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20). Oh! beloved, that is what makes room for the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
I think we fetter the Spirit in His ministry if we look on the death of Jesus only on the side of relief. He has come to us to abide with us for ever, but He has come to make known to us the wealth of the power of God; not to be confined in His ministry to the things that stand in relation to our need, but for a ministry, the wealth of which is the love of God, in connection with the purpose of God, to lead us as the sons of God; not only to carry us as a people free from Egypt, but to carry us with a holy dignity as those that belong to another world, the Centre of which is Jesus, the Son of God.
We come then, after the brazen serpent, to the well of which God spoke -- the only well in the wilderness of which God spoke. What God did at the rock in Horeb speaks of the death of Jesus, but in relation to moral need; this speaks of God's provision in the Holy Spirit by the death of Jesus on
{215}
the line of the purpose of God -- that belongs to another world. May I read it into the holy Scripture, as from the New Testament, putting the light into the Old? From the brazen serpent their path was defined, it was a path of righteousness in which there was life, and in the pathway thereof there was no death. There is no perishing on that line. We shall feel all the more acutely when the things of nature pass away, but, blessed be God, we shall feel it with the greatest relieving to our spirits in the knowledge of the things which never fail. Never to be sullied, they are connected with another Man, with the blessed Man who has been glorified, the same Jesus the Son of God who was lifted up that believing on Him we might "not perish, but have life eternal".
The Spirit of God is present with us, and the great object of His presence, according to the scriptures I have read, is to support us in the light and in the power and in the dignity and character of the purpose of God. May God give us that elevation of spirit to see above the level of the wilderness, to be kept in the level of the purpose of God, that God may have His pleasure, and that Christ may be glorified. May it be so, for His Name's sake.

THE RESOURCES OF THE LOCAL ASSEMBLIES
C. A. Coates
@Revelation 1: 4 - 6, 17 - 20
Then we read that the Lamb's eyes "are the seven Spirits of God which are sent into all the earth"
{216}
(chapter 5: 6), so that in the seven Spirits of God there is a power of discernment which will soon search all the earth, but it is at the present time favourable to the assemblies as being divine resource for the distinguishing of good and evil. There is this in an unlimited way in the seven Spirits of God.
The Spirit as indwelling the saints may be grieved or even quenched, and in that way the gain of His presence be largely missed, but no limitations can ever be put upon the seven Spirits of God; it is a comfort to know that the Son of man has the seven Spirits of God (chapter 3: 1). The perfection of spiritual power is with Him, whatever may be the state of the church. He has a power which can act sovereignly for the assemblies, whatever the conditions are here.
I think we must recognise that there are sovereign and varied actions of the seven Spirits of God. I do not think the Spirit speaking to the assemblies is quite His action as in the body, but His action as at the disposal of Christ, and as in accord with the throne. There are no limitations to what the seven Spirits can do, and Christ possesses them. There is always the plenitude and perfection of spiritual power with Him, but it is there for the good of the assemblies; there is with Him spiritual power commensurate with all assembly responsibility. If the golden lamps fail as vessels of spiritual light, He has the seven Spirits of God, as well as the seven stars; we can connect power with Him in an undiminished way, and He still has the seven stars. I take that to mean that there are still responsible
{217}
elements which He can own and use; this gives a wonderful idea of resource.
When we think of walking in local assemblies we become conscious of difficulties; if we do not see them at first we soon come up against them; so that it is of great importance that we should be furnished with the sense of resource. That marks @Revelation 1; before we see the failure which comes under the eye of the Son of man in the local assemblies we get a view of most marvellous divine resources that are adequate to preserve local assemblies as vessels of undimmed spiritual light; that is surely a great comfort. God in His faithfulness, and the seven Spirits who are in perfect correspondence with His throne, are favourable to us in our local exercises, helping us to resist and overcome everything that is contrary to the throne. The Holy Spirit as the seven Spirits before the throne would help us to resist everything that is contrary to what we are as "a kingdom", everything that savours of insubjection; everything which does not belong to vessels of spiritual light.
Then lastly, "and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth" (chapter 1: 4). This brings together what He was, what He is, and what He will be, and shows that in every character He is favourable to the local assemblies. There is grace for us according to all that Jesus Christ was as "the faithful witness"; there was no failure there, no obscuring element, nothing that came short in any
{218}
way of the full testimony that God would have to be rendered. Then as "first-born from the dead" we see Him as pre-eminent in resurrection; all the power of resurrection is known in Him from whom grace and peace come to us; that power is equal to anything. As "prince of the kings of the earth" He will order all for the pleasure and glory of God in a coming day. These varied titles are brought in to show how rich is the fund of grace that can be drawn upon.
There is no need to be discouraged if we meet with difficulties; they are not insurmountable if compared with the resources which are available. We have to notice, as was remarked before, that the Lord has preserved us from thinking that assemblies in local responsibility will always be a failure, because He has shown us that out of seven assemblies there are two concerning which He has no word of rebuke; showing that those are contemplated who utilise divine resources and are thus preserved from failure. We should covet to be without rebuke, that when the Lord comes in and looks around the local assembly He might find us so sustained by divine resources that He has no need to rebuke.
That leads me, finally, to say a little about the end of chapter 1, where the Lord brings out what a resource He is. John saw the Son of man in His majestic glory, and he says, "I fell at his feet as dead". John had long before this heard the Lord's words -- I have no doubt they sank deeply into his heart -- "without me ye can do nothing" (@John 15: 5);
{219}
but now John comes to the experimental realisation of it, and we all have to come to it, especially as to our assembly exercises. All this has in view assembly exercises. We have to learn experimentally that without Him we can do nothing. Nothing will pass the divine scrutiny except what has its source in Himself. It is only thus that there can truly be a golden lamp; a vessel of spiritual light must derive everything from Christ; there cannot be a contribution from nature or the flesh. John was made to realise that he must derive everything from Christ.
Then, "he laid his right hand upon me" -- that is power. The Lord is ever ready to lay His right hand upon us. I believe it requires some measure of spiritual vitality to fall at His feet as dead; there must be a certain sensitiveness to divine impressions. If we realised that the judgment of the Ancient of days had actually come into the present in regard of the assemblies, the result would be that we should at once be prepared to admit that nothing will stand that judgment but what is derived from Christ. Then He puts His right hand on us, and where the right hand of the Son of man comes there is power. He speaks next of what there is in Himself; "Fear not; *I* am the first and the last"; that is as much as to say, 'John, you must begin and end with Me'; then, "and the living one"; I understand that to convey that He is the source of life for us. "The living one" is the gospel of John in three words. Then "I became dead"; He had to go that way in order that we might live in Him, but He adds,
{220}
"behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". He has the key in chapter 3 to open the door to let us in to all the treasuries of precious things, but here He has the keys of death and hades to liberate us from everything that belongs to the domain of death, or to the evil powers of the invisible world; in short, from everything that is hostile to Himself and to God.
I believe the Lord would give us a great sense of the wonderful resources there are in Him even for the last days. This comes out in His addresses to the last three assemblies; the addresses to the first four -- omitting Smyrna -- present the Lord in the character in which John saw Him in chapter 1 -- a character calculated to produce deep exercise and searchings of heart. But to the last three assemblies He presents Himself as having new features and characteristics which are of the nature of divine resource. He says to Sardis that He has the seven Spirits of God; to Philadelphia that He has the key of David; to Laodicea that He is the Amen, the beginning of the creation of God. These are new features not mentioned before, and they bring out what there is in Him as resource for the local assemblies. We could not bear to think of the judgment of the Son of man if we did not know that there is adequate resource to enable us to fulfil our local responsibility assembly-wise. We need not be discouraged, but rather greatly comforted, as we get an increased sense of the profound interest of divine Persons in our walking together in local assemblies. We have to
{221}
learn that Christ must be the Source of everything for us; we cannot, apart from Him, furnish anything that is requisite to meet with His approval.
The assemblies need something more than the sense of responsibility if they are to answer to their place as golden lamps. Conscience must be awakened, surely, but that leads to nothing positive unless the heart is led to find its unfailing resource in the very One who sheds holy light on the conditions that are before Him. Responsibility can only be taken up in the strength of His right hand; there is produced a very real sense in the soul that we need Him if there is to be anything that corresponds with a golden lamp; this leads to calling on the Lord out of a pure heart (@2 Timothy 2: 22). Everything that we need is there for us in Him if we will avail ourselves of it, so that we need not give up the thought of being golden lamps, however great may be the general obscuration.

GOD'S TWO-FOLD VOICE IN SCRIPTURE
J. R. Kilroe
How often has it been said, 'The Bible became a new book to me' -- at such and such a juncture. Familiar with it perhaps from childhood, and converted by God's grace through some precious statement, one has lived on the strength of this and some other equally precious texts, while continuing, for years possibly, to plod on in occupation with the letter of holy writ. The habit of pious reading is
{222}
invaluable, but a moment comes when the Spirit of God throws open, to the true believer, the door of a new world of blessedness -- a spiritual realm -- in the holy Scriptures. We henceforth perceive therein not only interesting and reliable history, striking prophecies and precious promises, with their fulfilment, but, beneath all these, great, far-reaching, spiritual principles, with most intimate bearing upon ourselves; and, more precious still, as the first great unfolding of the Scriptures by the Lord Jesus (@Luke 24) showed, *the things concerning Himself*. Perceiving it, we reach the dawning of a new day for our souls. "The darkness is passing and the true light already shines" (@1 John 2: 8). We feel the touch of a power that "has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love" (@Colossians 1: 13). Our wisdom is to yield to that power -- to listen for the second voice¦ of God
¦We may perhaps speak of God’s threefold voice to man, if we reckon providence as one element (@Psalm 29; @Romans 1: 19, 20). The letter of Scripture would then be a second, and the spiritually discernible voice in Scripture the third. It is of the last two we treat here -- implied in the statement, "the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens" (@2 Corinthians 3: 6). @John 8: 43 also corresponds: "Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word" -- the literal utterance and the spirit of what He said. "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" (@John 6: 63). We might recall Elihu's statement (@Job 33: 14, 15), "God speaketh once [shall we say providence?], and twice [literal communications] - and man perceiveth it not". Then, thirdly, "in a dream", etc. -- when intellect is in abeyance -- He speaks effectually to the heart. "The natural man does not receive", etc. He obstructs. The things of God are "spiritually discerned" (@1 Corinthians 2: 14). "With the heart is believed to righteousness" (@Romans 10:10). 
{223}
in the holy Scriptures -- so that we may be formed according to, not only instructed in, the divine affections and glories of the new realm thrown open to our hearts.
A few instances of that second voice and the morally formative power by which it is accompanied may here be given as illustrative. The story of Abraham's household is familiar to all. Literally viewed, the account of Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, affords in some details somewhat perplexing reading, though truly inspired, divinely given history. When, however,
<blockquote> ... 'the Spirit's power <br> Has ope'd the heavenly door' (`74:5), </blockquote>
we perceive, in the enlightening 'allegory', long treasured divine instruction concerning the jealously guarded glory of the "Heir", God's Son. With this God's gracious purpose for those associated *with Him*, with the blessing of whom nothing of *the flesh* should be allowed to interfere (@Galatians 4: 30).
The sacrifices, priesthood and feasts in Leviticus were ordained by God Himself -- and recorded in amazing detail for an earthly tabernacle-system; and many to this day ask, To what purpose? The answer is found in the Spirit's unfolding of its concealed
{224}
glories, in which we perceive a world of blessedness designed for God's pleasure, constituted of believers, and in which believers have their blissful part. In it we perceive that Christ is all and that He fills all things. He is the Antitype of the *sacrifices* -- of infinite fulness and varied worth; the *Priest*, Head of a great priestly family begotten through His death; and *substance*, which invests with its sweet savour and infinite preciousness the whole cycle of Jehovah's feasts.
Again, we have admired God's beneficent provision in the cities of refuge, for any who inadvertently slew his neighbour; but how greatly the account of this is enhanced, as well as our appreciation of the goodness that so planned the provision, when we discover that the provision is the divine Author Himself, come into this world as Man to die -- provision for all, particularly for those who slew Him "in ignorance" (@Acts 3: 17), as grace chose to regard the crime. He is the Forerunner, too, to lead the way to that provision; and the High Priest, whose continuance affords perpetual security. Furthermore, we discover that in the meanings of the cities¬ names is told out God's great salvation in Christ, read in order according to the divine placing of the cities in circuit over the whole land, beginning with Bezer and ending with Hebron.

THE PAST, THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE
B. W. Burton
@Revelation 1: 4, 5; @Romans 5: 1, 2; @Philippians 3: 8 - 14; @2 Timothy 4: 6 - 8; @Revelation 3: 8 - 12
These scriptures speak of the past, the present and the future, and it is well to think of these three aspects of time. There are things in the past which we may wish we had never done. In the righteous-ness of God, through faith in Christ, those things can be settled to God's satisfaction. There are other past things that, in some measure, have been done in faithfulness to the Lord. Those are weighed in the balances, but in any case we know that we cannot alter the past. It has happened. It is well to have anything that troubles us settled in the presence of God, according to the standard of His righteousness.
I believe the point for us is how we are in the present, the moment given to us to fill out what the Lord would have us to do, to be here in relation to His pleasure and His testimony, and to be useful amongst His people. The present moment is always the test. This is the moment that we have, to serve in what the Lord lays upon us, and to do what the Spirit would help us to do. As to the future, that is in the Lord's hands. There is not really anything we can do about that either, but leave it to Him. We know that the future is glory, but how are we at the present moment?
In @Revelation 1, John addresses the seven assemblies with a message from the One "who is, and who was, and who is to come". You might have
{226}
thought it would read 'who was, and who is, and who is to come', but I think it reinforces what I have just said. The great point is the present, and the One that is on the throne is "who is". So the word is, "Grace to you and peace from him who is". God is speaking to you and me; He is speaking in a wider way too.
The speaking of God is a wonderful thing. He is speaking in Christ, and in the Spirit, and He would have a word for every one of us. Think of the grace and the peace of God flowing into our hearts! It is available, dear brethren. This is the attitude of Him who is on the throne, "who is". Oh! to be livingly and consciously in touch with God, to hear His word. The Lord was conscious that His own had been hearing the Father's word and they had answered to it, and they had kept it (@John 17). So let us have the sense that there is One "who is" on the throne. He "is", and also He "was". Think of all that has entered into that, as you look back over the history of time, and the ways of God and all that He has done, taking up one and another, working out His great designs, all according to the divine pattern, and it is going through to the wonderful divine end. Not only He is, but He was; He ever will be, and He is to come.
We rejoice to think of what is to come. There are great things to come. The message is also "from the seven Spirits which are before his throne". Think of the plenitude and the far-reaching character of the service of the Spirit at the present moment, seven
{227}
Spirits! We know, of course, that the Spirit of God is one blessed Person, but He is seen here in this figure as "the seven Spirits". It seems to me to supply the completeness of what is available from God Spirit-wise, God working through His Spirit and from the throne, the position of power and glory, dear brethren. Christ is the One who sits "on the right hand of the greatness on high" (@Hebrews 1: 3), but this is a beautiful verse and should attract our hearts.
"And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness". What a beautiful blending there is in these verses of the power of each Person of the Godhead, and the divine interest in the testimony all through this time. That would be involved in these seven assemblies. As we know, the addresses cover the whole scope of church history, the first three covering historical phases, the last four going on to the end. The One who is on the throne is watching everything, and it comes out in the Lord's word in the addresses to each of the seven assemblies. But the One who is on the throne is interested. He *is*. I would encourage every one to have a link with the living God, the One who is at the present moment, and He is towards us. His affections are towards us in view of strengthening every one of us in His testimony at the present time.
So let us have ears to hear too what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies, "the seven Spirits before his throne" no doubt linking with "what the Spirit says to the assemblies". So the Lord and the Spirit have things to say. God Himself has much to say to
{228}
every one of us at the present moment.
I go on to the verse in @Romans 5 because this really is where we all begin. This is a word that would appeal especially, perhaps, to the younger brethren, but to us all too. In this verse we have "peace" for the past, we have "favour" for the present and we have "hope" as to the future. Peace for the past -- it is wonderful, is it not? "Having been justified on the principle of faith". What a wonderful thing justification is! Christ risen and glorified -- the One that settled the question of sins, that bore my sins on the cross, that settled the whole question of sin, is in the unclouded favour of God at the present moment. The glory of God is shining in the face of Jesus Christ (@2 Corinthians 4: 6), the perfect testimony to God's satisfaction in that blessed One and all that He wrought, and to the fact that God's righteous claims have been met. Therefore we can look up into unclouded favour, the shining of God Himself, for we can find peace.
God wants those who have put their faith in Christ to enjoy a sense of settled peace as to the past. Justification is that God views the believer as if he had never sinned. Only God could do that. The believer is in Christ, so God views you in that One, and in justifying you, He views you apart from the whole question of that past, every aspect of it settled through faith in a risen and glorified Saviour.
But then Paul says, "by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand". Ah! have we gone in there? Do the young brethren
{229}
understand that? By Christ, not only has everything been settled to God's satisfaction, but a way has been made into the very favour of God. God's delight is in Jesus, and God has expressed it in the place and the glory that He has given to Jesus, at God's right hand. "By whom" -- by the Lord Jesus Christ -- "we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand". Favour for the present. What a wonderful thing to rest in the sense that we are in the favour of God! As the hymn says,
<blockquote>'God's favour never waneth <br>To us-ward who believe' (`184:3). </blockquote>
God wants to bestow on you a sense of His settled favour. He wants you to be enjoying the place He has given you, taken into favour in the Beloved. Who could unsettle that? God has done it for His own glory and the satisfaction of His own heart, but He has done it too for our blessing and establishment.
"And we boast in hope of the glory of God". So we can look too to the future with perfect assurance. All God's ways will end in glory, and if He has taken you up and blessed you in Christ, then His ways with you are going to end in glory for you too. You have this hope, you can "boast in hope of the glory of God". All the saints will be there and will have their part in glory in a coming age. This is a very assuring word to every believer in Jesus. I think God would assure us that we have these three things: peace for the past, favour at the present moment, and we are going on with a sure step to the great divine
{230}
goal which is glory.
I go on to speak a little about Paul. In the beginning of @Philippians 3 he goes over his past, a past of which he was now ashamed. Paul says, "what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss" (verse 7). Then he goes on to say further, "and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ". He had found deliverance in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. He had had a past, I suppose, that a religious man would have been proud of, but he came to it that it was all loss -- it was all "filth" in comparison with the glory of Christ. The grace of Christ had met him, the love of the Christ constrained him, "having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died" (@2 Corinthians 5: 14). He had found another Man, and He had displaced Paul in his estimation of himself. May the light of Christ in glory lay hold of every one of us.
Paul's present joy now was "to know him" (verse 10), and that, I think, was the theme of the beloved apostle's life. God presents a living and glorified personal Saviour that we might come to know Him. When we come to know Him, we realise that there is far more to learn about Him -- there are unsearchable riches with Him -- and we should know Him a little better every day. The more you know Him, the more you will love Him; and the more you love Him, the more you will want to serve Him; and the more you will be set to find His people, His body here. That is what laid hold of Paul at the very point of his conversion: the Lord said, "Saul, Saul, why
{231}
dost thou persecute me?" (@Acts 9: 4). Those that he had been persecuting he was now set to serve with all his strength. He devoted himself to serve the Lord and His people.
Then Paul says, "Not that I have already obtained the prize, or am already perfected; but I pursue". How active he was! Let us be pursuers. Paul was in the race; this was the present as far as Paul was concerned. He had nothing here in this world; everything for him was in Christ in glory. All that his life consisted of was bound up with that blessed Man and His interests here, and he was earnest and active in service. He speaks elsewhere about buffeting his body (@1 Corinthians 9: 27) -- Paul cared not for the things that the natural man would go in for; he was wholly taken up, captivated by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in affection he would "pursue".
"Seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus" -- another aspect of the beloved apostle's life at this point: he had been taken possession of by Christ Jesus, the Man in heaven. It is wonderful: divine ownership. Does every one here have a sense of that, that you have been taken possession of by Christ? He would have you wholly for Himself, with no divided objective, having a single eye for Christ -- He has given the lead in it Himself in taking possession of you. I say to every brother and sister here, including the younger brethren, Do not think you are out of it; the Lord wants you, and if you let Him, He can take
{232}
possession of you, take you up in relation to Himself and His interests, and give you something to do. He gave Paul, of course, a great deal to do, distinctive vessel that he was, but He has something for every one to do, and He would bless you in relation to it.
Then Paul speaks about "one thing -- forgetting the things behind". You see, the time comes when what is past loses its point. The goal was before Paul in a living and a vivid way, and he was forgetting the things behind. Sometimes we may need a bit of help to do that. We are often detained by the things behind, but the great thing is the things before. The present moment is the moment of opportunity to look on. It says, "Let thine eyes look right on ... Ponder the path of thy feet" (@Proverbs 4: 25, 26). The path that ends in glory, the path that ends with Christ, let us be pursuers in it and be like Paul: "forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before, I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".
This commanded Paul's life. He would not have been much interested in things here, what was happening amongst men. I suppose he might have taken account of it to some extent in relation to his prayers. He would be intelligent, of course, in relation to what God was doing, even with the nations, but Paul's great point was the coming glory. I would encourage every one in relation to that, to be filling out our lives at the present moment, that the coming glory might command us and that we may
{233}
direct our steps in view of the glory that is before us.
In @2 Timothy 4 Paul is just about at the end of his course. What a wonderful end was his! What is your end going to be, dear brother and dear sister? "*I* am already being poured out". All that he had, all that he was, was ready to be poured out for the Lord and in relation to His people. There was something in Paul that could be poured out, something of Christ in him that could be poured out. There is something in every believer that is for God's delight and pleasure.
Then Paul adds three things. Firstly, "I have combated the good combat". Paul had been a warrior, not fighting battles for their own sake, but he had taken up things in relation to the Lord's interests and the deliverance of many of His people. If there was a battle in relation to the liberty of the saints, or whatever it was that the enemy was doing, Paul was involved. He would be in the forefront. He says, "I have fought with beasts in Ephesus" (@1 Corinthians 15: 32). Then there was what he fought with in Corinth too, and many other things. It is not just any combat; it is "the good combat". I think it would be what is needed in the Lord's work. The Lord is the great Warrior; He is the Man of war, when He needs to be. Can we say that any one of us, in any measure, has been in the conflict on the Lord's side, and have we some sense that we have combated the good combat?
Secondly, "I have finished the race". We saw Paul earlier at full speed in that race. Nothing would turn him aside, he had his eye on the goal, and here
{234}
he is at the finish. That is wonderful -- his sense of rest and peace, and of the Lord's blessing. Paul was just about to finish his course. I trust every one here is in the race, and that you have a sense and the confidence that you are going to finish it too, either when the Lord takes any one of us to be with Himself, or when He comes for all His saints. When He comes, the race will be over. Let us be earnest in it, dear brethren.
Thirdly, "I have kept the faith". I think that means the whole truth of Christianity. He had kept it, valued it, been marked by it and been directed by it. There is a great wealth of truth in Christianity, and can we all say that we have kept it? I believe there would be divine approval and blessing for those who could say, in measure, that they have kept the faith, and followed in the path that the Lord would have them to be in.
Then Paul had his eye on "the crown", not for his own glory, but for the glory of Christ. Think of Christ's joy in being able to bestow "the crown of righteousness" on a believer! Paul had the sense that one was reserved for him and for "all who love his appearing". What joy there will be when Christ appears in His glory and takes up the reins of government! There will be those that come with Him, qualified to receive this crown of righteousness. Every bit of service for Christ here will be rewarded. We may not think much of our service, but the Lord measures it, whether it is much or little. The greater thing, of course, will be to see
{235}
Him face to face, and when we see Him "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (@1 John 3: 2).
I close with a reference to @Revelation 3, because this brings us, I think, to what is collective. What we have been speaking about is mainly individual experience, but here, in the Lord's word to Philadelphia, He is speaking to a company that were faithful to Him, and He speaks with great joy and great appreciation. The Lord looks back over the record and He says certain things: "thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name", and He says later as to persons ("them of the synagogue of Satan"), "they shall come and ... shall know that *I* have loved thee". These things are to mark those that are faithful to Jesus at the present time, the time of His rejection. There is a company here who have kept His word. Think of the majesty of that! His word, how great it is, how varied, how full, but there are persons that keep it. Oh! dear brethren, let us be amongst those who keep His word. That is, we value it, we hear it and we do it. There are three stages, and each of the three is important, but to arrive at the third one -- to do it, or to keep it -- is absolutely vital.
"The assembly in Philadelphia" (verse 7) is a company the Lord can appraise as having kept His word and not denied His Name. I think that would involve that everything that is done amongst the saints is to be in accord with that Name and in accord with the glory and majesty of it. Then it says, "and shall know that *I* have loved thee". How beautiful that is! I do not think it means that Philadelphia did not
{236}
know it at the time, but there are persons that will be brought to acknowledge it. Philadelphia certainly would have had a sense of the love of Christ. Well, dear brethren, we should have a sense of the tender love of Christ at the present moment in relation to what speaks to Him of His assembly.
We know that we cannot find the assembly in a place today, but we may find those who are walking in the light of the assembly, and the Lord loves the local companies too. He loves what is collective and is faithful to Him in relation to the truth of the assembly. He says, "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial", and then He speaks about making him "that overcomes ... a pillar in the temple of my God". That gives a view, I think, into the future. There are certain touches in these verses as to the overcomer in Philadelphia that are unique.
The Lord speaks so beautifully of making the overcomer "a pillar" in the temple of His God, "and he shall go no more at all out". Is that not fine, dear brethren? We should know something of this in Spirit at the present time, but we have to go out again. But there is a time coming when we shall go in and no more go out. That will be glory, that will be the presence of Christ. What it will be to be in the presence of Him who has effected all this for us, and is maintaining at the present moment His testimony here!
Then He speaks about "the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God,
{237}
and my new name". These are things that we shall come to realise in their fulness when we are actually with Christ, but they are promises, and every promise of God is fulfilled in Him. His words here will certainly be fulfilled. There is a place for every true believer, for every one that is walking in the light of the assembly at the present moment, in relation to this temple, in relation to His glory.
May we be encouraged, brethren, in these things, to have an eye on the past, the present, and, more particularly, on the future, for the glory of God and our blessing, for His Name's sake!

THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD
J. H. Trevvett
@Psalm 23
It might be helpful to look at the Lord Jesus as our Shepherd, and @Psalm 23 suggests itself as presenting Him in this character. It is a beautiful psalm, and is perhaps so well known generally that much of its precious detail is lost sight of. It is written in the singular and is the outcome of soul experience. One can think of David leading the sheep and chanting this psalm as thoughts of the great Antitype -- Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep -- filled his soul. David's very pathway and occupation thus produce a yield for God.
Of all the psalms, this one is perhaps the best known. It is called "A Psalm of David", but it may be learned and sung by each one of us as having
{238}
known and proved the Lord Jesus as our Shepherd. It does not speak of His official greatness; it bespeaks His heart -- what He *is* and what He *does*! It is helpful to notice the position of the psalm. It comes between the abandonment and work of Christ on the cross (@Psalm 22) and His millennial glory (@Psalm 24). In @Psalm 22 there is 'the voice of a man'. He is abandoned by God, suffering for sin. But He is heard, and a threefold circle of responsive affection is secured for God as a result of His work. In @Psalm 24 we get the Lord taking His place as King of glory, but @Psalm 23 speaks of the same blessed Person known here on earth in every circumstance through which the believer has to pass.
@Psalm 22 gives us the *good* Shepherd laying down His life for the sheep (@John 10: 11); @Psalm 23 the *great* Shepherd tending and feeding the sheep (@Hebrews 13: 20); @Psalm 24 the *chief* Shepherd seen in exaltation and glory (@1 Peter 5: 4). He will shepherd the nations in that day.
Now if I say, "The Lord is my Shepherd" (@Psalm 23: 1, Authorised Version), it involves that I am one of His sheep and that I am submissive and my will is not in exercise. It is not a beautiful sentiment, but a reality; and what is the effect? "I shall not want". Often-times difficulties and trials beset and hinder us, but this word admits of no doubt: "I shall not want". Now I am free to come under the compulsion and leading of love. "He *maketh* me to lie down ... he *leadeth* me". He would have me restful before Him. "My meditation of him shall be pleasant"
{239}
(@Psalm 104: 34, footnote *a*). Meditation and prayer are preferable to study, and greater in results. I am at rest in green pastures. In His alluringness He compels me to lie down -- "maketh me". Then He leadeth me beside the still waters. It is all to the end that I may learn Himself. Mary placed herself in a submissive spirit at His disposal, and she was led beside still waters. Martha forgot the Shepherd, for she said, "dost thou not care?" Of course He cared, but His delight at that moment lay in leading Mary into rest to hear His word (@Luke 10: 38 - 42). We need to cultivate this kind of abstraction.
Note the shepherd care of Jesus as He said to His disciples after their arduous service, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little. For those coming and those going were many, and they had not leisure even to eat" (@Mark 6: 31). He is going to feed them according to the integrity of His heart, and He is guiding them by the skilfulness of His hands. (@Psalm 78: 72).
He leads us *in* that He may lead us out. "He restoreth my soul", the weariness and pressure of the way are lost sight of, and He leads out now in testimony -- the "paths of righteousness *for His name's sake*". Our service manward is poor and unworthy if we have not first been restful with Christ. Our Shepherd is sensitive to all that is not consistent with the paths of righteousness. Let us be simple about this -- Jesus is our Shepherd; He is set for our good and prosperity. He serves not for wages but in love. The false shepherds in @Ezekiel 34 served
{240}
for wages; they ate the fat and clothed themselves with the wool. We have a Shepherd who loves to feed His flock and to strengthen the weak. He knows every sheep and its distinguishing feature. A brother who is a farmer showed me a shepherd on his farm who had the care of four hundred sheep and lambs, and he said the shepherd knew *every one* because of certain marks, and could tell which were missing. I thought of *our* Shepherd as tending and succouring *myriads* of sheep, and knowing each one severally because He had *died* for each.
Shepherd instincts and care contribute to promotion amongst the saints, and also to their prosperity. God took David from the sheepfolds, from *following* the suckling-ewes (@Psalm 78: 70, 71), and made him to be the leader of His people. There are two features with a shepherd: he can follow the sheep and he can lead. Following has a generation in view, but leading is in view of knowing the heart of God and the mind of Christ. "He leadeth me beside still waters", and would there make known to me divine thoughts. What a Shepherd He is! Nothing can alarm the sheep if they are near Him; if straying, they are exposed to danger.
<blockquote>'In Thy presence we are happy; <br>In Thy presence we're secure'. </blockquote>
His eyes are upon the sheep. How He follows the movements of the man in @John 9 and eventually leads him into the flock. Forsaken of parents, despised by neighbours, cast out by the religious leaders -- he is found by Jesus. Surely *he* would say,
{241}
"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want". Then in @John 10 he finds green pastures.
A sheep either follows or strays; a sick sheep gets away alone. We have seen such, alas! a brother or sister who nurses a grievance and keeps away from the brethren. We need to be marked by the features of our great Shepherd to recover such.
"He leadeth me". People say, 'I am so easily led'; they usually mean led in a wrong direction. Why not let *Him* lead? Now (verse 4) I can "walk through the valley of the shadow of death" without fear. The same One who lay in the dust of death in @Psalm 22 now supports me even in death's valley. But it is only the *shadow* of death. I am no longer held in bondage. The One who shepherds me through has become the Lord even of death. The enemy would discourage us with the shadow of death, but he has been robbed of the substance by the Lord, who says, "Fear not ... I ... have the keys of death and of hades" (@Revelation 1: 17, 18). The public testimony of verse 3 may be followed by persecution, trial, even death (as in verse 4), as suffering for righteousness, but before the pressure comes He has calmed my soul beside the still waters.
I met an ungodly soldier in France, a lad of nineteen, and I asked if he had a christian mother. He said, 'Yes'. Then I asked what she had told him to read in times of difficulty and danger, and he said, 'Something about the valley of the shadow of death', but he did not know where it was. We sat down together in the presence of about two hundred other
{242}
men and read this psalm. A day or two after he confessed Christ, and a few weeks later was killed in battle. He had gained the knowledge of the Shepherd who would sustain him even in the valley of the shadow of death.
This verse has been a comfort to many; but what about "thy rod and thy staff", His control over me and His support for me? They go together, and the psalmist speaks in the plural now, "they comfort me". Would we covet the staff without the rod? We could never know His support except as controlled by Him. Comfort follows obedience, and "*his* commandments are not grievous" (@1 John 5: 3).
"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies". What a triumph! A table furnished even on earth. Thus He would set us up in power and as nourished by Himself.
"Thou hast anointed my head with oil". Are we true to the oil? If so, the effect is seen, "my cup runneth over". There is now the overflowing of what has been enjoyed inwardly. Do not let us be stoical or seek to suppress spiritual emotions. We have an outlet for these -- to God first and then to man. Many of us lack the simplicity which the true knowledge of God would give us.
Now the psalmist reaches a most blessed conclusion: "Surely, goodness and loving-kindness shall follow me *all* the days of my life". So all is well, past, present and future, all in the hands of our great Shepherd. We can 'praise Him for all that is past', but there is more: we can 'trust Him for all
{243}
that's to come' (`23:2). Jacob could speak of the God who "shepherded me *all my life long* to this day" (@Genesis 48: 15), and he could look on to the future whilst blessing the sons of Joseph. "Surely, goodness and loving-kindness shall follow me", there is no doubt now as to the future.
After this psalm is known we can claim the whole earth for the Lord (@Psalm 24). The Shepherd of @Psalm 23 is none less than the King of glory. Do our hearts rise to it now? All power is in His hands and we look on to the day when He shall have His rightful place; meanwhile how comforting is His service to us. 'We love the Shepherd's voice' (`465:4). "He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out", but never into a place where He cannot go with them. "He goes before them" (@John 10: 3, 4). The results of His shepherd care were seen in Peter; how jealously the Lord looked on him. He is ultimately commissioned to "Shepherd my sheep" (@John 21: 17), and his work and his epistles show how true he was to that commission. Then as having imbibed the spirit of his Master he desires a succession of shepherds, not in name but in character (@1 Peter 5). Peter exhorts the elders to shepherd the *flock* of God (verse 2). Paul counsels the elders at Miletus to shepherd the assembly of God (@Acts 20: 28). Both Peter and Paul had learned from the good Shepherd how to shepherd the saints. Both alike, too, could desire that shepherding be continued amongst the people of God. This can only be as we learn Christ as the good Shepherd, the great
{244}
Shepherd and the chief Shepherd.
The good Shepherd laid down His life for the sheep (@John 10: 11); the great Shepherd is a risen Christ tending His own on earth (@Hebrews 13: 20); the chief Shepherd waits to reward every faithful under-shepherd (@1 Peter 5: 4).

THE FIRST DAY AND THE LAST DAY
W. J. House
@Genesis 1: 1 - 5; @John 20: 1 - 18; @Acts 20: 6, 7; @John 6: 30 - 40, 44, 53 - 55
I have in mind to call attention to the importance of the first day and the last day, both clearly relating to time. It is wonderful that God should make time His servant, as, indeed, He uses everything. "For all things are thy servants"; a wonderful word in @Psalm 119: 91, indicating how great God is. Ultimately, everything is His servant, whether willingly or unwillingly, and that gives great rest to our hearts. Time especially is His servant, God dividing time into sections.
It is clear that the great divisions of time are determined from heaven. Man has nothing to do with them except to submit to them. None can alter a day. The day is settled from heaven, it cannot be lengthened, it cannot be shortened, and what we speak of as a day, twenty-four hours, is divided into day and night by heaven. And the month is determined by heaven -- the lunar month. Man has nothing to say thereto, for it is fixed by God. And
{245}
the year is fixed by God, the complete cycle of seasons is also determined from heaven. God is pleased to use time to teach us many things. Finally, He uses a thousand years as one of His days to display His great triumph, for the coming world will display the triumph of good over evil, and when time has served its purpose it passes away. Our lives individually are made up of days and years. That is the great division of life of each individual on earth. "The days", it says, "of our years are three score years and ten" (@Psalm 90: 10). But the life of God's people as His assembly is divided into weeks, and it was with this in mind I wanted to say a word or two particularly about the first day of the week.
First of all I want to say a word about the *first* day. Its bearing is that it leads and gives character to the days that follow it. That is the scriptural thought of first, illustrated in the way the apostle speaks of Christ. As typified by Melchisedec He is "first ... King of righteousness" and then "King of peace" (@Hebrews 7: 2). That is to say, He is to be known first as supreme in righteousness, the great King of righteousness. Men would like to alter that and put peace first, but you cannot have peace according to God without righteousness. So it is with the Lord's selection of the apostles. It says, "First ... Peter" (@Matthew 10: 2). Peter is the apostle that is to lead and give character to all, both by divine selection and by what he represents in his ministry.
So the first day is *that day in relation to other days*. It is not an isolated day, but as the first day it
{246}
stands at the head of the other days. Now you can see that must be true if you look at what is said of the first day in @Genesis 1. On that day it says, "God said, Let there be light". Previously there was a condition of darkness, "And the earth", it says, "was waste and empty". How long that period lasted is not disclosed to men, but the truth is that the earth was waste and empty. What a thought that is, an empty, barren earth, and darkness pervading all. But on the first day, "God said, Let there be light. And there was light". What follows on the other days could not be effective without the first day. The light must be there for the work of God to proceed, for God would not work in darkness, because He is light and in Him is no darkness at all (@1 John 1: 5). So that if He is operating, He brings in light and then divides the light from the darkness and names them. He calls the light, Day, and He calls darkness, Night. So it says, "God saw the light that it was good ... And there was evening, and there was morning -- the first day".
All can *see* what follows in the separation of the waters on the earth from the waters above, by the firmament; in the bringing in of dry land and making it fruitful, and finally, animals and then man appearing on the scene. How essential must be the first day, that there must be light and that the light and the darkness must be separated and named, or all else could not proceed to the great end that God had in view.
Now this is still true of His work in every one of us. Our first day, the first day of His operations in
{247}
us, is that He commands light to shine out of darkness and He causes the light and the darkness to be separated and named. I believe every true conversion is like that; divine light enters the heart that hitherto has been barren and empty, and what follows normally is that the soul begins to distinguish between light and darkness, and is able to say of the light, This is day; and of the darkness, This is night. There is evening and there is morning, a first day. Then every exercise that follows is to be governed by that. Our life and our spiritual history are to be in the light that God has commanded, and in the maintenance of the difference between day and night, by naming both.
Every true Christian had a first day like that. Let me ask you, Is it a unit that stands away back in the past by itself, and your other days different, with no relation to the first? or has your subsequent history been in that light that once shone into your soul? And have you maintained the calling of light, Day, and of darkness, Night? Or are you mixing these things, so that the first day of your soul's history is simply an isolated unit? That is not God's thought. His thought is that the first day should lead every day, as controlling and influencing them. What fruitfulness, what pleasure to God follows when that is the case, so that, at the end, God looks on everything that He has made, "and, behold", it says, "it was very good" (verse 31).
I inquire of young hearts here who have had a beginning, a first day, who once divided light from
{248}
darkness, who once were able to say, This is light, this is day; that is darkness, that is night, and the two were separated in your soul. What about your second day, and your third? Does every other day follow your first one? That is God's order, His thought. If there is to be productivity -- increase -- for His pleasure, that day must ever be the first day, when the light of heaven shone into your heart and when you were able definitely to separate light from darkness, and name both.
One has been struck with the great power there is in naming things. God helps people who do so. Many are detained and diverted because they will not look things in the face and give them a name. Read the first of Genesis. God keeps on naming things and the first thing to be named is light, called day, and the second, darkness, called night. To mix these two will, as far as you are concerned, destroy the great end in view, of being here, fruitful for God. What I have said as to that indicates what is in my mind -- that the first day stands out as the great *head* of the days. It is so in creation, and it is so in our souls as we are maintained true to divine thoughts.
Now I would like to say a word or two about "the first day of the week", which belongs to the assembly, God's people as set together. The bearing of a week has relation to God's people together, and I want to apply what I have said in the same way, that every week we live, as of God's assembly together, is headed by the first day. The twentieth chapter of John introduces what comes to light on
{249}
the first day of the week. Luke does not speak of that, but of the day after the sabbath. But John speaks of the first day of the week, the beginning of the week, the assembly period. The One who went into death was no longer in death on the first day of the week -- He was risen. That is the thing. God's people now stand related to Christ, not as here on earth, but as a living Man out of death. The Object of God's people, the Object of their hearts, is not living on earth, nor is He in the grave -- the sepulchre is empty -- He is a living Man beyond death. The assembly's Object is not on the earth, nor in death.
The assembly's week begins with that. The week for all our hearts, as God's people, begins with this great discovery, that our Object is not on the earth, but is beyond death, and is to be known to us there, as He made Himself known to Mary. Mary represents what I am saying. She discovers an empty tomb and she finds, on the first day of the week, that the great Object of her heart discloses Himself to her as in resurrection, outside man's world and earthly things and all that makes up human life here. He is beyond all that, but He is living and able to put Himself in touch with His people in a real and spiritual way. Is that a theory to us, dear brethren? Is it something that we assent to in a mere nominal way, or do we know it experimentally, that the Lord Jesus, the Head of His body, the assembly, can put Himself livingly in touch with His own as their great Object? He does it on the first day of the week, and
{250}
then He discloses to Mary, this great lover of His, that the light and the sweetness of heavenly relationships are to be known on that day.

OBEYING THE GOSPEL
F. S. Marsh
It is striking that in that beautiful treatise on the gospel of God -- the epistle to the Romans -- there should be a statement at the commencement that the gospel is presented "for *obedience of faith* among all the nations" (chapter 1: 5) and that, at its close, reference should be made to the "commandment of the eternal God, made known for *obedience of faith* to all nations" (chapter 16: 26).
The apostle Peter confirms this thought of obedience in connection with the gospel, for he asks, "what shall the end be of those who *obey* not the glad tidings of God?" (@1 Peter 4: 17). While to the Thessalonians the apostle Paul writes of "vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not *obey* the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Thessalonians 1: 8), he also writes with sadness in @Romans 10: "they have not all *obeyed* the gospel" (verse 16).
The first evidence of obedience is that the gospel is BELIEVED, for it is only effective in those who receive it in faith. On the day of Pentecost there were three thousand who "gladly received his word" and "were baptised" (@Acts 2: 41, AV).
The gospel of the grace of God, great and
{251}
glorious though it is, avails none but those who receive it in "repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Acts 20: 21). It was said of those whose carcasses fell in the wilderness, "the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard" (@Hebrews 4: 2).
It is the pleasure of God that the gospel, having been believed, should be ENJOYED by those who have obeyed it, for it is intimately bound up with joy. There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth; joy in the Shepherd's heart when, having found the lost sheep, He says, "Rejoice with me" (@Luke 15), and there is joy in the heart of the believer in Jesus, when as the result of the gospel he is filled "with all joy and peace in believing ... by the power of the Holy Spirit" (@Romans 15: 13).
By the Holy Spirit alone is the believer filled with joy, for "the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace" (@Galatians 5: 22). The secret of joy is thus beautifully told in @Ephesians 1: 12, 13, in which the apostle, writing of those who have "pre-trusted in the Christ", adds, "in whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise".
It is by the Spirit's power that the promises of God are so faithfully fulfilled and the truths of the gospel are PROVED by those who obey it. That assuring promise of God that "their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more" (@Hebrews 10: 17) is proved by the believer in the
{252}
conscious knowledge of the forgiveness of sins. The promised gift of the Holy Spirit is proved as "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (@Romans 8: 16), and as "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (@Romans 5: 5).
But the gospel is not given that it may remain hidden in the hearts of Christians, but that it might be TESTIFIED, not by angels, but by those who have obeyed it and are enjoying and proving its reality and power. The commission given to Saul of Tarsus, after he had obeyed the gospel, was "to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God" (@Acts 20: 24), while the other apostles were told to "Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life" (@Acts 5: 20).
The personal testimony of individuals to individuals, though more testing, both as to heart and ability, is oftentimes more effective than even public preaching, and this means is being greatly used of God today to awaken many to the realisation of their need of the gospel.
To all who obey the gospel the public proclamation is of great interest, for it is divinely ordained that the gospel should be PREACHED, and "God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe" (@1 Corinthians 1: 21). The Lord said to His disciples, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" (@Mark 16: 15). But it is necessary that the preacher should go as one "sent"; for "how shall they hear
{253}
without one that preaches? and how shall they preach unless they have been sent?" (@Romans 10: 14, 15).
Those who would go forth to preach will find much instruction and encouragement in the consideration of the preachings recorded in Scripture, and especially in considering the public utterances of our Lord and Master, who displayed the manner and the spirit in which He would have His servants to proclaim God's great salvation.
Perhaps the most distinctive and important present result of obeying the gospel is the transformation of the lives of those who obey. By a consistent and subject life the gospel is ADORNED and the preaching endorsed. Who would have supposed that a poor down-trodden slave could adorn the glad tidings? Yet the believing slaves were exhorted "to be subject to their own masters, to make themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying; not robbing their masters, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the teaching which is of our Saviour God in all things" (@Titus 2: 9, 10).
How great, then, are the results of obedience to the faith! May each be enabled to display them!
"For the rest, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified" (@2 Thessalonians 3:1).

GOD'S TWO-FOLD VOICE IN SCRIPTURE
J. R. Kilroe
The account of Israel's entrance into the land is indeed a voice from God, telling how He can accomplish His purposes of blessing for His own; but when one's ears are open to His second voice, the story of infinite love, enigmatically told in the movements of the ark, on that great occasion, with the account of the two memorials in Jordan and at Gilgal, we are so engrossed that the literal account -- great as the doings were -- becomes of secondary interest.
The fascinating history of David from the moment of his anointing, through his victory over Goliath and long course of gracious forbearance with Saul, to his establishment in Zion as God's chosen king, has its peculiar charm for every pious reader. But when we awaken to the fact that in all this, as well as in many of the precious psalms which David sang, we have a prophetic account and presentation of our Lord Jesus Christ, our souls are enraptured with the Spirit's unfoldings of the glorious tale. We contemplate *Him* as Son and King (@Psalm 2). His victory, gracious bearing towards enemies, patient ways in the encouragement of His own, on up to the point at which we can address Him, consciously participating in His triumphs: "Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive" (@Psalm 68: 18), and see, with the apostle, that He must "fill all things" (@Ephesians 4: 10).
Then, once more, we contemplate Him
{255}
associating Himself with the lowly at John's baptism in Jordan, yet born King (@Matthew 2: 2), heralded and proclaimed (@Matthew 3), according to the decree of @Psalm 2 -- Son of God! Proved in perfect, dependent manhood, yet manifested as divine by His words of grace (@Matthew 4), and seated on the mount of beatitudes announcing the moral principles of His kingdom (@Matthew 5). All this is very apparent -- precious story! But even here we may discern the second side of the two-fold voice of Scripture. For the Lord's "I say unto you" involves an authority which none but the supreme One could justly assume -- it supersedes all that went before ... A little thought, moreover, will show that in the beatitudes we have a veiled setting forth of the Lord's own experiences, thus:
Who so "*poor in spirit*" as He? (@Psalm 40; @Psalm 69; @2 Corinthians 8: 9).
*Mourner*, most deeply so in Gethsemane (@Hebrews 5: 7).
*Meek*, especially in the high priest's palace and in the judgment hall, though ever so.
*Righteous*, ever thus, supremely so at the cross. (@Romans 5: 18, footnote *m*: '... It is the accomplished subsisting righteousness answering to the one offence').
The *merciful* One, obtaining mercies for others in resurrection (@Psalm 89, see especially verse 19; @Acts 13: 34).
Ever "*pure in heart*", He could *ascend* (@Romans 1: 4; @John 20: 17; @Psalm 17: 15).
{256}
THE *Peacemaker* (@Colossians 1: 20; @Ephesians 2: 17).
*Persecuted* and reproached (@John 15:20; @Acts 9: 4).
How confirmatory it is to us *to hear* in the two-fold way above indicated! God speaks in no merely formal way in the holy Scriptures: He makes us *feel* what it is to be in living touch with that which is divine and infinite -- that we have to do with that which is entirely beyond not only the ability of man to indite, but his ability to discern apart from the Spirit, even though truth lies open before his physical and mental vision.
May we ever be so near to Him, so interested and so teachable, that we may discern the hidden wonders of His blessed word!

{257}
THE FIRST DAY AND THE LAST DAY
W. J. House
@Genesis 1: 1 - 5; @John 20: 1 - 18; @Acts 20: 6, 7; @John 6: 30 - 40, 44, 53 - 55
Jesus says, "go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God". And Mary came and told these things to the disciples. She told them that, on this wonderful first day, He is to be known as out of death, in touch with His own, and He would convey to them the blessedness of heavenly relationships. That is the day that is to head our week. The consciousness that He is not here, that He has passed out of this scene, is not now in the grave, but still living, characterises this day. Our Object is a living Man, who is in touch with His own and conveys to their hearts the sweetness of heavenly relationships. He said, "I ascend": that indicated the heavenly character of the relationships to be known on the first day, not only resurrection, but ascension.
What about the second day? What about the third day? What about every other day of the week of God's people here? Is this the day that gives character to our week? We must have to do with the earth, but our Object is not here. That is as true on Monday as it was on the first day; it is as true for the last day, the seventh day, as it was on the first, that our Object is not here, but we belong to His assembly where He is known, and we have tasted the sweet-ness of eternal and heavenly relationships. The Lord intends that to put a colour on the rest of the week.
{258}
How different everything would look on Monday if the first day stood in relation to the next day, and the next, and the next, even to the last. Alas! with many of us, I fear the first day is only a unit, just one day, not the first day really, but one day, the second day not attached to it, not linked with it. So that on the second day our objects are seen to be really on the earth and earthly relationships absorb us.
Now I would like to pass on to the twentieth chapter of the Acts. There we have the first day of the week connected with the breaking of the bread. It says, "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread". Every heart, I trust, says, Yes, I do that; I come together with the saints on the first day to break bread. Who that loves Christ would be missing? "This do", He says, "in remembrance of me" (@Luke 22: 19). What lover would be voluntarily missing when He is to be remembered? How worthy He is to be remembered, for we owe everything to Him! But what I want to ask, dear brethren, is this: Is the day on which you break bread *the first day of the week*, or is it a detached day, a day that just comes round once a week but has no bearing on the rest of the week? If so, it is not the first day to you. The Spirit of God records that it was on the first day of the week they assembled to break bread. The saints in that city, Troas, began their week by this day ... The blessed One who came into the body that was prepared for Him used His body in devoted love to His own, even to its surrender in death, and the saints, on the first day of the week, eat this bread.
{259}
They not only maintain the memorial, but they eat the bread. It is food to their affections. What for? That strengthened, they might pursue the week as characterised by the food they have eaten, for that is the meaning of food. Food determines our character, and the saints together on the first day of the week eat this bread. The point in Matthew particularly is the eating, it is food for the hearts of the saints, so that strengthened by it, the week might be characterised by the first day.
Let me ask each one of us as of the assembly in this city, does Monday reflect anything of the first day? You say, How can it be? The bread we have eaten on the first day speaks of Christ's body given for us. What are we doing with our body on the second day? Oh! says someone, We must take great care of it lest our health gives way. That is not what was learnt on the first day. What was learnt on the first day? "This is my body, which is given for you" (@Luke 22: 19), even to death, so that with that day leading we hold our body for sacrifice, for devotedness to the saints, in measure as Christ did.
Then come the evenings; the prayer meeting sees us present, also the reading on Wednesday, maybe Thursday, and the care of God's beloved people who need shepherding will be remembered also. Oh! you say, There is little time, and our strength will give out. "This is my body, which is given for you", is the food of the first day. It is not a day by itself, every day takes character from that day. Oh! says somebody, We will not live long. That is not our
{260}
object. The Lord was taken away in the midst of His days. How are we holding our bodies?
Perhaps the greatest evidence of selfishness lies in the use of our bodies. The Spirit of God says, They came together on the first day of the week to break bread. The whole week should be marked by what flows from the first day, the Lord's body given in devoted love to His people, the reflection of that in the beloved saints is that their bodies are held for service and sacrifice to the saints, or else the first day is only an isolated day. "*We* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives" (@1 John 3: 16).
So the next thing is, "this is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many", "Drink ye all of it" (@Matthew 26: 27, 28). The Lord says on the first day, Let your heart be stimulated with joy as you drink into the love that moved Me to lay down My life for you, to secure you for the pleasure of God and His holy service. "For many". One loves the thought of the many. God looked down at one time to see if there were any. It says, There was not even one (@Psalm 14: 3, 4). Let your hearts expand in the joy of the Lord's love that would give up His life to have you for God, for His service, for His praise, to be amongst the thousands of them that love Him. That is the joy of the first day, that you have a place amongst the thousands of those who minister to God, that love Him. Is the second day like that?
What about the last day of the week? The first day speaks to us of a life that is laid down for ever, for the life that is in the blood is surrendered for ever.
{261}
You say, If I follow that line I will not live long here. The blessed Lord surrendered the life of flesh and blood for ever, to have you amongst the many, to have you as one of those instruments to praise withal. What are we doing with our lives as the week pursues its course? Are we letting go a little of our lives? The Lord in the cup says, I have given up My life: This cup is the new covenant in My blood which is shed for many. As the week passes, are we holding our life with a firm hand, lest a little of it should go? The apostle John says, "*we* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives", and the apostle Paul says, "Daily I die" (@1 Corinthians 15: 31). "Bearing about", he says, "in the body the dying of Jesus" (@2 Corinthians 4: 10). Paul says "dying", not the death of Jesus, but the dying.
We miss the joy and blessedness of Christianity if our week is not headed by the first day, but if it is headed by the first day, with what appetite, with what intense longings we approach the first day again, that our hearts might be strengthened afresh by the bread, and the joy of our souls stimulated by the cup. There is sometimes a lack of desire for the Supper, which indicates that the first day of the week has not really been first, hence there is little hunger and thirst, because the energy and joy has not been expended in the week that followed. I commend it to every heart here of those who break bread, that the divine thought is that the first day stands in relation to each day that follows.
I would say a word or two about the "last day" of @John 6. What a thought is the last day, the final day,
{262}
the day when all that has been secured in time, comes to light and is manifest. What joy to think that nothing that God has wrought in His people through-out the ages will be missing in the last day. The last day will be the day of manifestation, the day when God displays His work. That is the day that counts in this connection. Where will we be when the last day comes? Will there be anything worthy of having a place in the last day? So the Lord indicates what marks those who will appear then.
The Lord speaks of those the Father has given Him. "All that the Father gives me", He says, "... I will raise him up at the last day". What a view of the work of God, that we belong to those who are given to Christ! Think of the Father giving us to Him! Would He give Him a poor, unworthy gift? The Lord delighted in those who were given to Him. He says in another place, "They were thine, and thou gavest them me" (@John 17: 6). What a view to take of the saints. They are the gift of the Father to Christ. What a privilege to serve them faithfully. "All that the Father gives me" (verse 39), the Lord says. Every true believer represents a gift from the Father to Christ. He values them so much that when the last day comes He will raise them up, not one will be missing. They will be there because of the price He puts on them as the Father's gift. Then the Lord says, "For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, should have life eternal; and I will raise him up at the last day" (verse 40). That is another feature of the work of God.
{263}
What a sight to see the Son, to see the blessed One in manhood who declares God, who makes God known!
The whole physical universe teaches us some-thing about God as to His eternal power, but the Son is the Declarer of God in grace and life, and every eye that has seen Him and believes on Him (not *did* believe, but *is characterised* by belief, whatever adversity comes, whether loss or sickness or death, such still believe on the Son and in the disclosure of the heart of God in Him) -- every such person shall have life eternal. The Lord so delights in such that He says, "I will raise him up at the last day". Such are so valuable to Christ that He will see they are not missing then, for they have seen Him and believed on Him here.
Then we have a further word from the Lord. "No one can come to me", He says, "except the Father who has sent me draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day" (verse 44). Now we have another view of the work of God. Christ is presented as the great Magnet of the moral universe, and the Father is drawing the hearts of men to Christ. In another place the Lord is doing the drawing, "I ... will draw all to me" (@John 12: 32), the blessed One who was lifted up. But in this passage the Father is drawing. In His gracious activities of love and goodness He is engaged in drawing men to Christ. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him. How He valued Nathanael, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile" (@John 1: 47). The Lord says of every one that has been thus drawn, "I will raise him up in the last day".
{264}
He so values such that when the last day comes each will be there; the Lord will see to that.
Then, finally as to this viewpoint, the Lord says, "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up at the last day" (verse 54). The Lord is looking again at another feature that He puts great price on. How the Lord delights in those who eat His flesh and drink His blood. He has His eye on them and when the last day comes they will be there. You will notice He says, "I will raise him up" in each of these cases. They said to Christ, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" (@John 6: 60)
One cannot speak of it now, but just to say that eating His flesh and drinking His blood is the appropriation of His death here. The expression "flesh and blood" signifies the condition of life that He took, in which He died; it was the termination of the life of flesh and blood. You say, I do not see much food and joy in that. No, dear brethren, if earthly things are our all, there is nothing to attract in such meat and drink. If all I want is my business, my money, my home, and the pleasures and comforts of this life, of course I am not attracted by the termination in death of the condition of life that the Lord Jesus took; but if I find my food and joy in His death, it is because I have discovered other objects. First I have discovered in His death that which satisfies my heart, the blessed disclosure of His love, of divine love, and then there is a world beyond flesh and blood. Do we believe it? There is a world beyond flesh and blood, a vast world, "that world, and the
{265}
resurrection" (@Luke 20: 35), and the eating His flesh and drinking His blood is the acceptance of death in view of that world and the resurrection. The Lord says of any who so accept death, that He will see that he has part in the last day. What will give us a place in the last day is the thing that matters. We may miss much that is going on in the present world, but that is all coming to an end for ever, but when the last day comes, the Lord is going to raise up all that the Father has given Him, all that have seen the Son and believed on Him, all that have been drawn to Him by the Father, all who have fed upon His precious death as having another world in view. The Lord says, I will see they have a place then.
I thought it might be well to commend to you these two thoughts, the first day giving character to the rest of the days, whether it be our first day as Christians, or whether it be the first day of the week for God's people. On the other hand, to pursue that which will give us a place in the last day, so that the Lord will raise us up as valuing us. The Lord puts a value on what He raises up for the last day. May the Lord help us in these two matters.

MORE THAN CONQUERORS
J. Taylor
@Luke 12: 32; @James 1: 25; @James 2: 12
I wish to dwell specially upon the importance of maintaining a right spirit. The gospel as in Romans effects deliverance for man. It effects adjustment as
{266}
to the conscience, and finally views the believer as receiving the Holy Spirit, that "in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (chapter 8: 37). That is a statement that covers all believers who are in the light of that epistle. They are more than conquerors in the most adverse circumstances.
What I understand by a conqueror in a christian sense is that he maintains a right spirit in adversity. He is always superior as to his spirit. There are certain elements presented objectively that help in that connection, but aside from the Holy Spirit it is quite impossible to maintain the Spirit of Christ in adverse circumstances.
I would call attention to Paul's letters. It is always interesting to take account of opening and closing statements; these indicate the attitude of the writer towards those written to. In looking at Paul's letters, one is struck by the way he speaks of the spirits of the saints. He ends with the desire "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all" or "with your spirit". He was concerned that there should be the maintaining of Christ's spirit. Paul had amongst others received of His Spirit. John had said "of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace" (@John 1: 16). I think he understood it. He looks at grace as coming wave upon wave from Christ. Paul had received and proved its supporting value in service, in reproach and in suffering. So it should be with the saints. Thus it can be reckoned on, and earnestly desired and sought by each.
{267}
There are certain things presented to us objectively to help us. One of the great objective things is the *Father's care*. The gospel brings the light of the Father to us, and the youngest believer is viewed as knowing the Father. In the first three gospels the Lord invariably brings in the Father. The disciples had attached themselves to Jesus, and companied with Him; they had continued with Him in His temptations, they were of special interest to the Father in their continuing with Christ in companionship, in His, not their, temptations. The Lord continually instructs them as to the Father's care, and, as a Man here, He showed in their company what the Father was to Him. In @Matthew 11 where the Lord's testimony to Israel is rejected by city after city, He says, "We have piped to you, and ye have not danced" (verse 17).
The Lord Jesus came with His ministry of grace and heavenly strains of music. To speak reverently, like David He was the sweet Psalmist of Israel as regards God. He was skilled in heavenly music. I do not know of anything that would bring out the grace of ministry as that does. He says, "We have piped to you". Think of the music in the ministry of Christ! It generally drew forth from the people rebuff, suspicion, resentment and reproach. Village after village, town after town, city after city, was visited, with the wonderful music of the ministry of Christ, but there was no response from Israel.
John sums it up in saying, "He came to his own, and his own received him not" (@John 1: 11). The
{268}
Lord had to face the definite refusal of His ministry. They had rejoiced in John's the Baptist's light for a season, but not in Christ's. Sent from the Father with such music and such good works, He nevertheless had to face their refusal. We but little enter into what His feelings were. In the presence of this refusal, John the Baptist's faith fails, and he sends this question to the Lord, "Art *thou* the coming one?" (@Matthew 11: 3) adding to the Lord's pain. But in the presence of all *that*, the Lord lifted up His eyes to the Father. I want each to come to a definite knowledge of the Father. Jesus says here, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" (verse 25). We want to see to it that our spirits never succumb. At *that* time, He rejoiced in spirit. His spirit was right!
Now think of our circumstances. There is always pressure, sometimes more, sometimes less, always something. When it is felt, what do you do at *that* time, when the pressure is heaviest? There are seasons of rejoicing, and we may rejoice, thank God! We may rejoice with them that rejoice. But there are times of weeping. Solomon speaks of a time for everything. A time had arrived of outward defeat in the history of the Lord. At that time! What a moment for Christ and the Father, to see the supreme victory at this moment of outward defeat, in the rejoicing of His spirit and the outgoing of His heart in thanksgiving! I mention that as a model for
{269}
us in a scene of adversity, either as Levites or as ordinary men and women under God's government here on earth. Hence the Lord proceeds to say, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me" (@Matthew 11: 29). What a blessed yoke! He was here for the Father's will, and He rejoiced in spirit, and in that rejoicing received all that was to follow. To a father a babe must be an object of care. There are the babes, they are objects of the Father's care. The Father's things were revealed to babes. "Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight" (verse 26). It seemed good in His sight. How blessedly that works out! It is a question of what is good in *His* sight.
In @Luke 12: 32 the Lord looks upon His own as a "little flock". Look at that word *little*. Christianity began with outward littleness, as a mustard seed.
"Paul" means 'little' and he was a little man in his own estimation. Paul was a man like ourselves. It is well to have a model, a man of like passions with ourselves, so it is brought nearer to us. Paul was a model Christian. The word *little is* a characteristic word in Christianity. The saints were outwardly very small, there were not many titled people amongst them. Later, Paul says, "not many high-born" are called (@1 Corinthians 1: 26). He does not say 'not any'; a man is not disqualified by having a title, but there are "not many" such. God is greater than all titles, and a man gets blessing on the ground of being a man, in spite of a title. "Not many high-born" are called, says Paul, but the "ignoble things of the
{270}
world, and the despised, has God chosen, and things that are not" (verse 28).
*Little flock*! How happy to be content with that! The Lord never intended to gather huge congregations here. They gender worldly principles. The Lord's thought is littleness as to this world, and fewness; not indeed that there are not to be many, there are, for who can count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel (@Numbers 23: 10)? Things are to be very great in God's world, huge, wonderful! The great things of God, the wonderful works of God, but they are small in this world. "Fear not, little flock". How happy to return to a sense of littleness! "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes".
So the little flock were to come into the kingdom. Fear not! The Father's good pleasure is connected with them. We have the light of the kingdom; we are to have it, though kingdoms are in other hands now outwardly, and Romans tells us that we are to respect these in whose hands the government is, for it is of God. We are to submit ourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake. It is a free man that has grace enough to restrict himself for the Lord's sake. He is worthy of such sacrifice. It is unto the Lord, not unto the nations. In Romans, it is for God's sake.
The epistles of Peter treat of the government of God from the angels that fell to the end, and so of good and evil. The second epistle speaks of Lot in
{271}
Sodom. He was a righteous man, but he was not right in his spirit. The government of God takes account of the vexations of our souls. Our tears occasioned by the wickedness around us are put in His bottle, but Romans takes account of a recovered man who is exercised in the conquest of good over evil; he is in victory, instead of being pressed down by evil. Lot was not a recovered man. David recovered all, but it was in *victory*; he had something to give in the conflict of good over evil. There are many *Lots* today, hence the need of Romans. Romans contemplates an overcomer every day, and how he overcomes the evil with the good, the good that is of God, not in ourselves. It is by His spirit.
It is very exhilarating to contemplate @Romans 8. Victory overcomes adverse circumstances. It ends in a conquering, not a vexed spirit. It is not a vexed spirit, but a rejoicing spirit. I commend Romans earnestly to you. Lot's vexations are noted down, but how much happier for *rejoicings* to be noted! "Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice" (@Philippians 4: 4). "In everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 4: 6, 7).
It is important to understand military terms when we have to do with evil. Satan attacks our hearts, but they are garrisoned by peace. Peace cannot be defined, but it can be realised. David put garrisons in
{272}
the towns he took, to maintain them for him. On these lines our spirits are kept right. Romans teaches us to observe man's requirements. I never look upon the authorities as my enemies, I regard them as in my favour. James brings in the law under which we are. In Galatians, we have a nine-branches tree, *one* tree bearing the nine fruits of the Spirit, "against such things there is no law" (chapter 5: 22, 23). As a Christian, that is what I want. The laws of the nations are not against that. I am in possession of that against which there is no law. Thank God for that! How happy to be in relation to that against which there is no law! You can let it be seen before your superior officer. He is not against that, nor is the king, nor magistrates. The law is for lawbreakers, but the Christian is outside all that. He has that against which no law is: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, meek-ness, self-control. I want you to get hold of this, that there is no limitation to that fruit.
As respecting the laws of the land, I am in outward bondage, but I retain the fruits of the Spirit against which there is no law nor limitation, though outwardly limited as to my body. In @Deuteronomy 19 the feast of weeks (Pentecost) was unrestricted and unlimited, what indeed belongs to the eternal state of things, belonging to the Father and the Son and our place eternally; no law is against that.
In James we have the law referred to, "*he* that fixes his view on the perfect law, *that of liberty*". *My* desire is that our souls may remain in liberty. One
{273}
wonders what the outcome of the present circumstances will be. The spirit of militarism is insidious, like other spirits. Is that spirit to give character to the people of God? It must be faced and fought against. The exercise is, that my spirit is to be right, and then I shall walk in liberty. Hence "*he* that fixes his view on the perfect law, that of liberty" (@James 1: 25), (and mark) "abides in it, being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, *he* shall be blessed in his doing". Aside from that, liberty will depart, and there will be a shrinking and a narrowing up, and God and the saints will be deprived of the outflow of the affections of the heart. A soldier is foreign to the idea of a brother, and while I say a brother may make a good soldier, a soldier does not make a good brother; hence the spirit must be fought against, so that we may be preserved for God.
I love to think of Onesimus: he ran away, and was sent back to be a slave, but also a brother. How are we going to come out of these circumstances? Paul would send you back as a brother beloved not a soldier. See that you return as a brother beloved, not a soldier! Onesimus was once unprofitable as a slave, but now profitable to me and to you, says Paul to Philemon. We must be profitable. Do your work willingly as a servant, not grudgingly. We want to maintain the balance, in our behaviour, to those over us, and to the Lord. Do not deprive the saints of the profit. You can be a brother beloved in spite of the uniform. Profitable to *me*, says Paul; profitable to your brethren, but all this hinges on maintaining a
{274}
right spirit under all circumstances.
May the Lord grant this to speaker and hearers alike!

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 9. -- CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP
M. W. Biggs
In @1 Corinthians 10 we have three classes, or companies, of people brought before us, which are distinguished the one from the other religiously. They are Jews, Gentiles, and the church of God.
(1) The *Jews*, as we well know, were God's earthly people. At the beginning of their history as a nation Israel was delivered from Egyptian slavery, and at length they were established as a kingdom under the reign of David in the land of Canaan. For their wickedness and idolatry when in that land Israel was taken captive into Assyria, and Judah to Babylon; but in His mercy God brought back a remnant of Judah from Babylon in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. The fervour which at first marked this Jewish remnant soon abated, however, and a cold, lifeless, though fanatic religiousness settled upon the once favoured people.
But all through their history they had had the great distinction of having the oracles of God: they were the custodians of the written word. Commands had been given by God through Moses as to sacrifice as well as to moral law, and a system of earthly
{275}
religion existed, however much it became neglected and perverted in practice.
(2) The *Gentiles* were nations other than Israel. They were characteristically idolatrous. They, too, had a system of religion, differing according to their national god. But the systems were idolatrous, and we are shown the secret of the power of idolatry in this chapter which tells us that the Gentiles sacrificed to "demons, and not to God" (verse 20). Behind the idol, influencing men's minds by dark and debased superstition, was a demon. Satan used idolatry to satisfy man's religious cravings and keep him away from God. Gentile sacrifices were idolatrous.
(3) We have seen, in a previous paper, that after the birth, the death and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus -- indeed, after Jesus had been glorified -- another class of persons existed. The *church of God* was formed by the coming of the Holy Spirit. The church was not a nation, but was a company "called out", as the word "church" implies -- called out from all nations, called into "one body". This company, or class of people, was also distinguished religiously and by their sacrifice. Not an oft repeated one, as Jewish sacrifices had been, but a sacrifice *once* offered -- Christ's sacrifice of Himself upon the cross.
We have gone into these distinctions in some detail in order to make clear the idea of fellowship. The Jewish system had its sacrifice and its altar. And a person who partook of the sacrifices was identified
{276}
with the altar on which it was offered. It suggested a Jewish bond of a religious kind -- the commonwealth of Israel.
A Gentile, who ate of meat which had been offered in sacrifice to an idol, was associated thus with idolatry. It was an idolatrous bond and the idolater was identified with his idol sacrifice.
In @1 Corinthians 10 the apostle applies this principle to Christianity, and shows that it equally existed there and in a more emphatic way.
The sacrifice of Christ was once offered and would never be repeated. It stood alone as a complete remedy for man's ruin, an abundant answer to the question of sin.
But while there was not, and could not be, a repetition of this sacrifice, the Lord Jesus had instituted a supper on the night of His betrayal for a remembrance of Himself. And the bread and the cup of this supper symbolised His body given and His blood shed and were, indeed, a memorial of Himself in death.
The bread was only bread and remained such, and the cup of wine remained what it actually was; but they were the communion of His death.
The Lord had requested His own to remember Him by partaking of this supper. But in so doing believers necessarily identified themselves with His death, of which the supper was the repeated memorial.
If we read the chapter we shall see that the apostle insists most strongly on this fact of
{277}
identification and association.
An Israelite by his altar and sacrifice professed the true worship of Jehovah, and hence, also, the denial of all idolatrous worship. Idolatry and the worship of the one God, Jehovah, were mutually destructive of each other. And the offerer was identified with his altar.
The sacrifice of Christ had abolished the need of the repeated sacrifices of the Mosaic law. They were but types to the Christian, for whom Christ was the great Antitype.
The Christian had no altar of a material kind. But he had a fellowship and was a participator, in common with every other Christian, in christian privileges, of which the death of Christ was the foundation. And in partaking of the memorials of Christ's death he avowedly identified himself with this fellowship. It was Christian fellowship, in contrast to what was associated with the Jewish altar or idol temples.
The Corinthians were in the midst of idolatry, and therefore we have details in chapter 10 which are too plain to need remark. "The earth is the Lord's" (verse 26). Nothing that denied that could be allowed.
But this is not all. The question of fellowship does not only apply to eating in an idol temple, or to the outward forms of idolatry. It touches everything.
It is very evident that the person, whether Jew, Gentile or Christian, was always, professedly, in communion with that with which he was identified.
{278}
He was not only so while offering or eating his sacrifice, but always so. A few hours or days is of no account in a matter of this kind. The Jew was always to be true to the one God. A Gentile's idol abidingly marked the idolater. A Christian, too, was always professedly in christian fellowship and was always to be true to it.
Let us be perfectly clear on this. The very thought of communion or fellowship is contrary to any limitation. If we *are Christians we are professedly in christian fellowship and we are at all times to be true to this fact*.
It will be noticed that the bread and the cup are both used to teach us the bearing of this communion. The Lord's Supper is evidently supposed to have been taken, and the participators are called to recognise that to which they have committed themselves.
The bread is not referred to first as in the Supper, but the cup, as it symbolises that which is the basis of all communion¦. The cup is the communion of the blood of Christ.
The believer, in partaking of this cup, avowed his interest in the death of Christ and identified himself with it. The death of Jesus became his altar, his place of communion. It had procured for him every
¦This is not stated as being the only reason why this order is adopted in @1 Corinthians 10. Many other reasons might be added.
{279}
blessing. It was the ground of his being in the light as God is (@1 John 1). It gave him liberty of access into the holiest of all -- the immediate presence of God.
But the death of Christ also bore witness to the fact of His rejection here, that His life had been taken from the earth. It was a Saviour who had been crucified who was brought before the soul in the Supper. Moreover, it spoke also of God's judgment of sin, and told how not only offences were put away, but the offender -- man in his fallen, sinful state -- judicially removed before God's eye¦.
What lessons -- indeed, deep, spiritual lessons -- come before our souls as we meditate upon the meaning of the communion of the blood of Christ. We fear to limit it by what we might suggest. To drink the cup is the avowal of common participation in all that the death of Jesus means -- the sharing in the blessed results, the identification with the place of reproach, and the recognition of the total removal of all that we are as of Adam's race.
Such a communion must surely have a very far-reaching bearing. It must apply to everything; it must be a touchstone for our souls at all times.

{280}
OUR OUTLOOK
A. J. Gardiner
@2 Timothy 2: 7 - 9; @Jeremiah 45: 1 - 5; @Jeremiah 39: 15 - 18
I wish to say a word as to the importance of having the same outlook as the Lord. There is nothing so calculated to make us content, and to enable us to go through in steadiness and quietness till the Lord comes, as having the same outlook as the Lord. Paul says to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things". And then he says, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead"; that is, victory is seen already in Christ and the position is assured. He is "of the seed of David"; the coming kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ is near. We are to have the sense of that in our souls. He is of the seed of David, the One as to whom the angel said to Mary when he came to announce the impending birth of Christ, "of his kingdom there shall not be an end" (@Luke 1: 33).
It is not now a question of the approach of the time of His birth, but it is a question of the time being near for the establishment of the kingdom, and we are to remember Him raised from among the dead. Though the worst opposition has been exercised against Him, the Lord is apprehended by faith as completely victorious over it, so that there is nothing now to hinder the establishment of the kingdom, and the moment for it is near. He says, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings, in which I suffer even unto bonds as an
{281}
evil-doer". The present moment is a time of suffering. Suffering has characterised the testimony of God all down the ages. It commenced in Abel, who suffered for the truth's sake, and it has marked the testimony of God in greater or less degree all along and will continue to do so until the Lord comes. And Paul was suffering, "even unto bonds as an evil-doer"; "but", he says, "the word of God is not bound". The Lord is on high in the place of supreme power and authority and, the Spirit of God being here, the word of God is not bound. The word of God will go on and will accomplish whatever God has in mind to be accomplished through it. So in @Acts 12 after it speaks of the death of Herod who had put James, the brother of John, to death, we read, "But the word of God grew and spread itself" (verse 24), as though there is a certain power connected with the word itself, apart from the activities of man, that causes it to spread itself.
Now I turn to the two scriptures in Jeremiah because I believe that they have peculiar application to the present time. The first one, this special word to Baruch (who, I think we may gather, was probably a young man), was given him in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah. That is to say, it was about eighteen years before the final overthrow of Jerusalem and the final captivity of those who were left in it, after eighteen months of famine with all the horrors of a famine in a besieged city. What a time it was, that final overthrow of Jerusalem! It was the final pouring out
{282}
of God's wrath upon that with which He had connected His name, which had proved utterly unfaithful, and that has a strong analogy with the present moment, for Christendom is about to come under the most terrible judgment from God. It has professed the name of Christ and has proved worldly, and worse than worldly; it is characterised by every form of evil. It is well that we should have this in mind, because God is not likely to prosper things in the world. Just as He took off the chariot wheels of the Egyptians (@Exodus 14: 25), so I believe He will more and more weaken this world in the efforts it makes to hold His people captive, and its judgment in an intense form is absolutely inevitable.
And hence the word to Baruch is, "Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, what I have built do I overthrow, and what I have planted I pluck up, even this whole land. And seekest thou great things for thyself?" God knew what was in that young man's heart. He says, "seekest thou great things for thyself? seek *them not*; for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou shalt go". Baruch had identified himself with the testimony; he had committed himself to Jeremiah; he had served Jeremiah in writing his words for him, so that he was in everything committed to the testimony, and yet God saw in that man's heart that there was just a tendency to seek great things for himself, and He says, "seek them not". He will get through as he commits himself to the testimony and goes on
{283}
identified with the testimony for the moment. He guarantees that he will go through; his life shall be given him for a prey.
Then in the other case (@Jeremiah 39) this word to Jeremiah came even later than the word to Baruch, as far as we can gather. It came apparently when the final judgment upon the city was immediately impending and the word is, "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good, and they shall come to pass before thy face in that day". But then there is the word to Ebed-melech: "I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid; for I will certainly save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thou shalt have thy life for a prey" -- exactly the same expression as was used to Baruch. "Thou shalt have thy life for a prey; for thou hast put thy confidence in me".
Ebed-melech had also identified himself with the testimony for the moment; he was known as a sympathiser with Jeremiah, one who had spoken for him before the king and had been used to draw him up from the dungeon, and God speaks to him in a very similar way, not to look for any improvement in conditions in the city, but he should "have thy life for a prey; for thou hast put thy confidence in me". And so I believe that at the present time, till the Lord comes, it is for us to see, old and young alike, that we thoroughly commit ourselves to the word of God and the testimony, whatever it involves, and go
{284}
through with it. We can rest assured that the Lord will see us through and, as regards making a living, He will see that what is necessary is provided. For the testimony's sake the Lord will see to it that the saints have what they need, but it is a good thing for us to have our outlook governed by His.
As we go on on these lines we shall be increasingly free to support the testimony of God in all its features, and we shall have the great encouragement that God has pledged Himself to see us through, and we shall be seen through until the Lord comes. May we be helped in this matter! The more we have the Lord's outlook on things and are affected by it, the more we shall be in full unity. One great element of unity is that we have all the same thing before us and all think the same thing. If we do that there will be unity.

THE ISLES OF THE SEA
C. M. Menzies
The prophet Isaiah calls upon the islands of the sea to glorify the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel (@Isaiah 24: 15). Later in his book the Spirit of Christ says, "Listen, O isles, unto me" (@Isaiah 49: 1). This would suggest that the island is the object of divine teaching, as indeed, we know that in the day to come Jewish preachers will reach the isles that are afar off which have not heard of Jehovah's fame, to declare to them His glory (@Isaiah 66: 19). Applying this in a
{285}
simple way, let us consider briefly the lessons God has for us in the islands mentioned in the New Testament. God has a thought for us in each -- Cyprus, Malta, Crete and Patmos.
In Cyprus we learn that the natural must not dominate the spiritual, but the spiritual the natural. Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city ..." (@Acts 15: 36). It was a brotherly proposal, but Barnabas wished to take Mark with them, whereas Paul thought this not good, seeing he had abandoned them on their previous journey. Now Mark was the nephew of Barnabas, and the latter evidently allowed his natural affection and relationship to govern him. Warm feeling arose between Barnabas and Paul, and Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus, the place of his birth. Paul, choosing Silas, departed in another direction, but they went forth committed by the brethren to the grace of God. Thus two believers, Barnabas and Mark, an uncle and a nephew, move in independence. Thank God they were recovered later! Paul later spoke of Mark as being profitable (@2 Timothy 4: 11), but for a time these erring ones were in some measure lost to the testimony of our Lord.
Cyprus, thus, would teach us not to allow what is natural to govern us in our service to God. A John Mark might be seriously damaged in his spiritual career through being put into a position for which he is not spiritually qualified, and a Barnabas, though a son of consolation, might be crippled in his christian service by allowing natural relationships to dominate
{286}
his movements.
We are taught the solemn lesson in Malta of the complete break up of the church as set up in responsibility on the earth. The great ship on which Paul sailed was broken into fragments (see @Acts 27). The prow may stick fast on the strand and give a semblance of stability, as Rome claims, but it is all outward show, for the stern was broken by the force of the waves. We do well to have a look at that shipwreck. The church is in pieces publicly, and shall never be recovered to what it was as set up at the beginning. We have humbly to own our part in that wreck and not to attempt to regain unity by inter-denominationalism but by separation from evil.
As we accept the truth of this, and own the complete wreck, we move into a circle of warmth. There on that island certain barbarians showed the shipwrecked company no small kindness. A fire was kindled and Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire. Assuming no title but saved from the shipwreck, we are permitted to enjoy the privileges of the church, where the influences of the Reformation were felt, and where an open door exists for the testimony of the Christ. The enemy will attack that circle of warmth and love, and attack Paul, but he will be thwarted. The teachings of the apostle are constantly being belittled, and viper-like attacks are made upon him. It is often forgotten that in seeking to set aside the teachings of the apostle to the Gentiles, men are really ignoring the commandments of the Lord and the inspired Scriptures
{287}
(See @1 Corinthians 14: 37 and @2 Peter 3: 15, 16).
In Crete, we learn the importance of order in the church. Titus had been left on that island to set things right and to establish elders in every city (@Titus 1: 5). The national characteristics of the Cretans -- lying, gluttony, indolence, and so forth -- would have hindered the operations of God in these young assemblies on that island, and this was to be met by right church order and eldership. There were to be those in each city qualified to rule. There is no thought in Scripture of a bishop of a city, but bishops in a city; that is, there should be more than one in each city. Living as we do in a day when outward church order has broken down, we cannot appoint elders or assume eldership in title (for elders were appointed by an apostle or by his messenger) but we can cultivate features of eldership and support those who have such features. An elder must be blameless in his business, in his home, and among his brethren. The well-ordered home with believing children in subjection, commends the head of the house and is among the features which equip a man for rule in the assembly.
Patmos is a rugged island, barren as men would speak, where, according to tradition, John was exiled by the Romans and, indeed, the Scriptures tell us he was there for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus (@Revelation 1: 9). Although cut off from his fellow Christians, so far as we know, and confined to an island but twenty-five miles in circumference, he was in full fellowship with all walking in the truth,
{288}
calling himself their brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus. We too, may be in isolation or limited circumstances, but great spiritual possibilities are opened to us, if like John, we become in the Spirit on the Lord's day. The Lord Himself speaks to John in those island conditions, and the voice was behind him. We need to be alert and ready to turn around as John did in Patmos (@Revelation 1: 12), and as Mary did at the tomb (@John 20: 14). By doing so, John was given an impression of Christ Himself in the midst of the seven assemblies. Thus Patmos would teach us what possibilities there are, for even the isolated, separate ones who accept the reproach of the present limited conditions. The Lord would give us a touch and an experience of His presence on the Lord's day, and we would know Him in the midst of His own, where His love and interests are concentrated.
God might put us morally, so to speak, upon an island, to shut us in to Himself with nothing but the waters of death around, that we might learn some fresh lesson in our spiritual careers. In these four islands of the New Testament we are thus instructed, among other things, in Cyprus, to disallow the natural; in Malta, as to the complete wreck of the professing church; in Crete, as to the need of care and order in the church; and in Patmos the sweetness of the Lord's presence on the Lord's day.

LOVERS OF THE LORD JESUS, AND THOSE WHOM HE LOVED
F. B. Frost
@1 Kings 5: 1, 10, 11; @Luke 7: 44 - 50; @John 11: 1 - 5, 35, 36; @John 14: 15 - 26
I seek help to speak of lovers of the Lord Jesus, and those whom He loved. I believe one of the most powerful testimonies in these closing days of the dispensation is to have love amongst ourselves. And not only love for one another, but also the love of the truth (@2 Thessalonians 2: 10), and, above all, a deepening love for Christ. It is a wonderful privilege to be a lover of Christ in a world which still has no place for Him. What a triumph of divine grace it is that we can sit together here at this time as lovers of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Now I have read of Hiram king of Tyre, an interesting man who, it says, "always loved David". This man was a Gentile, not an Israelite, yet he loved David -- in type, he was a lover of the Lord Jesus. Now how do we show today that we are lovers of Christ? What evidence is there that you love Christ? That you have come here today, happy to be in the company of lovers of Jesus, is one evidence; and we should be obviously increasing in our love for our Lord Jesus Christ and for His assembly. It is overcomers that love Christ.
Now Hiram showed his love for David by what he was prepared to give to Solomon: "Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees according to all his desire". Hiram gets his reward for "Solomon
{290}
gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food for his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year". So it will be for every lover of Christ who is true to Him at the present time: there will be an answer also in the day of Christ's public glory. What wonderful recompense for faithfulness that will be!
Another evidence of love for the Lord is that you take up responsibility in regard to the local assembly. You care for the interests of Christ in the place where you live; you do not leave things to others to attend to, you take on the responsibility yourself. If there are but a few available in my locality, the Lord would have me to realise that I have a responsibility to fill out my part, according to my measure, in the local assembly.
The assembly is made up of responsible persons -- they care for Christ's interests because they love Him. The quota that you can contribute is exceedingly valuable. You say, 'It is very small', but it is very valuable, and God has ordered it: He has set you as a member in the body "as it has pleased him", and we are "members in particular" (@1 Corinthians 12: 18, 27). I should like you to think about that; you are a member "in particular". Of course that brings up the question as to your personal links with the Lord Jesus Himself, acknowledging Him as Lord and Head and keeping near to Him in the enjoyment of His love, and delighting to respond to it.
So when we come to @Luke 7, the woman we read of is unnamed. Luke writes his gospel with a view to
{291}
what is morally pleasing to God. Everything that was seen in Christ in the perfection of His manhood shone out in wondrous grace in all that He did. He manifested His love to His God and Father by all that He did. What a manifestation there was of the grace that was in the heart of God!
The Lord does not speak to the woman first, He speaks to Simon the Pharisee, who, no doubt, thought his conduct and his ways were all very suitable, but the Lord says to him, "Seest thou this woman?" Just take a look at her, she is a woman who loved Christ, and showed that she loved Him. Not a single detail of what she did in love for the Lord is missed by Him. The Lord recounts it Himself: "I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my feet" -- the Lord observed that, and tells Simon, You did not show any evidence of love for Me at all. "But *she* has washed my feet with tears" -- those feet were going to Calvary's cross of shame, to take up the whole question of her need, absolutely and perfectly, once and for ever. How she must have valued the feet of Jesus!
None less than God manifest in flesh, in the person of Christ, was here, not as a judge to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. God was in Christ reconciling people to Himself, removing all distance between Himself and man by that great work that Jesus was to accomplish, that men might enjoy nearness to God Himself.
The Lord values everything that we do out of
{292}
love for Him. He has done everything in love for us, and now He is looking for an answer to His love, evidence that we love Him. So He says to Simon, "*she* from the time I came in" -- the Lord noticed it -- "has not ceased kissing my feet". There was an excess of affection for Christ. The Lord knew where He was going, "he came out from God and was going to God" (@John 13: 3), and He knew all that lay ahead, every detail of it, but in devoted self-sacrificing love, He trod His pathway of sorrow, suffering and reproach. He did not turn aside, He went right through to the end. This woman may have been acting instinctively, without knowledge of what lay ahead, but the Spirit of God has had this recorded for us, to take account of the evidence that she loved Christ.
Well, love is very practical, and the local assembly is to be characterised by love: love for one another, visiting one another, consideration for one another in sorrow, sickness, trial and difficulty -- how wonderful the love of the dear brethren is, and it springs from knowing that the Lord loves each one of His own.
The four writers of the gospels each record that Jesus was anointed: two record that a woman anointed His head (@Matthew 26: 7; @Mark 14: 3), and two that a woman anointed His feet (@Luke 7: 38; @John 12: 3). The feet of Jesus were anointed in John, where John's point of view was that they were going to the Father. In Luke His feet were viewed as going to the cross. John had a wonderful outlook in regard
{293}
to the precious feet of Jesus, the glorious Son of God, who came out from God and was going to God. But in Luke, it is His feet moving here in sacrificial love to the cross to meet the need of mankind, to effect reconciliation in God's behalf. Reconciliation is 'being retained for the pleasure of God'.
I suppose that all of us would say that we love the Lord, but what about our actions, do we show it? The Lord said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (@John 14: 15), and, surely, one of these is to remember Him in the Lord's supper. That is something very precious to His own heart, for it is an evidence that I love Him, that I wish to remember *Him*. "This is my body, which is for you" (@1 Corinthians 11: 24). Paul does not say, "given for you" (see @Luke 22: 19) when introducing the truth of the Supper which he received from Christ in glory. Paul in saying, "This is my body, which is for you", makes it exceedingly personal, and I think that, as lovers of Christ, we would understand that personal touch every time we take up the privilege of the Supper.
Well, I read in @John 11, where Jesus comes to Bethany; what a circle of life and love there was for Him in Bethany! In Jerusalem there was the formal carrying on of religious customs, but in Bethany there was a home characterised by love for Christ. Death came in -- Lazarus had died -- but Jesus, in the glory and greatness of His Person, could meet the question of death, and He met it with the deepest feelings of affection. He loved this household in
{294}
Bethany; these are persons that Jesus loved. I have been speaking of our love for Christ, but this illustrates Christ's love for His own. This is "the village of Mary and Martha her sister", and John tells us who Mary was: "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair" (of which we read in @John 12: 3), whose brother Lazarus was sick. When Jesus hears of the sickness of Lazarus, He says, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus" -- three distinct persons.
The Lord knows those in our localities who love Him, and who are the objects of His love. I would like to be an object of the love of Christ, and I trust that every one here has a sense that they are loved by Christ -- *He* loves you! The simple thought that you are loved by Christ should bring about life and vitality in a locality, and deliver us from formality. It is a great thing to be in a company that is enjoying the love of Christ. A stranger coming in will notice it. It is not a great exposition of doctrine, no, but it is love that counts, for there is power in love. If there is not love in a locality, persons will exercise power and make themselves important. But where there is love, you can have what is of Christ. Paul could say, "yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence" (@1 Corinthians 12: 31), the way of love.
The Lord felt the pressure of death upon the human spirit (chapter 11: 33). It says, "Jesus wept"; how
{295}
real the Person of the Lord Jesus is, and then it says, "The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!" This is the Lord's love for His own.
In @John 14: 15 the Lord says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments"; now it is an evidence of His love, that He has given us commandments to keep. What are the Lord's commandments for us? Paul says of his ministry, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (@1 Corinthians 14: 37); not Paul's commandment, but the Lord's commandment. So the practical working out of Paul's ministry as it applies to local assemblies would be further evidence of love for Christ.
But then the Lord has great love for those who keep His commandments, and He says, "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever", so that His commandments can be maintained in the power of the blessed Spirit until the Lord comes to take us to be with Himself. There is power in the blessed Spirit to help us to maintain conditions and divine principles in our locality that will meet with the Lord's approval. You may find that there are not many who are prepared for it, but that does not mean that you alter the standard so as to keep up your numbers. Never alter divine standards. God's principles are eternal, they never change.
The Lord has given us the Spirit, "another Comforter" -- a wonderful title of the Holy Spirit. Do
{296}
you ever get a sense of comfort from the Spirit? You may say, I get comfort from the Father. Yes, I can understand that, and comfort from the Lord also. But what about comfort from the Holy Spirit? I believe that, as we desire to give more place to the blessed Spirit, we shall experience His comfort. It is a great thing to have faith in the Person of the Holy Spirit and His service to us. He has taken a lowly place Himself in the Economy, and He is still serving, and will serve saints until that great moment when "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" (@Revelation 22: 17). What must bridal affection mean to the Lord Jesus!
"He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father". Think of this further reward of keeping the commandments of Christ: to be "loved by my Father, and I will love him"; the Father's love and Christ's love to those who keep the Lord's commandments. And further, "and I ... will manifest myself to him". We will come together, if the Lord tarry, to remember Him tomorrow morning. He has promised not to leave us orphans, but to come to us (verse 18). We should not come to the Supper in any formal way, but as having in mind that "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18: 20). I think we need to look for a real sense of the Lord's presence, so that the Person might be real to us when we are together. "I will manifest myself to him" is a very precious promise.
{297}
"Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me". Now that is a wonderful thing: the world did not see Jesus any more after He was crucified and buried, ascended and gone on high. He says, "but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live": He is beyond the reach of the power of death, and because He loves us and we know Him, we shall live too. I think, it is one thing to say that you love a person, but the evidence that you really mean it, is that you show it, and that is living. To live is to love and to love is to live, both are true.
So the Lord says, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". Amazing words from the lips of Christ in nearness to the Father. That little word 'in' that you get so often in John, I think it means the nearness of love. "Ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me" -- we are taken into favour in God's beloved Son! But then He adds, "and I in you", and that would be manifest in evidence of our love for the Lord in a practical way. It is a wonderful thing that Christ is in us by the Spirit. What a place He should have in our minds, in our affections and in our lives! There is to be a practical, living testimony that such a Person is a reality to us, because that is what is needed at the present time. I believe that these promises of Christ to come to us and manifest Himself to us, are to maintain and promote living conditions in our souls, and in our localities.
There is nothing more precious to our hearts when we are gathered together to remember Him,
{298}
than to have a sense of a manifestation of Himself by the Spirit. The Spirit makes that glorious Person a reality to us, and fresh rays of His glory shine into our hearts. I believe whenever we come together we need to be ready for the sense of the Lord's presence: "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" (@Matthew 18: 20). Do you really believe that verse? You say, Well, it is a very comforting verse. Yes, but as you come to the meeting, are you expecting the Lord to make His presence felt? The experience is very precious.
We know what these experiences are, but it is the very wonderful service of the blessed Spirit that preserves us in our affections, and keeps us ready for every manifestation of Christ. We are waiting for that moment when we shall all be caught up together, to meet the Lord in the air. He is not sending an angel to bring His own to Himself. No, He is coming Himself. What wonderful grace! He says, "I go to prepare you a place ... and ... I am coming again and shall receive you to myself" (chapter 14: 2, 3).
May our personal link with the Saviour be firmer with each one of us, for His Name's sake.

"LITTLE UPON THE EARTH"
J. H. Trevvett
@Proverbs 30: 24 - 29; @2 Kings 4: 13; @Matthew 26: 6 - 10
We might profitably consider the importance of being little upon the earth, for every believer would agree that it is a most commendable feature in such days as ours, and that we do well to be content with our portion. It is not a feature that is popular among many -- far from it, alas, for many have been deluded and ensnared by the great pretentious religious systems on the earth. We know in what they will culminate: the proud boasting of a system that has no room for Christ, which says, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow" (@Revelation 18: 7) -- content with her own greatness in the absence of Christ.
That is Babylon: but then there is also the Laodicean feature of the profession, and a most serious one it is, for Laodicea boasts, "I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing" (@Revelation 3: 17). But as that phase of the assembly comes under the scrutiny of the One whose eyes are as a flame of fire -- He says, "and knowest not that *thou* art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes that thou mayest see" (verses 17, 18).
The word of God reminds us thus of the serious day in which we live, a day of inflation on the part
{300}
of men and the profession; a day, indeed, which might well compare with the early chapters of Genesis, where we read, "In those days were the giants on the earth"; and again, that there were "heroes", "men of renown" (chapter 6: 4). God did not find one single commendatory feature about them. Yet I suppose then, as now, men would exhaust their vocabularies in superlative language about such, for they speak today about supermen, and vie with one another in seeking words to express their admiration of "men of renown".
But Scripture tells us of true greatness, and it lies in what is outwardly small and of little account in men's eyes. Noah was perhaps of little account with these mighty men, and yet he was the one who should bring in comfort. What could saints in those early days expect from the men of renown? What help would the giants give them? Persecution probably, and a measure of scorn and hatred. But Noah was a comforter -- faith could name him such; small in the eyes of men it might be, but possessing features which God could take account of, for "Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah", and "Noah walked with God" (@Genesis 6: 8, 9) -- the eye of heaven resting on him with interest and favour.
There are others in Scripture who began well: king Saul was one. Samuel says to him in @1 Samuel 15: 17, "when thou wast little in thine eyes". That was a delightful feature, referring to the time when Samuel spoke to him of being anointed king. He recalls the words of Saul, "Am not I a Benjaminite,
{301}
of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? and why dost thou speak such words to me?" (@1 Samuel 9: 21). That speech would be pleasing to God. He was little in his own eyes, and God took account of it. It was probably the brightest moment in Saul's history, as it is in our history, when we are not only little upon the earth, but little in our own eyes.
Then we are reminded of Solomon; he had the most remarkable advantages of parentage and of early training, and yet as Jehovah appears to him in a dream, Solomon says, "Give ... thy servant an understanding heart" -- or, 'a heart that hears' (@1 Kings 3: 9). That is a delightful kind of heart. Paul in writing to the Ephesians says, "being enlightened in the eyes of your heart" (chapter 1: 18). The mind has its own peculiar and proper place in relation to the reception of the truth, but it is the eyes of the heart that are to be enlightened. So Solomon asks for a heart that hears -- an understanding heart, for he says, "I am but a little child: I know not to go out and to come in ... Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people". And the scripture adds: "And the word pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing" (@1 Kings 3: 7, 9, 10).
Would you like to please the Lord? Solomon has set the example, and his speech pleased the Lord. As anointed over all Israel and as one of the greatest of kings, he turned to Jehovah and says, I am but a little child; give me a heart that hears. I think we may all
{302}
see from these scriptures what a commendable feature it is with God, that we should be little upon earth.
This wise man Agur, in @Proverbs 30, says, "There are four things little upon the earth, and they are exceeding wise". We cannot afford to take man's estimation according to the face value of things, or to be deluded by the valuation of the human heart or mind in regard to what we see on earth; for what is great according to men, is base in the sight of God; and that which is of small value in the eyes of men, despicable, mean, and weak, is in the sight of God of great price. I believe the Lord would promote in us all the spirit of lowliness, so that our speech and deportment should evidence the fact that we are content to be little upon earth, and not only so, but that we are little in our own eyes.
You remember what was said of John the Baptist before ever he was born -- "he shall be great before the Lord" (@Luke 1: 15) -- and he was great, for God saw to that. The Lord Jesus, speaking later as to him, said that, amongst those born of women, there was none greater than John the Baptist (@Matthew 11: 11). Standing between the two dispensations, as it were, a separate man, away in the deserts, feeding upon locusts and wild honey; clothed with a garment of camel's hair, and with a leathern girdle about his loins -- certainly John was not a popular man. The high priest and those with him would never think of taking John into their confidence -- and yet he was one who was "exceeding wise".
{303}
Look at the list of personages in the beginning of @Luke 3 that the Spirit of God gives us before He brings in John the Baptist. He speaks about Caesar, the great imperial head; then of Pilate the governor, and of Herod and Philip, the tetrarchs -- all suggesting the idea of royalty and greatness. Then He brings in the religious dignitaries, Annas and Caiaphas the high priests; and yet, of not one of them is it said that he had the word of God! The Spirit of God says in face of all man's greatness, "the word of God came upon John" (@Luke 3: 2). Think of these men in all their pomp and power and glory according to man -- imperial, royal, and religious dignitaries -- yet exposed as not having the word of God. And then see what the Spirit of God adds: "the word of God came upon John ... in the wilderness". He was "little upon the earth", it may be, but he was "exceeding wise" and "great before the Lord".
If one could have spoken to John, as they did in John's gospel (chapter 1: 19 - 28), to raise the question with him as to his authority, his answer would be simple and brief. What an opportunity John had of self-aggrandisement! How much he might have made of his position when the Jews sent out priests and Levites to ask him who he was! Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. They said therefore, Who art thou? that we may give an account to those who sent us? And he says, I am but a voice -- a voice directing to Another. Little indeed, upon the earth at that moment, but yet exceeding wise, and having the
{304}
most wonderful knowledge. Hear how he speaks of the day of Christ, when every valley shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low (@Luke 3: 5); when there shall be a day of universal merriment as all flesh sees the salvation of God: when the true Isaac -- the son of laughter -- shall appear, and the bond-slave shall be cast out! John sees all that, and he sees more, for he sees "Jesus as he walked" (@John 1: 36). He was satisfied with the conscious knowledge of who this blessed Person was who was coming to him. And again, as he looks upon Jesus walking, filled with spiritual emotion, he says, "Behold the Lamb of God". In chapter 3: 31 he stresses in the most definite way what comes out of heaven: he says, "He who comes out of heaven is above all".
Men take little account of what comes out of heaven; they take great account of what is upon earth -- all the boastings and pomp and inflation that make up man's world; but John takes account of what comes from heaven, and says, "he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" (@John 1: 33). The test was that it was One upon whom the Holy Spirit remained; it was not an olive leaf plucked off merely, but an abiding place for the Spirit. Is John content with being merely a messenger? No; he says, "I have seen" (verse 34). That is the great thing. Thousands of believers hear things, but they do not see them. John is marked by
{305}
seeing and hearing. How can I bear witness unless I have seen things? John says, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God" (verse 34). That is another thing: "I have ... borne witness". See how powerful he is! No one can withstand John's testimony, because it springs from the inward consciousness that though little upon earth personally, he has the secret of the Lord. He is great before the Lord. Scripture makes that essential provision -- it is "before the Lord". When it speaks of Jesus there is an absolute statement -- "*He* shall be great" (@Luke 1: 32). Oh! how one's soul revels in it. It is not merely greatness in relation to another, but He shall be great -- it is absolute -- this is the angel's statement to Mary. I ask you, beloved brethren, who else could be great in this absolute sense, save Jesus?
I turn now to the scriptures we read. The speaking of each of the three persons brought before us in these passages is dependent upon their having been hearers. I want to stress that. Their speaking is dependent upon their hearing, or, in Agur's case, on his reading, for he speaks in @Proverbs 30 as one who has read all the preceding twenty-nine chapters. The first nine chapters are the "Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel"; then from chapter 10 to 24, we have "The Proverbs of Solomon" -- not here the king, but the man. Then from 25 to 29, they are the "proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed". I would ask young believers, Have you ever thought of that? The men
{306}
of Hezekiah transcribed these proverbs of Solomon; see to it that you copy only what has been rightly presented to you, but do not fail in the copying of it, and the spreading of it, if it is of value. These men of Hezekiah recognised what was of value and they copied out these proverbs.
In chapter 30 you have a man, as I gather, who is in the good of the other twenty-nine chapters. What does he say in the light of them? There is only one thing which could be said in the light of what Solomon has presented, and that is what Agur says, "I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy" (verse 3). He says, "Truly *I* am more stupid than any one" (verse 2); he does not say *as* stupid, but I am *more* stupid. He is like John the Baptist; he says, as it were, I am but a voice. Saul of Tarsus says, "To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations, the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ" (@Ephesians 3: 8). Saul of Tarsus -- no mean city -- has become Paul the little. Well, that is the conclusion Agur comes to, he is less than the least.
The name Agur, as I understand, means an Assembler -- one who has feelings and instincts in regard to assembling. I wish every believer had those feelings! There are many believers who prefer to stay at home, and there are many who go on in circumstances where Christ is dishonoured, and where there is no true idea of assembling according to His mind. But Agur is an assembler, yet he begins by speaking first about himself: "Truly *I* am more
{307}
stupid than any one; and I have not a man's intelligence. I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy". Now what is a man like that to do? He says, "Every word of God is pure" (verse 5); he pays attention to the utterances of God. I beg you, dear young people, hold on to the word of God. You are living in a day of intense difficulty -- a day of public infidelity within the pale of professing Christianity. I want to assure you, as Scripture itself does, "Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him". Here is a man feeling his way: he knows there is something to be had, and privileges to enjoy; he is feeling his way towards them. I can tell you how to do that: you begin to have a sense of mercy. You need mercy. Agur began with that. Each of us has had a beginning, and we all began with this sense: "Truly *I* am more stupid than any one" -- less than the least! But then he can say, "Every word of God is pure" -- he has a deep appreciation of God's words. Let us hold on to that.
Then Agur began to ask questions, and that is a very fine method of making progress. It is said of the Lord Jesus when a Boy of twelve, He was in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, "hearing them and asking them questions" (@Luke 2: 46). So Agur begins to ask questions, and I believe he is conscious of getting an answer, and when he has his answer, he looks abroad and sees four generations upon the earth who have not one honourable feature among them (verses 11 - 14). They are men who are
{308}
filling the earth, whose teeth are swords and knives, and there are rebellious men, and unholy men -- you can see them for yourself. But Agur sees these things as a wise man sees them.
Then he goes on to look into the principles which govern the world, those dark unholy principles that govern nations, and powers, and men -- even religious men -- and he describes them under four figures: "The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid" (verse 19). These are not commendable things, though some have tried to make them so. But Scripture adds, "Such is the way of adulterous woman" (verse 20) -- *that* is not commendable! These figures all represent a lack of transparency. You do not know what an eagle is doing, nor when it will swoop on its prey. You never know what may overtake a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid is a hidden snare; and a way of a serpent on a rock is untraceable.
All these things speak of what lacks transparency; and Agur sees these things. He is little upon the earth, but be is becoming exceeding wise.

"MADE LIKE TO HIS BRETHREN"
C. A. Coates
@Hebrews 2: 16 - 18; @Hebrews 4: 14 - 16
Our hearts have often been comforted and elevated by the thought that we are going to be like the Son
{309}
of God in His glorified condition, but it is necessary also that we should consider that in becoming Man in the circumstances in which we are, sin apart, "it behoved him in all things to be made like to his brethren".
We are told that "he takes hold of the seed of Abraham". In becoming Man, He took up a special relationship with the faith family -- with what God owned as having a link with Himself. There were features about that family which were of God, though every member of it had been by nature a child of wrath, even as the rest. But faith having come in, there was that in them which was not of the fallen man, but which had its origin in God. Christ could take hold of that, for it was suitable to Him; we might say that it was kindred to Him.
It is as having this characteristic of faith that men are regarded as Christ's brethren, and it behoved Him in all things to be made like to them. This underlies the teaching of Hebrews: we hardly get the indwelling Spirit in this epistle, but all through, prominence is given to faith. Christ's brethren are in view, and "the people" are the elect nation -- those who have faith. They, and they only, get the good of the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. Those from among the Jews who received Christ were the true "seed of Abraham", and they became Christ's companions and His brethren. They were the seed of whom Christ took hold; He attached Himself to them and was made like to them -- not that He could have them apart from His death and from His soul
{310}
being made an offering for sin, for they all had sins for which propitiation was needed if they were to be with God in a righteous and holy way. The seed could not be sanctified -- they could not be "all of one" with the Sanctifier -- if He had not made propitiation for their sins. So we find later in the epistle (chapter 10) that by God's "will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (verse 10). We also read that "by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified" (verse 14). As purged worshippers they have no longer any conscience of sins. We need to shut out the flesh more completely from our thoughts of the holy brethren. They are to be regarded as the epistle to the Hebrews regards them. There are more than twenty designations of the saints in this epistle, but they all suggest suitability to God and to Christ, and not the contrary.
It is as having the exercises and trials and sorrows of faith that saints are Christ's *brethren*, and it is as having part in the testings and sorrows of faith that it has behoved Christ to be made in all things like His brethren. Christ's brethren are viewed here as in a position and condition in which they are sure to be tempted and tried, and they are also marked by infirmities. Faith is there as a ruling principle, but it is surrounded by almost universal unbelief, and is therefore continually exposed to temptation in the sense of trial. It has always been so, wherever there was faith. And along with faith there is always, in our present condition, the
{311}
consciousness of infirmity. These things mark Christ's brethren here. The temptations or trials here referred to do not arise from the activity of the flesh; they are the result of faith coming into conflict with the influences that operate in the present evil age. If faith and a good conscience are maintained, there is bound to be suffering, and when we have part, however small, in the sufferings of faith, there is always the consciousness of infirmity. Infirmity does not mean that we give way before the power of evil, but it means that we are conscious that if we did not get divine support we *would* give way.
Now it is this experience which prepares us to appreciate how near Christ has come to us in becoming Man. He entered into, and took part in, all suffering which had been the portion of faith in all ages. He was tempted, or tried, by every form of trial which has ever come upon faith. And having passed through this experience He is qualified to be "a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God". It is in these things that we need a merciful and faithful high priest. Faith governs all matters relating to God, and when faith brings us into trial here, we need One who is able to help us as having suffered and been tried in exactly the same way Himself. When we prove that He does help us, it makes Him a very blessed reality to us.
We cannot for a moment think of Jesus, the Son of God, as having infirmities, but He had the true feelings of a man in presence of trials and sufferings. He was "tempted in all things in like manner"
{312}
(@Hebrews 4: 15). Therefore He is able to sympathise with *our* infirmities. He knows perfectly how trial and suffering affect man -- how they ought to affect man. In His case the sensibilities and the sufferings were perfect, and were all infinitely acceptable to God. They were wholly apart from sin. They are real trials which cause suffering, but they are not the result of evil-doing, but of faith. Now the Lord, in the state of a blessed, perfect Man, has been subjected to every such trial, that He might be able to sympathise with His brethren who suffer the same trials, but who are also conscious of infirmities. He never had infirmities, and He certainly has none as the great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, but His experience of trial and suffering here has qualified Him to sympathise with our infirmities. If I feel so weak that I cannot possibly hold fast the confession unless I get His support, He is exceedingly sympathetic with that feeling. It is the very reason -- or, at any rate, one reason -- why we have Him as our High Priest.
We have infirmities connected with our bodies, such as Timothy's "frequent illnesses" (@1 Timothy 5: 23) and the sickness of Trophimus (@2 Timothy 4: 20). Christ has not been made like to us in these things, but He can enter perfectly into them because in the days of His flesh "Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases" (@Matthew 8: 17). It has been well said that He bore in His spirit what He removed by His power. He felt in His spirit all that pressed upon men, even physically. This is not exactly what He
{313}
became as Man, but what He took on Him¦. But it enables Him to enter fully and sympathetically into all that His saints suffer, even in their bodies, and He is able to help them in those sufferings, as an in-numerable multitude have proved.

DIVINE APPROVAL
F. S. Marsh
It is a wonderful thing that there is on the earth that which ministers to the pleasure of God, and concerning which He delights to express His approval. Our hearts bow with reverence and worship before Him in the acknowledgement that He is entitled to that which will afford Him pleasure. God alone is entitled to act for His own satisfaction; He could not find pleasure in fallen man, but He himself has wrought for His own glory, and the prerogative is His to have everything for His own pleasure. In view of this, our hearts are challenged by the question: How far, by the Holy Spirit's power, are we enabled to contribute to that pleasure?
We delight to recognise that the pleasure of God has been marvellously carried through by the Lord
¦Footnote b to @Hebrews 2: 17 in the Darby Translation: He speaks, I apprehend, historically; it was necessary for Him to do this by the alleged reason, not His present judgment of divine necessity or purpose. 'Has behoved' would speak more of continuance. It behoved Him when He became a man. It is what He became as man, not what He took on Him.
{314}
Jesus, as a lowly Man here. That blessed One ever filled the heart of God with delight, and was indeed worthy of the Father's expressed approbation. The voice from heaven was heard saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3: 17)! Let us contemplate the Lord Jesus in this wonderful character, as the One who lived entirely for the pleasure of God. There was never a moment in His pathway here when He was not yielding delight to His Father; there was not a step, not a word from His lips, not a thought in His heart, but was delightful to the blessed God Himself! Such was the Lord Jesus in perfect Manhood; and as we consider that pathway we can but be drawn out in adoration to Him, the One who ever moved as a dependent Man, saying, "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee" (@Psalm 16: 1), and who trod the path of the will of God in such perfection that it was the Father's pleasure to open the heavens upon Him and express His delight in Him.
Now it is the thought of God that we should each be characterised by following the Lord Jesus in yielding pleasure to God. There is no higher motive in life, no greater objective, than to be here for divine pleasure! It was said prophetically of Jesus that "the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand" (@Isaiah 53: 10); and since He is our Model, it is a matter of the greatest importance that we, too, should be set for giving pleasure to God, so that we may secure His expressed approval.
The Scriptures abound with examples for us of
{315}
those who were thus approved. Of *Enoch*, one of the earliest saints of God, it is recorded that "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he has the testimony that *he had pleased God*" (@Hebrews 11: 5). For three hundred years Enoch walked with God, and God was pleased to put upon record this testimony concerning him. Should we not each be desirous of securing such a testimony, before the time of *our* translation? At the judgment seat of Christ, He will approve all that has been for His pleasure in the lives of His people; but He is also pleased to give the sense of His approval even now.
We see the same feature coming out in *Abraham*; after he had gained a great victory and delivered his brother Lot, he was tempted by the patronage of the king of Sodom. How pleasing to God was his refusal of the overtures of the world! After these things the word came to him: "Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward" (@Genesis 15: 1).
When Miriam and Aaron spoke against *Moses*, God vindicated Moses publicly, saying that "he is faithful in all my house" (@Numbers 12: 7); showing God's delight in expressing His approval of Moses. Of *David*, too, God was able to bear testimony to the fact that He had found pleasure in him, in the words: "I have found David ... a man after my heart" (@Acts 13: 22). God had noted David's spirit and his secret history as a keeper of the sheep, so that the time came when He could say to Samuel: "Arise,
{316}
anoint him; for this is he" (@1 Samuel 16: 12, 13)! Again, when Solomon asked for "an understanding heart" to judge the people of Israel, we are told that "the word pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing" (@1 Kings 3: 9, 10).
When we come to the New Testament, we find the apostle Paul writing to Timothy, his child in the faith, and exhorting him to "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God" (@2 Timothy 2: 15). This is a word of great moment to us, and to which we do well to pay heed. If it were not in the Holy Scriptures we might well hesitate to use such an expression; for it is the same as that which Peter used concerning the Lord Jesus Himself, when, in @Acts 2, he described Him as "a man approved of God" (verse 22, Authorised Version). Timothy might well have enquired if such a thing were possible: is it practicable or workable; is it within the range of a young man to show himself approved unto God? We may be sure that there is not one exhortation in Scripture which is not practicable! God has never set before us an unattainable ideal, or an exhortation which is not capable of being worked out; for with the word He gives the power in which to carry it out, so that we need to make full use of the presence here of the Holy Spirit of God.
We are in the last days, when we have to face many tests. Difficulties and perplexities abound, but in such conditions we have the exhortation to "strive diligently" to present ourselves approved to God. How great the joy of having from the Lord Himself
{317}
the one word: 'Approved'! Sometimes in our anxiety for approval, we may attempt to justify ourselves by enlarging on our motives in the ears of others; but we need to remember the word of the apostle to the Corinthians, that "not *he* that commends himself is approved, but *whom the Lord commends*" (@2 Corinthians 10: 18). It will surely be a joy to the Lord to be able to say of such: "Well, good and faithful bondman; thou wast faithful ..." (@Matthew 25: 23).
In @Revelation 3: 8 the Lord was able to express His approval of the church at Philadelphia. Not only did He give promises to the overcomer which are most profitable to consider, but He was able to say of Philadelphia, "thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". The Lord had observed it, and He found His pleasure in expressing His approval. It is a triumph that the Lord has set together in localities those bearing features of which He can approve. We may be thankful to observe these delightful features which are to be found in measure among the people of God. The spirit of worship, prayer and praise; the appreciation of the teaching; fidelity to the word of God and a recognition of its authority; subjection to the Holy Spirit and to each other -- all these are characteristics of which the Lord delights to express His approval.
May we each be marked by fervent desire to be contributors to what is for the pleasure of God, so that the Lord may be pleased with us and be able to express His approval.

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 9 -- CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP
M. W. Biggs
But the bread, or loaf, is likewise full of teaching. While the broken bread refers to Christ's body given for us on the cross, the *one* loaf unbroken has a striking allusion to the church itself -- the body of Christ. We read: "we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" (@1 Corinthians 10: 17). It was after the Lord had broken the loaf that He gave it to His disciples and said, "This is my body which is given for you" (@Luke 22: 19). But the "one loaf" unbroken refers to the church -- the one body. It is this fellowship, this common participation of all Christians as one body, which is referred to.
This being so, it must be evident that the act of taking the Supper is neither individual nor isolated, but can only be carried out in the recognition of the communion of the body of Christ. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body", says the apostle. Though there may be many persons, or more correctly members of the body, our act of partaking of that one loaf confesses a unity which abidingly exists. A person cannot partake otherwise, for the bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ.
We fear this has been very much overlooked.
The thought of fellowship and the partaking of the Supper are indissolubly linked together, and we can only regard as unintelligent many ideas which are about today which refer to the Lord's supper as a purely isolated and individual act. It is just the
{319}
reverse. It is not isolated, for it avows that the person is abidingly in the communion of the death of Christ; nor is it individual, for we, being many, are "one body".
We may have occasion to refer to this point again when considering the subject of the Lord's supper itself. It must suffice here to remark that the act of taking the Supper commits the participator to christian fellowship. He is to be true to this always. He is false if he denies in his practice at any time what he professes in his communion. If he avers a unity to exist in partaking of the "one loaf", he cannot honestly deny this unity at other times. It is abidingly true.
How solemn and searching this is. But how lightly taken up, alas! I fear that in many circles of professed Christians the idea of christian fellowship is wholly unknown. What losers they are! We must all feel, I am sure, how poorly we answer to our privileges and responsibilities in this respect. But it is a great thing to have our faces turned in this direction, and, if failure exists, let us own it. There is all the difference possible between stumbling while endeavouring to walk up a hill, and quietly and contentedly walking down it.
The violation and practical denial of christian fellowship is held up today as becoming. We state it with a deep sense of shame. The world, which the apostle Paul could speak of as having been crucified to him and he to it, is indulged in, and the indulgence upheld. Human sects are supported, and hence the practical denial of the unity of the body of
{320}
Christ.
Reader, do you seek to be true to Christian fellowship? It is very holy: it is very real.
May the Lord graciously help us to be so for His Name's sake.

THE SPIRIT'S LEADING
J. B. Stoney
... The Spirit has come down to the church, not to the world; He has no link with the world. The world seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him. The great work of the Spirit in each of us is to carry us up to the sphere of Christ's life -- to where He is in His own sphere; and where the "things above" are. We should all know much more, and have a higher range of heavenly things, if we more truly answered to the leading of the Spirit. There we could drink of the fountain which never fails. The tendency in us is to decline ...
I think many get a taste of being across the water with the Lord in the assembly who are not over Jordan. This taste increases, for the more we know it the more we like to renew it -- and it increases. There are many devoted who are not over Jordan. The Spirit is not free to conduct us to the things of God until we are clear of the world.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LOVING CHRIST
J. Taylor
@John 13: 18 - 30; @Colossians 1: 12 - 19
The exercise I have is to call attention to the great importance of loving Christ. I want to connect it with the advantages that accrue from it, especially that it leads us into the benefit of His headship.
One feels a peculiar exercise as to the headship of Christ, and what I would remark is that, aside from loving Christ, souls get no direct advantage from it. I use the word direct, for you may get indirect advantage from it although your love for Christ may be very little. You may get indirect advantage by observing others who profit by it, who are in the good of it, but it is quite obvious that each believer should know the headship of Christ.
Each believer who has the Spirit is in the body, and we read in regard of Christ as Head, "from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God" (@Colossians 2: 19). Therefore, every believer ought to be in direct relation with Christ in his own soul, in order that he should get the benefit of the headship, and correspondingly contribute to the whole. Our contribution may be little or it may be much.
The two disciples who had left Jerusalem for Emmaus (@Luke 24), when they returned to the company made a contribution to the company. In the house at Emmaus their souls had been touched by Christ's headship. They returned to Jerusalem and
{322}
found the eleven and those that were with them, who were speaking about Christ as risen, and immediately they add their quota, telling the company how the Lord had spoken to them on the way and especially that He was made known unto them in the breaking of bread. Now that was a contribution by those who had come into the light of Christ as Head.
The same may be said of Mary Magdalene. Look at the contribution she made to the disciples as re-corded in @John 20. For the moment, she eclipsed even the eleven; she contributed to such an extent as to give them light as to their new relationship and position. I call attention to these two instances so that you may see the great gain of headship. Whether you have a meagre apprehension of it or a very full apprehension of it, there is gain for you and there is gain for the company, for you become a contributor. One would feel extremely poor and ashamed not to be a contributor in some sense. Indeed, we know that to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ, and it is that we should be contributors.
Well now, my point is for the moment to show you that it depends on love for Christ, and I selected John's gospel because he says more about love than any of the evangelists. He says more too, perhaps, about hatred than any of them; he is a man of extremes, in a sense, and he presents the things that he speaks of in their absoluteness. In speaking of love in contrast to hatred, he intimates clearly that love is according to Christ and that hatred characterises Antichrist. It seems to me that Judas is the
{323}
representative of the anti-christian spirit; whereas, in a modest way, John presents the disciple "whom Jesus loved" as the expression of the spirit of Christianity.
In view of the character of @John 13, it is very suited that these two opposites should appear in it. I am not saying that other New Testament writers do not speak of love; they all do; Paul is very express about it; he says (@1 Corinthians 16: 22), "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha". Very strong language this! It is his way, in one sense, of expressing his estimate of Christ; he had wonderful affection for Christ. He is speaking to the Corinthians. Amongst them, alas! there were evidently non-lovers of Christ. You will not remain long a non-lover; if you are that now, you may presently become a hater of Christ. Hence the apostle is very pronounced in reminding you of the curse.
In writing to the Ephesians he does not suggest there were any amongst them who did not love Christ. He had a very great experience of the spiritual affections at Ephesus. You will all remember how, having called the elders, they embraced him (@Acts 20: 37); that is very beautiful! They loved him. They felt most of all, it says, that they should see his face no more. It was a scene to touch the heart. They loved the apostle, and this was really an evidence that they loved Christ. He does not therefore suggest that there was a non-lover amongst them; he rather emphasises in his epistle that they had faith in Christ Jesus and love, not only
{324}
for him, but for all the saints. It is a wonderful thing to love Christ and all the saints. At the end of his epistle the apostle remarks, "Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" (@Ephesians 6: 24). He suggests there the possibility of the existence of love for Christ in insincerity. I am not prepared to define how it works out in the individual, but the apostle suggests it, and I mention it so that we may inquire what is the character of our love. Is there an element of corruption there? He pronounced his benediction on those who loved Christ in "incorruption". Remember that word.
So the apostle Paul treats of love very extensively; but, as I was remarking, John uses the word more frequently; he weaves it into the whole fabric of his writings, and on the opposite side you have presented the anti-christian spirit, and Judas is the father of it. The reason why I say that Judas is the father of the anti-christian spirit is that he was with Christ, and so had the opportunity of knowing Him. Having known the Lord, he left Him and betrayed Him. One cannot be an antichrist unless one knows Christ in some sense; you know in some sense what you are objecting to. Hence the characteristic of Antichrist is, "they went out" (@1 John 2: 19). Judas went out. We have the word, "he went out", meaning that he left the circle in which the love of Christ was active.
Let us beware of going out. Perhaps some trivial thing has given occasion to it, but one goes out. In what direction is your face? Think of the company you are leaving if you go out. Judas was the first to
{325}
go out of the christian circle; he has had many followers, alas! In his epistle John speaks in the plural. He says, "there have come many antichrists ... they went out from among us". Judas did not go out unexposed. Neither should you assume that you are unexposed. You may fancy you are, but be your grievance what it may, if you go out you are exposed; besides, you will get into bad company, and it will get worse. It is a painful but wholesome thing to reflect on the course of those who have withdrawn from the circle of christian fellowship. Judas went out exposed, as I said. The Lord said of him, "He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me" (@John 13: 18). It is a terrible thing to lift up your heel. It is operating behind a person, the opposite of 'face to face'. It is an action marked by darkness; it is treachery. One could trace it.
The *heel* is found early in the Scriptures. Satan is the author of that sort of activity: "thou shalt crush his heel" (@Genesis 3: 15), God said to him. It is well to be reminded that he who acts in that way has his *head* bruised; it is inevitable. "He shall crush thy head", that is Satan's annulment. The tribe of Dan is like "a horned snake on the path, which biteth the horse's heels, so that the rider falleth backwards" (@Genesis 49: 17). That is anti-christian. As you know, Jacob himself had learned the lesson, for he was a 'heel-holder' (see footnote *c*, @Genesis 25: 26), one who operates in the rear. That thread runs right through Scripture; it is the anti-christian thread, and Judas is the exponent of it. He had been in the company of the Lord for some three years, so that he had known
{326}
Him. So carefully was he concealed as to his true character that only the Lord, apparently, knew him; but the Lord knew him from the beginning. We may be sure that the spirit of antichrist is under the eye of Christ in whomsoever it may be.
Well now, there was the disciple "whom Jesus loved"; he was not acting from the back, he was on Jesus¬ bosom. He is reposing in confidence, the confidence begotten of known affection; that was John. He is pleased modestly to regard himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved, and he rewards the Lord, as it were, for the place He gave to him, for he never tires of calling attention to the love of Christ. In the next chapter Judas says: "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?" (@John 14: 22); as to this disciple, the apostle carefully says he was "not the Iscariot" -- it was another Judas. Thank God, there was another Judas.
As I was saying, love for Christ is the great antidote to the anti-christian spirit, hence chapter 14 enlarges on the great advantage of loving Christ; "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me" (verse 21), and further the Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word" (verse 23). These are tests: keeping His commandments and His word. Besides the former, all the wonderful communications of Christ are treasured in the heart of the lover of Christ.
Now in turning to Colossians what I wanted to point out was that the Father has translated us into the kingdom of that One, the Son of His love. What a kingdom that is! Think of rule in the hands of the
{327}
Son of the Father's love. I only refer to that part of the passage to call attention to the manner in which the heart is engaged in Colossians. It is engaged with the Son of the Father's love, and then the apostle proceeds to tell us who He is. No one is prepared for such light save a lover of Christ. Colossians is specially for those who love Christ, but the danger was the admitting of an addition to Christ. I call attention to that for a moment. An addition to Christ! True affection will not admit of it. Mary Magdalene would not admit of it for a moment. The apostle, therefore, enlarges on Christ's personal dignity and glory in order that the saints should acknowledge His headship. I want to dwell on that just for a little, and I would refer to David.
Many of you will remember how that in the history of David, after the recovery of Ziklag, he remained in Ziklag for two days (@2 Samuel 1: 1). That I apprehend to be, in a sense, the epistle to the Romans. It is not, as it were, a station at which you are to remain, but it is important to remain for some time in it, in order that the soul should be matured in the sense of recovery. Indeed it is not only recovery, but victory. We are "more than conquerors through him that has loved us" (@Romans 8: 37). David re-covered all, and there was that which was designated "David's spoil" (@1 Samuel 30: 20).
David inquired of the Lord on the third day: Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah? The point is, Shall I go up? Did you ever ask that question? It is not the divine thought that we should remain on the plain; things on the plain must be adjusted, but
{328}
the soul that loves Christ inquires as to an upward movement. Jehovah says to David, "Go up ... unto Hebron" (@2 Samuel 2: 1). Hebron was a remarkable place. The Spirit of God, in mentioning it in Numbers, tells us that it "had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt" (chapter 13: 22). Now ponder for a moment over David in Hebron. Caleb had been there, an illustrious man; the Levites had lived there. Consider David in the streets of Hebron. Doubtless there were buildings there. What would David say of them? As a spiritual man he would say, 'These structures are not patterned on anything in Egypt'. How do you order your circumstances, whether domestic or religious? Are they patterned after the world? Christendom is patterned after the world, nothing else. Hebron would suggest that which existed before the world system. That is a thought we need to get into our souls.
Christ is said to be the Beginning: He is the Image of God. He is before everything; He is the Firstborn; nothing preceded Him, beloved friends. That is Colossians. Romans, in its general teaching, dates back to Eden, it refers to the fall and the recovery, but when you get to Colossians you come to see things that existed before, for Adam was but a figure of Him that was to come (@Romans 5: 14). We need to live in Hebron, beloved friends. David lived there and reigned there, partially, it is true, but he reigned there for seven years and six months. What a time it was! He begat children there; he begat none at Ziklag, but at Hebron his family increased (@2 Samuel 3: 2). Increase is in Colossians. It is in the
{329}
apprehension of Christ as Head that you get increase. It is a wonderful thing to dwell on the thought of what existed before the world.
David did not, however, build in Hebron. It is not the grand objective of the Spirit, but a most import-ant point if our souls are to be imbued with the sense of what existed before the world. In saying many things about Christ the apostle goes on to say, "*he* is the head of the body, the assembly ... the beginning". I would I could convey what I had in my mind as to the idea of the beginning, and that the beginning is before the world system was ever devised. It all originates in Christ. John enlarges on the beginning in his epistle. He says, "That which was from the beginning" (@1 John 1: 1). That is Christ as man. Whereas in his gospel he says, "*In* the beginning was the Word" (@John 1: 1). How the Lord would have us to sit down and drink in that thought! Like David, to meditate in the streets of Hebron as to the pattern of things according to God; still, as I was remarking, there is no building. David's period in Hebron was not marked by building, it was a *formative* period; it was a period preparatory to Jerusalem; there you get the structure. I can only touch on the thought.
In Ephesians we come to the headship of Christ, but not only for the individual Christian. It is said that He is set over all things; He is "head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" (chapter 1: 22, 23). And then it says further that He has "ascended up above all the heavens" (chapter 4: 10). What for? "That he might fill
{330}
all things"; and that being so, it says, He has given gifts unto men. Now I apprehend that the force of that passage is that things are operated, to refer to the type, from Jerusalem. The assembly is really formed on earth by Christ from His present position. The gifts are here to edify; for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body. After what pattern? Anything from Zoan? No, nothing. All that is rigidly excluded. You are reminded of the pattern given to Moses.
Now if you look at Chronicles just for a moment, the first book begins with Adam. You have all the threads traced until you reach David! David is the head typically. According to the narrator in Chronicles, Solomon is not the designer of the temple, he is simply acting under David. The temple is wholly designed after a heavenly pattern. Egypt and Babylon are rigidly shut out. Would that the Lord's people throughout Christendom could see that! Things should all antedate the world. David received the pattern of the temple "by the Spirit" (@1 Chronicles 28: 12). There you are, so to say, at the top. Everything is patterned after divine wisdom. Well, beloved friends, it is in that sense that one understands Ephesians, and I commend to you the subject in that light.
May the Lord give us in these days to have love for Him, and as we have love for Christ we shall come into these things; whereas if we are devoid of it, sooner or later we shall get on to anti-christian lines.

"LITTLE UPON THE EARTH"
J. H. Trevvett
@Proverbs 30: 24 - 29; @2 Kings 4: 13; @Matthew 26: 6 - 10
Then, looking round upon things, he [Agur] sees other things which would describe intelligent believers who compose the assembly; he sees them under two aspects. First, they are little, they are obscure, but they are exceeding wise; and secondly, they have a stately step, and are comely in going.
Paul was little; he got his name changed when he faced Elymas the sorcerer, that proud boastful man who would keep Sergius Paulus from the knowledge of the truth, a magician who had cast his unholy spell over men. But Scripture tells us that "Saul, who also is Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 13: 9) rebuked him -- he called him a son of the devil. That was not Saul of Tarsus speaking, it was Paul the little. He was "little upon the earth", but oh! what power marked him.
What does it matter how small we are in men's eyes, as long as we hold to the truth, and maintain fidelity to Christ! That is wisdom. A man who can say, "I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy" (@Proverbs 30: 3), is little indeed. He has gained nothing from man's schools; you do not learn wisdom there. Paul could remind the Corinthians that they had said, "his letters ... are weighty and strong, but his presence in the body is weak, and his speech naught" (@2 Corinthians 10: 10); yet he says, "But if I a simple person in speech, yet not in knowledge" (@2 Corinthians 11: 6). How the Corinthians
{332}
missed their way into the most blessed things, through not getting near to Paul as one who had the whole counsel of God (@Acts 20: 27). The Corinthians missed it, for they were not prepared to be "little upon the earth" that they might become "exceeding wise".
There are four things mentioned here in this connection, the ants, the rock-badgers, the locusts, and the lizard, and all are alike small, but exceeding wise. I would ask, Are we like them? Are we content to be "little upon the earth"? Is there any one of us who is ashamed of the testimony? Is there any one shunning the reproach of Christ? Or any one seeking a place in the social circle, or the political circle, or it may be the chief seats in the synagogue? These are not features of men and women who are "little upon the earth" and "exceeding wise".
There are other things which Agur sees and describes: "three things which have a stately step, and four are comely in going". See how enlarged he is, and how he is acquiring wisdom! The question is asked in @Job 28, "where shall wisdom be found?" (verse 12, Authorised Version). Job is speaking of the wonderful activities of men and showing how clever they are. He speaks of their many-sided achievements, burrowing in the earth for treasure, overturning mountains, or cutting channels in the rocks, but then he cries, "But where shall wisdom be found?" -- this is not wisdom! He is not hankering after the greatness of men, he wants wisdom. Then he begins to ruminate upon it. Have you ever done that? For if
{333}
you never ruminate upon the value of wisdom, I doubt if you will covet it. Job begins to speak of the price of it; he says, "the acquisition of wisdom is above rubies" (verse 18), "It is not set in the balance with gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire" (verse 16); not one of them can equal this wonderful thing -- wisdom. Then he says, Where shall it be found? And the last verse of the chapter supplies the answer to all his exercises: "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding" (verse 28).
Agur sees four things that go well, that are comely in going; that is the other side of the position, showing the assembly in its dignity; however small things may appear outwardly, they are inwardly great, and there is dignity in their going. One thing has profoundly impressed me in moving about amongst the small gatherings, and that is, the power there is to deal with evil. Though there is a sense of brokenness and weakness, and it is recognised that they are but a small part of the assembly of God in a place, yet they display the true features of the assembly; they have ability and power to deal with what is contrary to God.
The two women of whom we read in 2 Kings and Matthew represent these two features of the assembly, the outward littleness, but the inward power which gives a stately walk. The great woman of Shunem was content to be little. Shunem was one of the cities of Issachar, and it is said of Issachar that they had understanding of the times, and knew what
{334}
Israel ought to do (@1 Chronicles 12: 32). That is wisdom. Would that every believer had that kind of wisdom. This is stated of them at a time when David was not crowned, but these men of Issachar came down to him in the stronghold, and they knew what Israel ought to do -- they ought to crown David.
Well, this woman [@2 Kings 4] was like that; she knew what ought to be done, and she did it in a most wise and skilful way. She took account of the prophet, and said to her husband, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually" (verse 9). I have seen meetings where the prophet has been allowed to pass by, he was not wanted; they have said, He unsettles people; he disturbs us -- for the bringing in of the mind of God exposes things. Thank God if he is moving in our direction! For if the prophet is moving at all in our direction today, it is the gracious activity of Christ, for that is the character of the ministry for our days.
Thank God for every bit of prophetic ministry; it concerns the subjective side of the truth; and in these last days, the truth is being ministered prophetically in that relation, and if we miss the prophet's speaking, we shall miss much. So this wise woman said to her husband, He is passing continually, let us detain him. The acknowledgement of headship is one great feature with the woman. She said to her husband, "Let us make ... a small upper chamber" (verse 10). She would say, He does not want rank, social dignity, or social status; he is content to be small upon the earth. Let us make him a little
{335}
chamber and furnish it -- just a bed, for he must sleep and he must commune. If a prophet does not commune, of what value is his speaking? And then, further, he must have a table, for he must eat; and then a seat, that he may meditate and be restful; and a lamp, that he may have light. Perhaps you say, I do not like the light that prophet brings. Do not blame the prophet, he is but the vessel through which the light comes; it is God who is speaking. The prophet does not wish to expose, but he brings in the light of God, and the light makes manifest. So they detain the prophet, and I believe the woman's speech, as Elisha sends the messenger to ask what shall be done for her, is the result of listening to the prophetic word.
Have you ever thought how much conversation they would have in this house? It would not be just the current topics of the day. People sometimes speak of having a prophet's chamber; but what should concern us is the entry of the prophet into the local gathering: What will he bring to light? I may have a prophet's chamber and the prophet not be able to come. I may furnish a room for him, but what about the state? Is there the necessary state in my house? -- that is the principle. "And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread" (verse 8). How much he would say! How much he knew! Could you ever have a more delightful visitor than Elisha, the gracious, holy man of God? Now he says, "what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king?" How simple and dignified
{336}
and honest is her answer!: "I dwell among mine own people". She was "little upon the earth". It is not a question of what I may have, but of my state: Am I little?
The woman in @Matthew 26 is one who, in the words of @Proverbs 30 is "exceeding wise". She is certainly little upon the earth, but how comely in going! Sometimes people speak of their local company as being a cold meeting; I have heard that remark myself. But could you ever find a colder meeting than this in @Matthew 26? Can you think of any other meeting where the disciples said, "To what end was this waste?" Outside was an atmosphere of conspiracy, for men were conspiring to kill Jesus; they were consulting that they might take Him by subtlety and put Him to death ...
But it is in the house of Simon the leper that this woman anointed the Lord. It is the meeting viewed on its public side, not the meeting that you have in @John 12. In that scripture, Mary anointed the feet of Jesus -- that is more the Colossian setting; that is not public exactly. But here it is in the house of Simon the leper. There is a certain stigma of reproach attaching to such a house; it is more the outward character attaching to it. But *Jesus was there*. The Lord is to be found today outside the camp, with a poor and despised and feeble folk; that is the place where the Holy Spirit is free; and I know of no other such place, than among such as have withdrawn from iniquity, and who are calling on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart; that is where the Holy
{337}
Spirit is free. In the vast camp of human religious organisation, He is hampered, grieved, and quenched, yea, sinned against, through the intrusion of man's will into the holy things of God, but there is a place where He is free to unfold the things of Christ, and I desire to be found in that place.
This woman shines out against the dark background of apostasy and hatred and conspiracy, as lavishing all the treasures of love upon the head of Jesus. In what fervent fidelity she comes forward! I do not know any person in Matthew who so challenges the heart as this woman does. It is easy to go on with the brethren as their desires are after Christ. Thank God for them! But how would one appear in such an atmosphere as this in @Matthew 26 if one were standing alone? She was but a defenceless woman. What so defenceless, so crushable, as a lizard? Yet it is found in kings¬ palaces (@Proverbs 30: 28)! Crushable, defenceless, feeble -- such is this woman; but oh! how she loved Christ. She comes with her alabaster box of very precious ointment and pours it out upon the head of Jesus as He lay at table. In that act, she crowned Him Lord of all! He allowed her to be put to the test, but she crowned Him; she anointed His head.
In Matthew and Mark it is His head which is anointed, but in Luke and John it is His feet -- for who could anoint His head as presented in John? Jesus says of her in Mark, "What *she* could she has done" (chapter 14: 8). Another has said, referring to this chapter, that 'Christ's comfort in apostasy is this,
{338}
She hath done what she could'. How little she was, but how exceeding wise.
She became wise as she listened, as it were, to the sayings of Jesus as recorded throughout the gospel: meeting the great need in @Matthew 4; and enunciating the great kingdom principles in chapters 5, 6, and 7; as He opened His mouth and taught them. The bride in Canticles says, "His mouth is most sweet" (chapter 5: 16) -- and never sweeter than when He opened it on that mountain and began to speak of what is little upon the earth -- the "poor in spirit", the meek, the mourners and the merciful. Then in the ten miracles of chapters 8 and 9, how He overcame every obstacle; then sending out the twelve that this thing might be greatly extended, and spread abroad; then riding into Jerusalem in chapter 21, as the scripture tells us, "Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass" (verse 5). The Psalmist says, "in thy splendour ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness" (@Psalm 45: 4).
From chapter 21 to 25, it is the King speaking, viewing what has been, and what is, and what is to come. And when He had completed "all these sayings" (chapter 26: 1), this woman crowned Him. All these things caused her to enthrone Jesus in her heart, and at the very moment that was most suitable, she embraced the opportunity and crowned Him Lord of all! And Jesus says, "she has wrought a good work". She is lowly, she is obscure, but oh! how comely in going. Is she afraid of the disciples,
{339}
or considering what they will think of her coming and acting thus alone? No, she is intent upon Him!
May the Lord help us to be little upon the earth, that we may become exceeding wise; so that in all our movements, and in the administration which belongs to the assembly, there may be dignity and comeliness in going, so that testimony may be borne to our blessed Lord, and that all that we undertake for Him, as belonging to His assembly, may bring glory to Him.

A FEW WORDS ON ELIJAH
J. N. Darby
@1 Kings 17 - 20
These chapters set before us several important principles; and we see there pointed out several very different characters; we learn in them also the ways of God.
Ahab and Jezebel appear on the scene; Elijah prophesies; Obadiah is seen and the seven thousand men of God mentioned in chapter 19: 18.
The character of Ahab is presented to us in chapter 16: 29 - 33. Ahab, Jezebel, and the four hundred and fifty prophets were at the head of the apostates of Israel, who at that time worshipped Baal. And Obadiah and the seven thousand were mixed up with the people (chapter 18); not that they served the idol, but they were friends of Ahab. As for Elijah, he was the friend of God, and, separated entirely from the apostasy, he was the only witness
{340}
of the truth in the midst of all the evil.
Let us distinguish then these three different classes of persons: Ahab and Israel, apostates on one side; Elijah, on the other, the faithful servant of God; and again, somewhat different, Obadiah and the seven thousand connected always with the evil. Now let us examine the different characters of these persons.
What were the circumstances of Elijah? This feeble and poor man had no force and strength save what he found in Jehovah, his only support (chapter 17: 1 - 9). He was a man of faith and prayer; and, keeping before Jehovah, he could boldly testify against the apostasy of Israel and announce the judgments of God.
It is said to him (chapter 17: 3), "Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the torrent Cherith, which is before the Jordan"; then in verse 5 we read that he obeyed this command. We see already then that Elijah had no power, but had faith in God and knew that all blessing is in obedience. Also from the moment that the word was addressed to him, he submitted to it and went to the torrent Cherith where he learnt to depend on God.
Ahab and all Israel were the enemies of Elijah (chapter 18: 10); but God was his friend, and in each step that he took in fidelity to Jehovah he learnt the fidelity of Jehovah to him. By this means he was more and more strengthened for the mission on which he was about to be employed (chapter 18: 1). God sent him to be with a poor widow who entertained
{341}
him during the famine, after he was fed by the ravens at Cherith. During all the time that he was cared for by the ravens at the brook, and by the widow at Zarephath, he learnt to know the riches of the love and grace of God. It is there precisely that we learn to know ourselves also in all the circumstances in which we are placed by Jehovah.
We see then in chapter 17 the simple and entire obedience of Elijah. Whether Jehovah sent him to a brook to be fed by ravens; whether he was sent to a widow during the famine; whether he was sent before his real enemy Ahab (chapter 18), he made no objection, but counting on Jehovah he did that which he was ordered. He was nevertheless a man subject to the same passions and to the same infirmities as ourselves (@James 5: 17, 18); but he had much of that faith the power of which is infinite. By it he could say that there should be no rain, and there was none; by it he could raise the son of the widow, and overcome Ahab the king and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal. These circumstances show us clearly that Elijah was in the place where one is blessed, namely, in that of obedience. Men were his enemies; Ahab had sent everywhere persons to find him out: but Jehovah was his refuge, and he had learnt to trust in Him.
Let us examine now what concerns Obadiah (chapter 18: 3, etc.). He feared Jehovah greatly, but, spite of this, he was in the service of Ahab's house and did not bear testimony against its evil. He did not suffer the reproach of Christ. He was not like Elijah,
{342}
pursued and chased from country to country. He did not know what it was to be fed by the ravens or the widow; that is to say, he lived little by faith, and knew little of the ways of God. He lived at his ease in the world. Ahab was his lord. But who was Elijah's? Jehovah. Compare chapter 18: 10 and 15. Oh! what a difference. Obadiah knew the good things of the earth; Elijah, the good things of heaven.
Let us read now verses 7 - 11. All the thoughts of Obadiah were about his master, whom he dreaded; but all the thoughts of Elijah were centred on Jehovah, his only Master. The superiority of his position to that of Obadiah is further indicated by this circumstance, that the latter fell on his face before Elijah when he met him (verse 7). And when Elijah tells him to go and announce to Ahab, Obadiah is all frightened. Yet Obadiah was a child of God; he had even hid the prophets; but he had no strength whatever to bear testimony to Jehovah, because he was associated with evil.
As to Elijah, he could say fearlessly to Ahab and to all the people, "If Jehovah be God, follow him"(verse 21). Whence did, therefore, this boldness and power come, as seen in Elijah, a poor and weak man, who had been straitened to this point, that he depended upon ravens and upon a widow for his food? From the fact that he stood aloof from the apostasy, that he lived by faith and had a single eye fixed upon his God. Oh! how far better his position was than that of Obadiah.
There is in these things an application for us to
{343}
make to ourselves. Let us gather from them this lesson, that since the Lord is God, it is He whom we must serve, and that, in order to be faithful to Him, we have to separate ourselves from all the principles of the apostasy by which we are surrounded.
We know how Elijah triumphed over his enemies: there is therefore no need of repeating the issue of the scene on Carmel. But let us observe that, when Elijah prayed Jehovah that He might give him the victory, what he asked was, that it might be known that Jehovah was God (chapter 18: 37). All the desire of his heart consisted in these two things, that Jehovah might be glorified, and that His people might know Him. There was not in him the least desire to lift himself up, to exalt himself; it mattered not to him if he was nothing, provided that God might be glorified and His people brought to know Him. Oh! that the same desire may be in us, and that all thought of vainglory may be cast far, far away.
Let us now read chapter 19. Poor Elijah! he had a lesson to learn, which we ourselves, weak and poor as we are, need to learn also. When Elijah stood before Jehovah, he could by Jehovah's power stop or send rain to the earth, raise up the widow's son, etc. But when he stood, not now before Jehovah, but before Jezebel, he was then without strength, and this ungodly woman was able to cause him to fear. Downcast, Elijah therefore goes into the wilderness, sits down under a broom-bush and asks Jehovah to take away his life (verse 4). How different he is here from what he was in the chapter before! How little
{344}
did he remember what Jehovah had done for him; how little did he enter into the mind of God, and expect that chariot of fire which would shortly take him up to heaven (@2 Kings 2: 11)!
So is it with us. We are downcast, discouraged and weak in ourselves as soon as we fail to live in faith and prayer, and then we cannot say, as Elijah in chapter 18: 15, "Jehovah ... before whom I stand".
In chapter 17 Elijah by faith could make the widow's oil and meal last; but here he is weak, and needs that an angel come to strengthen him and give him some food. (Read chapter 19: 5 - 8.) He eats, drinks, and, like a man without strength, lies down. But Jehovah sends the angel back again, for He is plentiful in grace and mercy; He watches over all our ways and feeds our souls according to all our wants and according to all our circumstances. Jehovah therefore bore with Elijah and succoured him, and it is also what He is with respect to us. As He was afflicted in all the affliction of His people (@Isaiah 63: 9), so is He with us in ours now.
In chapter 17 God was leading Elijah and telling him where to go, and Elijah obeyed. But in chapter 19 Elijah, fearing Jezebel, flees away and does not wait for Jehovah's commandment to go into the wilderness. See therefore what a sad message is sent to him, as recorded in verse 13, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" In verses 11 and 12 we read that a wind, an earthquake, and a fire are sent; but Elijah did not find Jehovah in these things, and they could not bring comfort nor strength to his soul. God was
{345}
appearing in His grandeur and power; but what Elijah needed was the still small voice, what he wanted was the manifestation of grace and communion with his God. When, therefore, Elijah had heard the still small voice, he wrapped his face in his mantle and stood ready to obey Jehovah. By the power and strength that he had found in this voice he was once again enabled to obey the commandment of Jehovah.
What we have said on these chapters is very incomplete; but we believe that the chief thing is to bring out of them the principles calculated to give the intelligence of what the chapters contain. Let us therefore be mindful of avoiding the position of Obadiah and the seven thousand, who were taking their ease in the midst of apostasy, but who were without strength to bear testimony against evil. Let us also remember that, though Elijah was despised and rejected of men, he was nevertheless in the place of blessing. And if like himself we are brought to realise our weakness, let us remember that communion with the Lord can alone give us afresh zeal and devotedness and joy.

SPIRITUAL ENERGY
G. H. S. Price
@2 Timothy 1: 16 - 18; @Acts 20: 29 - 35; @Haggai 1: 2 - 8; @Haggai 2: 7
I wish to say a word on spiritual energy, feeling that it is a matter that may be especially needed amongst us at the end of the dispensation. Spiritual energy is needed if we are to follow up swiftly light from God as knowing God, so that we are found with the ear to hear and the eye to see. The time that may remain, in the period that we have spoken of as the days of our receiving up, may be very short. There is much to be done, and it calls for energy in those who are prepared to put their hand to it.
I would stress the qualification of spiritual energy, for, in the work of the Lord there is to be no other kind. There may be much fleshly energy and zeal in the world around us, but let us remember that the power for everything in the divine realm lies in the Holy Spirit. If we aspire to have part in this kind of activity in an energetic way, it must be as those who are prepared to come under divine control, under the lordship of Christ and under the practical influence of the Spirit.
We have the most affecting examples before us, first of all, in divine Persons Themselves. In the Old Testament we have the allusion to God "rising early and sending" the prophets (@Jeremiah 7: 25; @Jeremiah 25: 3; @Jeremiah 26: 5; @Jeremiah 35: 15; @Jeremiah 44: 4), showing how this thought of energy is set out even in God Himself in relation to the needs of the time. We see it touchingly set out in the life of Jesus, those days full of activity in the realm of testimony, and those nights of communion alone
{347}
with God on the mount of Olives. What holy energy there was in that life, a life of activity in obscurity, as another has said.
As we read through the gospels we are impressed with the quantity and volume of work that was compressed into those days, and I suppose but a fraction of the activities of the life of Jesus is recorded in the holy Word. In grace He would go on to secure the woman at the well at Sychar, although wearied with the way that He had come (@John 4: 6). And yet the work goes on, and in that very chapter the Lord takes in hand the education of the disciples. They were postponing the harvest, but the Lord says to them, "I say to you ... the fields ... are already white to harvest ... others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours" (@John 4: 35, 38). The Lord spoke -- I say with the greatest reverence -- as the great Labourer Himself, for He had that day gathered in a sheaf, as it were, for the worship of God, and then as He says in John's gospel (chapter 5: 17), "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".
Then we have the thought of energy in the service of the Spirit. We have often been reminded of the energetic action of the Spirit in the way He came according to @Acts 2 and the way He fell on persons according to @Acts 10, showing how the divine Mind is committed to this mode of operation. So I speak feelingly and humbly to my beloved brethren, as to whether this may not be one of the needs of the moment. We do not drift into these
{348}
things; if we drift anywhere, we drift away from them. What is needed amongst us is spiritual energy. And we are faced with the word of God Himself, "Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently" (@Jeremiah 48: 10).
These passages have come to mind as setting it out in certain persons and in certain settings, and I begin with this reference to Onesiphorus and the energy that marked him in seeking out Paul and being a comfort to him. But, before I speak about Onesiphorus in this book, I make a remark about the book itself, because Timothy, to whom Paul writes, is spoken to as having need "to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee" (@2 Timothy 1: 6) and Mr. Darby gives a most poignant note to that word 'rekindle': footnote *e* -- '... The whole subject of the epistle is energy in the darkening state of the assembly'. The very phrase should make a profound appeal to our hearts.
Publicly we are in the days of the darkening state of the assembly. The Lord must feel that. In that which once shone so brightly in testimony to His name and His glory, the light has gone, publicly the candlestick having been removed through unfaith-fulness as to light-bearing, and as corruption and departure from what is right and the truth had set in. Can we not enter in some measure into the feelings of Christ as to that which professes His name and yet which is about to be spewed out of His mouth?
Paul feels it, every lover of Christ must feel it, that that which is so dear to the heart of Christ, publicly should have gone so sadly astray. And we
{349}
have to own, of course, our part in the public failure and breakdown. Paul, under the influence of the Spirit, discerns what is needed, and speaks of it in this epistle, the whole theme of which is energy in such days, the darkening state of the assembly. It is as though every person is to be conscripted; and Timothy is needed. The book gives those who depart from the truth, named men, alas, who leave Paul. Even in this first chapter he says, "all who are in Asia ... have turned away from me" (verse 15). But one of the bright rays in the darkness referred to in this book is this man Onesiphorus and the way he comes forward to identify himself with Paul in his bonds.
I am not thinking from this first passage exactly of Paul personally, but I am thinking of Paul representatively. He sets out the assembly position in reproach and smallness and in bonds, and Onesiphorus comes before us as a man who is energetic to identify himself with that. Let Paul be a prisoner, let him be in chains: Onesiphorus would say, 'That is the position I want to be identified with'. Would that that energetic kind of attitude marked us more in relation to the public position of the testimony today! It is in reproach. Let no one think otherwise than that! Paul says in this very book, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner" (chapter 1: 8). The testimony is in bonds, it is the day of the public absence of the One we love, and that which is dear to His heart is in reproach. Paul represents that in this passage, and Onesiphorus is marked by spiritual energy to find it out and to bring in a ministration of
{350}
comfort.
I ask myself, as I ask my beloved brethren, Is that the kind of spiritual energy that is with us in relation to the local position in all its oft-times smallness and the public reproach that attaches to it? Are we ashamed of Paul's chain? Are we ashamed of the prisoner of the Lord? Soon the whole scene will change and, as another has said, the church will go from her ruins to her glory, while the world will go from its magnificence to its judgment. What a reversal there will be!
There is that which is of no account in the eyes of the world, even in the eyes of the ecclesiastical leaders of the day, it may be, yet the Lord names it as precious to Him. Are we diligent in finding it out? Does diligence mark us in supporting the local position, where it is small and, may be, not many available? There may be difficult times, with suffering called for, and not many to stand by the position. Are we there, dear brethren? We are on the very eve of the Lord's return, and Satan is making renewed and repeated attacks on that which is dear to the heart of Christ. Let us stand by it, be it ever so small, be the reproach ever so great! Let us be energetic to be there, standing loyally by it!
Think of the diligence that marked Onesiphorus in Rome. Not many people would have wanted to help him find a prisoner in bonds. There would not have been much outwardly to encourage him, but there he was, very diligently seeking Paul, and Paul says, he "found me". Think of what that was to Paul. Think of what it is to the brethren in the locality,
{351}
where it is evident that there is some one spiritually energetic to come forward and stand by the position in a darkening day.
The days of testimony and reproach are nearly finished. The opportunity of standing by the position in the acceptance of the reproach of Christ may soon have passed away for ever. It is one of the needs of the moment in the darkening state of the assembly publicly. Never mind those who say, 'It is only Paul, and the thing has gone to pieces'! Let *men* say what they will! We stand by the authoritative word of God, that hades¬ gates shall not prevail against the assembly (@Matthew 16: 18), and there is, thank God, in outward weakness and smallness, something that bears the true and full character of the assembly, something that delights the heart of Christ, here in this very scene at the present time. I am humbly suggesting that we should use spiritual energy to find it out, stand by it, and seek to bring in a ray of comfort, if we can.
Paul can speak to Timothy, according to the last verse of the chapter, about knowing what Onesiphorus had done. Timothy himself had done much, for he was a man that Paul knew and trusted, a man that cared for the saints, and he can speak to Timothy of what Onesiphorus had done in the support of the testimony in the darkening state of the assembly. Paul loves to bring a man like this forward in the face of those who had turned away from him. Was the path too narrow or the position too small? They might have gone on, perhaps, with a more prominent position; but with Paul in bonds and
{352}
testimony in reproach, these men, Phygellus and Hermogenes, had turned away from him. Let us not despise "the day of small things" (@Zechariah 4: 10), but use spiritual energy to find out the position, identify where the truth is, where the Lord is, where the Spirit's voice is heard, and let us stand by it with spiritual energy in these dark days!

NOTHING BUT CHRIST
J. B. Stoney
Though the night be dark, the Lord is sure to encourage us when we least expect it. I feel more and more that there is great opposition abroad, and the opposition is against the exalted Man. If you are not really set for God's Man, the Man out of heaven, no matter how useful and nice you may be, you are not in God's testimony!
There are two classes of believers -- one would cultivate everything that is nice and good, the other will have nothing but Christ. If your heart is really for Christ, you must make choice of Him exclusively. I have been helped by seeing that there is great gain in sacrificing everything that would prevent my being in company with Him. I might be useful and yet lacking in the love which is not satisfied with anything but the company of the Lord.

THE BLESSING OF GOD, THE BLESSING OF THE LORD AND THE LIBERTY OF THE SPIRIT
J. Smith
@Ephesians 6: 1 - 8; @Luke 12: 42 - 44; @1 Thessalonians 5: 19 - 23
I desire to speak to you about the blessing of God, the blessing of the Lord and the liberty of the Spirit. I think we have to make a distinction between the blessing of God and the blessing of the Lord, whilst at the same time I feel the importance of the liberty of the Spirit. It is rather remarkable that at the end of such an epistle as the Ephesians you should find God proposing blessing which is not exactly spiritual in its nature, yet consistent with the dignity of the epistle in which it is found. So that I would like you to connect these remarks with the Ephesians.
One has often felt what a marvellous occasion it was when the Ephesian brethren found themselves in possession of this letter, and probably found themselves together to hear it read, and one can only conclude that such a company would have the custom of assembling with their children. At any rate, when that letter was read, those who had their children with them must have been exceedingly thankful. That is to say, the apostle turns directly to the children, not to speak to them alone, dear friends; he addresses them with their parents, with the servants and with the masters, and proposes to them the blessing of God -- that is, the blessing of God in connection with temporal things.
Now, there is a way, there is a path where light is
{354}
sown for the righteous. You see, it is for the *righteous*, therefore in the end of Ephesians you find the proposal is to the children with the parents, and the servants with the masters, to take the path of righteousness. The admonition to the children is simply to do what is right. Also the parents with the servants, each are admonished to do what is right; and, beloved, I would like you to notice two things in connection with this scripture; in verse 3 it says, "that it may be well with thee". Is not this temporal blessing?
Then in verse 8, "knowing that whatever good each shall do, this he shall receive of the Lord, whether bond or free". I understand that to mean that God gives compensation in relation to every act of uprightness in this world. Surely it is well to know the plan of salvation and to have light in regard to spiritual things; but (may I say it?), how can we prosper without the blessing of God, that is, the blessing of God in connection with what is *temporal*? ...
It is easy to think of our parents as though they were administering things merely to carry out some whim of their own, but is not the position just this? Our parents are responsible to God. However, the first admonition is addressed to the children. Surely, beloved, the Lord knows we do not like to be under discipline, we do not like the idea of obeying, it is irksome to us.
Some of us have been obedient, but why? Was it not because we did not like the consequences that
{355}
would follow disobedience? Yet today we are thankful we did obey. We are thankful for any measure in which we were obedient, because God says, 'I will bless that'. But in the very next verse God addresses Himself to the parents. There is a word for them, and if you sum it up altogether, you find that God, in addressing the children, the parents, the servants and the masters, is proposing to them a blessing.
My first point, then, is this -- the necessity of our inheriting the blessing of God. Does not Peter present the same thing? But if you get it, *you inherit* it. You may have noticed that a person brought up in the truth often makes a reliable brother. Now why? They had been taught from their earliest days to inherit the blessing of God. One feels the danger has been with many of us, we have sought to lay hold of what is spiritual without due regard for what is temporal. Suppose I am negligent as a servant or overbearing as a master, can I prosper spiritually? Never -- unless I am changed!
Now, of course, we need more than what is temporal, but some of us have been so very eager to instruct people in "the glad tidings of the grace of God" (@Acts 20: 24), that we have failed to show them the necessity of inheriting this blessing. We have been so anxious to get them to receive that which comes to them entirely through the merits of Christ, that we have forgotten to tell them that there are certain things that must come to them through their *own personal activities*.
{356}
Beloved hearers, I am speaking of the blessing of God. If you wish to have it, you must merit it, and no greater favour could be conferred on a person than to help him at the outset, that is, to give him light as to inheriting the blessing from God ...
So then, beloved, leaving this scripture with you, may I ask you to ponder these opening verses of the sixth chapter of Ephesians? Will they not introduce you to the blessing of God?
Now coming to Luke's gospel, we find quite another matter, that is, what is spiritual. Here the Lord is speaking to His stewards. May I apply this to each one of us? Are we not all stewards? In verse 41 Peter says, "Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?" and the Lord in effect says, "to all". Peter represents the ministering brethren, valuable in their place; but the Lord is speaking to all.
Now, in verse 42, the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward?" It is addressed to the steward. How important it is to carry the exercise of a steward! You see, you cannot make any headway as a Christian without carrying the exercise of a steward. May I propose it to you, beloved? Never allow anything to take from you your stewardship. I believe I have heard persons saying, 'I leave all that to my husband'. If so, where is your stewardship? Can you afford to surrender anything?
I can understand, of course, a man being head of his house, and I can understand a woman being in subjection, but, beloved, I cannot understand a woman's exercises being completely wiped out. Are
{357}
you going to make the woman a nonentity? I know the enemy has endeavoured to get women to step right out of their place, and the men seem to like it; they do not want responsibility. They seem to say, 'Let anybody do it'. But, beloved, did you never take account of yourselves as stewards? May I ask you to put yourself into this scripture? "Who then is the faithful and prudent *steward*, whom his lord will set over his household?"
Now does not all this stand in relation to the world to come? And is not your position in stewardship an education in view of that world? That is to say, if you are faithful in a *little* here, the Lord may commit *much* to you there; and is it not so, beloved brethren, if we come back to reign with Christ, we shall not come back as brothers and sisters? What a loss it would be for a sister to drop her stewardship now! How will she come back to the millennial reign? She will not return as a sister. So then, nothing could be gained by stepping out of a sister's place; how precious it is to be entrusted with stewardship!
The young, too, should carry the exercise of stewards. It is the one privilege which makes things *sweet*; puts sweetness into going to our work. Just think of it! Why do I work? It gives me capacity as a steward. So then, beloved, so far as I am concerned I would like the smallest child who receives a little pocket-money from its father to begin with the consciousness of being a steward.
Does not more hang upon it than we think? "And
{358}
the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will set over his household?" Faithfulness in stewardship leads to the principle of rule, and the principle of rule comes out in the world to come. Is it not possible that the Lord may give you some position of prominence in the world to come? I am perfectly sure that I shall not get this because I preach. I attach more importance to my fidelity as a steward than to my ability as a preacher. Indeed, are all preachers *able* speakers? I was saying the other day that if I wanted to find an able speaker, I should not think of a preacher. This is an able speaker to my mind -- you are in the company of some opposer of Christ, and in spite of all he says, you give him an arrow to his conscience and something to touch his heart. Is not that an able speaker? a speaker who can speak in spite of disturbances. Some preachers could not preach if a baby were to cry.
Now *the Lord* is looking to you that you should be faithful to Him as a steward. "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give the measure of corn in season?" You may say, 'I cannot do that'. Why not? Cannot you find out some sick persons and give to them a seasonable word? Are there not many who need a word in season? "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus". Well might we covet that when the Lord comes He should find us faithful as stewards.
Now we referred to the question of money, but a
{359}
steward would be poor who had nothing but money. Yet we would like to be stewards of *all* we possess, spiritually and temporally. Should we not hold all as a steward? If the Lord comes and finds you faithful as a steward, His word is, "Blessed". Who shall say how much depends on this?
I believe the Lord would encourage us not only to allow the precious death of Christ to give us a title to heaven, but He would encourage us to qualify for *prominence in the kingdom*. It would be folly to aspire to prominence *now*, but it is wisdom to aspire to it *then*. I would to God that He might fill every young heart here with the ambition, the holy ambition, to qualify in this present moment for *prominence*, yea, more, to add to the glory of the day of display.
Now I think the Lord would use these things to give shape to our exercises, and I trust that all present can see that I have been speaking of the blessing of God in a temporal way, and of the blessing of the Lord in a spiritual way; because you may depend upon it, if the end of the course is so important, the journey is important too. There is a course that leads up to the moment when the Lord comes and finds you faithful as a steward, but do you not see that if I am to be sure of the blessing in its finality, I have to be faithful all the way along the journey, for who of us knows *when* He will come? So it says in @Luke 12: 37, "*Blessed* are those bondmen whom the lord on coming shall find *watching*". So you see there is the question of
{360}
watching and the question of doing. These things bring the blessing of the Lord. Surely *this* is spiritual blessing!
But now these are individual matters, and I thought it might be dignified if we touched on something collective.
One covets to inherit the blessing of God and the blessing of the Lord, but then in @1 Thessalonians 5: 19 - 23 the apostle is speaking of things that cannot be individualised; for example, verse 19, "quench not the Spirit". The question of quenching the Spirit takes you beyond what is individual, and many of you have noticed that the Lord in His mercy (not because we are better than other Christians) has called us to a path in which we may taste the joys of an unquenched Spirit.
Perhaps there are some here who have not definitely identified themselves with it, yet the Lord has been speaking to them to call them out into a path where the Spirit is unquenched, that is, where such a thing is known. You see, if I speak of grieving the Spirit (@Ephesians 4: 30), it is an *individual* matter. But this afternoon we were sitting down together with the possibilities of having not only an ungrieved Spirit, but an unquenched Spirit. Think of it, beloved, the people of God sitting down *together* with an unquenched Spirit. You would like to have an ungrieved Spirit in doing the most menial service, but when we come together, seeking to edify one another, much depends upon an unquenched Spirit.
I understand the quenching of the Spirit to be
{361}
connected with His liberty in the company. Is it not a greater thing to have the Spirit free in the company than it is to have the Spirit free in an individual? Surely, it is blessed for the individual to have an ungrieved Spirit, yea, to be filled with the Spirit, but so far as I see it, it is greater to have an unquenched Spirit than it is to be filled with the Spirit. That is, it is greater for the Spirit to be free to get His place in the company than in an individual.
How good it is for the people of God to sit down together! Surely it is good to have a preaching, and an able man to give an address, but if we sit down and make room for the Spirit, is it not making room for a divine Person? ... Now, have we carried the exercise that the Spirit might be unquenched? Has it dawned upon us that the Lord might look to us to do something? What about the sisters? The Lord might put a hymn on their hearts with a view that it might be given out. Then again, if you hold that we should have a word from the Lord in the Lord's day meeting, who shall say whom the Lord may select to give it? It is not necessarily a question of gift. Would it make you uneasy to feel that next Lord's day morning you might be led to speak in the meeting? Because, such is the possibility. My dear brother, let me say it to you soberly, If you come to the meetings you never know what the Lord may expect you to do. Can we come to the meetings, like babies, always coming to get something? How good to come to the meetings remembering the necessity of an unquenched Spirit! ...

SPIRITUAL ENERGY
G. H. S. Price
@2 Timothy 1: 16 - 18; @Acts 20: 29 - 35; @Haggai 1:2 - 8; @Haggai 2: 7
Now I speak about @Acts 20, just to touch on energy in Paul himself. I am thinking now of Paul personally, of Paul as a man, and the way he comes before us in this choice chapter in the energy that marks him. This is not energy that identifies the assembly position; this is energy that has the welfare of the saints at heart, and their building up in the truth. Paul shines here in what he does and in the way he can speak of what he had done. He says, "three years, night and day ... with tears". This is a passage in this great love chapter that should touch our hearts. Paul would use spiritual energy in his love and care for the beloved people of God, challenging us, by what he does and by what he says, as to how much we are prepared to spend on the care of the saints and on their upbuilding. It may include their physical welfare, but Paul knows how to combine the two. In this very chapter he speaks about having announced to them "all the counsel of God" (verse 27), and then he is supplementing that by his house-to-house visiting of the brethren, and by
{363}
the way he can speak of his hands having ministered to his wants and to those who were with him. His arduous, daily service amongst the brethren would all be carried out in the light of the fact that he had already announced among them the whole counsel of God. In his care of the saints, and in his labours amongst them, he would always have in mind the building up of the saints in the truth.
I would enquire of myself, feeling the need of it, How energetic am I in seeking to build up the saints in relation to the present truth, and to help them into the light and enjoyment of what is coming in? Paul was given to foresee that after his departure there would be "grievous wolves" coming in, "not sparing the flock", "and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things". We are not without some sorrowful examples of those that would have part in divisive activities amongst us. It is to be met by this kind of spiritual energy that would move in and out amongst the brethren, if needs be, night and day, and with tears, that the saints might be built up in relation to the present truth.
In Nehemiah's day in the building of the wall the emergency was so great that, it is said, they "wrought in the work with one hand, and with the other they held a weapon" (@Nehemiah 4: 17). Sometimes in assembly crises we have to use the weapon; we have always to hold it ready there to be used; but let us not forget that the other hand is to be used in labouring in the work. That must go on. Sometimes
{364}
we may be more anxious to have a weapon in both hands in our zeal for dealing with matters, and we may overlook the building up of the saints. In assembly exercises there is great need of holding the two in balance. Let our zeal to put things right not obscure our need of seeing that the positive work goes on amongst the saints! Energy is needed. Think of the energy in Nehemiah's day! The whole book, as it were, breathes the atmosphere of spiritual energy in days of recovery, yet days of crisis.
Now Paul here was contemplating days of crisis, and he speaks about his own service. He uses the very word, 'build up', in this chapter: "I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up". How Paul would minister the word of God's grace! And this was not a public service. This was what Paul would do as he went in and out of the houses at Ephesus. We are challenged as we go into one another's houses. Thank God for the holy liberty we have, and the hospitality that exists amongst the brethren; but, as we are in the houses of one another, have we in mind the upbuilding of the saints in the truth? How that objective towers above the level of mere social links that the world may indulge in! We thank God for the holy links of the fellowship. How precious they are! How evident they are at this time! But let us keep in mind, as Paul had in mind, that he would build up the saints in the great light and truth that the Lord had sovereignly given to him. It is not only the energy to stand loyally by the assembly position, but energy that would go after the brethren,
{365}
seek to recover those that may have gone astray, build up one another, strengthen one another, in view of standing unitedly together at the end.
When the Lord comes, may He find us marked by this kind of activity, as the prudent and faithful bondman that knows how to minister a measure of corn in season (@Luke 12: 42). How we need to be energetic on that line! It may be some little touch of Christ that is brought in, in the service of love to one another, that results in the saints being refreshed. We need sober-minded men and woman that understand the need of the times, and are prepared to commit themselves to it, not only out of love for Christ, but out of love for that which is nearest to His heart, those who are of the assembly. Paul would always have them in his mind, and he would labour on, even if in abundantly loving and serving them he was the less loved (@2 Corinthians 12: 15). Paul was not deterred; he was not discouraged. He would go on night and day, in tears, in the spiritual energy that characterised that beloved man of God, in view of the saints coming into the truth of what he had in his soul for them at Ephesus.
Now I say a word on the passage in Haggai. Haggai contemplates a day of revival and recovery. God had intervened in His goodness govern-mentally: there had been a return from the captivity, and the work had begun. But slackness had come in also and, when Haggai prophesied, there were those whose hands were hanging down and who were saying, 'It is not the time for Jehovah's house to be
{366}
built'. There is a tendency with all of us to think on that line, to think that it is not the time for these things. This is a question of God's house and God's pleasure in His house and, in chapter 2, God's glory filling the house. I know this looks on to another day in its fulness, but are we not in days when in some measure the glory of God is filling the house? The light that has come to us as to the blessedness of God, is it not filling the house and filling our hearts and filling the assembly service?
But, before we get that touch as to God being glorified in it and the glory filling it, we have this prophetic word. It is a word that is directed to the consciences of the people, a people who had been liberated from bondage and yet who had settled down in a spirit of lethargy, in a time when spiritual energy was needed. Now I want to link up this passage with the service of God as maintained in His house. It is not only energy that identifies the public position in its outward smallness, not only energy that seeks to build up the saints in relation to the truth, but now energy that furnishes suitable occasions, or a suitable setting, in which divine glory may come in.
This passage would therefore help us to think of the true assembly position and all that belongs to it. Haggai represents the power of the prophetic ministry, calling the attention of the saints to what is needed at the moment. What was needed at that time was an energetic action to "Go up to the mountain and bring wood". It was something that called for
{367}
effort, and we get very little apart from effort and energy and sacrifice. There had to be provided the shrine, we might say, in which God's service was to be maintained, and the prophetic word brings itself to bear on the consciences of the people, twice over, with the word, "Consider your ways". Do our ways need to be reconsidered? Are we moving on right lines, with the worship of God uppermost in our thoughts, or are other matters leading us astray? Are we set to go forward, to glean in the field that is being reaped? The prophetic word helps us to identify that field.
Haggai here would put his finger, as it were, on the very need of the moment, for the persons to whom he speaks were dwelling in their own "wainscoted houses", dwelling in restful conditions, and the needs of the house of God were being neglected. So we have this appeal, "Consider your ways". Let us learn how to consider our ways, and to review matters, as to whether there may be anything with us that is hindering the service of God in its richness and fulness being maintained in the assembly. The Spirit would help us to *consider* our ways and to be prepared, typically, to go up the mountain; that is, no doubt, a suggestion of energy to reach a sphere morally elevated above this world system. What a difference between dwelling restfully in our own surroundings and the energy of response to the word of the prophet to go up to the mountain and bring wood! There may well be a suggestion in that of the acquisition of features of
{368}
Christ's manhood. How they are needed in the service of God! Manhood is needed today in those who think for God, those who stand in the testimony, and those who are concerned about the service and the worship of God.
The service of God should have first place in our minds and in our activities in these favoured days, and we should learn how to relate all matters to that. For the service of God links us on with what God ever had in mind, according to eternal purpose, that He should be served by those in nearness to Himself. And all God's ways with us, individually and householdly and assembly-wise, are to fit us the more to have our part feelingly in His service in the assembly. So let us consider our ways and see if they are yielding something. What is the yield out of our activities for the service of God? What can I bring freshly to enrich the holy worship of God in the assembly? If it is to be what is suitable, it must be something formed by the Spirit morally after Christ, and I believe there is a suggestion of that in the "wood" that has to be brought. Nothing else will do, for no other feature of manhood is to find a place there. It constitutes the setting in which God is served by those who love Him and are near Him.
May the Spirit freshly energise us all in relation to the public position, in relation to the needs of the saints, and, supremely, in relation to the service of God, so that, as we await the Lord's coming, there may be in the assembly a steadily increasing fulness and richness to the blessed God we are so favoured
{369}
to know in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for His Name's sake!

SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 10 -- THE LORD'S SUPPER
M. W. Biggs
The thought of the Lord's supper and the necessarily allied question of 'fellowship' are inseparably linked with the consideration of the subject of the assembly as "come together" (@1 Corinthians 11: 17), inasmuch as in its setting in Scripture, and in its normal relation, it stands in this connection. Moreover, it is the ordinance in Christianity which has specific reference to the church as the body of Christ.
There are two ordinances in Christianity -- baptism and the Lord's supper. Baptism is individual and initial -- that is, it relates to a soul individually with regard to his position on earth, and introduces him to what is nominally Christian. It has nothing to do with the assembly as the "body of Christ". The Lord's supper is not an individual matter, nor is it initial. It is a constantly repeated ordinance of Christianity. Moreover the assembly has been specially given the privilege of this precious remembrance of Christ.
(1) Partaking of the Lord's supper is primarily an act of responsive love. It is meaningless apart from this, whatever the symbols of the Supper themselves may set forth. Christ has loved the church and has
{370}
given Himself for it (@Ephesians 5: 25), and in partaking of the Supper we respond to His love, remembering Him who so loved us and died for us.
The Lord's request to His own on the night of His betrayal -- and, indeed, since by special communication through the apostle Paul to the assembly (@1 Corinthians 11) -- is an appeal to the affections of the whole church. It is to be feared that many of the Lord's people have overlooked this appeal. Endeavouring, it may be, to avoid superstition and ritualistic tendencies, they have forgotten the distinct request of the Lord, "this do ... in remembrance of me".
We do not speak of it as a command, such as the Mosaic law contained; it is more, *it is a request of love*! And nothing can be more simple, or more precious, than this remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ by those who love Him.
(2) We may remark, secondly, that it is necessary that believers should "come together" to partake of this feast. In a previous paper we have referred to the Lord's supper thus. Let us develop this thought a little.
It is particularly precious that the Lord should have linked the "coming together" of the assembly with the remembrance of Himself. *It is characteristically an act of fellowship*.
We do not break bread by ourselves individually, but as in communion with one another. It is the normal calling together of the whole assembly in a place; and we "come together" in response to that call. And what a call it is! How strongly it appeals to
{371}
every heart that loves Christ and desires to answer to His request! How loudly it calls to every ready and attentive ear! It is a call of love to love and can only be rightly answered by love.
And in coming together to respond to His love by partaking of the Supper, we are made increasingly and deeply conscious of how great His love is to all His own, and hence we love Him and we love each other. How could it be otherwise if we are real?
What an atmosphere to be called to! Each leaving his own individual circle, we are called by the remembrance of Himself into a circle of love -- divine love, expressed and responded to.
In keeping with this we may remark that the Lord's love expressed in the Supper is rather as that which He has shown to the church than as that known to us individually. Of course it is the same precious love; but to fully appreciate the beauty of this memorial, we must take into our thoughts the especial and peculiar love that Christ has for the church. It is true that we can each say, He "has loved *me* and given himself for *me*" (@Galatians 2: 20); but as gathered together, called by His request to remember Himself, it is His love to the church which is so strikingly before us. We are 'together collectively'.
It is instructive to note that the question of fellowship is introduced in the epistle to the Corinthians before the subject of the Supper is dealt with. We feel this is of the greatest moment; for it is necessary to be true to christian fellowship if we are to answer to the Lord's mind in partaking of the
{372}
Supper.
It is in no sense an individual act. Its very nature is opposed to the idea. It is a privilege which can only be enjoyed as accounting ourselves members of the body of Christ -- in the light, indeed, of the whole church of God. I ask the reader's serious consideration of this point. If we cannot answer to the call of the Lord through the Supper and "come together" in the light of the church of God as members of the body of Christ, we cannot rightly partake of the Supper at all.
The "one loaf" speaks of "one body" (@1 Corinthians 10: 16, 17). We may add that there cannot, therefore, scripturally be *two* companies of believers breaking bread in one locality unless in communion with one another. The two loaves would be a denial of each other. There is only one body of Christ, and hence there can be only one loaf. If as to fact there are two companies, and hence two loaves, we must have brought this about, and it is a very serious thing, for one of them is meaningless, if not a mockery.
We, being many, are *one* loaf, *one* body, says scripture. What a blessed unity.
The one loaf represents every member of the body of Christ. Oh! that they all heard the appeal, "This do". No less than the whole company is called, for the Supper is the normal occasion for the calling together of the church of God.
Taking the Supper is an act of fellowship. The failure of the present day is great, but let us not lose
{373}
sight of the true nature of the Lord's supper.
We hope to consider the subject of collective privileges in a future paper; but let it be clearly understood that if such privileges are past, then the privilege of the Lord's supper is past, for it is a collective privilege and not an individual one. If we assume to partake of the Supper individually it is our own supper and *not* the Lord's (@1 Corinthians 11: 21).
It is to be feared that the enemy would rob souls of the beauty and simplicity of this feast, or lead them to ignore it. It is primarily an act of responsive love; it is necessarily an act of fellowship.
Perhaps we need scarcely add that *it is not a sacrament* -- that is, it is not a means by which the participator receives anything through the mere partaking -- 'a means of grace', as it is sometimes called. To partake of the Supper rightly, the person must already be a member of the body of Christ; he must be a true believer, indwelt by the Holy Spirit. It is quite contrary to Scripture to speak of the Supper as that by which we receive life or grace from the Lord. It is not a question of receiving, but of answering to love already known. We remember Christ.
Needless to say *it is not a sacrifice*. Alas! that the enemy should have so deceived souls. Christ's sacrifice stands alone, making all other sacrifices for sin impossible, or a denial of His perfect one. And, too, it cannot in any sense be repeated, not in efficacy even the memorial of it: we commemorate what has been done and done once for all. Moreover, the bread and the cup remain just what they materially
{374}
are -- no change takes place in them, nor is there anything else but bread and wine there. It is the very simplicity of the feast that adds to its sweet character. We "eat this bread, and drink the cup" in remembrance of the Lord and thus show His death till He come.
We recall that long after Moses had made the serpent of brass it became an occasion of idolatry. Hezekiah observed this and destroyed it, calling it a piece of brass (@2 Kings 18: 4).
We believe Satan would do the same, indeed has done the same in some instances, with the simple feast of the Lord's supper. He is attracting attention to *it* and placing it between souls and the Lord. Alas! he has succeeded in making it an object of worship. We need not wonder if the Lord calls this sort of thing the "depths of Satan" (@Revelation 2: 24).
May the Lord revive in our souls the sense of His deep, deep love and adjust our thoughts and give each one of us greater intelligence and right ideas as to His supper. What an immense privilege it is! If rightly understood, and spiritually apprehended, it is, as it were, a doorway through which we may pass from what is material to what is spiritual -- into, indeed, the proper spiritual privileges of the assembly.
The Lord's supper answers in this respect to the type of crossing the Jordan (see @Joshua 3). The reader will recall that the twelve stones were set up in Jordan and a like number erected on the banks in the land of Canaan. In like manner in spirit we may
{375}
pass from what is merely outward and be led by Christ into the wondrous and blessed privileges of the assembly -- blessings which are wholly spiritual and which can only be known in the power of the Spirit and in association with Christ.

PRIESTLY DISCERNMENT
J. Taylor
J.T. ... The position of the levites is determined by the will of God, as is the position of the tribes (@Numbers 2). The Corinthians were making way for the clergy, by setting up local leaders; all were theirs. But then in @1 Corinthians 12, the gifts, whilst they belong to the saints, are regulated primarily by God. God *sets* them in the assembly (verse 28), which would imply that they are under restriction. They are not only under the hand of the Lord, but as set in the assembly they are surrounded by spiritual intelligence.
M.W.B. Would that be the priestly influence that would regulate their service?
J.T. Well, exactly; so that in @1 Corinthians 14 we have formal allusion to the service of the levites; they come in for the judgment of those who hear: "let the others judge" (verse 29).
M.W.B. Is that what you referred to as the sensibilities of Christ in the saints?
J.T. I am thinking of that, of the great need for discernment in regard to what is ministered, so that we have not only what may be literally correct, but the *spirit* of truth ...
H.H. In @Malachi 2: 7, it says, "For the priest's
{376}
lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts". It is responsibility.
J.T. That fits in with the second part of Numbers, the priesthood being asserted at the end, in its bearing towards the people; they "keep knowledge". All was really in the custody of the priests, the law, etc. Viewed as priests, we are trustworthy; that is, God entrusts us with things, and that saves us from the clerical element.
P.L. Would this critical faculty appear in the way the inward parts of the sacrifices were treated by the priests?
J.T. I think that is right: "truth in the inward parts" (@Psalm 51: 6). If we have truth in the inward parts it will come out in what we say.
Ques. Does this mean that the responsibility for the truth rests on the priests and not on the levites directly?
J.T. Of course the levite is responsible, but final responsibility would rest on the priests. They are the custodians of it. They keep knowledge, and the law is heard at their mouth. That is what is emphasised in Malachi; and hence the need for cultivating priestly sensibilities and discernment, so that we may judge rightly of things.
What I notice is that one's casual judgment is exceedingly unreliable. One goes to a meeting and hears an address, and is casual and not critical; (I do not use the word 'critical' as being objectionable but in the sense of judging) -- and something is said that is new, and it strikes him. Well, he is not critical and
{377}
goes away with the thought of a novelty -- something that is particularly striking, but which may not be just the truth; whereas if a man is critical, in all probability he will discern what is right. I mean that the judgment of the saints is reliable if their attention is specially called to the thing to be judged; if something is put to them specifically it is almost a certainty that we will get a right judgment from the brethren; if not immediately, certainly in time. But if we remain in a casual attitude towards what is ministered, what is new is apt to strike us, what we have not heard before, and if we fail in having this critical spirit, we shall perhaps carry away and accredit something erroneous.
There is much being ministered, and the Lord would call into action the priestly *discernment*, not now the service towards God in the assembly, but what Numbers contemplates, the priest's relation to the levites, so that there should be nothing but what is in keeping with the Spirit of truth. The Spirit ungrieved in the believer is sure to teach him; He will not be quiescent if things are not right; and so the more sensitive we are, the more likely we shall be to discern.
C.H.W. Would you say the apostle lays the onus of this on the saints in Thessalonica? "Do not lightly esteem prophecies; but prove all things, hold fast the right" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 20 - 22).
J.T. Yes, that is an excellent confirmation of what we are saying. "Do not lightly esteem prophecies" would mean that we ought to listen to every brother, even although he may not be of
{378}
special repute; for how are we to get the latent ministry amongst us save as we give opportunity to the younger men to speak? But then, "prove all things, hold fast the right", is the guarantee for the preservation of the truth amongst us.
J.O. S. John recommended Gaius for holding fast the truth.
J.T. Very good. He was a true priest.

DESPOTISM AND UNION
J. N. Darby
@Genesis 10 and 11 give us the enumeration of all the families of the earth, and their divisions. We find therein two great principles which characterise the natural energy of the human heart in doing its own will, viz., the spirit of despotism, and the spirit of association.
Nimrod, the first example of individual supremacy, begins to be mighty in the earth (@Genesis 10: 8). Nebuchadnezzar, the first chief among the four monarchies, exercises by a strong will dominion over his fellow men. On the other hand man does not like to be governed, and he associates himself with others in order to make himself entirely independent of God. Associated with others, he thinks himself capable of everything. 'Union', he says, 'is strength'. And this is true until God intervenes. Men associate together to make themselves a name upon earth; that is the spirit of association. But, when God had scattered men,
{379}
Nimrod took possession of all they had done. The beginning of his kingdom was Babel (@Genesis 10: 10). God recognises (@Genesis 11: 6) the power of the principle of association; but this is the proper principle of Babylon. Man will associate, and, by his own will united to that of others, get some reputation. This spirit of union has no other object than man's glory.
For the church there is true unity -- "one body and one Spirit" (@Ephesians 4: 4). This unity has the Holy Spirit as the power of life, and Christ as the centre of all. Christianity alone could give great force to individuality and to conscience, and at the same time unite men under the direction of Christ towards one centre, which is Christ. This could only be possible by the Holy Spirit, which takes away selfishness, while it gives power to the conscience; giving, by faith, an object to the heart outside of itself -- an object which acts on the individual conscience, and unites us all through one predominant affection to one centre of affection, by one life, and one only power of the Spirit.
The unity of Babylon is of quite another nature. It tends to the glory of man, who desires to gather men around one system, which the wisdom and the prudence of man have invented. Babylon will always have a chief. After God had scattered Babel, one man took into his own possession all those scattered wills, united them under his own will, and made them obey. Under the two forms of association and of despotism, it is man who will make himself a
{380}
name. Conscience is not exercised; there is neither root nor fruit. Conscience does not admit of anything between God and itself. All that man can do, as an instrument, is to put the conscience or the heart in relationship with God. During a long period the spirit of this false Babylonish unity has been outwardly religious; it is none the less for all that the spirit of Babylon.
The spirit of association is very powerful in these times. Commercial association governs everything, and a desire for union is everywhere proclaimed. Man will succeed in a wonderful manner; but all this will only end in the confusion of the will of man, and in his submission to Antichrist, as the last chief. The remedy to all this is conscience. The Holy Spirit acts as the spirit of union in the children of God: but conscience cannot be in society and reject its own individual responsibility. It is individual: otherwise God could not be the Master of conscience. The Holy Spirit directs it towards Jesus. If we will avoid the principles of evil, it must be through conscience; there is no other way. Through it we are rendered wise concerning that which is good and simple concerning evil. The Christian who acts from conscience will avoid a thousand snares of which he is not at all aware.
