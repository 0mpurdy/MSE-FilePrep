THE FIDELITY OF THE LOVE OF CHRIST
J B CATTERALL
@Luke 22: 7 - 23; @John 13: 1 - 17; @John 20: 14 - 18; @John 21: 15 - 19
I desire, at this time, that the Lord may give us help together to speak of the fidelity of the love of Christ. I think we must feel that in regard of the love of Christ we touch a theme of peculiar blessedness and sweetness. At the same time, we cannot consider the subject without also feeling that we are drawing near to that which, with all its sweetness, must inevitably be very searching to our hearts. I shall take a human illustration in a simple way. I might say that in regard of human affection, where there is a pure tie between souls, there will always be the desire that the expression of it should be heard and understood. One thing that marks the love of Christ, beloved, is its intensely plain speaking, and that touches us in many ways. But in whatever way it may touch our spirits, it always has the great end in view of its own satisfaction, and connected with that, the satisfaction of the Father's heart.
It was the plain speaking and inquiry of the love of Christ that tested the spirit of Peter so intensely. Even in the ways of the Lord with ourselves, and I touch on it with all affection, we may find the Lord speaking very plainly to us. We may be, for various reasons, inclined to interpret His speaking to us thus more on the line of His lordship, than of His affection and care for us. Often times the Lord may speak plainly to us, and it is of all moment to us that we should hear. But there is danger lest we might too
{2}
readily interpret the Lord's plain speaking as only bearing on matters that would show our contrariety to His mind, and the fact that they were out of line with His own pleasure and rights as Lord. But there are times when the Lord speaks with intense plainness, when, if we knew the truth, we should know it was not so much that He was drawing attention to existing wrongs, as to the fact that even on the line of rectitude, there may be a lack of intensity and warmth of affection to Himself.
It is insufferable to the heart of Christ that there should be remoteness -- distance -- on our part. We may incline to it, but the longer we remain there, the more accustomed to it we become, and the more disinclined to leave it, but the love of Christ will not endure distance. The institution of the Supper, the service of feet-washing, the service and care of the Lord immediately on His resurrection, in regard of Mary Magdalene particularly, and the dealings of the Lord with Peter at the close of His pathway here, are the plain speaking of the love of Christ that will not endure remoteness. I know of nothing that one becomes so accustomed to, with all one's knowledge of the truth, as the tendency to live in heart at a distance from the Lord. To know the things that are His pleasure and interest, to know the things that are changelessly dear to Himself, and yet, as to our personal links with Him, to be remote, could never satisfy His heart.
I should like to go over with you, as the Lord may help us, the movements of the love of Christ, as indicated in the scriptures referred to. As the Lord drew near to the close of His pathway, with His own outlook before Him -- death, and what death meant to Him -- and to the great end
{3}
that was to be the final and culminating testimony of His love to the Father, and His love to, and interest in, His own -- one is deeply impressed with the way in which the Lord moved as to the passover and the Supper. I do not know that I should be justified in taking for granted that every soul here distinguishes between these, but I think it might suffice if I say this in passing, that while we need the passover and the Supper, and each has its place, nevertheless, when we have distinguished between the two, we might lack the consideration of exercised affection for the Lord, that looks into the matter to see what bearing one has on the other. When we come together on the first day of the week, to answer to the Lord's desire as the One who laid down His life for us, we would surely, if ordered aright, come together in moral conditions that have been produced by the keeping of the feast together. Is there in our hearts a sufficient recognition of the fact, that when we come together to answer to the Lord in the Supper, we do not come together to create conditions, but to answer to the Lord in the power of conditions present with us? In whatever way we may order or regard the occasion, we may rest assured of this, that there is that in the Supper which touches our spirits in a peculiarly tender, and searching way. In many ways we have been tested, when we have come to take the Supper, and have been made to feel, more than in any other way, how searching was the scrutiny of the love of Christ. But it was not instituted that we might be searched, or made to feel the remissness of our affection for the Lord. It was instituted that what is due to the Lord Himself, in response to His great and precious
{4}
love, might be presented to Himself, the worthy Object of it all.
I draw your attention for a moment to the necessity with the saints at Corinth, that the apostle should recall their attention particularly to the passover at the outset of his epistle. He says, "our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (@1 Corinthians 5: 7). Was there ever such a Passover? Paul does not bring it to bear upon them simply to make a distinction between it and the Supper, but in order that their hearts might be freshly exercised as to the bearing of the feast on themselves. He says, "So that let us celebrate the feast ... with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (verse 8). Whether in respect of the Lord Himself, or in respect of one another, as bound up together with the Lord and His interests, may we be exercised that in all our goings, in all our thoughts of the saints in secret, or when together, and in our prayers for those who are precious to the Lord, that all might be maintained with us in sincerity and truth, for there is nothing that so leads souls astray from the line that pleases the Lord as the lack of these. Individuals, even souls together, may make mistakes or be diverted, but the Lord places great value on sincerity of heart.
Sincerity, in its simple meaning is this, that if I *say* I am going a certain way, then I go that way. If I *say* I am seeking certain things (the Lord sees my heart), then I seek these things. The Lord knows I may slip and fail in my footsteps, but sincerity and truth imply that what the lips say, the heart really knows to be true. It is not a matter of saying we love the Lord more than we do, or the brethren more than we do. Sincerity and truth are that we love them
{5}
more than we can tell. May we keep the feast together! What will hold us together will be sincerity and truth.
I believe that when we come together to the Supper to answer to the Lord, even though there may be a sense of the need of the Lord's present grace, in regard of temporal things and needs, yet He, blessed be His name, gives the grace not only to rise above that, but also that an answer may be provided in simple response to His precious love. One wishes to speak simply of the Supper as that which marks the great love of the heart of Christ. What a serious thing it would be for our hearts if ever there came a time with us, when the Supper became common! Every heart can answer for itself whether there be any such tendency with it. It should ever have in our hearts the greatness of the place that the love of Christ has given it. Not a place as an ecclesiastical centre, not a thing which is the centre of one ecclesiastical setting, or another, but that which is the most precious and most searching of all things. For it raises a constant question with us as to whether our hearts are right with the Lord, as His heart is with ours. The question raised by the love of Christ is; where our hearts are. You may remember the Old Testament incident to which I refer. "Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?" (@2 Kings 10: 15). This question was asked by one who was not omniscient, but who would fain know how he was regarded by another.
The Lord knows our hearts omnisciently, nevertheless in the Supper there is a constant appeal to our affections, and the nature of the appeal is this, Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours? There will never be any change in the heart of Christ; His love is the same as when He laid
{6}
down His life for us. Well-known ground as the subject is, I trust that no heart here has the impression that it has become at all common ground. It never will be that to the heart of Christ, and may He grant it may never become so to us. If it become common to us, the thing that the Lord most sought in the institution of it will be that which we lack -- a clear, simple, true, and affectionate answer to the Lord Himself, for His own sake. He instituted the Supper, it was His own movement.
The hour of the passover had drawn near, and there is an inquiry on the part of the disciples as to the keeping of it, but the institution of the Supper came in distinctly outside the inquiry of the disciples, it came from the Lord Himself. It was not their request, or desire, that initiated it. Who could have taken them off the ground of the passover, bound up with their affections as it was, but the Lord Himself? Sweetly, the Lord served them in taking their hearts outside of Judaism and all connected with it. The truth as we know it will make us free. "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" (@John 8: 36). The Lord knew what those disciples needed in regard of Judaism, and He took their hearts with Himself on to new ground in the institution of the Supper. I connect the two morally. What the Lord used for the institution of the Supper was provided for the commemoration of the passover -- the bread and the wine. The bread and the cup speak to us of the body and blood of Christ. The cup speaks of the love of God. But I am speaking on this occasion of the Supper, not only as the Lord's provision, but of the conditions which the Lord would have on our side in fidelity to Him.
{7}
If we have affection, what is the character of it? Is it that which stands in the power of its knowledge? For a moment I would attempt to make this distinction, that the Lord's appeal is not best answered to by those who know most, but by those who love most. Then, you say at once, that must mean of course by those who have been a long time on the way. No, it does not mean that, but it is really given by hearts to whom the Lord in His own Person is more than anything else, any one else, time, place, or circumstance. It is hearts that love the Lord for His own sake, and respond to Him out of the sense of His own love, that please the Lord best in the Supper.
You may say any one might presume out of their knowledge. There is nothing like love for keeping people quiet. I do not know if you have tried it. I may be thinking of restless people, but there is nothing like love for keeping people quiet, for there is nothing like love so simple and easy to understand. In the presence of the love of Christ, when it lays hold of your soul and impresses your spirit, how much do you want to say? If you were speaking to *my* soul, which might be a little empty, I could understand your feeling much and saying it too. But in the presence of the love of Christ there oftentimes comes to us a sense that the most we can say may be said in the fewest words. We have nothing to tell the Lord about the Supper. Infinite has been the patience of the Lord in what He has told us about it, and in the ministry of the Holy Spirit, touching our hearts and bringing before us the great, precious, changeless, love of Christ, and the love of God the Father.
{8}
The more the love of Christ settles upon our spirits individually, or when together, the deeper is the sense our hearts have of the peace, the rest, of the love of Christ. Then we do not say things to the Lord on the line of description, but our hearts move only on the line of response, and thus we respond with a deep sense of the way we are indebted to the love of Christ. He instituted the Supper from His own side; it was not the suggestion of the disciples; the Lord knew they could not be without it. As one goes on, one feels more and more thankful that the time between the occasions of breaking bread, are just what they are and no more. I do not speak as if the Supper was a place of refuge; for the more we taste of the love of Christ as it is conveyed to us then, the more thankful our hearts become that the space between one occasion and the next is no longer than it is.
I come now to the service of feet-washing, as connected with the love of Christ. It was not done by the desire of His disciples. It stands on the same ground as the Supper in this respect, that it was the Lord's institution, and as much above the understanding of the disciples, on their side, as above their desire. We know much about it. Were I to make a slip tonight and seem to confuse between the Lord's feet-washing service, and His advocacy, I can understand even a young soul saying, 'You are confusing these things'. Though I saw the distinction many years ago, I did not learn till long after, what the preciousness of the love of Christ was in this particular form of service. We want the things themselves. Here we see the love of Christ moving -- the same love that instituted the Supper. I would not say we come to the Supper to get our feet
{9}
washed. But I believe that often and often, when we have come there we have proved in a most blessed way the manner in which the Lord touched our spirits and washed our feet -- removing from our souls, not only defilement, but the sense of encumbrances and weights, and thus enabling our souls to move freely to the Lord, with a fresh touch of the love of Christ that did it. Many things might press upon us -- the care of the household, physical conditions, weariness of body, the effect of surroundings; these things might be on the spirit in coming together. God in His great wisdom made man a creature of peculiar sensitivity. Before he sinned, I believe his sensibilities were keen, but they became blunted by distance from God and by sin. They may again become sensitive however, as a consequence of grace having reached us. Even when we are coming together to meet the Lord, we may pass by surroundings, and places, and conditions, that touch our spirits and fain would leave a shadow. You may say, Need I be so? Would it not be better if I did not feel them? No, it would not be better if you did not feel them. But it would be better if, feeling them, you knew the intensity of the grace, and the love of Christ, that would serve you in regard of them. Do not get away from the feeling, it might mean more insensibility than piety.
I wish now to say a word to the young, that has been impressed on my spirit by reason of certain experiences of the last few days. Possibly you pass places you have been accustomed to enter, that you could not enter now, because you love the Lord and belong to Him. But you pass the place and you look at it and say, I am glad I do not go there: I know better now. But is that safety? Is your
{10}
preservation from the things you used to serve and follow, wrapped up in your knowledge? No, it is not. Your safeguard is in the fidelity of the love of Christ. You are not safe, unless these things touch your spirit with a sense of pain, which turns you to the Lord, for you are depending then on the ministry of the Lord's grace to your spirit.
The Lord instituted the service of feet-washing, knowing that His hour was come to depart out of the world, knowing too that He was come from God and went to God, and that the Father had given all things into His hand. The widest possible outlook as to the divine dispensation was before the Lord, and He knew it all. All the inward certainty, and peace, and steadfastness of the Lord's own Spirit -- if I may speak of it in that way -- was in God the Father, and in the great desire and interest of His own love, He turns to His own circle, and institutes the service of feet-washing. What were His brethren to Him? A sort of second-best? Just something given Him, because He had lost Israel? No, that is not the love of Christ. His is a love that holds the assembly as the first, and sweetest, and best thing -- the treasure that is meet for His own heart and the answer to His own affection, and the gift, too, of the Father. "They were thine, and thou gavest them me" (@John 17: 6), and of all of them I have not lost even one. How He holds His own! He holds the best thing first; that which the Father would have for the Son, what the heart of the blessed God would give to Christ (I speak of it reverently), -- the best thing first. He has given Him the assembly.
{11}
With that upon His heart, the Lord instituted the service of feet-washing. He inaugurated it above the desire, above the findings of the disciples¬ feelings. He presented it to them in its desirability, and in its dignity. Actually it was the service of the slave of the house, a menial service in man's ordering. What is its dignity? The dignity of it is that the Son of the Father, the Son of God, the Lover of His own has instituted it. He did the service first. Will that ever become common to us, brethren? Shall we satisfy our hearts with the understanding of the doctrine, or do we value it in its own value as the thing Christ did first? He did it first, and as He did it must be its character to the end.
He laid aside His garments. It was His own act, done in His own dignity and in the peculiar greatness of His own Person. Then He took a linen towel and girded Himself. It speaks of the righteousness, lowliness, tenderness, and fidelity of His own affection. He took water, poured it into a basin, and began to wash the feet of His disciples. He *commenced* to do it -- notice the word. That was its inauguration. We cannot go into details now, though the more we ponder them the more precious they will become to our hearts. Look at the circle! I do not know how far round in the circle Peter was, but, in due course, the Lord came to him, and when He came to him, Peter spoke. He had had ample opportunity to consider the matter, but even when the Lord came to him he had not overcome his difficulty about it.
Those who do not know what feet-washing is, seldom continue. You say, What do you mean? Well, the sweetest thing that comes to us amongst the saints is the outcome of
{12}
the understanding of the love of divine Persons. When you get the sense that a thing that has come to you from another is for the sake of Christ, it washes your feet. You neither misunderstand the motive of the person who may be the instrument of it, nor do you misunderstand it on any false line of your deserving it or otherwise. But if the impression conveyed to your spirit, is the impression of the love of Christ, your feet are washed.
How the things that are temporal drop away in the presence of the love of Christ. Preference for persons, difference of circumstances, and many other things, how they all drop out in the presence of the activities of the love of Christ, in the circle of His own. You get a touch from a brother. You may think at times, Well, I wonder if I should be much profited by knowing that brother; perhaps he does not look attractive externally. How often we are surprised by the fact that, from a vessel that on its exterior does not promise much, there may have been much in it to wash our feet -- it was there for *Christ's* sake. Our difficulty may have been rather this, that what was there was not only for our sake, but for His. Brethren, what washes our feet is first and most precious of all, for Christ's sake. It must be so if He is above all others. Everything that makes much of Christ, washes the saints¬ feet. Peace and comfort flow from it.
May I say a word as to Peter, in regard of continuance? What Peter trusted in was his own strength. In the things of God? Yes, he trusted himself. He said, Though all should be offended, yet will not I. He found himself out of touch with the Lord in feet-washing. If Peter had taken to heart the fact that the Lord had to expose to
{13}
him that his own feeling was out of accord with Himself; if he had borne on his spirit that tender word of the Lord in regard of feet-washing; might he not have been spared the rest? If I am not minded to accept feet-washing, am I on a line on which I can have the Lord's support?
This is the first touch in John's gospel that shows us that Peter was not in accord with the Lord's feelings, and a peculiarly serious one it is; as if the Lord said to him, Peter, the thing that matters most to Me is the thing you do not understand. If he had taken to heart the Lord's word, may we not legitimately suggest he might have been saved the rest? Howbeit, he reached by discipline what the Lord would have brought him into by feet-washing. Such is the fidelity of the love of Christ. I speak from experience, which has taught me this. There are many things I may have reached by discipline, that I might have reached by feet-washing, but it is the fidelity of the love of Christ that has brought me there in the end.
In regard of the Supper, our gatherings from time to time are so variable, in what I might call their spiritual quality, that we often raise a question as to conditions from the moral point of view, but may I suggest this? If we washed one another's feet more, our answer to the Lord in the Supper might be more decided and sweet than it is, and I believe too that our power to worship would be greatly enlarged in us.
In regard of Mary, we see the unchangeableness and faithfulness of the love of Christ. I see the Lord, not only in the sense of His suffering, and superior to it in the greatness of His love, but I see the Lord again, the living One out of death, alive for evermore, having the keys of
{14}
death and hades -- as He speaks in @Revelation 1: 17, 18, "*I* am ... the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages". Ah, you say, that is a great guarantee of the fact that He will unlock the situation at the rapture. It is a sweet guarantee of the fact, brethren, that He can unlock it now. He took the affections of Mary on to entirely new ground; rapture affections, in the principle of them, are affections that are engaged with the Lord in an entirely new place. He said to Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17). Before the affections of Mary were in touch with the brethren, in the power of the Lord's word, they travelled to a new place. It was the power of the ministry of the Lord to Mary, that took her affections from earthly hopes, even in Himself, and anticipatively carried them to the place with which the declaration was connected: "My Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
Now He says, "Go to my brethren". She went and told them. It was the fidelity of the love of Christ, securing a heart in the power of affection, connected not only with the lordship of Christ, but sweetly and divinely connected with the Lord Himself -- the Object of the Father's pleasure. The Firstborn amongst many brethren, yea, I think we might say, as the Head of the assembly, His body, "the fulness of him who fills all in all" (@Ephesians 1: 23). Her affections went to the new place, and they went there to stay there.
I do not wish to be mystical, but I think no one can give you so much practical help in your difficulties, as a
{15}
person who is connected with heaven. God solves time's difficulties for eternity. The person whose heart is where Christ is, is not necessarily an impractical sort of person. You will find far more help in your difficulties from a man whose heart is in heaven, because he brings in the light of God's presence on them, and not the accumulated knowledge of man.
I close with one word more. The Lord spoke thrice to Peter. It was in the presence of the brethren He spoke. I would draw your attention to this, because it may touch our spirits without leaving any undue shadow on our minds, that the reason for His plain speaking these three times to Peter was to draw out in tender expression to Himself the character and the quality of the love of Peter. He did not ask Peter if he believed. Look at the tender movement of priestly care and shepherding that reached Peter! That must have been a tender proof to the heart of Peter of how much the Lord loved him. Nevertheless, three times He spoke, "Lovest thou me?" At last Peter was grieved because the Lord said to him the third time, "Lovest thou me?" and he said, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee". Brethren, that is what the Lord is seeking. Then He says to Peter, "Feed my sheep".
The object of the Lord's plain speaking to our hearts at this time may be, that as we are helped to answer to Himself in simple and deep feeling, He may entrust to us in a deeper way than before, the things that are most precious to His heart. May we covet these things.

FOLLOWING CHRIST
J B CATTERALL
@Luke 9: 37 - 52
My desire, as the Lord may help me, is to speak to you of what is involved in following the Lord. The thought of following the Lord must present a very great attraction to every one of us, and I think, too, that the young, whose hearts have been drawn out after Him, must also have some sense of the gravity of such a path. I would say at the outset that it is not a way that will be found easy naturally. The energy of nature, or even the strength that the knowledge of divine things as information can give, will not carry us through. It is a way in which we must find the help of the Lord, if we are to be walking in it for His pleasure, in fidelity, and in spiritual affection. I hope that I may be able to encourage your hearts before Him, as to what it is to Him for us to be found in that way, and to have before us the preciousness and value of following the Lord; and not only what it is to us, bringing light, and comfort, and preservation of mind and spirit, but what it is to Himself, bringing joy and comfort to His heart.
At this juncture I shall refer to a very peculiar and sweet word employed by the psalmist at a time of very great pressure, through the attitude of men in their wickedness towards him. Speaking in the Spirit of Christ, and as a type of Him, he appeals to Jehovah and says, "The assembly of the violent seek after my soul". Then he lifts up his heart to Jehovah and says, "Shew me a token
{18}
for good, that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed" (@Psalm 86: 14, 17). I would impress upon our hearts that in the path of following Christ, we are God's token for good to Christ. We have been given by God to Him, not only that we may be associated with Him in that scene into which He has entered, but that we might come out in the spirit and character of Christ here. So that in that sense we have been given by God as a token for good to Christ. If we view for a moment the light that has come to us in these broken days of departure from the truth, it is of very great moment to realise that we have been given it for Christ's sake, not because of faithfulness in us. We have been given it in the faithfulness of God, that we might come out as God's token for good to Christ, that His enemies might be ashamed.
Now that precious thought is presented in the gospels as applying to us. In Matthew, in connection with the kingdom; in Mark, as connected with the holiness and service of God; in Luke, in regard to the testimony of divine grace; and in John, as connected with the fellowship of God according to the truth. In every case we come out as God's token for good to Christ, that His enemies might be ashamed.
I desire to raise the question in our souls as to the truth as it is known in Christ personally. The very knowledge of the truth that we possess, if we be unwatchful, may come between our hearts and the person of Christ, who is the expression of it. We may become accustomed to what exists in the company of those with whom we walk. What is clear and concise in the knowledge of the truth is our very heritage, but there is the possibility and the danger of
{19}
dissociating it from the person of Christ, in receiving whom we have received all. Every one of us is being formed in soul history in relation to God. I do not speak of our public and known history amongst the people of God, but of soul history in regard to God's things. Let me ask you how far in regard to your apprehension of the Supper, has there been consecutive steps in soul history with God? How easy it is to regard our comings together as that which has to be formally sustained, comings together that may stand upon custom, rather than upon affection! So one would raise the inquiry as to how far, as we gather together from time to time, from the least to the greatest of us, are we working out our true soul history in regard of the things of God, and spiritually and livingly following Christ.
The connection that scriptures in Luke's gospel have with the thought of following Christ, may not be immediately apparent to you, but in various aspects it opens out with the view that is seen of the glory of Christ on the mount of transfiguration. The Lord, in His own movement, takes His disciples aside from their position here, as connected with the testimony, and as the Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He takes them with Himself to the mountain apart, and while He is in prayer, as recorded in this gospel, He is transfigured. The sight of the blessed Lord in that attitude is deeply touching, and to see the glory of God, in the person of Jesus, roll in as the answer to His prayer, is very affecting. It is not the majesty of His Person that we see here, it is His moral glory as the Man who has come to do the will of God.
{20}
We have in that one blessed Person the answer to every yearning of faith, and to every spiritual desire in the Old Testament dispensation; and the answer to every utterance of the Holy Spirit, "for the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus" (@Revelation 19: 10). The glory that shines there is the glory of the Man Christ Jesus, the One whose "visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the children of men" (@Isaiah 52: 14). The One of whom the Spirit of God records the sufferings, through which the glory of God would be brought to pass abidingly. You will recall the word He spoke to two of His own who, discouraged by His sufferings, were turning away from the path of the testimony. He appeared to them on the way to Emmaus, searching their hearts and said, "O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?" (@Luke 24: 25, 26). Thus the glory of Luke's gospel, is the glory that is at the end of suffering: "If indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him" (@Romans 8: 17). The beloved apostle, writing to the Philippians, said, "Because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also" (@Philippians 1: 29). The path of suffering is that into which we have been called, and we have not been called there because of any superiority on our part, but by the sovereignty of the love of God, and by the measureless power of His grace. We have been called to it, not that we may shine in any way peculiar to ourselves, but that we might come out in the mind, and spirit, and character of Christ. I do not wish to discourage, but it is possible to have a very great amount of light, and
{21}
be very clear in our minds as to divine truth, and yet not be following Christ. It is a very serious matter to be in the circle where faith, and separateness of heart are maintained for us, and yet not to be really following the One who by His faithfulness was the Originator of it.
You will observe in this chapter that as the Lord comes down from the mount of transfiguration, a condition of things is discovered which had crept in by reason of the fact that Jehovah, as an Object, had been lost to His people Israel. I apply this in principle to ourselves. There are many of us, young in years and young in faith, and many who are older too, and we are following in one path together, having one blessed and peerless Object. But let us consider together whether we are at this present moment in our soul history in the light of the truth "according as the truth is in Jesus" (@Ephesians 4: 21). Does that blessed Person hold our hearts as He should do? Is He nearer to us in a spiritual way than ever? Or are we in the spirit of our minds, while perhaps adding to our knowledge, less in nearness to His Person than we have experienced formerly? I have been greatly impressed by this fact, how possible it is to be adding to our intelligence, and yet to be drifting from His own Person. How possible it is to be adding to our store of knowledge, and yet not growing by the true knowledge of God. As we view these possibilities it moves our spirits to exercise.
As the Lord descended from the mount there was brought to Him by one of the multitude, his child possessed of an unclean spirit, or as Matthew describes it, he was lunatic. It is very striking that that statement follows immediately upon the manifestation of the Lord's
{22}
glory on the mount, where He is seen in His majesty, His face shining as the sun. Evidently the condition of things that had supervened was the result of the glory of His Person having been lost sight of. But in Luke's account it is spoken of as an unclean spirit: the blessed Lord speaks of it in that way. It is a spirit that is the result of a gradual process of drifting away from the glory of God in a living Person. Bear with me in a word to my younger brethren. Although you may be indwelt by the Holy Spirit, unless you are sustained in nearness to the Lord, you will become marked by another spirit. Being indwelt by the Holy Spirit does not relieve us of the need of prayer for a supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ; nor does it preserve us from the need of exercise, lest we should be affected by another spirit.
The Spirit of God has been given to us, and His normal ministry is that our hearts may be held livingly, directly, and dependently in nearness to the Lord Himself. So the condition of things which the Lord found in coming down from the mount, had come in typically by reason of the Lord in His glory having been lost sight of. Now, figuratively, in place of the power of the Holy Spirit, there was another spirit that affected the mind and character, and controlled the succeeding generation. If we, who are going before others, do not manifest unquestionable proofs of walking with a living Lord, we are leaving a door open to a contrary spirit in the next generation.
Well, the Lord meets this condition in His own power. He casts out the spirit, which was a spirit of bondage, cowardice, and fear, a spirit that may gradually possess our hearts, unless we are kept by the Lord. Then we have in a
{23}
very precious way this suggestion as to following the Lord.
If we were asked by the Lord Himself, what we wanted most in the assembly, what should we say? Some might say, I should like to preach; others might like to teach; some, perhaps, would like to be wise; while others might desire to be available to the saints in whatever service opened to them. The greatest thing open to us in the assembly of God's people is to be *like Christ*. But there arose a reasoning among the disciples as to who should be the greatest. The power manifested by the Lord undoubtedly underlay their inquiry and reasonings. He, knowing their hearts, took a little child and set it in their midst, as an expression of what He loved best -- the thing that was nearest to His own desires, the subject of His most tender approval. Would any one accustomed to man's ways have expected a way like this, and a word like this? But if their hearts had carried forward the lesson of the glory on the mount of transfiguration, what else could they have expected but that the Lord would take a way that was entirely His own! Man in his greatness, and wisdom, and knowledge is set aside entirely; whereas one who has seen the glory on the mount will never desire to figure anywhere in the assembly, but in the way that Christ loves, and of which He approves.
The fact is, the line of following Christ begins in the assembly. My dear young friends, you will find that the Lord will gently lead and direct your hearts to this point -- to the assembly, as the place where you are most tested by the mind and Spirit of Christ. If I am in the world -- the world that is against Christ and the testimony -- and its
{24}
conduct comes out in a flagrant form, I may present a moral contrast, and I may set upon myself a mistaken value for that reason. But when I come to the assembly where, normally, the Spirit of Christ rules, I am tested by what is according to Christ, not by what is contrary to Him. If the world speaks against Christ, any little syllable of mine for Him is great. In a sense, it stands out great by its contrast, but in the assembly I am tested as to whether I am near Christ or not.
It is where the Lord is enjoyed that our greatest tests are found. The Lord took that little child and put him in the midst. Can we follow Christ in that? It is one thing to follow Him in the world, where there is such contrariety, but come to the centre and look at the position which is Christ's own -- for where else are His joys, His possessions, but in the assembly of His people? In the midst of this company He sets a little child and challenges their hearts, as if to say, This is the starting-point, can you follow Me in this? Can we follow Him in it? Set together in our various localities, as we are under the Lord's hand, can we follow Him in this? What men love is one thing, what the Lord loves is another. He did not wait until we were like Himself, before He loved us and died for us. It was when we were totally unlike Himself. Yes, we have to do with a loving Lord. What His heart is set upon is that we should follow Him, and learn what it is to be set up here in the power, fragrance and wisdom of His own Spirit, so that we may be found in our little companies following Christ. We should therefore be prepared, in relation to one another, to take the lowest place possible, in order that the pleasure of God may be assured. Anything
{25}
else militates against it. If I have gift before me unduly, I put gift before others; if service, service. If I have Christ before me as the living, loving object of my soul, I shall put Christ before myself and before everything else.
In this same incident, according to Matthew, the Lord calls the attention of the disciples to the fact that unless they be converted, and become as little children, they cannot *see* the kingdom of God, let alone have greatness in it! That does not mean a person is not the Lord's. It means that in regard to the Lord's own circle, in nearness to Himself as having been converted, and become a little child, you are pursuing the kind of greatness which is greatness in His eye, and in the sight of God. There can be no other greatness. It is that upon which God had already set His approval when He said, "*This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him" (@Matthew 17: 5).
I come to another point -- one raised by John. Moving in the path in which the Lord had set them, the disciples encountered a man casting out demons in the Lord's name, who did not walk with them. We are surrounded with this, and this scripture is not only given as guidance in regard to it, but that we may be helped from pursuing that line. Will you bear with me in asking a question touching this? Have you ever felt inclined to use the power of the Lord apart from Himself? If we move in the light that God has given to us in these days, but apart from communion with Christ, what are we doing? We are using the power that has been given to us, without reference to the Person. But, you say, I am responsible to speak for the Lord wherever I am. Yes, you are the Lord's wherever you are. But have you ever felt yourself content to use your knowledge, as knowledge,
{26}
while in your heart of hearts you know you are not walking with the Lord? You say, You are guessing! No, I am not guessing. Then you say, You know me! No, I do not; but I know my own heart; I know what I have done, and I feel that this scripture is given to affect us so that we may be lowly, and in the mind of Christ.
Our business is to keep near to the Lord, to be in our minds and spirits free with Him, that He may use us, but not to seek the Lord's interference to justify our position ecclesiastically. In what we have from God, be it ever so much, if we are not following the Lord in it, what is it worth? Whatever I know if it be not held in my soul in relation to a living Lord, it is but religion. It may be a good brand of religion, but so far as its power and value go, it is but religion. May the Lord grant, in regard to what we have received from Him, that we may seek grace from Himself to test ourselves as to whether we are walking with the Lord as a living Person.
John was one of peculiar exercise, and I am glad that it was he who raised the question. He was the one who leaned on the bosom of Jesus, who asked the question, Lord, who is it? John is marked off in Scripture, as one who kept near to the Lord personally, and I can understand his difficulty. He was not merely seeking the Lord's guidance as to their relative positions; he was seeking the Lord's mind in this matter, for he could not understand how a person who could use the Lord's name, could do so without following that Person. If our hearts were rightly exercised, we should feel it to be an intolerable and unseemly thing, that we should move on the line of using knowledge without being near Christ. May God keep us!
{27}
But the Lord did not interfere. He said to John, Leave him alone. That was enough for John; if his Lord did not interfere, neither should he. Do not frown on anything, even though it be marked by a lack of knowledge, that seems to have little regard for Christ. If you cannot go with it, leave it alone. Our business is to follow the Lord in what we know. Have we not experienced it? I have. One has come into contact with souls who, in regard of knowledge, needed help, but in regard to the preciousness of Christ to them, they put one to shame. Let us follow this line as to being called after the Lord. It is a precious line, one in which there is testing for the spirit, one in which, however, there is great comfort, and realisation of our desires as they are found centred in the person of Christ.
But to pass on, the Lord speaks to His disciples as to the end before Him, not an end of greatness according to man, but of greatness according to God. He was going to Jerusalem, His face set stedfastly to go there, committed entirely to the will of God and His glory. As He moves in that way, a man comes to Him and says, "I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest, Lord". The Lord says, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head" (@Luke 9: 57, 58). The Lord pointed out to the man the character of the way. He never indicated to him the character of the end. We start on this way with a very great deal of impetus. We start with the impetus that grace gives, with the sense of relief that comes to our spirits by meeting the Lord Jesus; so we say to the Lord, There is no place where we would not follow thee. Why does the Lord leave the question of the end of the journey when speaking
{28}
to this man? To test his heart as to what Christ was worth to him. You say, I will not leave the testimony! But you will leave the testimony, if you leave the Lord. There is not a heart among us that can be trusted as to what might transpire tomorrow, if tomorrow finds us out of communion with the Lord. But, blessed be God! The testimony is independent of human resting-places -- holes or roosting-places -- but we have the blessed love of Christ. We are not expected to stand in the place of exposure, without that love holding our spirits; but so far as nature is concerned, and so far, too, as religious supports are concerned, are they sufficient without Christ? Oh, you say, I have been with the brethren from my early days, and my parents were with them before me! And so were mine, and in the mercy of God, through that provision, I knew what it was to find a resting-place. But I did not know its value, until those who cared for me took another road from mine, and, even though professedly following the same Lord, we had different roads.
God may use what is human in bringing light to our souls, but there is not one thing in God's system, which stands with natural heredity. In @John 9, we get a man's eyes opened by the power of the Son of God. Jesus having made mud and anointed his eyes, he went to Siloam (by interpretation 'sent'), and having washed came seeing. You remember what happened; the very day he saw the light for the first time, he had to turn his back on what he saw. Blessed be God, he had the light of another world in his soul, or it would have been too much to leave! He never saw the synagogue until the day that he was cast out of it for the Lord's sake. He never saw his father and
{29}
mother, until the day that they denied him! But he proved the truth of the words, "For had my father and my mother forsaken me, then had Jehovah taken me up" (@Psalm 27: 10). It is not of nature.
You give God thanks for the saints; you give Him thanks for the parents who loved Christ before it became yours to love Him, but you have to learn that the light of Christ in your own soul is the tie that binds you personally to Him. There is no room for natural heredity in the things of God. We do not know what happened to the man in @Luke 9. We have this word of the Lord to him, as to His having nowhere to lay His head. There are few men who can do without sleep for more than a few nights; but the simple meaning of the Lord's words is, Are you relying upon nature? Are you relying upon knowledge, that came to you through the instrumentality of nature, to follow the Lord whatever changes may take place, if He tarry?
Let us learn this together, that our power to continue in the testimony lies in being kept near the Lord. Where is the Lord with you tonight? It is not a question of what we did five, ten, or twenty years ago. Has the Lord moved since then? Oh, you may say, I am in the same room and in the same locality. Where is God's room and God's locality? Where is the Lord in matters, and where am I with Him? Am I as near the Lord? Is He a name to me, or a Person? Is it doctrine, or the truth in a living Person who died for my soul? He gave Himself for the church, and to accomplish the will of God -- the living, blessed Person of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. To follow Him, is not to follow a line, or a system; it is to follow all that is of God. The foxes have holes, the Lord says, and the birds of
{30}
the heaven roosting-places; it was just as much as to say, If you think you can follow Me, you will have to move in the path that I am in. Are you in it for Christ's sake? May the Lord grant that it be so. I do not know why the youngest lover of Christ here, may not step out confidently, lowlily, and dependently on a path even like this, having regard to the fact that the blessed person of Christ will be their object and support in it.
Now I come to another point; the Lord calls again. He says to another, "Follow me". This one answers Him, saying, "Lord, allow me to go first and bury my father". Then Jesus says to him, "Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, but do *thou* go and announce the kingdom of God" (@Luke 9: 59, 60). Things connected with our lives here, natural objects, live long with us. I once came in touch with a brother who seemed to be under a shadow. I inquired as to what was the cause. Well, he said, I have never got over the matter of a brother's defection some eighteen years ago. It had taken him eighteen years to bury his father, for it was the brother's father, and for eighteen years he had been under a shadow, because, looking back upon it, he thought that his father had not been rightly handled. It had taken him all those years to bury his father -- nor was he buried then. If we are not very careful, often what we think to be our rights, our own ways, and thoughts, will hinder us in the things of God. Is there any brother or sister here tonight, who feels that in their companying with the saints they have not been treated as they might have been? Is it not buried yet? Some one may say, 'Yes, but then you know it was wrong'. Well then, I say, for Christ's sake, make it a matter of sacrifice, not of
{31}
disappointment, but keep in the path of following Him. May we who feel that we have anything outstanding in our minds in connection with natural links, or of our own rights, seek grace of the Lord to bury it; for the sake of Him who is our Object in the path, the One who has died for us. Put it under ground, get it out of sight. It may cost you tears, but you will be able to enter into your relation with the saints happily, and without shadow to follow the Lord.
And now I come to the closing word. Another said to the Lord that he would follow Him, but wanted first to return to those who were at home. He wanted to save a rupture, and to preserve a reputation. He wanted to follow the Lord in a way that would carry an element of nature with it. He was not prepared quite, to set out in the reproach of Christ. He was carrying forward elements of danger, of going back. My friends, we need not stretch our imagination. Our history as brethren has proved it, that there have been things carried forward in times of crises, which have well nigh wrecked the saints and dishonoured the Lord. What is reputation in the things of God? Do you want to be reputed as a follower of the Lord Jesus?
You can leave your reputation; it will hinder you in the race. Your reputation lies before. Keep to the Lord's reputation, His honour, and yours will be all right. Make up your mind, as the Lord gives you grace, not to sully *His* name and yours will be cleared. Consider not your reputation now, it lies on before, and the day will declare it. No man can be a true lover of Christ, who tends to look back. "No one having laid his hand on the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God" (@Luke 9: 62).
{32}
Let me close with a word for all our hearts, especially those who are younger: that he who thinks to follow Christ, must see to it that he is not easily turned aside by a word, by a threat, or by an attraction. Such an one must keep his face in one direction only. I remember, as a boy in Scotland, watching what is not seen in these parts, a ploughing match. In ploughing matches they do not usually set the furrow where all the ground is seen; they contrive in setting the men to plough, that they shall finish their furrow perhaps over the hill, so that the end is not seen at the commencement. The man who ploughed the most straight furrow was the man who kept his eye upon one thing, and one thing only. He fixed his own mark, and never watched what his neighbours were doing, and you do the same. The greatest power that can be found amongst us in following Christ, is to be attached to Him with undivided affection. I do not get in your way, nor you in mine, if we are both following the Lord. May He help us, for His name's sake!

{33}
THE THREE GREAT FEASTS OF THE LORD AND THEIR SPIRITUAL IMPORT
J B CATTERALL
@Exodus 23: 14 - 19; @Deuteronomy 16: 1 - 22.
I desire to speak to you simply of what God's desires are in respect of His people, and one feels the need of special grace in doing so, in order to be preserved from presenting things merely on the line of intelligence or theory. It is often possible to be clear in one's mind as to certain ideas in christianity, but it is not one's clarity of mind that is so important, but the measure in which our affections are in spiritual exercise.
I read these scriptures so that we might dwell a little upon the love of Christ, the sufferings of Christ, and the way in which the Lord delights to take account of conditions amongst His people. It is interesting to consider how graciously God expresses Himself to His people in the Old Testament, when giving them communications, and how pleasurable it was in His sight that there should be response from them to Himself.
It is a very searching word for each of us -- that we have to beware that we do not present ourselves empty before God. We may be greatly concerned as to the importance of doing right things, and that our conduct should be blameless, without flaw, and yet we may appear before the Lord empty. I venture to say that the heart that loves Christ will never be found empty. Some may think that it is our want of intelligence that is the root of the
{34}
trouble. Instruction is provided for us, if we need that, but what lies at the root is that we are spiritually deficient. But the more the heart resides in the presence of the glory of Christ, the more do we grow in the appreciation of Himself, and we shall not then be empty.
In referring to these three feasts, one would desire to consider the way in which they are brought before us in these two scriptures. For the sake of the young, I would say that it is not with us a literal appearing before God three times in the year. Nor is it a matter of keeping actual feasts, whether the passover, the feast of weeks, or the feast of tabernacles. But it is a question of spiritual response. I want, therefore, in a simple way, to bring before you how there can be with us, in the power of the Holy Spirit, what answers to these feasts. The first, the passover, presents what is moral; the second, the feast of weeks, what is spiritual; and the third, the feast of tabernacles, what is divine.
The Holy Spirit has furnished for our spiritual instruction these definite lines of divine teaching, so that we might increase spiritually. As I said, it is not a matter of keeping actual feasts. In @1 Corinthians 5: 7, 8, we read, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth". If we are careless, or indifferent, in respect of the passover, it will result in our going back in spirit to what is in Egypt. The passover is kept in the wilderness. It was to be the means of preserving God's people. He would have the sense of what was connected with the passover ever kept before them.
{35}
During the whole course of the year, He would have them in continual remembrance of the month "Abib". We often say, I think it is time we got beyond that point; but I should pity the soul that gets beyond the passover. It was observed in the wilderness, and was God's means of preservation for the people from what was Egyptian and hostile to God. But it also had to be observed in the land. They were always to be solemnised in their spirits by the fact that their place in the land was entirely due to their having been covered in the passover.
In the epistle to the Colossians, the apostle presents to the saints at Colosse the wonderful outlook, presented on the heavenly side as risen with Christ. In doing so he reminds them of the fact that they had been reconciled to God "in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy and unblameable and irreproachable before it" (@Colossians 1: 22). That is the way the position was brought to bear upon the Colossians; it was presenting to their affections the sphere of things on the other side of the Jordan. He encourages them to pass over, but they could not be there on the line of the flesh, but as secured by the offering of the body of Christ.
It is very easy to get occupied with what is Egyptian. Often our associations, which are perhaps full of apparent value to us, are the hindrance. We feel we have not the power to free ourselves from them. That should be a most serious consideration for us. If we are desirous of being free from what is Egyptian, are our hearts tied or held by what is contrary to God's rest? When Moses, the leader of God's people, recounts the passage of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, he says they "removed from
{36}
Rameses" (@Numbers 33: 5). Moses had the opportunity of being the greatest Ramesian that Egypt had. If he, that chosen vessel of God, had made his position in the opposite direction to that which he did, he could have been the greatest head that Egypt ever had. Rameses denotes all that is great on the Egyptian line: and Moses measures their pathway from that point -- the place where the Egyptians buried their dead.
Many a heart has gone out of Egypt at the start, in the enthusiasm of evangelical conditions, and afterwards it has begun to feel that in leaving Egypt, it had left what was living instead of what is dead. Egypt is a giant burying-place; their occupation that of burying their dead. What a solemn sight in the eyes of Moses, was the thought of his heart in bringing it afresh before the people of God at the close of Deuteronomy! How have we left Egypt? Have we left it with regrets, with any lingerings in respect of its things? You will recall the incident of the children of Israel murmuring in @Numbers 11: 4 - 6. They said, "Who will give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; and now our soul is dried up: there is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes". The Spirit of God challenges them as to whether there had ever been any time that they had been in trouble when He had not come in for them.
How solemn to forget "Abib", the beginning of months! Moses makes express mention of this in @Deuteronomy 16: 1 - 3, he says, "Keep the month of Abib, and celebrate the passover to Jehovah thy God; for in *the month of Abib* Jehovah thy God brought thee forth out of
{37}
Egypt by night. And thou shalt sacrifice the passover to Jehovah thy God, of the flock and of the herd, in the place which Jehovah will choose to cause his name to dwell there. Thou shalt eat no leavened bread along with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste, -- that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt, all the days of thy life". How well might they and we remember the month "Abib". It is to be held in spiritual recollection. We must not always abide by the forgiveness of sins, we must make spiritual progress. But is it spiritual progress to forget the month Abib? Is it spiritual progress to go back to the things from which God has freed us? If we do forget it, we shall begin to long for something of Egypt. We need never be empty, we need never be spiritually deficient, or feel the slightest need of turning to the world. No heart ever found a void filled by turning to the world! We may have been disappointed because we have had a feeling that we have not been loved or cared for enough, or that others have not been sufficiently interested in us. If this has been so, there is need to get to the Lord, for Him to come in for us. There is enough in Him to satisfy our hearts; but unless God be our object, disappointed we must be. One has heard of those who had a little feeling that they were not loved enough. But let me assure you, there is warmth enough in the christian circle. There are comfort, sympathy, and tenderness, to be found there if we are prepared to keep near enough to feel it.
When God took the people out of Egypt, He thought of them as one man, as was predicated of them by the Holy
{38}
Spirit through the prophet Hosea, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son" (@Hosea 11: 1). They came out in that one identity, as one under God's eye, both in discipline, and as to blessing. As they had been similar in trials and testings, so they were to be similar in the purpose of God, in that great end to which He was bringing them -- "What hath God wrought?" (@Numbers 23: 23). And what possibilities there are when God puts out His hand in divine blessing and touches the soul. It is the breaking forth of the green leaf! What does God intend to do? To bless us in His own way, as those in whom He has wrought, and to establish us by the discipline and trials through which we may be called to pass. But we must be free of Egypt; there must be no entanglements; we must not forget the gain of discipline and the end God has in view in allowing us to go through it.
Much of God's discipline is exercised to get us free of entanglements. He brings us out in the power of His blessings, and sets us up richly supplied for ever. We may not get the sense at the outset, that every step of our way is a matter of divine interest. But there is not a step of our goings that God is not interested in -- not only at the beginning and the end, but also right through the whole journey.
You say, My pathway has been so vacillating. But if I told you mine, you would be amazed. That is not the point really. What is God's view? The end will be, "What hath God wrought?" I do not know anything about you, or what your path has been, but if you have got blessing from God, how comforting it is to know that from the first moment
{39}
you got blessing, God was interested in you in regard of every step of your entire pathway.
The passover is connected with what is *moral*. We keep the feast together. What is our mind? We are here in the world where there are many objects before men, but God's object in bringing His people out of Egypt was that He might set them free from bondage. He did not do so by dealing with the character of things in Egypt; He did not bring down the political and human greatness, but He broke its power, that He might let His people go free. He has brought us out of the world of human greatness, and pride, by the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, His Son, come down from heaven. The greatest thing in our hearts is the grace of Christ. Is there anything then in the world that appeals to us? The greatest thing that has ever been seen in the universe has been the down-stooping of the Son of God. "Who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men; and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross" (@Philippians 2: 6 - 8). That is how we came out.
It was the blessedness of God Himself, that drew Moses¬ heart away from human greatness, and Egyptian pride. What has brought your heart out of the world? Has it been because you found certain troubles attached to things that are seen? The power of the plagues did not bring His people out of Egypt, but the knowledge of Himself did. What filled the heart of Moses when he came out of Egypt? It was by faith he kept the passover, and the
{40}
sprinkling of the blood. What moved the heart of Moses in connection with the deliverance of God's people were the keeping of the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood. For us, dear friends, to be detached from the One who has loved us so much should be intolerable to our hearts. If you had spoken to Paul of the many great things in the world, and asked him if he would not have been a much greater man in Egypt, he would have no doubt agreed as far as the things of the world are concerned. But as a spiritual man he reckoned it all as dung and dross. The greatness that had captivated his heart was the grace of Christ. What is the humanity that God is occupied with now? It is before His face -- the Man Christ Jesus! Jesus glorified as Man! The apostle says, "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter" (@2 Corinthians 12: 2 - 4). What a vision was his, to be caught up to such a place! Higher than Rameses and the Sphinx of Egypt! and enough for his heart! Oh, that one had seen earlier that God's first touch had in view that ever afterwards we should be in the knowledge of His interest, instead of only seeing oneself as a sinner saved by grace, and the interim left insecure.
But you will tell me that on the Lord's day morning we do not come together to be occupied with the passover. That may be, but we come together in a state that has been secured by the passover. We come together in moral
{41}
conditions that have been produced in that way. The passover is one type of the death of Christ. The apostle said, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus" (@2 Corinthians 4: 10). That was the moral obligation of the death of Christ. It is the great divine negative, applied to all that is fleshly, and that would interfere with the operations of the Holy Spirit. "Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body; for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh" (@2 Corinthians 4: 10, 11). The great moral power of the death of Christ, applied to the path of the believer, makes room for what is spiritual. May we keep in mind the month Abib! so that nothing that is Egyptian may have any hold upon us.
<blockquote>Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures? <br>God in secret thee shall keep, <br>There unfold His hidden treasures, <br>There His love's exhaustless deep. (`76:5)</blockquote>
Now let us come to what is spiritual. The antitype of the feast of Pentecost -- the feast of weeks -- was to begin with a wonderful message to the nations of the Holy Spirit. Why should such a place be given to the operations of the Holy Spirit? Because the issues are so tremendous. The end with God is so great and glorious! What a place has been allotted to the presence and operations of the Holy Spirit! "Seven weeks shalt thou count: from the beginning of putting the sickle into the corn". That is the bringing to pass in the power of the Spirit, in the souls of the saints,
{42}
what Christ died to secure, and what He suffered to bring about -- the glory of God. He suffered in respect of everything that was offensive to God. He endured and felt it all. How can we speak of it? But the Lord would have us to consider it -- His atoning sacrifice; Him who knew not sin was made sin for us. One feels how little we have understood it! How easy it has been to say it; how often quoted; and how often preached from! What marvellous words! "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us" (@2 Corinthians 5: 21). Never had He had the slightest touch with it! When the Spirit of God speaks of His sinlessness, He is speaking of His perfect, holy Person -- Him who knew not sin. Oh, the depth of it! And it was "that *we* might become God's righteousness in him".
The Spirit of God has come to us in virtue of Jesus being in the presence of God -- He has come from the glory. He was in the divine majesty of Godhead glory -- Deity, before ever the world was! But the glory that the Spirit of God has come from, is the glory of God, where Christ is. Stephen saw it; and he saw the blessed Person. "Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God" (@Acts 7: 56). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth. He has come that He might be with us, to dwell in us, and to be with us as comfort and power. Also He is a Teacher to lead us into all the things that pertain to that sphere that has been brought into being through the death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus as Man. So in the feast of weeks we find the great reality of not only what is moral, but of what is spiritual. What is spiritual rests on what is according to God. The Spirit has come to us. What are our links? They are
{43}
spiritual. What a sphere of divine comfort and blessing is ours! The Spirit of God has come to us, as the apostle says in @Ephesians 1: 13, "In whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise". He has come to us believers, not only to deliver us from what is contrary to God, but that He might form us in features that correspond to Christ. The Spirit of God fills out the whole interim, after Jesus went on high.
The truth as to the Spirit is illustrated in that incident of divine beauty in Rebecca being brought to Isaac by the servant. When she inquired who is the man? He answered her, That is my master. She sprang off the camel and meets Isaac; and then we find the account that the servant Eliezer renders of his service. "The servant told Isaac all things that he had done" (@Genesis 24: 66). What a rendering at the end of all the service of the Holy Spirit! We are in the feast of weeks -- the Spirit's day; but we must not forget the month Abib. Let us never forget that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us. If we have forgotten the month Abib, and lost the fresh sense of the sufferings of Christ and their import, may the Lord recover it to us! The apostle says in @2 Corinthians 4: 5 - 7, "For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake. Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from
{44}
us". And again in @Philippians 3: 20, 21, "For *our* commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself". May we give room to the Spirit! *Every discipline is intended to make room for the Spirit*. No discipline ever fully yields its fruit until what is spiritual has been built into our souls.
Now I come to the feast of tabernacles. In considering what the import of that is, we must not think only of certain occasions of coming together. Sometimes in getting clear as to different ideas, we are in danger of putting them into little pigeon-holes of divine truth. The truth of God will help us to distinguish one truth from another. This feast is not a matter of occasions -- three times in the year. The Lord is caring for us every step of the journey. Do we touch what is divine? If we touch what is spiritual, we must touch what is divine. How often is it so when we come together? The Lord would have us then in the inside place with Himself. Blessed be God, there have been times when we have touched divine realities! It does not satisfy the heart of God that we pass along the outside, so to speak. He would have us within with Him. There is a great difference between what is inside and what is outside. This feast of tabernacles is the type of God's rest. We are hastening on to it, but we who believe do enter into God's rest. There is a rest remaining for the people of God -- remaining in all its entirety and greatness. We are moving on to that end. And the Spirit of God is moving. The proof of it is that the Spirit of God has been
{45}
bringing to bear upon the hearts of the saints what would make them spiritually ready -- the power of the grace of the ministry of Christ -- what really answers to Christ. And how tenderly the Lord comforts us! God comforts all those who are cast down. But besides comforting us, He would give us spiritual confidence that what is divine is being built into our souls never to be removed.
The feast of tabernacles is at the end of their year's labours -- harvest labours -- and they dwell together. "The tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God" (@Revelation 21: 3). Oh, what a blessed end to be arrived at! And God is building the assembly to that end now! May the Lord help us! I would seek to encourage my own heart and yours, to remember that everything that has come to us is heavenly -- forgiveness of sins has come from heaven. My justification is from heaven. The Holy Spirit who has come to us, has come from above where Christ is. Everything is heavenly for us, before we reach God's end. He is building the heavenly into our souls. John shows you what is abiding, and says, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world" (@1 John 4: 4). And, "For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith. Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?" (@1 John 5: 4, 5). The apostle is not here applying the passover to those to whom he is writing, but the faith of Jesus as the Son of God. May the Lord in His grace help us in the
{46}
consideration of these few thoughts together, for His name's sake!

{47}
THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TESTIMONY IN THREE SPHERES
M W BIGGS
@Acts 18: 1 - 11
There are three aspects of our relation to the testimony that I have before me to present. In the first place we are to stand for the testimony in our daily occupation; then our households are to become available in connection with the testimony; and, thirdly, we have our place in our respective local assemblies. We can appreciate, I think, that there are those three spheres: our ordinary everyday life, our life in connection with the household, and our place in our local gathering.
Most of us are quite ordinary people. God has called us in ordinary positions of life, and we shall remember that the epistle to the Corinthians insists that a man should abide in the same calling in which he is called. When a man becomes a christian he usually has no need to change his ordinary circumstances; he may still remain in his situation, but the whole moral element of his life is altered. Hence he is to abide in his calling *with God*. "Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called ... . Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide with God" (@1 Corinthians 7: 20, 24).
The circumstances of our daily calling seem suggested by what is brought before us in the first few verses of @Acts 18. It says, "For they were tent-makers by trade". It is a wonderful thing to be for the Lord in our daily life. We
{48}
were recently reminded that a large portion of the life of the Lord Jesus has been concealed from our view. We are told that at the age of twelve He went down with His parents and was subject unto them, and we do not hear of Him again until He was thirty years of age. In @Mark 6: 3 He is spoken of as the carpenter, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?" and again in @Matthew 13: 55, "Is not this the son of the carpenter?" Think of the Lord following the ordinary routine of daily life; how extremely affecting! We may be sure it was as precious incense to God. It was the antitype of one view of the meat offering. Those eighteen years must have been exceedingly precious to God. After that period the Lord comes forth in public ministry, and heaven opens upon Him and God announces His pleasure in the Lord Jesus, and says, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Mark 1: 11). In that way God covered by the divine declaration of His pleasure those years of obscurity when He was known as the carpenter's son.
The Lord now gives us the privilege of living for Him in our ordinary daily life. It is there we are to defend the testimony. Our conduct there is in defence of what we love so much and hold so dear. This is not Levitical service, but what is typified by the man of war of twenty years old (see @Numbers 1). Every established believer is responsible to defend by his conduct and character the testimony that he holds so dear. There are one or two scriptures we might turn to in this connection which would elucidate the subject.
The first is @1 Corinthians 7: 20 - 24 (already referred to), "Let each abide in that calling in which he has been
{49}
called. Hast thou been called being a bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free, use it rather. For the bondman that is called in the Lord is the Lord's freedman; in like manner also the freeman being called is Christ's bondman. Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of men. Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide with God". The word bondman is really a slave. A slave, even, had no need to change his occupation or his circumstances in order to defend the testimony. He was not to rebel and run away. He might be the slave of a most exacting and hard man; but christianity enabled that slave to adorn the doctrine of his Saviour in those same circumstances. The trouble is not usually with our circumstances but with ourselves. God would have us abide in the circumstances in which we are found *with Him*, defending in our conduct and character the testimony He has given us to appreciate.
Wonderful things will be displayed in the world to come. The world to come will be governed by principles entirely contrary to the principles of this world. These principles were seen in Jesus in perfection, and they were seen exhibited in the saints collectively in the early chapters of the Acts. What a testimony there was to unselfishness and to holiness. Selfishness and unholiness govern this world; but holiness and unselfishness mark christianity. What we see in the life of Jesus is a self-sacrificing love. Those qualities will be displayed in the world to come and the believer stands for them now.
I would make a special appeal as to how we stand in our business life. In a very large part of our life we are engaged in business. We may have to start early in the
{50}
morning and be home late at night, and those engaged in domestic work have very little leisure. You may be employed in a shop, a bank, or your occupation may be a profession of some kind. Whatever it be, God says you are to abide in that calling with Him. We are to go on with our everyday work; but there is to be an immense moral change in the way we do it. We are not now to do it with a view to selfish aggrandisement and success. It is easy to do things on that line and be successful, but if you do you will fail in the testimony.
Perhaps you have a business of your own and you put all your energies into it and you are very successful. But what about the testimony? It is a very poor thing if you succeed in business and fail as to the testimony. We can count on God's mercy with regard to our everyday life, and God does come in remarkably. But if you carry on your business as an ordinary man of the world, in what way are you standing for the testimony? We want to have an entirely different outlook in the way we do things. We are to take them up for the Lord.
Many years ago I was working very hard in an office; I was going early and remaining until nearly midnight. It seemed an extraordinary life for a christian to be all those hours dealing with mundane or secular matters, nothing spiritual. But I was cheered by that word to bondmen, "Ye serve the Lord Christ" (@Colossians 3: 24). After all I was not quite a slave. It enabled me to see that my ordinary daily life could be for Christ. We are all conscious of much failure, alas! But it is indeed a cheer to know that we can "adorn the teaching which is of our Saviour God in all things" (@Titus 2: 10). This is not preaching or teaching;
{51}
those are for other times. You adorn it as setting it out in its beauty practically. By your manner of life you adorn the teaching. It is very important that we should take home to ourselves the question of standing for the testimony in our daily life. A great deal is said in the epistles as to the conduct of slaves and masters. They are told how to behave relatively, and for the slave there is special encouragement given, for the majority of God's people are found in humble circumstances. "Bondmen, obey in all things your masters according to flesh; not with eye-services, as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord. Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as doing it to the Lord, and not to men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ" (@Colossians 3: 22 - 24).
Some one remarked that no christian who is servant to an earthly master could receive his full wages from him. He might receive the amount agreed, but he could not receive full wages because, if he has served the Lord Christ in his earthly calling, he is to receive the reward of the inheritance. God is taking note as to whether you are doing it for the Lord, "not with eye-services ... but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord". How interesting our daily life becomes; not eight hours of blank, but every moment serving the Lord in our ordinary daily life. How different the motive; we are to do things in a way that would please Christ. How encouraging this is for the sisters who are engaged in ordinary domestic duties, which are in themselves excessively monotonous to some natures. Let us remember that every particle of our life may be taken up for Christ -- adorning the teaching of our
{52}
Saviour God. Our daily occupation is a very important section of our life.
In the passage we read in Acts we find Paul staying with Aquila and Priscilla because he was of the same craft; they were tent-makers. Think of the great apostle working at tent-making! It shows his acceptance of the governmental ordering of God. Aquila and Priscilla had come from Rome. Was it a movement directly ordered of the Lord? No. Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome, and these two accepted it as under the government of God; and as accepting it they found themselves in the direct line of the testimony. We need to accept the governmental dealings of God in connection with our limitations in circumstances of life and health. As accepting the governmental limitations prescribed by God, we find ourselves in the line of the testimony.
The government of God and the testimony are never at variance. It was under the governmental ordering of God that the Lord Jesus Christ was born at Bethlehem! God was behind it all. Do not chafe in your circumstances; they are what God has permitted. God has placed you as you are, and where you are. Your health, your capabilities and your circumstances are His ordering, and He would have you adorn the teaching of our Saviour God where you are, and you are to abide in your calling, *with God*. Of course, if I cannot abide there with God, I must get out of it. If my calling is not in keeping with the testimony, if it necessitates the denial of the principles of God's world, I must leave it. But there are very few occupations like that. The providence of God has placed most of us in such
{53}
positions that we can carry out this injunction, and adorn the teaching of our Saviour God.
I come now to the thought of households. There is a good deal said as to households in @Acts 18. In verse 7 the apostle enters into a man's house which was by the synagogue, and the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house. In chapter 16, too, the house of Lydia is referred to, and also the house of the Philippian jailor. In the epistle to the Corinthians the households of Chloe and Stephanas are referred to. The households of the saints obviously have a great place in connection with the testimony.
We see in the book of Numbers that each tent formed part of a camp, and the camps were arranged round the tabernacle; so that each tent had its own place in reference to the defence and maintenance of the testimony. It becomes a practical question. It is often in the houses of the saints that Satan sees a weak point and he gets in. But our houses should be descriptive of God's house. The epistles to Timothy show that most clearly. Let us read @1 Timothy 5: 4, "If any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to be pious as regards their own house, and to render a return on their side to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God". What a lesson for us all. Our home is where we first learn to work things out. It is often said that if you want to know a man you must live with him and see how he acts in the home. What testimony do you give in your home, as a brother, a daughter, a son, a father, a mother, a husband, or a wife? We are to show piety at home. How important it is for the children to requite their parents. The home is the first
{54}
region in which we learn to exercise piety. Piety is not limited to that, however, for we are to shine everywhere, but surely there.
Then there is the order of the house. Many a house is ruined because the brother does not take his place as head. Another house may be ruined because a sister seeks to be head, which is disastrous. The whole thing should be ordered according to the divine pattern; it is in that way the scripture is fulfilled which says, "*Ye* are the salt of the earth; ... *Ye* are the light of the world" (@Matthew 5: 13, 14), that is, testimony. But we are also the salt of the earth. In this world everything natural is violated. There is a heartless disregard of affection, and violation of the most sensitive feelings. We only need to look round and see what is going on to observe how awfully corrupt things are becoming. Affections are violated and engagements snapped. Is that christianity? We need not go into the intense and awful forms things have taken in this world. What is natural is preserved in the christian circle in its right features. "Ye are the salt of the earth". There is the recognition of every divinely ordered relationship; it is held in a right way and God supports that and what is natural is preserved.
Then, too, the houses of the saints are the avenue by which the house of God reaches the world. A worldly man cannot see the house of God, because it is a spiritual house; he has no means of knowing it in its spiritual character, but he can see you and me; he can note *our* houses. What is that man's house like? Is it different from other houses? Are acts of grace shown there? Is it marked by liberality and hospitality? Does the kindness of God
{55}
shine out in that house? It is most important that there should be in our houses the expression of God's house, that there should be the maintenance of the testimony in the household sphere.
How honoured the house of Lydia was. The apostle not only went there once, but he went back there. Then the Philippian jailor's household was baptised and brought under the rule of the Lord. And as we were seeing in @Acts 18, there are several houses mentioned. In the first epistle to the Corinthians we read of the household of Stephanas devoting themselves to the saints for service. We see thus how the testimony is maintained and defended through the households of the saints.
But how easy it is, alas! for worldliness to get in. Satan sees his opportunity in our weaknesses. How easy for us to allow for our children what we would not sanction for ourselves. He gets in through the most tender affection of a parent to a child. We excuse ourselves and say, The children are so young; they do not understand. And so Satan, with all his cleverness, gets in through the natural affections, and the world enters the home of the christian. What is the next thing? It enters into the assembly through the houses of the saints, and the testimony is gone, How important that the households of the saints should be supports to the testimony. Do you remember what happened to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite? He had the ark in his house. What an honour to have the ark there -- to have the testimony in that way maintained in the house. God recognised it and He blessed the household of Obed-edom. There must be the recognition of what is of God in connection with the
{56}
households of the saints. I do not think we can take up the administration of the assembly -- the house of God -- unless we have some education in connection with our own houses.
Timothy refers very largely to the houses of the saints. Look at @1 Timothy 2. I think that refers primarily to the christian household. Prayer marks it. Prayer is to be made "for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity; for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth" (verses 2 - 4). I believe that is particularly applicable to the household. I would like to ask every head of a house what his household prayer is like. Are you conducting family reading? I once asked someone what they were reading in the morning -- family reading -- and she replied, 'We don't have family reading'. I hope you have family reading, dear brother. What a terrible thing to let the household start without the public recognition of God! Supposing you had to have a business friend to stay with you. Look at the effect it would have on him, if you did not have family prayer and reading. He would get a wrong impression of the house of God. We are to pray for all men; we may also pray for God's care over our households. I believe household prayer is particularly in view in the epistle to Timothy.
And then there is to be prayer for the gospel specifically. Some of us have had great encouragement in gathering our household around us for prayer before the gospel preaching. Some of us are not privileged to be at home always, but if we are home, what an opportunity to
{57}
gather thus as a household. I believe the household is referred to primarily in @1 Timothy 2. Let us read verse 8: "I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning". What a lovely position for a man -- dependence marking him -- characterised by the feature of Christ. And then the women "in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion" (@1 Timothy 2: 9). There is the preservation of what is natural in the christian circle.
We need to be very definitely set against the worldly attire of the present day. One's spirit is extremely pained to see the worldliness of dress of some believers. The sisters who are older should have a care over the young sisters in this matter. Young brothers, too, must beware of this. Worldly fashions are a denial of the rejection of Christ and the cross. There is a tendency to adopt the fashions of this world, and if we are doing that we are not setting forth the character of God; we are not defending the testimony; we are letting the enemy in. The women are to adorn themselves with *modest* apparel. Our houses are to be the channels for the exhibition of the features of the house of God. Men should see in our houses what the assembly is like, and they should be attracted. The Lord would greatly exercise us, that we might be found true to Himself in our daily vocation; and also in our households, that there might be the setting forth of the character of God, in our whole deportment, our hospitality, and the general upkeep and style of our houses, so that they may say, Yes, this house belongs to a different kind of man. Where else can a man learn these things?
{58}
Let me now turn to a few verses in 2 Timothy to show four qualities which should mark us in connection with each of these spheres. @2 Timothy 1: 7: "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion". One thing which is greatly needed in these spheres of our life is courage. In verse 8 the apostle says to Timothy, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord". I would say to the young here specially, Do not he ashamed. The testimony is such that it need bring no blush to your cheek. We can be ashamed of much in ourselves, but we never need be ashamed of the testimony. Timothy was evidently a diffident, nervous young man, and to encourage him the apostle refers to Onesiphorus. He says, he "has not been ashamed of my chain; but being in Rome sought me out very diligently, and found me" (verses 16, 17). And he says to Timothy, Don't *you* be ashamed. We need courage.
And then there is suffering, "Take thy share in suffering" (@2 Timothy 2: 3). We are often timid and are marked by the spirit of fear because we are not prepared to suffer. If we are prepared to suffer as a lamb we shall be as bold as a lion. Then next there is understanding, @2 Timothy 2: 7: "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things". We need to know what we are suffering for. There is great need for thinking over what Paul says. The next thing is devotedness. A good soldier will give up everything to please the Lord. There is a call for devotedness today; nothing else will meet the situation. An insipid lukewarmness has come over the professing church, and devotedness is necessary if we are to be for the Lord and to stand for the testimony.
{59}
Let us apply these four qualities, first individually and then in regard of our households. If a man of the world comes to see you when you are just about to start for a week-night meeting, what are you going to do? Supposing a worldly relative arrives. Is that going to stop you from going to the meeting? If it does, you are giving the situation away; you have allowed the Moabite to carry the situation, to use a typical expression. You want to express what God is like. Take them with you if they are willing; if not, go alone. You may say, It might upset them. Possibly, but it might mean their salvation. We need courage and preparedness to suffer reproach. Reproach helps us in a very definite way. We must be intelligent and devoted. The Lord would help us in our individual paths and in our households if we go on those lines.
I come now to the thought of the assembly. We have our daily individual life, our households, and lastly we have our place in connection with the local assembly. I would like to read a passage in @1 Corinthians 12: 12 - 18: "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit ... . Now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased him".
We must ever remember that we are set together. We could not have a closer bond than that seen in the human body. It moves with instinct and impulse. If one member is hurt, almost unconsciously the other members go to its aid.
{60}
If a child knocks his knee, the hand is put out to soothe it. If something gets into the eye, the hand goes to the rescue and seeks to remove what is offending. The human body is a remarkable organism. And so the Lord takes up the human body to illustrate the feelings and movements of the saints as set together, not only locally, but universally. Verse 13 brings out what is universal: "For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body", and in verse 27 we get what is local: "Now *ye* are Christ's body". The expression, "so also is the Christ" (verse 12), does not refer to the Lord personally, as the next verse explains, "For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body" -- that is, the anointed vessel here is the one body, the assembly. The one body here, in its unity, is to be expressive of what God is in this scene where Christ is no longer.
We might say, How can God be expressed here since Jesus has been crucified and gone to heaven? The only way God can be expressed here is in that one body -- Christ's body -- here, the vessel of the Spirit for the setting forth of God. God has set you here. It is not that you have to join or become anything. Every one who has received the Spirit has been set in the body. God has put you there. This is very exercising, but it is a great privilege to be a member of the body. What care are you taking of the other members? How many have you visited? How many have you prayed for, not only locally, but universally? "*Ye* are Christ's body". The "we" of verse 13 embraces all christians, but the "*ye*" of verse 27 was the Corinthian assembly locally, that is, it represented in character what the thing was universally. The assembly at Corinth should
{61}
have been the expression of what the assembly was universally. The features of the universal church were to be maintained and exhibited in the local assembly at Corinth. That makes the movements of any local assembly very important; anything that is done is done in the light of the whole. The testimony is one and the assembly is one. Nothing is purely local. There is a great danger of becoming locally isolated. We must remember there is only one body. How are your neighbouring meetings getting on? How are you caring for your brethren elsewhere? The local gathering at Corinth was to express in feature the whole assembly -- one body.
Note verse 25: "that the members might have the same concern one for another". The grace of the Spirit is seen in the care the saints have one for another. Sometimes we ask each other how we are physically, but do we inquire as to how we are spiritually? Many a fall has been saved by the kindness of a brother who looks after us spiritually. It is the grace of the Spirit that exhibits itself in the one body, the members having the same care one for the other. It is not all for one. Christianity is not a one-man thing; it is a mutual thing -- "one for another". How we need to maintain the thought of the one body, so that there may be the right expression of the testimony.
Passing on from the mutuality of the body, we find at the end of the chapter the distinctiveness of gift. All of us are members of the body, but when you come to gift there is distinction; the idea of sovereignty comes in. "God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers" (@1 Corinthians 12: 28); and so on. Whilst there is the mutuality of our relationships as in the
{62}
one body, there must always be the recognition of the Lord coming in sovereignly. If the Lord raises up gift it is like an ornament in the house of God. We might see some young brother raised up. It is not only a question of care for the saints, but it is gift. A young brother may be raised up in a very remarkable way, and wherever he goes he is a gift in the assembly. It is important to recognise gift.
We might refer to the Levites, which suggest the grace and devotedness of service. When the Levites were sanctified they had to wash their clothes. It was part of their sanctification. This grace of service must be seen in the exercise of gift; we must be concerned that there should be the deportment, habits and clothing in keeping with the testimony that we proclaim. The servant and his message must be in agreement. The exercise of gift is alluded to. There is the mutuality in connection with the body, and then the public side of service as the Lord might in sovereignty bestow gift. May the Lord give us to recognise both sides. I do not think He would set the young to serve immediately. If I am converted tonight, it is not that I should publicly serve tomorrow. There is a period of waiting before service.
Spiritual education is necessary for service. There might be a kind of service rendered, like the woman who said, "Come see a man" (@John 4: 29) -- a spontaneous service, but the definite taking up of service would come rather later. The overruling hand of God prepares a vessel. The Levites were numbered from one month and upward, and then from twenty-five years they learned to serve, and at thirty they took up service definitely. In any public service, proper experience is necessary for the
{63}
maintenance of the testimony. We need to be careful that there is no venturing into public service without the qualifications, for we are to set forth what God is.
The vessels of the sanctuary were very holy. It needed priestly skill to cover them rightly, and the Levites had to learn *how* to serve. The brethren should be able to lay their hands on the one that serves. Having received the Holy Spirit, we can function in the body at once. We should all care one for another. I would say to a young soul converted yesterday, you are necessary for the body; it is not complete without you. Every one is necessary in the body, and we each should function -- each member taking up its place in relation to the whole, caring for one another and esteeming one another, every member comely and every one necessary.
May the Lord give us to be greatly exercised that our conduct, first in relation to our individual pathway, then in our houses, and also in relation to the assembly, may be all in support of the testimony, not only locally, but universally.

WAITING UPON GOD
R BESLEY
@Isaiah 64: 4
What I had in mind in reading this passage was to try and say a word to you, beloved brethren, with regard to the matter of waiting upon God. I believe that it is distinct from prayer, although intimately connected with it. That is to say, you might have prayer without waiting upon God. There is great blessing accruing to those who wait upon God. I have no doubt every one here is accustomed to praying, for there is no more delightful occupation for a believer than praying, unless it be praising, but the one is often the outcome of the other. To have the favour of being allowed to speak to God, and speak to the Lord in heaven, is greatly valued, I am sure, by every one.
Prayer fortifies a believer as having to meet the influences of the world, and of his own heart, but what I have very much before me now is the experience of *waiting upon God*. Evidently there are wonderful things -- things that eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor that have entered into the heart of man -- which God has prepared for those that *wait* for Him. The apostle in the epistle to the Corinthians gives a beautiful touch, as showing that those that wait upon God are those that love Him. I believe that all the persons whom God has taken up from the beginning have been accustomed to wait upon God, and I raise the inquiry as to whether we are accustomed to wait upon God. I suppose we have all, in varying measure, had the
{66}
experience that we have spoken to God about a matter, and have received no reply. What are you going to do? Are you going to abandon the pursuit, or are you going to wait upon God? The waiting process tests us much, but it is a most delightful experience to wait on God, with the sure and certain sense in our souls that none ever waited on God in vain. It is part of our education for the realm in which we are to dwell presently, that we should wait on God. I think Noah stands out as one who waited on God. Noah recoiled from the condition of things in the earth where he lived, and he took an opposite course; he was a righteous man, and God regarded him as such. The time came when God told him that the end of all flesh had come before Him. Now, God frequently indicates what He is about to do before He does it, and Noah had to learn to wait on God as to what He was about to do. As waiting upon God, your heart rejoices in the sense that you are in His confidence, and that you have a secret with heaven. It is a wonderful experience to be in the secret of God's mind. Noah enjoyed that, and as he built the ark, during the long period that elapsed while it was preparing, Noah was waiting upon God. Day by day he would no doubt commune with God as he waited upon Him. And even after Noah was put into the ark, and the door was shut by the hand of God, he had to wait. I am perfectly certain that Noah acquired, as the outcome of waiting on God, a moral greatness that distinguished him from the whole generation in which he lived.
Then one might refer to Abraham. The God of glory appeared to him, as distinct from Noah. The God of glory appeared to him in a land of idolatry, and He called him to
{67}
come out of country, kindred, and father's house, and we are told that he went out, not knowing whither he went -- because he was waiting on God. What did it matter if he did not know whither he was going if he had God to wait upon? He arrived at a knowledge of God through that experience, which I suppose he could not have derived in any other way. Then, in offering up his son, he was told that the thing was to be done on one of the mountains that "I will tell thee of". Abraham still further waited upon God, and all through his experiences we find that this thing characterised him (save, alas, with certain lapses) that he waited upon God.
Our place as brought into relation with God, in His family as His children, and in His household, gives us our privilege of waiting upon Him. The thought of waiting upon God far exceeds the idea of making requests to Him, and leaving it there. There may be requests which we make, and which we leave, but that is not waiting upon God. Waiting upon God is that the affections of the heart turn constantly towards Him, ever having in mind what we have spoken to Him about, or that of which He may have spoken to us. It may involve patience, but it is amply rewarded. May I ask whether we, as believers, are intimate with heaven? Do we know the gates, the doors? Do we realise that we have been called into holy intimacy with God, not to be so only when we arrive in heaven, but now? Do we understand this? In the world great prices are paid, and great efforts are put forward, in order to be allowed to speak to royal personages. You need pay no price to speak to God. It is your rightful place to be near to Him, and to commune with Him continually. Nothing, surely,
{68}
can be greater in the life of a believer than to be intimate with God, and to know what it is continually to wait upon Him.
I might remind you of others besides Noah and Abraham: of Joseph, of David, and of many others who knew what it was to wait upon God. There were those who through long hours of dreary darkness knew what it was to wait upon God. I want you to understand that *none* ever waited on God in vain. As surely as the sun rises in the morning, so surely will God answer you if you wait upon Him. But He may keep you waiting, and the process of being kept waiting tests us all, but it educates us greatly. When once you have passed a period of waiting upon God -- waiting on and on, and no answer, no apparent issue -- the moment will come when the dawn will appear and the light will stream in where it was dark, and God will show you His way.
In the life of Jesus here, perfect though it was, great and Holy One of God as He was, there was this particular element of waiting upon God. Think of the Lord being in Jerusalem; He knew about His Father's business -- what great affairs were in His hands. Think of a boy of twelve years old in the temple. The One who was going to bring about the reconciliation of all things, the One who was going to effect atonement, and the One who was going to destroy the power of death and overthrow completely the whole power of evil. Did He not know what was before Him? He says, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" (@Luke 2: 49). Think of Him going down to Nazareth and waiting. Think of that One turning daily, frequently every day, turning
{69}
heavenward, and waiting on God. Which is greater -- to accomplish great things for God, or to enjoy nearness with Him? The Lord valued the holy intercourse that He had with God. So He went down to Nazareth, and it says He was in subjection to His parents.
I ask you, Are you really in touch with God? Do you know Him? I have found believers in obscurity. One comes to my mind now who lived in a little wooden cottage, who could speak in the most intimate way of having to do with God. Never shall I forget the look that came into her face as she spoke to me. She said, 'Do you think God will ever fail me? No', she said, 'never'. Are we really intimate with God, beloved? Do we know Him? God is working at the present time to bring us *near* to Him. We have become nigh by the blood of Christ; we all have access in the power of one Spirit. But do we know this nearness? Do we know what it is to wait upon God? Oh, it is lovely to get into the company of one who is accustomed to wait on God.
The time came in the life of Jesus, in His precious life, when He came up to the baptism of John. And Luke tells us, "all the people having been baptised, and Jesus having been baptised and praying, that the heaven was opened" (@Luke 3: 21). Jesus was praying, not preaching yet, not raising that voice, which in its power could cause the dead to hear. No, He was waiting, waiting on God -- praying. It is a most touching consideration. A lowly, humble Man, standing by the water, coming up out of the river, standing there. Oh, how precious to heaven, a lonely Man standing praying by the Jordan, what a lovely sight. Waiting on God. What will God do? God opened the heavens, and the
{70}
Spirit in bodily form as a dove came down and abode upon Him. A manifest representation to all who were there that that Person was approved of heaven. That was the answer. The voice was for His own heart, that He had the place as the beloved Son.
We are missing much, dear brethren, if we do not know what it is to wait -- to wait only upon God. You may say to me, 'I am in difficulty as to my home; I have to leave the place in which I am living, and I do not know what to do'. Well, when you do not know what to do, do nothing, but wait upon God to come in; for certainly He will. What about your family? Are we accustomed to letting things drift? Are we as parents accustomed to letting our children drift into the world? This will not do, brethren; you and I as parents, and heads of households, are responsible to wait on God for them. Oh, you say, 'It is an impossible case'. What? Impossible to whom? Have you never read those words, "With God all things are possible" (@Matthew 19: 26). You say the case is a hopeless one. I challenge that. I ask you solemnly, is any case hopeless when you bring God in? No, there must be this practice of waiting on God, and the Lord Jesus in His lowly, humble life pre-eminently set it forth.
There came the moment of the transfiguration. Jesus went up the mountain knowing what was coming, for He had alluded to it, and that shows that nothing ever took the Lord by surprise. I have often had a desire that I might be nearer to God, so that things might not take me by surprise. I am thinking just now of the coming of the Lord Jesus. I believe that if one could only wait, and wait upon Him, He would give a definite indication that He was
{71}
coming. Have you any intimation from Him as to whether He is coming? What is your own personal experience with the Lord? Is so great a moment to come without any kind of intimation in the hearts of those who love Him? I question it. When did you ask Him last when He was coming? Just before He ascended they said, "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" (@Acts 1: 6). And he said to them, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority" (verse 7). I have a strong impression that there will be those here on the earth who will be in the secret of the fact that the Lord is just about to come. I would like to be among them. I believe there will come into the souls of many of the saints -- I do not say all, no doubt it is open to all -- an impression in the hearts of believers that the Lord is at hand. That is my impression. I would like to wait upon Him so that we have some indication from Himself that He is about to come. I would love, if it were possible, to be able to put my book down, or leave whatever I am doing, and just wait, and say, 'Lord Jesus, come', and we shall be gone. I am convinced that the Lord would have us wait on Him as to it, for it is at hand. If He comes in the dead of night, remember it is daylight on the other side of the world; or if darkness there, it will be daylight here. I would love to wake out of sleep and have the sense that the Lord is coming, and so be ready in affection to greet Him. That is what we desire, I am sure, and it will be the outcome of waiting upon Him. How many days do we pass without ever referring to the Lord about the matter at all? There should not be one day. I went into a brother's house and I noticed a paper on the wall with these words: 'Perhaps,
{72}
today'. How lovely to be in the household of a brother who, on his knees in quietness with you alone in his room, with his whole soul moved and throbbing with affection and attachment to Christ, says, 'Oh, Lord, is it today?' If we wait upon Him we will get some intimation from Him that His coming is imminent.
I was referring to the Lord going up the mountain as knowing that the transfiguration was about to take place, for He had intimated it to the disciples. Yet, having ascended the mountain, we find Him praying, or waiting on God, and as He prayed -- not after He prayed -- as He prayed, His countenance was altered and His clothing was also changed. The fruit of waiting upon God was this transfiguration. It is open to us all to enjoy waiting upon God, and we shall prove how true it is that, "Eye has not seen, and ear not heard" (@1 Corinthians 2: 9), how He will act for those that wait upon Him. What will God do for those that wait upon Him?
I pass on, and think of the moment of the Lord's crucifixion, and recall the remarkable words of @Psalm 40: 1 in connection with it, "I waited patiently for Jehovah". Think of that moment on the cross -- Jesus nailed to the cross and abandoned of God, enduring the wrath of God against sin. Think of Him there, waiting, and He says, "he brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay" (verse 2). Although abandoned, He waited for God to come in, and God brought Him up out of the horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set His feet on a rock, and established His goings, and put a new song in His mouth. Look what an array of things come in now as the outcome of waiting, and waiting patiently upon God. The most
{73}
magnificent devotion that the universe will ever witness was seen there. It was not only that He prayed to God: He did that, but He waited on Him. You, or I, or any saint at any time or in any place, can never come into such circumstances as those; and yet here is the eternal witness that God will answer him that waits on Him. He was heard for His piety; His inmost feelings clung to God although He was forsaken, and He waited on God; and the establishment of a universe of glory will be the answer to it.
Beloved brethren, if God is to be known, and if He has revealed Himself to us, it is that we may have the joy of waiting upon Him, and He will never fail us. It is a thing that is called for in a godless world. I say most respectfully to the brethren, merely to offer our prayers is not enough. It is a great thing; there are christian households, alas, where prayers are not offered publicly; but there are others where prayers are offered. But what about this? Does not the head of the house know what it is to shut himself up alone and wait upon God? The most dire and awful need that ever arose in any house or family will be met if only we know what it is to wait upon God. The most awful dilemma into which a man was ever plunged shall be solved if we will only learn what it is to wait on God. The most distressing assembly difficulty which we have ever known, will be solved if we only know what it is to wait, and wait only upon God.

CHRIST LOVED BY THE FATHER
R BESLEY
@Isaiah 48: 14, 15; @John 3: 35, 36; @John 5: 20; @John 14: 31
I want to speak to you, if the Lord will help me, of the place which Christ the Son has in the love of God the Father, and to trace in connection with this, the place which we have in the love of God the Father. Love is the greatest thing in the universe. There is no power equal to love. God is love, and he that dwells in love dwells in God. We shall never be brought to have any part, any share, in Deity, but we are already brought into the most intimate relationship with God that He is able to give, short of bringing us into Deity. I would ask you, beloved brethren, to weigh the magnificence of such a proposal as this. Most of us, probably, have the knowledge of forgiveness and salvation, and know something of being the recipients of divine care here in circumstances of human life, as the result of which we can sing praises and give glory to God. But that is far short of what God has in His mind for our enjoyment now and for the eternal portion of our hearts.
With regard to Christ, *He* had a place as a Person of the Godhead in the region of love, before ever this world was. There is no doubt about that (@John 17: 24). But it has pleased God to make Himself known, not only in the majesty of His power in creatorial works -- He has done that -- but fully made Himself known. He has, however, not taken the way of coming into revelation in an angel. It has pleased Him to pass by angels and to take hold of the
{76}
seed of Abraham, and to come into revelation by becoming a Man. As you perceive this, I think you must realise that it expresses the greatness of divine love. God has come into revelation by becoming Man. You will readily perceive that had God taken up angelic form, whether of an ordinary angel or an archangel, we should have felt that we had nothing in common with an angel. An angel knows nothing of human feelings, save as that which he may be capable of as an onlooker. But God has been pleased to reveal Himself by becoming Man, and our Lord Jesus Christ, while essentially divine, as the Son of God is perfectly a Man. Every human feeling, every human sensitivity is there in perfection. I do not possess human feeling in perfection. I am painfully conscious of it; but I know that the Lord Jesus Christ has human feelings in perfection. All our feelings are affected by sin, and the power of moral death having come in as a result of the fall. But in the Lord Jesus Christ there is the perfection of human sensitivity which belongs to no one else; and God has made Himself known in that blessed Man. I have sometimes sat quietly, or knelt in prayer and thought of the immensity of Godhead -- the splendour of Godhead -- and felt how entirely it is outside my range altogether. Then, as through, I suppose, the Spirit of God, one has been awakened to the sense that God has revealed Himself in a Man, our Lord Jesus, and that great and glorious Personage has come within our range, so that we may know what God is and who He is. And that we may be instructed in His thoughts, and His desires; not through teaching only, for there is something greater than teaching, and that is influence. As having come under the rule of
{77}
Christ (I do not use that word as applying it to anything arbitrary as we generally understand rule), one is instructed and educated in the knowledge of God not only by what He says, for He does speak, but by influence. There are things to be discovered by coming under His influence, and I am sure we know something of what this is. Now, as I said, the Lord occupied a place in Deity and in love. He was an object of affection and love in eternity (@John 17: 24), but having come into Manhood, He became in a peculiar and unique way an Object of divine love. Hence He is referred to in Scripture as "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (@John 1: 18). The Lord alone has that unique place, but in addition to this place which the Lord will ever hold, alone, He, as Man, is also Pattern for us, for we read, "that the world may know ... that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me" (@John 17: 23). He is now Firstborn among many brethren and brings us to share with Him, as "firstborn ones". God's purpose for us is that we should be conformed to the image of His Son; He sent forth His Son that we might receive sonship; and we are loved as He is loved.
Referring to the first passage that I read, it would appear from the words of the prophet Isaiah that in chapter 48 there is an allusion to Cyrus, king of Persia. In chapter 45 also God speaks of him as being anointed. But though alluding to Cyrus, the chapter has Christ in view prophetically, and it says there, "He whom Jehovah hath loved". Now, as come into this world, the Lord came definitely to serve. I wish you to understand that Jesus, having come into this world took up service, and He took it up in the consciousness of being loved. "He whom
{78}
Jehovah hath loved". There never was a moment in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ in this world, but He had the sense that He was loved of God, not a moment. There are multitudes of incidents in that life not yet made known, perhaps typified in the manna, placed in the golden pot and laid up in the sanctuary. There is the vast wealth into which we shall shortly be brought, when in those radiant courts of divine glory. We shall then be let into the great secrets of Jesus in humiliation, and we shall learn in a fuller measure how He had the consciousness of being loved by God. The motive power behind His service included the consciousness of being loved of God. A motive behind all our service, the heavenly impulse behind all our activities, whether they be levitical, priestly, or those of sonship, should be the sense that we are loved of God.
The proposal is a wonderful one in @Isaiah 48. The power of Babylon, the power of the Chaldeans, is to be broken. Jesus is going to overthrow it for ever. Babylon has already fallen in our hearts, but the public overthrow is at hand. The world raises itself up today in its greatness; but let us remember the words, "His enemies shall lick the dust" (@Psalm 72: 9). So that we can afford to serve, although results may not be apparent. Our great Master had to say, "I have spent my strength for nought and in vain" (@Isaiah 49: 4). Yet He laboured and served in the sense that He was loved by God. And you and I must serve in the sense of being loved, whether among few or many, year in and year out, and possibly in comparative isolation. Was there ever any one who tasted loneliness like Jesus? When He said, "I am become like the pelican of the wilderness ... I have eaten ashes like bread" (@Psalm 102: 6 - 9). That glorious Person
{79}
served with unwearying energy, because He ever dwelt in the love of God. I know of no other way in which we can serve, but in the sense of divine love. If our serving is carried on in the consciousness of divine love, then it will be maintained at the high level of sonship.
Now I pass on to the verse in John's gospel (@John 3: 35) where it is said, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". The Lord is presented here as One whom the Father loves, and He was conscious of being not only a Servant but of being the Son. I want you to understand that that was always behind His service. Though He took the place of Servant, He was ever conscious of sonship. I am speaking of what He was in manhood; for the place He had in sonship, as alluded to in Scripture, was known by Him in manhood. "The Father loves the Son" -- that is, in manhood -- "and hath given all things to be in His hand". Think of the love of the Father to the Son -- Man in this world -- being such that He could put all things into His hand. What a hand! I want you to think of the Lord Jesus as being One in manhood of such moral greatness and glory that the Father could put all things into His hand. Not merely for a moment -- it is not that He put things for a moment into His hand -- but abidingly. Yes, that blessed One was here in this world, in the consciousness of being loved, in spite of rejection by man, and I suppose no gospel portrays the rejection of Jesus so pointedly as does the gospel of John. We find at one point that He was surrounded by enemies, and yet He had the consciousness of sonship in His holy manhood, and that all things were in His hand, placed there abidingly. What about the nations? What about the world?
{80}
What about the affairs of this earth? The Father loves the Son, and He has put all things into His hand; and you and I are to be associated with Him. We can well wait patiently and serve, sustained by the love of the Father's heart. I suppose the allusion to all being given to be in His hand touches the point of the inheritance; for do not forget that we are heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ. The moment is not far distant -- it already exists according to the affections and thoughts of the heart of God -- when God will head up all things in Christ, and we are going to be with Him. All things are in His hand! What quietness and composure the knowledge of this would give to us. First, the place the Son has in the Father's heart, and then that He has given all things into His hand. Do you really believe that all things are in the Son's hand? So that whatever comes to you and to me, comes through that hand. And all things have been placed in His hand, as the abiding witness to our hearts of the love of the Father for Him, and of the character of the Person, the loved One of the Father's heart.
In the next passage that I read (@John 5: 20) it says that, "the Father loves the Son and shews Him all things which he himself does". This unveils to us what was taking place in the life of Jesus, the blessed Son of God here on earth as He moved in the path of divine service. The Father loved Him, and He was able to show Him all things that He Himself was doing. Indeed, the Lord says that as He saw, He wrought, and as He heard He did and spoke. You will recall that, with regard to Moses, he was charged in Exodus that everything in connection with the tabernacle had to be made according to the pattern that was shown
{81}
him in the mount. Now Moses was only a minister himself, and there is no suggestion that Moses was shown these things because Jehovah loved him. Jehovah trusted him; he was one who could be trusted. Hence he was shown, not only the pattern of the tabernacle, but the pattern of the things of the holy sanctuary. But when it is a question of Jesus, "The Father loves the Son and shews Him all things". What God had shown to Moses was but an item of the "all things". But when it is the Son of God in manhood, "The Father ... shews him all things which he himself does". You will remember that with regard to king David and to Solomon, and the building of the temple, David handed over to Solomon the pattern. Such accuracy was to be secured that the pattern of the things was handed over in writing so that there should be no departure from what was shown to David by the Spirit. The whole of the house, and the houses in connection with the temple were to be according to what was shown and given. But when Jesus comes in, "all things" are in view, the earthly and the heavenly system. The Father loves the Son and shews Him *all things*. Think of the place that Jesus has taken, think of the place that He had in manhood as Son, and He received these things as shown by the Father. I want you to note the name of Father; it does not say God. There is one God, the Father, it is true. But when it says "The Father" gave all things to be in His hands, and "the Father" shews Him all things which He Himself does, it implies that the whole movement is a movement of love. Moreover, we, being through redemption associated with the Son of God, are privileged to know what these "all things" are. Christ is the Firstborn, and we are with Him, and if we want to know
{82}
what are the heavenly things, we have access to Him, and they have all been shown to Him. There is nothing of those "all things" outside the range of the Son in manhood, and the saints are associated with Him. God desires that the saints should be -- indeed, they are now -- the most illustrious assembly the world has ever seen. The Father loves the Son and shows Him -- it does not say that He *did* show; it puts it that way in order to give it a living present force -- He shows. And you and I are presently, perhaps in a few hours, to be caught up to form that great assembly on high. We need to give our whole mind to these "all things". The things in this world are beneath you. We are privileged to know the "all things which he himself does". He has shown them to the Son because He loved Him; and because He loves you and me we have been given a place in association with the Son of God. It is not only that the Father has loved Jesus but He also loves us.
Then in @John 14: 21 it says, "he that has my commandments". What a word, we have His commandments. What are we doing with them? Can we, as sitting here together, say that there is not a known commandment that we are not keeping? What about the Lord's supper -- are we all breaking bread? The commandments are binding. Love has the greatest force, an arbitrary commandment is not so binding. "He that has my commandments and keeps them". You must keep them. Why? Because He loves you. You must never lose sight of the fact that He loves you, has loved you unto death. "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me" -- here we come in -- "shall be loved by my Father". Has He given you the
{83}
care of His people? What has He put into your hand? Why? Because He loves you. Is it because you are a competent brother? Not at all, it is because He loves you. It is the greatest trust that can ever be imposed. He has given you something in your hand because He loves you, and not only so, He will show you things, because He loves you. Take it to heart; the Father loves you, and as Jesus says, "The Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me" (@John 16: 27). So that in our measure we have the opportunity of coming into the enjoyment of the love that He knew in limitless fullness. Think of having such a place of service. The Father has given it because He loves you. We can take up the path of service now, and take up the things which are put into our hands, because He loves us, and we can take them up as conscious of our relation as associated with the Son of God. Do not step down from your dignity. Remember, whatever you are doing down here -- the most menial service -- will never rob us of this, that we are numbered among the sons of the firstborn family and we are loved.

STARS
R BESLEY
@Genesis 1: 14 - 16; @Matthew 2: 1 - 11; @1 Corinthians 15: 39 - 42
The scripture in Corinthians, which we read, justifies our regarding the people of God as under the figure of stars. You will have noticed in the book of Genesis that while the whole creation stands out as the handiwork of God, yet the stars are mentioned as an item by themselves, which will help us in what we are about to look at. It is said that God made the two great lights, the sun to rule by day and the moon to rule by night, and then it says, "and the stars". I need not remind the brethren here, I am sure, that the sun is a type of Christ, and the moon may be regarded as a type of the assembly. But the stars are figures of persons, viewed severally, but set in relation to Christ and each other.
I am not now about to speak to you of the assembly as typified in the moon, but of ourselves as persons who form the assembly, typified in the stars, not as isolated individuals, but as a constellation under the figure of the stars. I beg you, brethren, to seek from the Lord that you might be delivered from any kind of isolated position. I will show you later that it must become exceedingly perilous if we who form the assembly become isolated. From what I understand, although I am afraid I am somewhat ignorant of the stars, no star is independent of the others. Men used to think that the stars were independent, but they are rapidly arriving at the truth that
{86}
the stars have been set by God in the heavens together as a whole.
And what is stated of the sun and moon, is also stated in reference to the stars, namely, that they are there to rule. The sun is to rule in the day, and the moon and the stars are to rule in the night. And I put it as an inquiry to us all, as to whether we are exercising an influence from God over this earth. As being one of the stars, you should be ruling, taking part in an influence of rule over this earth. I do not know whether you have been aroused in your affections as to this; and what kind of life you are living where God has put you -- in the city, town, or village, where you are. But you should be a ruling influence for God, as being one of the great number of stars. It is a serious inquiry. I trust, dear brethren, that all of us here are exercising some degree, at least, of rule. I do not know whether I may address you as living in Woodstock, or Hamilton. But that place ought to be that much better off because you are there; and if it is not, then you are not filling out the divine design in giving you a place which is set forth in the stars in the heaven. A boy at school who is converted and knows the Lord ought to exercise some influence over the others, and if he is true to the Lord Jesus he will. I have no doubt there are some here who do. You may think you are only a little star, but a star is a very great thing in God's design, because the stars, with the small light, are to rule the night. There is a sense in which we are related, as I will show you, to the morning, but the main suggestion is in relation to the night.
Now in the prophet Joel we read in two places of a day which appears to be coming, when the stars will
{87}
withdraw their shining (@Joel 2: 10; @Joel 3: 15). This is a very serious matter for the world; but I raise the inquiry as to whether we are among the shining stars. Things may have come in which interfere with our shining, but God's end in putting the stars by power of creation in the heavens, is that they should shine; and we should be shining. Are you shining among the stars? Are you bringing heavenly light towards this earth, into the office where you are working -- what kind of shining is there?
Are you a shining star? On the market, in the business, in the mill, in the workshop, and in the assembly, are you a shining star? Do you bring light in? We should be among the shining stars. It will be a terrible day, to which the prophet Joel refers, when the stars withdraw their shining. We should never withdraw our shining. We should at every time be shining as the stars in the firmament.
Job refers to stars as singing. I have noticed that there are some of the saints who do not sing. I have not yet asked them why. Maybe they cannot sing, but they can make a joyful noise I am sure. I doubt whether there is any one who really cannot sing. I have sometimes discerned the voices of the children in the assembly. Some one once said, 'Do you not think it is out of place for the children to sing? They sing loudly and are often out of tune'. No, I love to hear them; it does not distract me. I love to be among the saints and know they are among the singing stars. Job says, in view of creation, "When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (@Job 38: 7). Music has a remarkable place in the divine realm. If you examine passages in Chronicles referring to music, you will find there is much to show that
{88}
music, which is under the direction of God's Spirit, has an uplifting effect. It is a great thing for the brethren to be able to sing. The effect of it is the sons of God will shout for joy. The word shout is used generally as meaning a shout of victory or triumph. We should be able to bring in an element of harmony in singing that so affects the brethren that the sons of God shout for joy -- not groan in misery. There is no such custom in the assemblies. Oh, but you say, the times are very difficult. They are; but has God changed? Has the precious truth altered? No. Oh, that the Lord may so help us in spiritual energy and power that we may be found among the stars that sing. It is the morning stars that sing -- not the persons who are in the darkness of the night, and who say it is so difficult that I cannot see the way. You belong to the morning stars, and you should be with the morning stars singing, and the sons of God will shout with joy. By that means you will bring into the assemblies an element of holy triumph in what God is, and what the Lord is. Oh, that we may be found among those that sing. Do you know the Lord sang? It says (@Matthew 26: 30), "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives", teaching us that singing a hymn has an elevating effect, similar to this, that the sons of God shouted for joy. May He help us in this, so that we may develop in what is called for in @Psalm 148, where the exhortation is to the stars to praise God. So that we may not only be singing in our own soul's happiness in the knowledge of what the Lord has done; but voicing our praises, rejoicing in what God is, and what He has done, and expressing our love for Him, and for His own Son.
{89}
It is a great thing to be among the stars that are praising. You must understand, whenever there is an allusion to things of this character, there is a spiritual thought behind it, and the spiritual thought behind it is that we are called upon to praise. A person who is going on badly cannot sing praises. He has a bad conscience, and if he has not a bad conscience, he ought to have. So in order to have our part and place here among the stars that are praising, our walk must be according to God. Perhaps that is the reason, although one hesitates to think it, that certain of the saints do not sing. Is it because they are not happy? Is it because there is some secret thing in the soul -- something that has been unjudged, some unforgiving spirit? Is this the reason why we cannot sing?
Oh, that there might be heart-searching and self-judgment, so that we may not only be among the singing stars, but that we may be among those who are praising God. It is a great service; God delights in it -- to hear the voices of His people praising Him -- and He delights to hear our voices raised in praise to the Lord Jesus, for in so doing we take part in that which is going on for ever and ever. The spirit of praise will for eternity be on our lips. May God put it there on our lips for praising Him.
I notice we sometimes have meetings that are placed open, to enable the brethren to speak to us; but why do we not speak to the Lord, and why do we not praise Him? Why do not two or three rise to address the Lord in praise? It would be a wonderful thing. We are called upon to "praise him, all ye stars of light" (@Psalm 148: 3). That is what God is looking for, and what heaven is waiting for.
{90}
Now, leading along this line, we come to another range of things entirely, and I remind the brethren of an instance that is recorded in the book of Judges (chapter 4), when the king of Canaan came up against the people of God. What immense power he had -- great chariots of iron, and great forces against God's people. He had a great general in his army, as you remember, called Sisera. Now we have to remember that there are forces, unseen and unknown often, to us, which are against us. You know Satan and all his emissaries are against us. We have to enter into conflict, not with flesh and blood, but with the lords of darkness, who are against us because of our elevation to the heavenly places. That is where Satan is for the moment, and he will not tolerate that we should, in spirit and thought and affections, occupy the heavenly places. The Lord has gone up there. He has gone up far above all heavens, and Satan knows it, and he knows it is not long before he will be dislodged, and so he is against us. Now God's people appealed to Jehovah, and God took up two women, one of whom was a notable sister, Deborah; and God will often take up the sisters. Perhaps we brothers do not realise the place the sisters have, but we have to come to it. God will often, in an assembly, take up sisters, and He will work in them and through them, so that a victory is secured. That has happened more than once; and what the Lord showed in reference to this conflict of the king of Canaan with the people of God, was that the stars fought against Sisera. Deborah in her wonderful song alludes to it.
It says, "The stars from their courses fought with Sisera" (@Judges 5: 20). What a comfort it is to realise that
{91}
the people of God may come in, as identified with an exercise which the Lord may awaken possibly through the women. God has done wonderful things through women in church history, and indeed in all history. We have to remember that there is an opportunity for us to have a part in the conflict against what is opposing the people of God. I want to ask you if you realise what it is to be found among the stars that are fighting. The stars, it says, from their courses fought with Sisera. Are you among them? There may be some conflict in the assembly where you are. Are you among them? I have heard brothers say, 'The meeting is so late, I am not going. I am so tired, and it is just a prayer meeting'. The stars from their courses fought with Sisera, it says. Are we prepared to sacrifice anything and everything, to take part in the conflict as fighting stars? That is what is called for. And the effect of the stars fighting against Sisera was that Jael came with a thing you would look on with disdain, to bring down a great military general. She took a tent-pin and a hammer; she knew the moment to strike, when he was off his guard, and she struck at the critical moment. Why? Because the stars from their courses fought with Sisera. Do we know what it is to be in conflict? I am sometimes asked if I have taken part in military affairs, and I always say 'Yes'. It involves fighting under this banner, which is Christ's banner, and His banner over us is love, and the conflict in which we stand for the truth is faced by us, and we stand in it because we love Him. We desire in all our dealings to be actuated by holy love, and holy love is intolerant of evil. We must take part here in Canada -- in Hamilton, in Toronto, wherever we may be, as long as the assembly is
{92}
on earth. We must have our part among the stars that "*from their courses*" fought with Sisera. Remarkable words. You must know what course you are on. There are ordered ways, or courses, for stars, and the fighting goes on. The war is on, engagement after engagement, until the last great battle will come, and the saints will be translated to heaven. The truth is being maintained here on this earth, and it is being maintained by the Lord in heaven, and the stars are engaged here in conflict. May the Lord give us preparedness of heart to be here as good soldiers; as Paul says to Timothy, "Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" (@2 Timothy 2: 3).
This is what we need, otherwise we may have to be numbered among the falling stars, for there are such. The Lord refers, in @Mark 13: 25, to a day that is coming when the stars of heaven shall be falling down, and there have been many among believers that might be numbered among the fallen stars. I do not know whether you have in mind any believers whom you know who are fallen stars. I have met them; I have seen them; some who once took a prominent part in assembly affairs, are now in the world. Persons who once had a place among the people of God, are now among those who are seeking to mutilate the truth. It is a solemn thing to feel that I may be there. Hourly watchfulness, diligence in prayer, is required that we may be preserved, that we may not be among the fallen stars.
There are certain who are referred to as wandering stars. Jude tells us of them (verse 13). He describes them so that there is no doubt as to them. There are people who have been numbered among the people of God, who are far from the truth, and I have no doubt they are wandering
{93}
stars. It says, "to whom has been reserved the gloom of darkness for eternity". If you have any fear that your course is such, I beg you in sincerity of heart, to get into the presence of the Lord. Allow those eyes that are as a flame of fire (@Revelation 1: 14) to search you, and inquire whether you really belong to Him, lest it be said of you, "the gloom of darkness for eternity". May the Lord help us in regard to these serious matters.
I want to turn to what I may speak of as an individual position, and the brethren will understand what I have in mind. We were speaking together in the afternoon of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the passage I read in the gospel of Matthew we have certain details which are not mentioned by Luke in his account. In Matthew's gospel mention is made of the wise men who came from the east, and they saw a remarkable thing. They say, "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born? for we have seen his star" (@Matthew 2: 2), (not stars -- His star). And that star appears to have moved and stood over the place where Christ was. It is said that when they saw His star they rejoiced.
Now I put it to my own heart -- indeed I have done so already, I trust, but one would do so again -- and to all the brethren here: Are you the Lord's star in the place that the Lord has allowed you to be? That star in the east may have been a very wonderful star, and I conclude it was a marvellous star as to its shining, but all else is forgotten in this, that it was His star. The only thing for which that star shone was to show where He was. Now I ask you, in your family, what are you shining for? Is it to bring Him in? Is that what you are shining for? As a husband with a wife,
{94}
how do you shine? Is it that she may know more of Christ, and that He may be greater to her? As father, do you shine that Christ may be known in your household, so that the children may know the Lord? Is He loved, and is a greater place given to Him than to any one in the house?
And in the assembly, are you a star that guides to Him? Is our influence where we are set such that it has this one result in leading every eye to Christ, so that He is known, He is worshipped, He is loved? Or have we risen to a position of leading, for the sheer love of being first? Such are not of His stars. No, you might think you are, but -- you will excuse me speaking to you gently and affectionately -- you are not His star. You will not lead us to Him, for He never took that place. You may say, 'But I am leader'. Where do you lead? Leading brother, where do you lead? Do you lead to this -- that those who are seeking Christ, when they see you shining, find Him and forget you? His star had this effect -- that when the wise men saw that star and went to the place over which that star stood, they forgot the star, and worshipped Him and that is what we must be as His stars. If you and I do not lead to Christ, we are diverting from Him. As His stars, the only thing for you and me is to guide to where He is, so that He is worshipped and we are forgotten.

RESTFULNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST
R BESLEY
@Genesis 45: 1 - 8
What I desire to refer to in speaking of this passage of scripture is the need for restfulness in having to do with the Lord. I am not now referring quite to our side of matters. It is desirable indeed that we should be at rest in drawing near to the Lord; but what I have rather more in mind is His drawing near to us; and with that in view I have referred to this incident in Joseph's history.
I do not think that we perhaps value as we should the intensity of the Lord's desires to be with us, and to have us at home with Him. I am not speaking exclusively of the occasion of the Lord's supper, when the Lord Jesus may come to assembled saints. But I am speaking of the occasions when the Lord manifestly draws near to His people, in order to speak to them, and I am convinced that all will agree that the gain of the Lord's address to us is not possible if we are not at home with Him.
Now how wonderful it is that there are emotions, deep, measureless emotions in the heart of Jesus towards us. Think of that, think of the Personage as typified in Joseph. You might have said Joseph has enough to satisfy him in Egypt. Look at the pomp and splendour surrounding his place in the court, think of the eminence in which he is as the saviour of the world, and the revealer of secrets. But these were more or less official positions, dignities which invested him; and one might speak of the
{96}
place of glory in which Jesus is in heaven. He has a glory in heaven surpassing the accumulated glory of all others. That is the glory which rests upon His brow in heaven, the once crucified, despised and hated Man -- what a place! He has dignities investing Him. He has official glories in that place of light superb. You might say, 'Lord Jesus, these are enough to satisfy Thee'. No. What about these few shepherds who had come into the land of Egypt? That was where Joseph's heart lay; they were his brethren. Christ has in heaven glories, yet there are affections in that wonderful heart that can only be satisfied in having our companionship. What a wondrous consideration that is.
The arrival of the brethren of Joseph as he looked on them stirred the emotions of his heart, so that he had to cry, "Put every man out from me" (@Genesis 45: 1). The ministry of the truth in the power of the Spirit, from Christ in glory has in view to cause these elements in us, elements of the flesh, to go out. Now the question is, is every man going out? All that belongs to us as of this world is a distinct hindrance to the manifestation of Christ amongst His people. One Egyptian remaining there would have restrained the intense emotions of the heart of Joseph.
Now the ministry of the truth which we have received -- many of us for many years -- is, in the Lord's mind, to the intent that every man should go out. Now have we heard that voice of power, "Put every man out from me?" That was the command from the lips of Joseph. It was not a question now of disapproval of these elements, of these persons. It was that there were such intense emotions in the heart of Joseph that the presence of Egyptians, the presence of persons who were unsympathetic, would have
{97}
restrained them, would have hindered him, and so he gave this command, put every man out.
Now are we prepared to disallow the flesh -- are we prepared for that? It is a searching question, beloved brethren. I feel it deeply for myself, because the element of the world which is in us, and clings to us interferes with what the Lord desires to do; He desires to make Himself known to us. What a thing that this great and exalted Personage desires to make Himself known. He is not seeking the courts of the world, He is not knocking at any palace doors, He is knocking at the doors of our hearts, and He says, "Put every man out".
They went out, and the pent-up emotions of the heart of Joseph found an outlet in loud weeping -- weeping of intense emotion, intense joy, and I think one has discerned the evidences of the Lord's intense emotions as having liberty to come among His people. You may say, 'I know nothing about that'. There is a reason for that. This priceless joy which is within the reach of every believer is only known at the cost of surrender. If we are harbouring and clinging to what belongs to us as in the flesh, clinging to what we may be naturally; whether it be in talents, or attainments, or social rank in this world, it is a hindrance to the most wonderful joy that believers here can ever know; the manifestation of the Lord Jesus in the intensity of His love for His own. That is what He is seeking in the assembly.
You understand now that I am speaking of movements on the Lord's side towards us, and not of movements on our side towards Him. The emotions of the heart of Christ are so precious that they cannot be divulged in the
{98}
presence of Egyptians, so He says, "Put every man out". He gave vent to his love in loud weeping, and the Egyptians heard and the house of Pharaoh heard. It is not too much to say that this world has heard the joy that is known in the assembly, has known that such a thing is. It may have no intelligence in regard to it, but the thing is known, it has had its effect in the world.
Now that is the move on the part of Joseph to make himself known. The Egyptians have been disposed of -- they have gone out. We are walking in a path of separation from the world, I hope. If not it is high time to begin, and it is not too late to begin. The cleavage between us and the world must be absolute in heart. The taking of the Lord's supper, if it is understood, is an avowal publicly, that Jesus is our Lord. That is the meaning of the Lord's supper; it is the Lord's supper. All of us here who are the Lord's have passed very definitely from the kingdom of darkness, to the kingdom of the Son of God's love. Supposing I went over to France, and petitioned the authorities that I desired now henceforth to be a citizen of the French Republic. I renounce every right here, and I take some steps to avow my allegiance to that government. Now the crossing over from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of God's love is as real as that, and more so. Have we passed over? On the Lord's Day we eat that bread, and we drink of that cup, as a definite avowal that Jesus is Lord. The days that follow are to be in correspondence with that; otherwise the situation is dishonest -- it is unreal.
So we have caused the Egyptians to go out, I trust. Joseph discovers now that there is another element to be dealt with. It says here, "His brethren could not answer
{99}
him, for they were troubled at his presence". Now, why is it that the Spirit of God is quenched in the assembly of God? I am not speaking now of His being grieved -- a most affecting consideration. Think of a divine Person being grieved. I am not speaking of His being grieved -- I am speaking of His being quenched.
We were speaking this afternoon of certain manifestations of the Spirit that take place in the assembly of God, in relation to the body of Christ. When the Lord manifests Himself in the way of ministry, or in the way of His presence as coming among us, there are occasions when those who are there are troubled. I suppose we all know what it is to have sat uneasily during an address. Sometimes a word of ministry causes uneasiness. Why? If the Lord speaks, if He speaks in a voice of thunder, we are not disturbed unless there be some secret question there that has never been touched. Is this condition of things obtaining among us, beloved brethren? Do allow me to talk plainly and affectionately. Are any troubled at His presence? Have you a good conscience? Are you silent in the assembly? That is abnormal. The Lord's desire is that all should come near to Him, and the Lord's voice is heard in the assembly in the way of ministry, or He may pursue His own ends by the Holy Spirit in a manifestation. The Lord speaks in a remarkable way on occasions to His people. But He does it for what? So that all distance may be removed.
I am greatly exercised as to why there are certain ones who appear to take no part in the functioning of the assembly. This is a condition of things that should not be. In the type, Joseph desired that all the brothers should be
{100}
free with him, and I am sure that his heart was deeply moved as he felt that they were troubled at his presence. One desires to speak with due care, and reverently, of the Lord. What must He feel when He finds us troubled at His presence? You ask a brother in the assembly, when you can get near enough to him so as not to wound his spirit, and you say, 'My dear brother, why do you never take part in the assembly?' The usual answer is, 'I am not free'. Why is that? I believe every one should be free to function in the assembly. Every sister should be free in her sphere; the young sisters should be free -- they should be holy women. There should be a difference between them, and the women of the world, as light is from darkness. The fact is the elements of the world have got in among the people of God, and we must cause the Egyptian to go out; that is what must be done. Think of people coming into the assembly, and you do not know them from people of the world. Dear brethren let me say, in all love and gentleness, these things ought not so to be.
Why should we imitate the fashions of the world? Why not imitate the fashions of heaven? That is where we belong, and in demeanour and dress we want to bear the moral marks of heaven, and what is outward is an indication of what is inward. Now what about affection for Christ? We are definitely pledged in love to Him. What about our pledge? What about your body? We were speaking in the afternoon about our bodies being holy. Think of a holy vessel. Think of a holy body, in which the emotions of sin are disallowed. Think of a heart devoted absolutely to Christ.
{101}
I believe there is a custom in the apostate church, a most terrible imitation of the church, of what is called taking the veil -- absolute devotion to Christ. Love calls for that. Could anyone view the cross in all its anguish and desolation, without giving a whole heart to Christ? He gave His whole heart to us then; nothing deterred Him -- shame and spitting, agony immeasurable. Such was the devotion of Jesus to you. What is the answer, dear brethren? What is the answer to it all?
Now there were in the hearts of the brethren of Joseph deep questions that had never been settled, and I believe there are questions which are not settled in the hearts of the saints. Have you forgiveness of sins? 'Oh', you say, 'I am breaking bread'. I was not asking if you were breaking bread. I asked have you had your sins forgiven? Is the matter really settled? Are you really clear that you are forgiven? Have you got peace with God? Do you know that you are justified? What about being justified? God delivered Jesus for our offences. What a thing to do. Why, it was God against whom I had offended; it was the blessed God against whom I had sinned; it was He against whom my will had risen in repeated opposition; He it was who delivered Jesus for our offences, and He raised Him again for our justification. Have you believed that? 'Oh', you say, 'I believe Jesus has risen'. No, that is not what it says. I have no doubt you believe He is risen. Have you believed that God raised Him for your justification? When that wonderful testimony is believed, God justifies the person. No one justifies himself, it is God who justifies. As Paul says, "Who is he that condemns?" (@Romans 8: 34). The believer is clear from every charge; he is justified, and he
{102}
has peace with God, and, as having the Holy Spirit, the love of God is shed abroad in his heart.
Now do we know what these things are? Do you know that you are justified? Justified means that no charge can be brought against you, neither now nor at any time. Now what about the dominion of sin? What kind of life are you going to live?
The soul history outlined in the epistle to the Romans is of vast importance, in order to give believers restfulness in the presence of the Lord Jesus. The Lord showed unto the disciples His hands. He showed them what He had done; that is the force of showing His hands (see @Luke 24: 40). I suppose there is hardly an occasion when the precious death of Christ is before us, but we think of what has been secured by Him. He showed them His hands -- His hands, no doubt marked with the print of the nails -- as indicating what He has done.
The effort of the enemy is to rouse all that is natural in me, to do my own will; that in its essence is sin. But sin's dominion is to be destroyed. We are to pass over from the life of the flesh, living here in the indulgence of the flesh, into life in the power of the Spirit. We are to live unto God now, and henceforth. We are entitled to reckon, to count ourselves to have died unto sin, but alive unto God. Now this is very practical. You may say I understand the truth; but that will not do. The understanding of the truth will only bring condemnation upon the conduct, unless there be the pursuit of its way. To understand the truth and yet allow sin to work is a very serious matter. You are not to live any longer in sin.
{103}
Now these experiences are typified in the behaviour of Joseph's brethren; they were troubled; and there are those now who are troubled, they are not free. I know I am touching what is practical. We are to be a holy people, we are to walk in righteousness. Sin's dominion is to be destroyed in the believer; otherwise the holding of the truth is of no value, and we shall come under the discipline of God. If you will not surrender the flesh, and the life of the flesh, then you will come under discipline in order to bring you to things. Paul says to the Corinthians, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep" (@1 Corinthians 11: 30).
Now, beloved, the Lord's love is so intense, He desires to make Himself known to us, and to make us know that we are His brethren. Think of world-bordering; think of persons walking in alliance with the world; think of reading the wretched literature of the world, when the Lord would come to you and say, "I am Jesus". What a word! Do I live unto God? Is it true -- is it really true -- that I live in the power of the Spirit? How can I have anything to do with this world, save to walk humbly, and in a lowly manner through it? Oh, for a heart to love Him more faithfully. Oh, for zeal that would walk in conformity to the light of the truth here, so that one might never be troubled. How wonderful and lovely to hear a brother rise and speak to the Lord -- with not a cloud between himself and Christ. Yet I may hear another, you know what I mean, laboured and stumbling. Have you ever been there yourself? One troubled in the presence of Jesus. They were troubled, troubled! Oh, dear brethren, I feel the Lord is speaking to us. Would that we might have grace to hear
{104}
His word. He longs to make Himself known to us. Think of how those men must have felt when they saw Joseph in all his royal apparel, probably the chain of gold about his neck, and the ring upon his hand! Think of the glories of the Son of God, the despised and crucified Man, the exalted, glorified, heaven-seated Son of God! Beloved, what shall we be in heart, and life, and practice, so as to be at home with Him? To be His brethren morally we must hear the word of God and do it. We shall then be restful in His presence. What were you reading on Saturday? Were you smoking on Saturday? "I am Joseph your brother" (@Genesis 45: 4). Think of the Lord's intense emotions as desiring to be with us, and we have been troubled. He says, "Come near to me" (@Genesis 45: 4), do not stand afar off; draw near to me. It is an affecting word.
The Lord would have us, dear brethren, occupy this wonderful position. Joseph said, "I am Joseph". The Lord looks upon us as His brethren, of whom He is not ashamed. I have sometimes felt deeply bowed in the sense of that. I know what I am. I know of the smallness and littleness of what I am; but think that I am ranked as one of His brethren. I can speak with holy confidence, He is God blessed for ever, but He would have us at home with Him. The emotions of that heart will never be satisfied until He has us at home with Him. May He bring it to pass for His blessed name's sake.

VALUATION
R BESLEY
@Leviticus 27: 1 - 8; @Matthew 11: 2 - 4, 11; @Matthew 16: 13 - 18; @Matthew 26: 6 - 13; @Acts 9: 15, 16
I want to try and show that we are all subject to a divine estimation. It is sometimes said that it matters little how we are valued down here, but I take serious exception to that statement. We ought to be gravely concerned as to how we are valued down here; it is a matter for grave exercise, or should be, to us all. I do not refer to what the world may think of us. But what I am anxious to arrive at is that we are all set down in the *divine* account. I have an impression that the estimation is written down, and the estimation is the estimation of the priest, and I want your heart to be full of joy in the realisation of the estimation. I am sure every one here will value it much, that they are estimated according to the ability of the Lord to value. I believe that one's estimation of the brethren should correspond with the Lord's estimation of them. Many of us are estimated by others a great deal too highly: some of us are perhaps undervalued; but we are to think soberly, dear brethren, the apostle says. Sometimes a brother will say, 'Well, I am a poor thing, I am no good'. I sometimes wonder whether he really believes what he says. We are to think soberly, and wisely; and we should covet to be near enough to the Lord, and sufficiently often in the holiest, to know what the Lord's estimation is.
{106}
Now in the last chapter of Leviticus we have the matter of estimation according to God, and estimation according to the valuation of the priest. Doubtless you have noticed in reading the passage, that the valuation of the male differs from that of the female. At your leisure it will interest you to note the difference between the valuations; they are not regular. According to age, the valuation of the male and the female differs. I believe the spiritual meaning of the valuation of the male and the female suggests for us the valuation according to what we are according to divine purpose. The valuation according to what we are in God's ways here; that is the measure of what is actually wrought in us, what is entered into by us. You might say to me that every one is valued alike. Well, every one stands in divine favour, and stands before God in divine righteousness; all stand in the blessedness of what Christ is as risen. But you must understand that when it comes to a question of the world to come, and possibly eternity, there are variations. For instance, when one thinks of the apostle Paul, the great place that he has in relation to the divine structure, one will readily conceive that he has a distinctive place in valuation, even in relation to the ways of God on earth, and the assembly of God. But speaking of matters in the main, the valuation of the male and female, has respect to the place divinely given to us according to the purpose of God, and the place we have in relation to the formation wrought here in us in the power of the Spirit. The valuation all through in the male is higher, showing that the place we have in the divine reckoning, and the estimation in respect to the place divinely given according
{107}
to purpose and counsel, is always higher than anything we have reached here.
So I want you to understand the blessedness of what it is to view ourselves, as taken up before ever the world began, in the purpose and counsel of God, and the place given to us in that connection. Things are not done in any sense by the Lord in estimation, as we should say, by guesswork. I have seen men estimating here on earth, and they run their eye over a building and say, so much. The Lord never does a thing like that. The estimation is accurate, and is according to the shekel of the sanctuary; it is God's estimation. I want you to think that the Lord has estimated your value. He knows exactly the place that was given you according to purpose, chosen of God in Christ, and the place that you will have in the divine structure. He knows, too, your actual state, what has been formed in you. There is an estimation from five years old. Think of a young convert, a boy or girl converted yesterday. They were the subjects of divine purpose before ever the world began, and the Lord estimates them according to that, and He estimates them also according to the work that is actually there. You may say it is faith that is there. It may be a very simple faith; but because a person is only recently converted, it does not follow that the measure of faith is small. On the contrary, in a person recently converted, often the faith is wonderful. Never discredit what is in a young person, because they are young. I have often thought that I would have given anything to see older persons with the faith of a little child. I dare say you have noted in a child, a most extraordinary faith. So that you must never underestimate the young people. Always try to
{108}
remember that they have been estimated according to the estimation of the priest. So that we, as brothers and sisters in the assembly of God, would do well to become intimate with the sanctuary, to be much in the presence of the Lord. Somebody said once, 'What a wonderful thing for the priest to have access to the holy place'. I remember saying to a clergyman once, in a railway train, 'It must be a wonderful thing to be a priest;' and he looked at me and said, 'Indeed, it is'. I said, 'It must be a wonderful thing to be able to go into the presence of the Lord'. He looked at me with the utmost astonishment and said, 'I am afraid I do not know much about that!' Are you accustomed to the sanctuary? Do you know what it is to go in and speak intimately with the Lord, who is the great Priest in the house? What an indescribable something there is about such people. I do not know any human language to describe it -- persons who are intimate with the holy place, so that you have some sense of His estimation of you. It is a very sobering thing.
Now God may have to resort to a sign, in order, perhaps, to give a sense of the estimation. You remember that the heads of the tribes of Israel had to lay up their rods before Jehovah, after the rebellion of Korah and his company, and the word was that God would speak to the man whose rod budded. Now what is the estimation? You recall how they had to come and take their rods. Think of coming and finding your rod just as it was before -- no buds, no blossom, no almonds on it. But God showed by whom He was going to speak. It was Aaron; and there are times when you and I have to lay up our rods and learn that God is not going to speak by us. What is His
{109}
estimation of me on this occasion -- not last week, but now? It must be a living thing, and it will impart great power to us in the house of God, as knowing what the divine estimation is. It matters little what people think of you in the world, although I would like people to think that this is a man who wears the breastplate of righteousness. I frequently hear it said, 'There is something about that person that I cannot understand'. A brother was in conversation with a man of the world when another brother came into the office, and, seeing there was an interview going on, he retired, and the worldly man said to the brother, 'That is an extraordinary sort of man. I feel that man is a holy sort of man'. Would you like to bear priestly garments like that? He was in moral accord with the estimation. Now that is what I would like, and that is what we must covet -- we must covet this. Difficulties come in, Paul says, "That the approved may become manifest" (@1 Corinthians 11: 19). It is approval we need; it is sweeter than anything. I need the Lord's estimation, and I do not believe that the Scripture would justify the idea that the estimation is unvarying, for I believe it may vary. The place given to us according to the purpose and counsel of God does not vary, but the estimation according to what we are here in our growth practically may greatly vary. Are you exercised about the word of God, with you and in you? Does it ever cause you any concern? What are you doing? How are you shaping your course? How are you occupying yourself, with a view to divine working? What about the vessel in the hands of the potter? Do you ever think about it? What is the use of getting up in the morning and getting through the day anyhow? I understand that life
{110}
is an arena where God is preparing a vessel. Have you ever been through a pottery? How remarkable are the processes the clay goes through, till at last it stands a thing of beauty, perfect symmetry. What has done it all? Working has done it. How I have watched the people of God, until, seeing some going home, I have seen a vessel of mercy prepared for glory. It matters little what happens to you down here, as long as we are being prepared, so that the estimation of the priest may set us down at the value that will please Him, and be more truly in accord with God having taken you up.
You may say, 'I do not know why it is that at the close of my life I seem to have nothing but sorrow'. Shall I tell you why it is? There is a vessel being prepared for glory. Oh, the loveliness of a vessel when prepared. I do not think there is anything more exquisite on earth, than a vessel ready to go -- prepared for glory. The estimation of the priest may be fifty shekels according to the shekel of the sanctuary. That is what the Lord is doing with us, and the thing is to be near enough to Him. My dear brother, how often do you speak to the Lord? Do you have morning reading? Is that the only time you speak to Him? In the evening when you kneel down and close your eyes before you sleep, is that all? No one loves your company like Jesus. Do you think He misses it? He might say, 'He never speaks to Me unless he is in need'. It is rather painful when a friend has to say to you, 'When was the last time you came to see me?' 'Well, let me see, it was when I was in trouble'. Would the Lord have to say, 'You never come to sit down under My shadow with great delight'. And being with Him would give us a sense of His estimation.
{111}
I want to show you first of all, the estimation of the Lord of a *convert*, and I refer to Paul, or, as he was then, Saul; he was a convert. And Ananias was not prepared to give him any value at all. He said, "I have heard from many concerning this man". Now reports may be dangerous. "I have heard", he says, but the Lord will not accept that. The Lord judges by what He knows, not by what He hears, and it is not always a safe thing to be guided by reports. The Lord's estimation of this young man, Saul, is exceedingly beautiful, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel". He was a chosen vessel, the great apostle to the gentiles, and the one through whom the truth of the mystery was to come out, and the word of God was to be completed. But, nevertheless, such was the character of Saul's conversion that the estimation of the man is, "This man is an elect vessel to me". Now I want you to understand that every young convert is not necessarily a chosen vessel in *that* sense; but, nevertheless, every one *is* a definite choice of the Lord. What are you going to say to a person if the Lord has chosen him? What are you going to do with a brother or sister converted yesterday, if the Lord has chosen him? It alters the place a person has in my thoughts at once, when I regard the estimation of the priest, the valuation. That person, although he may have fled in dire need to the Lord, yet He has chosen him. He may be a tiny vessel, as compared with the great vessel, but a vessel nevertheless, and that is the Lord's estimation and valuation, and we should never value anyone at a less valuation than that. Have you ever thought of your child? You say, 'He loves the Lord'. Well,
{112}
thank God he does. Would you like to look at your boy, and feel that he is chosen, the Lord has taken him up, that is His valuation of him. You say, 'He is only a little fellow, just converted'. Yes, but he has been taken up, chosen of the Lord. "An elect vessel to me". You will regard your child very differently, if you can regard him in that light. Now, how are you going to frame your child's life in future? What do you want him to be? A Bachelor of Science? What for? He is "An elect vessel to me". Do we care for our children, and bring them up ever having that in mind? What did Hannah do? She said, 'I will give him to the Lord'. Have we done that with our children? "An elect vessel" -- that is the valuation, the Lord's valuation, the estimation of the priest. To you, my dear little boy, if you should be here, and if you know and love the Lord, I want you to understand that this great Personage has put out His hand, and chosen you as a vessel, to be for Him -- that is the valuation. "Let no one despise thy youth", said Paul to Timothy (@1 Timothy 4: 12). He had some sense of the valuation of the priest.
Now I want to go on from that to speak a word with regard to the valuation of the *disciple*. In @Matthew 16, it says with regard to the visit to Caesarea-Philippi, that the Lord was with His disciples, not the apostles, they were that, but disciples. He begins to inquire, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" What is their valuation of Him? I do not know how you regard the world. I do not want to speak disrespectfully of the world at all, but when I think of the poor ability of the world to value what is great, I am not attracted to the world at all. The princes of the world did not know the Lord of glory, and they
{113}
crucified Him. That has stamped the world forever as a community that cannot be trusted, and I am not going to accept their judgment for a moment. Now the Lord says, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" Well, John the baptist risen again. They are all in the dark, you see. Ask the men of the world about Christ, the Holy One of God -- think of the infamous blasphemies! Young man, are you looking to the world for judgment and wisdom? You will never find it there. What is the valuation of our Lord? Now as to choosing your friends, are you going to choose friends who have undervalued the Lord? I will not be seen in their company, I will not have anything to do with people who have undervalued the Son of God; they are not my company, and I am sure I am not theirs. So the Lord goes on, "But *ye*, who do ye say that I am?" Now Peter has been sovereignly taken up by the Lord. I admit that this is special to Peter, but the principle of the thing is the same. Now the Lord says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". Now that is the Lord's estimation of a disciple, that he was the subject of revelation from the heavens, from the Father. That is special to Peter. There is no such revelation to anyone now -- the revelation is complete. But the principle of the thing remains, that to a disciple there may be given light with regard to the revelation. That is possible to us all, for the thing comes into our souls in the way of light, and you may have the light of the glory of that Person. So the Lord says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona". What an honour for that fisherman, "Blessed art thou". Would you like the Lord to say that to you? He has said it of you, for He said
{114}
to Thomas, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed" (@John 20: 29). You are blessed in His view. Think of the Lord saying you are blessed. Have you ever put that down close to your heart, 'He has said that I am blessed'. That is His valuation of you as a disciple, one that has a heart open to get light from heaven. If ever there was a day when we do need to have light from heaven it is now. There is marvellous ministry given in the assembly, but there is something more than that, and that is light from heaven for yourself. I do not discredit one word that has been spoken and written for a minute, for I value it all immensely. But there is something greater, and that is to get a ray of light for yourself, and you can have it, and the Lord's word with reference to one who has it is, "Blessed art thou".
Well, now, I just want to say one word with reference to the Lord's valuation of a *sister*. I refer to the woman in the house of Simon the leper. She brought the alabaster box of very precious ointment, and put it on the head of Jesus and anointed Him. There was a dispute about it -- the ointment should have been sold, and it was a waste, and so on. Now the Lord says that His estimation of her is that "She has wrought a good work ... What *she* could she has done" (@Mark 14: 6, 8). He so valued what was done that He said that wherever the gospel is preached this would be spoken of for a memorial. Think of that woman having a memorial in this world. That woman's act has come up in the assemblies as a memorial all over the world. If you go to Sydney and ask the brethren there if they have ever heard about that woman, they will say, 'Yes, we often speak of her'. Ask the brethren in South Africa or in New
{115}
York. I have been through parts of Europe, and in every meeting I have been, they know about her. My dear sister, would you not like to have a valuation like that? But you cannot have *that* one; *she* has got it. But what is the priest's valuation of you? Supposing the Lord were to come right down here, would you like Him to tell us His valuation of you? You say, 'No, I would not'. Well, He will not; but He knows. What is your life? Is it laid at His feet? Can you think of what He has suffered for you, and not put your life at His feet? Would you like to go straight to heaven, and put your head down at His feet, and put your whole soul's homage at His blessed feet? May the Lord work in us that there may be a valuation of us that is in keeping with what is priestly. Some of you young people would like to have some letters after your name; you would like to be something in this world. It is not worth being anything in this world, where your Saviour only had a cross and grave. Be something in God's world; have an estimation at the mouth of the priest, and nothing can take its place.
Just briefly, I want to speak of John the baptist as the Lord's valuation of *a servant* in @Matthew 11. Now John was shut up in prison, and it says that he heard of Christ in the prison. It would appear that for a moment John's better judgment was swayed by what he heard. So the Lord gives a wonderful guide as to confirming a judgment. "Go, report to John what ye hear and see". I do not think we are to be much governed by things we hear, unless there is something to see. Reports are sometimes dangerous. Every report must be borne out by something that can be seen; so the Lord says to the disciples, "Go, report to John what ye
{116}
hear and see. Blind men see ..". And then the Lord runs over what has happened. He knows perfectly well that John will not doubt for a moment. I am certain that John never wavered for an instant; he knew who had come. Now the Lord gives, in the hearing of those about Him, the valuation of John, and He says, "There is not arisen among the born of women a greater than John the baptist". You might say John was very low down when he did not believe in the prison that the Lord had come. Now what are you going to do with a brother like that? Well, you say, 'That is a very poor brother'. The Lord's valuation of him according to the estimation of the priest, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, is that "There is not arisen among the born of women a greater than John the baptist". That is, in that order of service, in that dispensation, as having regard to the bringing in of the Lord. Moreover, He says, quoting scripture in reference to him from @Malachi 3: 1, "Behold ... my messenger ..". In prison? Yes, but "my messenger". Now that is a very serious thing for this world. I am afraid we do not perhaps realise what a serious position this world is in. "My servant" has been put in prison in this world by the hands of the political power, and the Lord Himself has been crucified and slain. That is what this world has done, and there is a day of reckoning coming for this world yet. I want you to feel that while you may pray for the salvation of poor sinners in the world, there is a line of demarcation between ourselves and the world, that no one can overlook.
I wonder if there is any one here who is not converted. You belong to this world that put the Lord's messenger in prison and crucified the Lord of glory. If there is any one
{117}
here unconverted, I beg you to flee for your life. Turn to Christ immediately; do not let another sun set over your head. Flee as if your whole life depended upon it, and accept the Lord Jesus as your Saviour, and believe in Him and confess Him, and you will be free of this world, and you will have the valuation of a new convert; you are chosen and taken up by Him. Here is the valuation of a servant. I question if John ever heard it. It is a wonderful estimation. He says, nevertheless, "But he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he". He belongs to another dispensation altogether, but that does not disallow the great place that John had in the Lord's valuation as a servant. And that is where we fail, beloved brethren, in our service; we may waver, for we are but poor weak men, but our service will always be valued at its highest possible estimation according to the estimation of the priest. I want nothing more than that. If I can only have a valuation from Him, and the estimation from His mouth, and hear Him say one day (great though the sense of weakness is in regard to all our service), "Well done, thou good bondman" (@Luke 19: 17). That is the valuation of the priest, for every man shall have praise of God.
May the Lord keep our souls in the sense of it for His name's sake.

THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF CHRIST
C C ELLIOTT
@Song of Songs 5: 9, 10, 16
On the last three occasions I spoke of the work of the Holy Spirit. I want to speak of the One of whom the Holy Spirit tells -- the One whom He makes dear and real to our hearts. I feel that our defect is want of affection for Christ. I therefore desire to speak tonight of some of the attractions of Christ. We all know a little about them; but I thought I might present Him in various aspects to our souls, so that His attractiveness might have a greater effect upon us. The essence of christianity, the very centre of christianity is the attractiveness of Christ. If our hearts really are attracted to Christ, and we ponder over His beauties, we shall certainly be occupied aright. On the other hand, if our sense of His attractions wanes and fades, we shall seek other attractions; and which of us here can say that in the course of our christian experience, he has not done so? Why? Because we have not kept close to Christ, and found His attractions sufficient for our hearts. Our affections can really be satisfied with Christ, and I suppose there is not a soul here, a christian, that has not at one time or another found that Christ is sufficient. Yet other things come in, and the attractions of Christ wane.
I want to present, the Lord helping me, some of His features, which come before us in those passages which I have read. The beloved of Solomon gives an account of her beloved. She is able to describe him. They ask her,
{120}
"What is thy beloved more than another beloved?" and she is able to give an account of Him, that He is the chiefest among ten thousand, and the altogether lovely One. That is indeed true of Christ. However dimly we may know Him, there is no doubt He is the chiefest among ten thousand. There is not a defect in Him: He is altogether lovely.
In speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ personally, the whole of Scripture lies before us. It speaks of Him from beginning to end; but I want first of all to show you how certain persons we read of were attracted to Him. Let us take His attractiveness to some of the apostles. Peter was called from fishing to follow the Lord. You only follow a person who is attractive to you. Peter followed Him because he found something attractive in Christ. That is just the point. There is something in Christ that we have found, something almost indescribable, that draws us to Him, something of Him that we know in our hearts, and so we follow Him. However little we may know Him, our souls have found something of what Christ is, and it attracts our hearts, and we follow the Person who has thus displayed Himself to us. As we continue, there is the most extraordinary array of beauties that our souls gather from the contemplation of Christ. The two disciples in @John 1 were touched. They did not merely follow what John said, but Jesus Himself. There was something in the Lord Jesus which attracted them, and that is what happens to us: we follow. Peter found that, and he followed Him all his life. It is true he denied the Lord; but he said, when the Lord spoke to him before about it and warned him, "Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death" (@Luke 22: 33). You will say that was boasting. He
{121}
meant it. He felt if he could be in the Lord's presence and company, he would go to prison and death with Him. That was not a hypocritical statement. It was true at that moment; he was so impressed with the Lord and what He was, and so attracted to Him, that he said, with Thee I will go to prison and death. Not, I will go to prison and death *for* Thee, but *with* Thee, meaning that if he had the Lord's company, he could face prison and death. That is quite true, and shows how Peter was really attracted. He did not fail in affection, but because of self-confidence. He did not fail even in faith, because the Lord said, "*I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not" (@Luke 22: 32). If the Lord offers up a prayer for any one of us, that prayer is going to be answered. He prayed that Peter's faith would not fail, and it did not fail; his courage failed. I wanted to show you that, despite the failures, he was attracted to Christ. And so the Lord said to him at the end, "follow thou me;" continue in the path in which I am the attractive Object of your heart.
Take a less known apostle, Thomas. What does he say? "Let *us* also go, that we may die with Him" (@John 11: 16). He felt like Peter, if he could only die with the Lord, he would be prepared to die -- not only for Him but with Him. Death would not be anything if he died with Christ. He failed later in having doubts, but he did say definitely, "Let *us* also go, that we may die with Him". He was so attracted to Christ that he felt he could die with Him. I think we have all perhaps felt that. Supposing this hall was surrounded tonight by a body of policemen, the government having turned against christians, and they said, everyone that professes the name of Christ is going to
{122}
be lined up against the wall and shot. We should say, we would not mind that, we should be pleased to die for Christ. That would not be difficult. The difficulty is to live for Him, and to die with Him now spiritually; to own that we have died with Christ, died to the rudiments of the world and sin. That is a much greater matter. It is more difficult to live daily, or die daily, as Paul says. It would be easier to have a bullet through your heart. Thomas was attracted to Christ, and said he would die with Him. The point is to live for Him.
Take all the apostles, they all followed Him in this world. Sometimes He took them through such dangerous passages that, were it not for the attraction of His Person, they would not have followed. When He went to Jerusalem, it says that as they followed Him they were amazed. They followed fearfully, they were afraid when they followed Him. If it had not been for that powerful attraction of Christ they would not have followed Him. He was going to Jerusalem, where men were going to kill Him. We are so attracted to Christ that we say, Although that path leads me into a position I feel I cannot stand in, yet if He leads, I will follow Him. Sometimes we count the cost and retreat; but let us, like them, keep on, no matter where it leads. We sometimes calculate too much. If I follow Christ in that path, where is it going to lead? To rejection, to scorn, to trouble with the world. May be it is going to lead to trouble with parents, or with fellow christians, because they do not understand that we want to follow Christ. Even though we are amazed and afraid, we follow on because our hearts are attracted to Christ.
{123}
Then take Matthew, the tax-gatherer: he was a man of means. He was sitting taking in money, and money would have a great deal of attraction for him; yet the Lord only said, "Follow me", and he followed Him. He said, I have feasted a great many people, but I am feasting the Lord today, and let those who care to come to the feast with Him, come. He was so attracted to Christ, that at a simple word he went; he was at His disposal. We know what the Lord did further; He chose him as one of His apostles. We find him following Him, one of those who took part in the last supper. He followed Him in that way faithfully. They all failed in the end, it is true, but were all attracted to Him when risen. I have no doubt if we knew about all the apostles, a similar thing could be said of all of them.
John was particularly attracted to Christ. He was so attracted to Christ that he got as near Him as he could; he leaned on His breast at the supper. He had a special place in that sense, in the affectionate heart of Christ. If Christ becomes attractive to us, we get as near Him as we can. We do not stand as far away as we can, content to say we are christians: we like to get as near as we can. What it is to get near to Christ in affections, to have His love daily as a portion of our hearts! Get near Him in affections spiritually. It is possible for all of us to become spiritually near to Christ, and there you will find the attractiveness of Christ. One cannot make it good for another, but there *is* that in Christ; that is what is so extraordinary, that there are thousands of people in this world who are attracted to Christ. So attracted to Christ that His love is known in their hearts, and they get as near Him as they can. It is a very serious matter. Let us examine our consciences. Are
{124}
we getting as near to Christ as we can? Or are we just going on and keeping as near to the edge of the world as possible without having a bad conscience. Are we ignoring the cost, and getting near Christ, or counting the cost and keeping Him at arm's length? Is He still as attractive to us as He was of yore, when our hearts were fresh and loyal? I remember an old christian saying, 'There were times when I would have given my eyes, as Paul said the Galatians would for him, but now, how different!' It was very sad. Later the same brother, many years after, said 'The Lord said to Israel, I remember for thee the days of thy youth, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness. But now!' We do not want that, do we? We all know how gracious the Lord is, that He remembers the days of the warmth of our affection to Him. The day comes when we get colder and the world gets a hold of us, and we will not follow Him into the wilderness. His attractions are not what they were to us.
I was speaking about John, and the attractiveness of the Lord to him. I will just follow that up a little, because it is very remarkable that the Lord, having adopted such an affectionate attitude, and allowed John to adopt it to Himself, assumed such a different form in the book of Revelation -- so much so that the beloved apostle, instead of leaning on His bosom, fell at His feet. What does it mean? It is the attitude of outraged affection, a severe attitude. His head and His hair were white like wool, as white as snow, His eyes were as a flame of fire, His feet were like unto fine brass, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. Why was it? Is that the Lord Jesus Christ? Yes, in His attitude of outraged affection. A great
{125}
love had been bestowed and reciprocated, and then that love is left. Ephesus has left her first love. Therefore the Lord assumes an attitude of that kind. He will not go on with a church devoid of affection. If that continues, the Lord will have nothing more to do with it, He will spue it out of His mouth. "*I* rebuke and discipline as many as I love" (@Revelation 3: 19). The Lord cares nothing for our services and activities, if they are not actuated by love for Him; but if they are, every little service we do for His saints, even a cup of cold water, is grateful to Him. Anything we do for Christ's sake, on account of what He is to us, and because of the love we bear to those whom He loves, He values; but any other kind of activity is dust and ashes, the Lord does not care for it. What is not the effect of love is all in vain. Oh! let us see to it that we do not let our activities obscure the personal love of Christ. We are apt to be like that; we may be extremely active, and do a great many things, and perhaps in our very activities we are barren and our love to Christ wanes. We think our service more important than His heart. He does not want that.
I want to say a word about Paul -- a most wonderful example of the attraction of Christ. I want to show you how powerfully Christ attracted his heart. He may have made mistakes here and there; He was not perfect as Christ was; but I have no doubt the Philippian attitude was maintained in Paul. The things he counted loss, he continued to count as dross. Many of us can say we have had to give up things for Christ. Do we regret it? If we do, we do not hold Christ as attractive to us. If we do not, and we say I am glad I gave that up, and I am going to continue that way, then what is to be compared with the
{126}
knowledge of Christ? Let us see to it that we hold to our vows. Many of us make vows. Let your vows be few: you may make many vows in your ardour. Peter said he would go to prison and death with Him, and Peter denied the Lord; but the Lord gave him another chance. The Lord remembers your brightest day. Is this your brightest day? Should it not be your brightest day spiritually? Age does not make any difference. You should not have to say, I have not made any progress for the last thirty years. It would be a very sad thing: I hope there is not any one like that here.
Oh! the glories of Christ! He is very attractive: continue to get to know Him. Paul's great object was to know Him fully, to have a knowledge of Christ. There is so much in Christ that it will take all our spiritual activities to know Him. Our spiritual eyesight will be fully occupied; our spiritual hearing will be fully engaged; our spiritual affections will be continually expanded.
Take another apostle -- Andrew, about whom we know very little. How do we know he was attracted to Christ? Because he brought his own brother. He thought Christ was so wonderful that he would like his brother to know Him too. If He is good enough for me, He will be good enough for my brother. If you know Christ, you want every one else to know Him. You would seek to do what Andrew did: he brought him to Jesus. He was attracted.
Throughout John's gospel you find it. "My sheep hear my voice ... and they follow me" (@John 10: 27). They are attracted to Him, and as attracted will they not follow? At the end of the gospel Peter saw John following Him. What did the Lord say to him? It does not matter what *he* does --
{127}
"Follow *thou* me". In @Revelation 14 one hundred and forty four thousand follow the Lamb whithersoever He goes. They follow Him because they find Him so attractive. They stand on mount Zion, they have His name and His Father's name on their foreheads. It is the very height of happiness for them to follow the Lamb whithersoever He goes.
In @Revelation 19 the armies in heaven follow Him, as He comes out to judge. That is taking up a very peculiar work -- taking up the work of putting down God's enemies. The horsemen were clothed in white raiment. As it explains in another passage, the white raiment is the righteousnesses of the saints. So the saints follow Him in this holy scene too: the attraction continues.
And so we see that the greatest privilege we can conceive is to be with Him. The apostle refers to it: to depart to be with Christ which is far better; and then he says, speaking of the rapture, "thus we shall be always with the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 17). If we love a person we seek his company. In natural relationships, if two people are engaged to each other, and I find they hardly ever see one another, I should say there is not very much love there. You want the company of the person you love, it is quite natural. It is exactly the same spiritually; if we love Christ, we want to be with Him.
A happy and wonderful thing is that Christ gives us His company now, spiritually, but really; and so He comes to us, and we are with Him, and we find the highest spiritual delight to be with Christ. In the same way, when the Lord spoke to the disciples, He took their affections for granted, as well as His affections for them: "That where I
{128}
am ye also may be" (@John 14: 3). He knew it would be their highest delight to be with Him, as it would be His delight to have them there. It does not say what the Father's house is like. There is no description of it. We do get a description of the holy city, but that is not the Father's house. The Father's house is such as cannot be described, and I am not surprised. How can you describe affection? Enough to say, it is the Father's house. It could not be described, because it is a home of affection; and that is where He wants us to be with Him. The Father's house would not be anything to us if it were not for the love of the Father and the Son.
It is of interest too, that when the Lord gives the promise to the thief on the cross, He says, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise" (@Luke 23: 43). Not today thou shalt be in paradise, but "To-day shalt thou *be with me* in paradise", and this to a soul converted a few minutes before. Do you not understand that there is a link between Christ and the soul that knows Christ? There is a wonderful attraction at once, and you want to be with Him.
I could adduce a number of instances. The demoniac desired that he should be with Him, not merely because he had got such blessings from Him, but there was something in Christ that attracted his heart. If you have anybody dwelling in your heart, how can he be nearer to you? Christ comes near to us: and besides, He dwells in us -- "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" (@Ephesians 3: 17). When the heart responds, then the greatest joy you can have is to be with Christ. I have even noticed that believers who are dying, and have not been walking with Him, say, 'I would like to be with Christ. Despite my
{129}
unfaithfulness and worldliness, despite what I have been in my life, despite the way I have slighted the Lord, I am going to die, and I would like to be with Him', -- because in the soul there is affection for Christ. I do not want that only: I desire that our souls may be really attracted to Him and His beauties. We may understand the attraction of Christ as down here; but this same Person is in glory and we can become acquainted with Christ in glory. Christ can be known to our hearts as He is. We do not have literal access to the glory now, but spiritually we have. As J.N.D. says in `74:5: --
<blockquote>And see! the Spirit's power <br>Has ope'd the heav'nly door, <br>Has brought us to that favoured hour <br>When toil shall all be o'er. </blockquote>
We anticipate the joy of the Father's house, and the joy of the glorified position of Christ. We shall see Him and be like Him; but we now become acquainted with Christ, not only as He was but as He is.
May the Lord grant that He may become more attractive to our hearts. I am certain that if our hearts are more attracted to Christ we shall love His own more. We shall bear with each other: we shall love one another with a pure heart fervently. We shall seek in prayer for the spiritual progress of Christ's loved ones. We shall seek to help each other, not only in material matters, but in spiritual. We should let believers feel 'someone cares for my soul'. A brother who occupied a position where he exhorted people, once said that no one seemed to care to
{130}
exhort *him*. Let us care more for the things of others. If we love Christ we love His own, and seek the good of His own. May God bless His word.

GOD'S GLORIOUS END
W J HOUSE
@Luke 10: 38 - 42; @Luke 24: 50 - 53
One feels, dear brethren, that we cannot too firmly lay hold of the divine principle that "Better is the end of a thing than its beginning" (@Ecclesiastes 7: 8). God would convey to our souls that there is a very wonderful time immediately ahead, and He would encourage us all to be in it -- whole-heartedly in it -- not to let anything stand in the way that would hinder our being in it. The thought runs through the Word of God. Take the heavens and the earth -- in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth -- but the new heavens and the new earth are better than the first heavens and the first earth. For the latter are going to pass away, they are going to disappear but the new heavens and the new earth will not disappear.
In the beginning the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man he had made. That Eden disappeared and nobody could find it -- men have tried but they cannot find it, but the paradise of God in Revelation does not disappear. God has a paradise that will not disappear, and the blessed Man who is entrusted with the care of that paradise, to dress and keep it for God, will not disappear. The woman that God made at the beginning as a companion for the man and a help-meet disappeared. But we see in Revelation, the wife of the second Man will not disappear or deteriorate, she is as fresh in her affections and attire -- in the garments that she
{132}
wears -- after a thousand years, as she was at the beginning. It is of God, wholly of God, to end with a brighter and more glorious character of things than He begins with.
With that in view I wanted to say a few words about the history of Bethany, to show how it began and how it ends, and I think you will see that its end is better than its beginning. What one has in mind is that Bethany is a place, and it indicates what the Lord would have in a place -- what He would have in a village. This country has many villages, as well as cities and towns. Bethany begins as a village, and it indicates what the Lord would promote in a local setting. What a country this would be, if every locality was characterised by the features of Bethany. Just think of Worcester as being really a Bethany, having the history of Bethany, beginning like Bethany and ending like Bethany; what a place it would be for the Lord! That is what the Lord wants, and that is what He is doing. One would not hold these things out as impracticable, for we see them coming to light in many places.
How did Bethany begin? I think the passage we read in @Luke 10 gives us the start of Bethany, as Scripture records it. The Lord was on a journey, chapter 10 is very well known, "a certain Samaritan journeying", one who is despised, one with whom the Jews have no dealings; the religious people had no dealings with the Samaritans. We know that is true today, the name of Jesus makes many feel awkward. You have only to mention it and an uncomfortable feeling arises, people look more intently into their newspapers, and novels -- He is despised and rejected of men. A certain Samaritan journeying, it was a
{133}
wonderful journey, there never was a journey like that. He was taking with Him oil and wine, He carried with Him the means of healing and filling the heart of man with joy. He was prepared to make available His own beast for the man that was ruined, nevertheless He had not where to lay His head. The Lord said, "the foxes have holes" -- cunning, destructive creatures who did harm to everyone, they have holes, "and the birds of the heaven roosting-places" (@Matthew 8: 20), almost worthless many of them, "are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?" (@Matthew 10: 29) -- they have nests, but the Son of man had not where to lay His head -- Jesus the Son of man.
In this journey He had no home, and nobody wanted Him, everybody despised Him and then Martha appears. It says He went into a certain village, it is not named at all. Martha had been meditating, she had seen something of the dignity and greatness of Christ, the true Ark, in these unsuitable conditions, and it says she received Him into her house. She indicates by that act that whatever was the feeling in the world, she felt that the place that the Lord had was wholly unsuitable and so she opens her house. It is hers and she receives Him into it. The Lord goes into her house, she receives Him there, what wonderful grace on the part of the Lord to accept what was available! He goes into that house and He accepts it -- He accepts the affections of her heart expressed thus. She finds room for Jesus in her heart, and in her house and that is the beginning of the whole history of Bethany, it all came out of that. The next thing, of course, is what always happens, and that is the moment we are in touch with Christ, we become aware that we need a lot of adjustment. You see in
{134}
the world you can do as you like in the religious systems, you can control it as you like, and think and teach what you like, but the moment you come in touch with Christ in a living way, then you need to be adjusted.
The Lord Jesus proceeds with the work of adjustment. Martha begins to find fault with the Lord, questioning whether He really cared for her. She says, "Dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?" How wonderfully the Lord answers her, "Martha, Martha", what a wonderful touch that is. You do not find in Scripture there are many occasions where the person's name is repeated; it seems to convey the deep interest of the Lord -- that is the object of it. The Lord says, "Martha, Martha". The Lord loved Martha, she was a choice vessel to His heart and so He puts her right. He says, "thou art careful and troubled about many things; but there is need of one". The Lord corrects her, and she does not resent the correction, she does not answer back; the Lord loves women who can be corrected. It says, "Jesus loved Martha", that means that she was lovable, for that is how John always presents love. What did He love in Martha? He loved a woman who received Him into her house, and then was ready to be corrected. You will never get on and provide a Bethany anywhere, if you are not ready to be corrected. If we think we know, we do not like correction, but there will never be a Bethany on those lines. Show me a brother or a sister that is ready to be corrected of the Lord, even if it comes through the brethren, or the ministry, as it mostly does, and I will show you an element that will soon form part of Bethany.
{135}
The next feature that comes to light, is seen in Mary sitting at His feet, listening to His word. She had seen one great thing, the greatest of all; that beyond all the service she could render to Him, the greatest thing was to know His mind, to listen to His word. I wonder if there is a christian heart that has not reached that, who lives, as many do, in what they are doing. How much they are doing, that is their life, and they might even be seeking humbly to do it for the Lord. But the Lord says that "Mary has chosen the good part". To listen to His word, to allow Him to teach you, that is what is so lacking amongst christians generally. They do not allow the Lord to teach them. They are converted and they set out to work; they are busily engaged doing something, and they do not allow the Lord to teach them. But Mary is sitting at His feet and listening to His word.
The Lord loved Mary, and Martha, and then Lazarus appears afterwards. He is not mentioned here, but he is added to this community. What marks Lazarus is that he is "our friend". You must have friends to have a Bethany -- "our friend", not only the Lord's friend. The Lord could say "our friend;" he not only loved the Lord, but he loved the brethren, he loved them all. The Lord did not say, 'Mine, and Peter's and John's', but He says to them our friend, Lazarus. Jesus loved Lazarus -- "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus" (@John 11: 5). That is how the thing began, and how wonderfully it developed. The Lord found more joy in Bethany than in any other place on earth, He loved to go there.
Take that one day, it does not tell us when it was, but in @Mark 11: 11 we read that one day He went to Jerusalem,
{136}
and He went into the temple and looked round on everything, and what did He see? What sorrow must have filled His heart when He looked round on the temple of God, and He saw merchandise in it. He saw that it had become a great business establishment, where trade was going on. As He looked round what must have been His feelings. In that look He saw thieves there, not one or two but a den of them, usurping, in the very house of God, the place that belonged to God. It says He looked round on everything. Let us remember that when the Lord comes into a place He looks round on everything; nothing escapes His notice, every single thing that goes on in that which professes to be the house of God is scrutinised by Christ, and He feels it. He felt it so much on one occasion that He made a whip of small cords, and He drove out certain things from the temple as it is said -- "the zeal of thy house devours me" (@John 2: 17).
In the gospel of Mark, having looked round on everything, He went out, and I believe He does that today, He has left it. You can see that abroad in christendom, He has seen the den of thieves in it, He has seen the trading operations in the professing church. In the book of Ezekiel what comes to light is that there is an idol set up, in the temple. What idolatry is going on! -- think of Rome what idolatry is going on in the temple! -- but it says He went out, and where did He go? With sorrow in His heart, as He saw what was in the temple, He went out and went to Bethany. Bethany would provide for His heart the true features of the house of God; the true features of the temple; the place where He could find what He looked for. Bethany means the 'house of dates or house of figs'. It is
{137}
where divine sweetness is ministered to Christ, where the sweetness of divine affections operating in the hearts of men and women become available to the Lord. That is what the house of God should be, what the temple should be. It says the next day, that He came back again and He saw a fig tree, and He looked for figs, what He had had in Bethany that evening -- it was eventide. He spent the night, the dark night of all that He found in the temple, in Bethany, and He had figs there. He came back and He saw a fig tree on the way to Jerusalem, and He looked for figs but did not find any, and He cursed the fig tree. That is what is going to happen almost immediately to that system that rejects Christ, and usurps what belongs to Him; it is coming under a divine curse, and that shortly. The fact is that the Lord found in Bethany what He did not find in the temple, for He left it and went to Bethany.
Then in @John 12: 1 we read that "six days before the passover" He came to Bethany. What the passover must have meant to the Lord; He had six more days to be amongst men, to move about in this world, to feel for six days what man is. How it was upon His spirit! And then comes the passover. The apostle Paul tells us about it. He says, "Our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (@1 Corinthians 5: 7). Think of the sacrifice of the passover -- sacrifice means the cost, think of the cost to the Lord of the passover, with all the fire of divine judgment so soon to come upon Him! The Lamb has to be roast with fire, and the blood must be shed and put in a basin -- the Lord alone knew in His Spirit what that sacrifice meant in its fulness -- and it says six days before the passover He came to Bethany. What for? To have some figs, to have His heart refreshed with the
{138}
sweetness of those affections which were in Bethany, such as would be eternally His, through the sacrifice that He was going to make. He came to Bethany, what a spot it was! -- the gold was there, what affections permeated that town, for it was the town of Mary and her sister Martha! The gold of divine affections could be seen there, gold of Ophir. The silver is there, the Lord is owned and recognised -- the previous chapter brings that out. "Lord", says Martha, "behold, he whom thou lovest is sick" (verse 3), and again, "Lord, if thou hadst been here" (verse 21); the Lord is recognised in that place. Six days before the passover the Lord came to Bethany, to find fruit for His own heart, the blessed fruit of love, that the passover would secure for Him -- what was known in Bethany was the greatness of that blessed One. It began to dawn on Martha, when she received Him into her house, and on Mary when she listened to His word.
Now @John 11 unfolds more and more, the greatness and glory of the Son of God; how He had come to Bethany, in order to unfold to their hearts the glory of God and His own glory, that is why He allowed Lazarus to die. He remained two days where He was deliberately, so that He might go down and manifest to them in Bethany the glory of God. What a spot Bethany was! The glory of the Son of God is known there. He was not known in Jerusalem; He was not known in that which was outwardly the temple, but He was known in Bethany. "This sickness" says the Lord, "is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it" (verse 4) -- and then they learn what they had never known before, the intensity of His love -- Jesus wept -- that was in Bethany.
{139}
They knew in Bethany both the glory of His person, and the intensity of His love. Even the Jews that were there said, "Behold how he loved him!" (verse 36). Then Martha appeared again, you remember, still needing some adjustment, still ready to accept it. The Lord said, "Take away the stone" (verse 39). Martha intervened to correct the Lord again. She did not want what was there exposed, but we never have a Bethany unless we let the Lord expose what ought to be exposed. You see if in this town there is secret corruption hidden away, you could not have a Bethany while that was there. You could not have the blessed joy of @John 12, if the stone is not rolled away.
I would urge us to face what ought to be faced, if there is some moral element of corruption that ought to be faced, roll away the stone, the Lord can deal with it. It may be dreadful for the moment, but then the power of the Lord is manifest. In chapter 12 they make Him a supper. The nails that bind everything together are there -- *they* make Him a supper, not Mary, not Martha, not Lazarus alone but *they* do it. They are all in it now, bound together in one common desire to provide for Christ in Bethany, and the Lord came *there*.
He came there six days before the passover, to feed upon the sweetness of those figs, the blessed sweetness of the affections in Martha that would serve, and in Lazarus that would find his joy in sitting with Him. He was one of them that sat at the table with him. Lazarus could not have been happier as a true friend, than just to sit with Him. It does not say he said anything, he just sat there with Him, and the Lord loved that. Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price and the house was filled with the
{140}
odour of the ointment. The Lord went there, to get it from Martha and Lazarus and Mary, and He would not have that interfered with under any circumstances. Judas was there. Judas crept in, hiding the real thoughts of his heart. He says, 'Why this waste?' But he did not really care for the poor, that sort of people never do; you hear people talking a lot about the poor, but they do not really care for them, they keep a bag. Judas had a bag, but the Lord comes in authoritatively. He says, "Suffer her" -- there is no option about it. He will come in if there is a Bethany anywhere, and if anyone dares to spoil that, the Lord will rebuke it, He will give a word of authority.
In @Mark 14, two days before His death the chief priests and scribes and elders took counsel together as to how they might kill Him. It is not now the passover aspect of the sacrifice of Christ, but it is the murderous spirit that hates Him in the world. It is within two days and they take counsel to kill Him; where will He go? As the murderous spirit of hatred rises, where does Jesus go? "And when he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper" (verse 3) -- that is where He was, only two days before His murder. With the very spirit of it in the atmosphere around, He retires into Bethany to receive there the expression of the glorious dignity of His person from somebody's heart. It says "a woman", it does not name her, but He goes into that house for His blessed head to be anointed, to receive the worshipful adoration of His glorious Person from somebody's heart. He goes to Bethany.
That brings us to @Luke 24; the Lord is now out of death. He has sojourned for forty days with His disciples going in and out, we do not know everywhere He went,
{141}
but Scripture indicates that He went to many places. He appears here and there and He can go where He will, you could not restrict a Man out of death, He is not subject to any of the limitations, which in grace He accepted in flesh and blood. He can go into the midst when the doors are shut, He can appear on the road to Emmaus and then vanish. He could appear to five hundred brethren at once. But now the forty days are over, and it has come to the last day of His presence on earth. What will He do? Where will He go? He led them, everyone that loved Him, out of that murderous city, out from the place where the temple was, that had become a den of thieves, as far as to Bethany. What a signal stamp of divine approval on Bethany, the last spot on earth that ever saw Him; the last place that He is found in. It indicates that He not only wants Mary and Martha and Lazarus there, but He wants all His own there, He led them. He wants Peter there, He wants Mary Magdalene, He wants Mary the mother of Jesus there, He wants all His own at Bethany -- He led them there. That is what He is doing now. He is leading many a heart out of the religious systems of this world; out of the dark spirit of murder and hatred that is abroad in the world; out from mere formal religion so hateful to Christ; to a spot where He is ministered to. He led them out from everything, and there He lifted up His hands and blessed them. That is where divine blessing is, in Bethany. He lifted up His priestly hands in blessing there. They know where He is gone, for He was separated from them and carried up into heaven from that spot.
What marks the professing systems of religion is that they do not know where Christ is. "This Moses ... we do
{142}
not know what is become of him" (@Exodus 32: 1); they have lost all touch with Him. But in Bethany they saw Him, they were all there and He was separated from them, and was carried up into heaven, they beholding Him. Each of their hearts filled, they return with great joy -- what a stamp of divine approval on Bethany that it should be the last spot. When going away for a long time, we leave the spot we love most until last. A man finally breaks with his home, he says good-bye in his office, among his friends and acquaintances, but he leaves his home until last. It is the last act to say good-bye at home. That is what Bethany was to Jesus; it is the last spot that He leaves. The angels say "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" (@Acts 1: 11). He is coming soon and He wants the features of Bethany, He wants all the saints to correspond with Bethany when He comes to receive them.
May the Lord help us to begin by just opening out our hearts and our houses, and giving a place to Christ, in this world of His rejection. If we are prepared for correction, it will lead on until there is a spot where the Lord will find the very house of dates or figs, standing out in wonderful contrast to what He had in this world. They gave Him vinegar mingled with gall, the most bitter substance that human lips can taste. But over against that is Bethany, the house of figs. The Lord loved Bethany and He would like to see a Bethany in every locality where His own are. May it be so more definitely with us all.

TRADING
A E MYLES
@Luke 19: 11 - 17; @Acts 2: 44 - 47; @Acts 3: 1 - 6; @Acts 7: 55, 56; @Acts 9: 17
I purpose linking up these scriptures with the thoughts that were before us this afternoon. I have no thought of entering into any detail, except in so far as it is necessary to show how they are linked together. We left off this afternoon at the point of a saved house. What follows shows how a man with a saved house can take up the interests of Christ. In other words, when salvation comes into the household the Lord can depart, He can go out of the scene altogether; for the next parable introduces the idea of a nobleman who went into a far country leaving all his interests in the hands of his bondmen.
I want to press the thought that it is at the point where salvation is brought to the house that the Lord, so to speak, feels that He can safely leave His interests in the charge of His bondmen. It is a very sobering thought to contemplate that the Lord Jesus has left all His interests in the charge of His people. What He will receive on His return is dependent on what His people do during His absence. I do not suggest that if I am unfaithful the Lord will lose in the end. I do not think it would be right to suggest that, because if I am unfaithful He can give grace to another to do what He meant me to do. But considering saints as a whole, I would be prepared to say this, that what the Lord will receive on His return is dependent on their faithfulness. Now that is sobering. We often think that the
{144}
Lord's interests are all secured. They are not. If the Lord's interests were all secured what would be the object of leaving His people here to represent Him? He leaves sufficient undone so that every generation of His saints may pass through the exercise of having the charge of His interests during His absence.
Luke brings in responsibility. The parable in this chapter does not, so far as I understand it, bring in the idea of gift as in Matthew's gospel. Luke's parable speaks of minas -- a small amount of money, and each bondman receives the same amount. It is not a question of capacity, as in Matthew. Matthew brings in talents and capacity, but Luke's parable brings in responsibility; and I would say to every believer in this room, The Lord has left you with the responsibility of taking care of His interests. You may have thought that if you are unfaithful it will only mean that you will lose a little of the blessing that might have been yours. But as I read this passage, this parable, I see the danger, not of losing a little bit of the blessing, but of *losing it all*. You may say, Can a believer lose his eternal blessing? I do not suggest that. I am taking the parable in its connection and in its import and I am increasingly afraid of taking away the edge of the Word by importing into any Scripture something that is not there. I see within the range of this teaching the clear possibility of losing all that has been given to me in the sphere of responsibility.
What is in view, of course, is the kingdom -- the coming day when Christ will reign, and when He will reward every little bit of faithfulness, and, let me add this, when He will rebuke every bit of unfaithfulness. I do not believe in presenting the things of God in such a way that
{145}
people think they have a title to everything in the future regardless of what they do in the present. Such a presentation is, I am sure, foreign to the spirit of Scripture. God will bless us eternally; I would not weaken that for a moment, but we are speaking about the setting of responsibility, and in responsibility there are rewards and there are rebukes. And I am well supported by Scripture when I say that it will be a dreadful moment in the kingdom when the Lord refuses to acknowledge those who have been unfaithful -- when He will deny them. He will deny them. The future is only full of blessedness and carries no humiliation and no rebuke for those who are walking in faithfulness to Christ. I am sure that every believer will be in the kingdom, but some may be so far in the background that they will hardly be seen.
In this parable we get a suggestion of one man reigning over ten cities. What does that mean? It means, amongst other things, that there are more cities than men who are capable of reigning over them. That is what it means. Ah! we talk lightly of reigning with Christ. Thousands of people have talked about reigning with Christ who never will reign with Him. Reigning is dependent on suffering, on faithfulness, on diligence, on true representation and care for His interests during His absence. Reigning is not an automatic thing that you get because you have believed in Christ as Saviour -- far from it.
Nothing is more solemn to my mind than to think of the moment when the Lord will ask me for a trading account, so to speak, when I shall have to produce a balance sheet, in terms of profit and loss perhaps. I am
{146}
afraid there will be very little profit. I am sure it is a solemn thing to contemplate, the moment when the Lord will ask for an account. What do you think will show up well in that balance sheet? It will not be houses and lands, or motor cars, or money, it will not be great names. All that will be to your credit in that balance sheet, my friend, is this: the measure in which you have promoted the interests of Christ and enlarged them. It is not enough to say that you hid your mina in the earth; it is not enough to say, 'Lord, I have not lost what you gave me'. The man that had not lost it in the sphere of responsibility lost it in the kingdom -- it was taken from him. The Lord will look to each one of us to have something to present to him, to be able to say, "Lord, thy mina has produced ten, [or five] ..". The Lord looks for that. You may say, Well, I am only a woman, or, I am only a boy or girl; or you may say, I am slow of speech and hesitant. The Lord does not ask you, my fellow-believer, to trade with anything that *you* have -- nothing; neither a slow tongue nor a ready tongue, neither a dull and heavy brain nor an active one. He asked His bondmen to trade with what *He* left them. That is all. *Every one* of us in this setting of responsibility, has received a mina -- a small coin, very small. Now the challenging question is, What are we doing with it? The word was to "*Trade* while I am coming", that is the word -- trade. Trading means intercourse with men, not only with saints but men. What kind of intercourse -- social? Oh, no. You might be able to claim as friends all the great men of this world, and not have a single mina to your credit. The kind of trading that is in view is that which will promote
{147}
the interests of Christ and enlarge them during His absence.
Now what follows gives us a suggestion of how the trading can be carried on in a day of weakness. I allude to what the Lord told the man who had done no trading. He said to him, "And why didst thou not give my money to the bank; and *I* should have received it, at my coming, with interest?" (verse 23). A bank is a suggestion for feeble folk, timid people. A trader is a man who goes out on a venture; he has large things in view, and he gets large profits if successful. But a bank is an opening for weak people, such as we are. We live in a day of intense weakness, and we are all weak; there is not a strong man in this room. We are all weak. And a bank is such a comfortable thought for those that live in days of weakness; it is a place of security, but it bears interest. You see the Lord will not be satisfied if there is no interest. It is interest He wants -- increase. He will not be satisfied, He will not commend us, if there is no interest, and the bank is the place that yields interest and security. I commend it to the brethren. I will tell you what the bank is. The bank is the fellowship. The same word in the first epistle to the Corinthians is translated "table" -- the table of the Lord. It is the same word. It is the fellowship. Timid people, weak people, can trade in the fellowship amongst the saints. Whatever you put in there will bear interest, it will never be lost. I will give you a suggestion from John's gospel as to how the Lord viewed this thought; I will call it the thought of the bank. He was about to leave this scene. When a man is leaving this scene his first thoughts are for his family, those that have been dependent upon him, as to
{148}
how to provide for them. Now, you remember how the Lord provided for Mary, His mother. He did not leave her a large sum of money; He did not leave her lands, annuities, or the thousand and one things that men provide for those whom they love in the ties of nature. He committed her to John. It was the bank -- the fellowship, you see. In the eyes of the Lord Jesus, the best, the most secure place in all the earth was the love of the brethren. He committed her to that; that was the bank.
Following on from the passage which I read, we read about a colt that is tied. I did not read that section, but I dare say you all know it -- how the Lord sent His disciples to the crossways where they were to find a colt tied. Not only tied but having owners, persons who had a proprietary right over the colt, and the word to the disciples was to loose the colt. I believe that is a suggestion of how you trade. It is an illustration of trading under the Lord's direction. It is most essential that we trade under His direction. He has gone into a far country, but from the far country He is still directing things. How many colts there are tied? What a privilege it is to find them out! This Scripture is often used as showing how children are held in parental authority and affection, very rightly, I am sure. But it is not only that. There are many colts tied -- tied by a thousand things. I do not think there is one of the Lord's people who, having failed to come under divine teaching, is not tied up. The Lord cannot afford to give us liberty if we are going to use that liberty in self-will and lawlessness. The only reason for our having liberty is that we might serve Him. There are many colts tied. Some of them are tied by beds of sickness,
{149}
disease; some of them are tied by their circumstances. The Lord has many ways of tying us. He gives us a sense that He will only give us liberty when that liberty will be used for Him. Ah! if there is a soul in this room tonight not walking according to the light, I would that I could impart to your soul fear -- the fear of God. You may say, That is a peculiar thing, you ought to try and stir up my affections. Well, if your affections are not stirred up, I would like to stir up your fear. Don't you fear the Lord? I do. I can say it truly, I fear the Lord. I fear His governmental ways with me. Many a time I tremble; I tremble as I think of them. I fear what He may bring upon me in government if I do not heed His voice. He is very patient, He waits, oh, He waits a long time -- ten, twenty years, perhaps, but when He rolls in His government it is a dreadful thing. If He has to take away everything that we love He will do it. If He has to break up our health and afflict our body with disease, He will do it. If He has to afflict our minds, He will do it. The Lord will do anything rather than lose our love.
Now a trader, one who is seeking how to enlarge his interests, would be available to the Lord to go and loose these colts and bring them to Jesus. Could there be a greater privilege than that? To find souls that are tied and bound and shackled, all because their wills are not broken, because they are not subject to Him, because they will not walk according to the light; to find them in fetters, awaiting the moment when they can be liberated and be available to Him. Oh, that is a splendid way of trading. It will bring large results; it will bring you cities in the day to come. What will give us capacity to rule over cities? I will tell you. It is not reading out notices in the meeting, and it
{150}
is not looking after the money; it is not doing anything official, anything that might give you a prominent place among the brethren. The capacity to rule cities has been acquired in bringing divine teaching to bear on souls, so that the wills of men have been broken and the will of God established. It is that that gives capacity to rule over cities in the day to come.
Well, I wanted to say something more about the bank; it was for that reason I read this passage in the Acts of the Apostles. I think that book shows us how the trading was started, how the 'bank' was contributed to by one and another, and how it served to supply the needs of those that had nothing. I think the bank was opened, so to speak, on the day of Pentecost, when all that believed were together and not one of them counted anything he possessed his own. They had all things in common. Every bit of its capital represented pure sacrifice. It was all, if I may use a figurative expression, holy money. Ananias kept a bit back for himself. It was not holy money. He introduced the element of unholiness. When sacrifice goes out, unholiness comes in. What the disciples contributed was all based on sacrifice; not a single man had a title deed for anything. Not one of them had the sense of proprietary rights. Oh, how we love to be able to look at something, a bit of land perhaps, or a house, and say, That is *mine*! Not one of the disciples said, That is mine. It was all sacrifice. The bank was open. Oh, what a wealthy bank it is! how it has been endowed with the sacrifice of Christ! with the presence of the Spirit! with the devotion and sacrifice of men and women who have died for the brethren. It has been endowed with all these things. In the religious world
{151}
Satan has promoted the idea of wealth and endowment connected with the church. I suppose that the wealth of the church of Rome could hardly be reckoned up. But look at the endowment of this assembly! It is all pure, it is all holy. It is based on sacrifice. It is what is pleasing to God. Marvellous bank!
Peter and John began the trading in chapter 3 -- not with gold and silver. This bank is not meant to provide silver and gold. What it provides is the power of God to make men whole, so that they should be for God and for Him alone. So Peter could say, "Silver and gold I have not: but what I have, this give I to thee". The man was made whole. That is what the fellowship does. You bring people to the meeting, bring them under the sound of teaching, bring them under the influence of the love of the brethren, and they will be made whole, their moral diseases will vanish, their self-will will be subdued, and Christ will have a place in their hearts. They will be made into men, men according to God, having sensibilities -- ears that can listen to Christ, lips that can speak of Him, feet that can walk for Him, hands that would work for Him. You remember the exhortation in the epistle to the Ephesians, the remarkable exhortation to the man that had been a stealer -- a thief. The exhortation to that man was that he was to work; he was to steal no more; he is to work. Why? To live; No -- to *give*. That is how the fellowship works. The man is lifted from the degraded position of a thief into the dignity of an Ephesian saint; he is a giver. God is a Giver. That is how the bank works.
Then in chapter 7 Stephen comes into view. Stephen adds richly to the treasures of the fellowship, and
{152}
remember this, that all the treasures of the fellowship are still there; not one of them has been lost, they are all carried forward. I have never seen the apostle Paul, I have never seen Stephen the martyr, but all they put into the treasury is still there; I think I can say I have looked at it. What contributions have been made! What Stephen contributed was a sight of what is in heaven; I do not know what we should have done without it. You see, Stephen was a member of the body, and he was an *eye*. You know the function of an eye; it does not see for itself, it sees for the body -- the whole body. The whole body got the gain of what Stephen saw. What a contribution! -- a look into heaven, not a peep -- a look. He "fixed his eyes on heaven". And he tells us what he saw. Ah! it is a glad sight. It is a sight that enables you to go on trading, for Stephen was a trader. Perhaps he was not thinking about trading, I do not think he was; he was more occupied with what he had seen in heaven. But he was trading nevertheless. Even while the life was being battered out of his body he was trading. There was a young man standing by who held the clothes. Ah! he is to be the product of the trading; that is to be the working of Stephen's mina -- Saul of Tarsus. One goes out, another comes in, the work goes on. It has been like that ever since the day of Pentecost; the persons have changed, but the work has gone on. Great men have passed, and humble men, every day, ordinary working men such as we are, commonplace men find themselves called into this precious inheritance. How are we going to carry it on? Are we going to drift as near to the world as we can? There will he no fruit from that, only
{153}
sorrow, and in a day to come shame -- public shame, for he that denies Christ will be denied before the angels of God.
Well now, just a word or two more; I just wanted to show how Saul came into the fellowship. It is so beautiful to see the working of it; it runs all through this book. Saul comes among the saints, and the brethren are afraid of him; they did not quite realise the mighty, subduing power of Christ. But Saul comes along. He cannot see, he is blind. Where is he going to get his sight? He is going to get it in the fellowship! From whom is he going to get it -- a great apostle? No, but from a humble disciple, a man we never hear of before and whom we never hear of again. Just such a person as we are. You see, the treasure and the power were connected with the fellowship -- with what the Lord had set up on earth to carry on His work. Do you think He would have persons to carry on His work without power? No, the power is always there. And this humble disciple is to be the instrument through which Saul is to receive His sight and receive the Holy Spirit. What trading! I think Ananias would be able to reign over a city or two! I do not think he would have any difficulty about the way the power of God could subdue men. I think I could see Ananias going to a city of men, unsubdued, as they will be at the beginning of the kingdom, and so bringing in the power of God that every person in it will be subdued. Where did he learn it? He learnt it in his own circumstances, worked out in a single man; for God works things out in an educational way in small things and small circumstances. I often say that you can have all the exercise that you need in a small meeting of two or three brothers. Small numbers do not in any way limit the Lord
{154}
as to the variety of exercise. You might have a hundred brothers and their education be not a bit better than the two or three in a small meeting. It is a question of being with God.
Well, you see, Saul is *drawing* from the bank; to use the illustration he has not got anything to contribute. He is drawing. But it is not very long before he becomes a contributor, and he preached boldly that Jesus was the Son of God. Ah! it was not very long after that that Paul had something more to contribute; and so on throughout his history. How many thousands he turned to Christ; how many saints he instructed in the way of the Lord; how many assemblies he established up and down Asia and in Europe. What trading he did! What fruits there were! You may say, I am not a Paul. That is manifest; there are no Pauls today, but all the wealth that Paul contributed is still here among the saints -- every bit of it. And his teaching is in the Scriptures, his suffering, his devoted love, it is all recorded.
I will tell you something about the Scriptures. Scripture speaks of events that happened nineteen hundred years ago, but when I read the Scriptures, under the guidance of the Spirit of God, the things that are recorded are just as real to me as though they had been enacted before my very eyes. That is what Scripture is for me. It has had that power throughout all the generations of the church. Thousands of men and women have read the Bible, they have waited upon God, and they have had almost as real a sense of what is spoken of as if they had been there when it happened. That is Scripture as lit up by the Spirit of God. Why, it is full of life! -- full of it. There
{155}
is a gold mine on every page! It is not a question of where you dig; wherever you dig you will find jewels -- anywhere -- everywhere! The Scriptures bear the marks of God's handiwork.
Well, the subject is an interesting one; I feel I cannot do much more than suggest it to you. But I am sure it is a right exercise to soberly face the fact that the Lord has left us here, every one of us, with a definite responsibility, and something to trade with. He has shown us examples of how men have traded, and He has told us about the bank. Whatever little bit you contribute to the circle of the fellowship will bear interest; every helpful remark in a reading, every visit to the sick, it will all bear interest. That night when the weather was bad and the armchair looked very comfortable, and the fire was inviting, when you said No, I must go out and see that sick saint -- it will bear interest. It is all taken account of. Nothing bears such interest as this. The finest venture that the mercantile world has ever known never bore, never could bear, such interest as the Lord gives. He takes account of what you give up, what you sacrifice, and He knows when it hurts you to do a thing. I commend the bank to you. Do not try and keep your mina at home; put it in a safe place. Sometimes when a brother gets a nice thought about the Lord, he is tempted to wait for some special occasion to bring it out, and when the special occasion comes, it has gone. Or he brings it out and it is old -- stale, and the brethren did not think anything of it at all. We want to see that something goes into the 'bank' *every day*. It will all bear interest. And what the Lord will get on His return will be something worth while. He has gone into a far country
{156}
to receive for Himself a kingdom and return. When He returns He is going to ask you, and He is going to ask me, what we have done with that mina. Excuses will be no good. It will be no use saying, Lord, my circumstances were thus and thus. The Lord knew all about your circumstances, He gave them to you; He gave them to you along with the mina. No, we have the Lord -- a wonderful Lord, wonderful in His grace and love and tenderness. But we have to remember that our God is a consuming fire, and it is due to Him that we should fear Him; and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. It will give us right thoughts, we shall present the things of God in a right way. They are holy things; we cannot play fast and loose with them. The Lord looks for devotion and fixity. May we all have grace to be here for Him in this way, for His name's sake.

THE LEVITE AND HIS SERVICE
A E MYLES
@Numbers 3: 5 - 8, 11 - 13; @Numbers 4: 4 - 6, 15, 21 - 26, 29, 31, 32
I desire, dear brethren, to present, as grace may be given me, certain features of Levitical service. There is a good deal of concern at the present moment amongst the people of God, as to the maintenance of this. In tracing the history of the service of God, one can see that God has set great store upon the work of the Levites. We read as to the service, "It is most holy" (@Numbers 4: 4). The true Levitical element came to light amongst the people of God at a critical moment. You will remember that in the history of Israel there was a moment when a great crisis was reached. Moses had been up into the mount with God, and while he tarried, the people had turned to idolatry. When he came down, the situation was so serious that he issued that clarion call as to who was on the Lord's side, and the tribe of Levi responded to it. They went to Moses, and under his instructions they took every man his sword, and slew his brother. They did not spare. So that at the very beginning this peculiarly blessed spiritual feature is seen in their readiness to use the sword on all that nature would put forward to turn God's people away from Himself. Need I say, dear brethren, that God can do great things with such persons -- with any man, or with any company, that is prepared to give God His place, and as necessary to use the sword on all that is natural.
{158}
I believe that the choosing of the Levites is what we might call a sovereign movement on God's part. There are many such movements indicated in Scripture, where God makes a movement entirely on His own part, and when He does, it is always of interest. We are so prone to sit down as regards God's sovereign movements and to say, 'He does as He pleases', or 'He gives gifts to this one and that one entirely at His own pleasure'. So He does; but in His choosing the Levites in lieu of the first-born, you see how beautifully the word of God connects devotedness and faithfulness on the part of man, with what God is pleased to do in all the sovereignty of His acting. That is, Scripture first presents the Levites¬ devotion and consecration to God, and then God's movement in choosing them for Himself subsequently. Now God chooses them in lieu of the first-born, so that every Levite stands in all the dignity of a first-born one. You will remember that there were not enough Levites to ransom the first-born ones, and that five shekels of silver had to be paid for the number of Levites that was short of the number of the first-born, but every one of them stands before God in all the dignity of a first-born one.
Doubtless what I have mentioned is well known to all here, but I am making these remarks about the Levites to gather the factors together, so that we might see the atmosphere and setting in which the peculiar service of the Levites is detailed.
There are two features about this service that we should note. One is that all Levitical service is related to the tabernacle. There is not a single item of Levitical service that you can disconnect from the tabernacle
{159}
system. The other is that all that character of service was to be subject to priestly oversight. I refer now to the former and I think you will see the importance of it, for how much service there is today amongst God's people -- service manward -- Levitical in character, which is disconnected and dissociated from the tabernacle system. How much effort there is amongst the people of God to benefit man, effort that has in view no more than man's blessing. Dear brethren, every Levite, in all the dignity of a first-born one, should have such an appreciation of the tabernacle, and of his service as connected with it, that he would not, as it were, stretch forth his hand to benefit any man, without having the tabernacle in view. How much preaching of the gospel there is that has no thought, no exercise, no prayer, in connection with the tabernacle system! The gospel in its true setting, in the setting which Scripture gives it, has that object always in view. God effects His own purpose by it, in bringing the material for the tabernacle system to light. As every gospel preacher is a Levite, he should have in view, in all his service manward, that the material for God's system should be brought to light, and that it should be set in its proper place. I wonder if we realise, dear brethren -- one feels one's weakness in this regard -- that God is working systematically. He is working according to certain great schemes that are in His own blessed mind, not working in a haphazard manner, but with design, having the great system of service in view which is going to minister to Himself, because every part of it is to speak of Christ. Now I thought that with this in mind, we shall see how important it is that every Levite should be instructed in his
{160}
work. He should know what material is to be of service in the tabernacle. He should know how to carry it and bear it through the wilderness.
The second great point of Levitical service, as it presents itself to my mind at this moment, is this, that all Levitical service, as I said, was subject to priestly oversight. We read "The prince of princes of the Levites was Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest: he had the oversight of them" (@Numbers 3: 32). There is no part of Levitical service carried on today, that should be apart from priestly oversight. Those of us who can go back in history some twenty years, to the time when there was a period of great trial and distress amongst the people of God, will recall that this was one of the great issues of that moment -- as to whether what was evangelical and Levitical, that is what has man in view, should be exercised in independence of what is priestly. All Levitical service, no matter how small it is, is to be under priestly oversight. Now, you may say, does that mean that another brother, a priestly brother, is to stand by and take note of all that I do, and tell me whether it is wrong? I do not think it quite means that. You see in christianity you find the priest and the Levite in the same person, and the meaning of it is just this, that whenever you stretch out your hand manward, you are exercised to remember as a priest, what is due to God. It is the priestly instinct in oneself, the priestly eye, that would exercise the oversight of all service that has man's blessing in view.
Now I am sure that is very important, because the priest's instinct will exercise restraint. It will keep you from going to many a place, and putting your hand to
{161}
many a thing. There are many opportunities of Levitical service in the world today that you cannot use, because the priestly sensibilities in your soul give you the sense that it is not according to God, and you recognise that. Thus priestly instinct and priestly discernment should govern every Levite in his activities in service.
There are three branches of Levites -- the family of Gershon, of Kohath, and of Merari. I want you to note, dear brethren, the positions of these three families of Levites in relation to the tabernacle. Moses and Aaron and his sons occupied the eastward position -- the position of the sun rising. The family of Gershon was behind the tabernacle westward -- the position of the sun's setting. The family of Kohath occupied the southern position, a most favourable one, which I will speak of again. Then the family of Merari encamped on the side of the tabernacle northward.
The name Gershon means 'A stranger here'. The name Kohath means 'Assembly', and Merari means 'Bitter, or Excited'. These are the meanings of the names, which you can verify. How peculiarly beautiful is the divine setting in which these three families are placed by the divine ordering. You see, Moses and Aaron, who stand for all the dignity and majesty in which the divine system was ushered in -- the apostle and the high priest -- they are at the sun rising. If you bring it down to assembly conditions, I believe that it corresponds to the day of Pentecost. It was a glorious position; there had never been a moment like it on earth. There had never been a time of such liberty for divine Persons as on that day when, with Christ in heaven and all His work accomplished, the Spirit
{162}
came down, as the great witness of His triumph to form that peculiar structure that was to be the dwelling-place of God. Scripture speaks of the sun rising in his majesty and strength, and the day of Pentecost was marked by majesty and strength. It was the ushering in of the system. There was no evidence of weakness; men were afraid to join themselves to the assembly. When evil was manifested, as it was in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, the thing was immediately exposed and judged. There was no opportunity, or liberty, for the enemy to work at that moment. It was the hour of the sun rising.
But behind the tabernacle is the family of Gershon. They are marked by strangership, pilgrimship, and their position is the sun setting. How different is the moment of the sun rising, from the moment of the sun setting! How comely that those who are behind the tabernacle, who see the sun go down in its course, should be found as strangers. The sun-setting position, as developed in 2 Timothy, with the obligation to separate from what is unholy, and the recognition of the assembly as a heavenly vessel, is treasured in the heart of the family of Gershon, and they are found on earth as strangers. Kohath, on the other hand, is situated on the south, and is in the position where the sun is shining, and where all its warmth and influence are felt. It corresponds to assembly conditions, for in these the sun, so to speak, is always shining. In the assembly, God has secured His own blessed thoughts, and the sun always shines there. It is the most favourable position, and it is protected from the north winds. The family of the Kohathites pitched on that side.
{163}
But in the north you have the family of Merari -- the name meaning 'bitter or excited'. What is so calculated, according to divine thoughts, to subdue what is bitter and what is prone to excitement as the north position? The cold winds come out of the north -- God's discipline, the pressure of the pathway, the sorrows connected with it, all those painful exercises connected with the breaking down of the flesh in us, and with learning the bitterness of one's own heart as a man. Merari is placed in the north. With what skill and wisdom God has placed His people!
Now I want to call attention to the distinctive impressions which each of these families has gathered typically about Christ, and this is really what is on my mind. The power of being able to 'carry' things, as these three families did, is the evidence that you have learned to love them, that you have appreciated them, and that you know, as divinely taught, what they are. In the world things can be carried, of which the one who carries has no consciousness, no knowledge, no movement of heart, no regard for; but when you come to the things of God, you can only carry what you love and what you value. It is very significant that when the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by David, the peculiar attack which the enemy made at that moment was directed wholly against the Levitical element. Satan's attack was the introduction of a cart -- a new cart -- and the cart always displaces the Levite. The Levite's place was to carry, and you can only carry in wilderness conditions, those appreciations of Christ that you have taken into your heart. So each of these families of Levites, according to the peculiar position that
{164}
they had in relation to the tabernacle, had learned in their souls to love certain features of the Lord Jesus Christ.
The family of the Gershonites who, as the name signifies, were 'strangers', and who were behind the tabernacle westward, carried what one might describe as the soft materials. They carried the tabernacle -- its tent, and its coverings, the hangings too of the court, and the cords. This was their burden. The Kohathites, who were in the southward position, that is, in the light of the revelation of God in Christ in assembly conditions, carried the most intimate and precious things that were found in the tabernacle -- the ark, the table, the candlestick, and the altars. They carried too all the vessels of the sanctuary. Then the family of Merari, who had passed through all the experiences which are typical of learning the evil of our own hearts, carried the hard materials of the tabernacle -- the boards of acacia wood, the bars, the pillars, the bases, the pegs, and the cords.
Now what I want to try and develop is just this, that the peculiar discipline and exercise which is suggested in the positions of these families, is what qualifies them to appreciate Christ, in the particular features which they were to sustain and bear in the wilderness. It is very beautiful. The Gershonites carried, as I said, all the soft materials. You will remember how the tabernacle was constructed. The outer covering was of badgers¬ skins. That speaks of what was seen in its perfection in Christ, which is to be formed by the Spirit in the saints, that is vigilance, the power of detecting the working of evil, and involving the power to cover and protect the precious, holy things that are underneath. Beneath the badgers¬ skins was
{165}
a covering of rams¬ skins dyed red. How that speaks of the devotedness of Christ! The ram was the consecration offering; it speaks of His consecration, of how He was wholly given over to the will of God, and of the path that He had to tread to effectuate the will of God. He had to go the way of death. So this covering, which spoke of His devotion, is to be marked by that which speaks of death; they have to be dyed red. Then underneath this covering is what is called the tent over the tabernacle; it was made of goats¬ skins. How that speaks of the absolute separation of Christ from all evil! How it speaks of the lonely paths in which His feet had to tread in pursuance of the will of God! It speaks too of those features to be reproduced in the saints. Every one of the family of Gershon is to have these features reproduced in him, so that he can carry them, bear them in the wilderness. And then underneath the covering of goats¬ skins are the boards of the tabernacle, and they are linked with the family of Merari. But hanging over the boards -- those boards covered with gold -- and forming the ceiling within, are all the beautiful embroidered curtains of the tabernacle; blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined byssus. How they speak of the four-fold glories that centre in the Lord Jesus Christ. The fine linen, or the byssus as it is rendered, that fine weave, speaks of the uniformity of His life, every day's service to God so dovetailed in with every other day. Every word fitted perfectly with every day; there was no disparity, no gaps, it was all the fine weaving, the texture of a life of absolute uniformity under the eye of God. The Spirit of God would work these features in the heart of every Gershonite, for how can he appreciate them and carry them unless he has
{166}
them in his affections? And then the blue, I suppose, refers to what is heavenly. It is the heavenly character of the Son of man. The purple refers to the royal dignity and glory of Christ, and the scarlet to the earthly dignity and titles, that He will take up as the Heir of all things here on this earth. These are all typified in the beautiful curtains of byssus, and they were embroidered. How one loves to think of the embroidery work! How the Spirit delights to show to our discerning hearts these beautiful traces of divine perfection, seen in that blessed One as Man. The more you look into them the more glorious and beautiful they are.
The Gershonite would love these things. He loves them at the sun setting too, not merely in the day when as at the beginning they were marked by power and glory, but he loves them at the end of the day. How near we have drawn to the close of the day! How near we are to the sunset of this day! I wonder if we are true sons of Gershon, bearing these distinctive and peculiar features of Christ, as having apprehended them in Him, and thus portraying to men what is heavenly, what they cannot understand. These are the marks of the Gershonites. Can you not see that their position gives them their exercise? They are strangers, and strangership is the exercise that is necessary, to learn to treasure these beautiful features of Christ.
Now, let me turn to the family of Merari for a moment, to show how these things dovetail in. As we saw, their position is a northward one. They are in the place where the weakness and vileness of the flesh are made known, and what does the Spirit of God minister to them? What peculiar features of Christ has He brought to bear upon them to strengthen them in that position? The boards
{167}
of the tabernacle. Do you know what these boards were made of? They were made of what is called incorruptible wood. I believe the epistle to the Romans answers to this. A man is set up to support something. The boards are the features which give stability and support to all the soft materials that were carried by the Gershonites; they speak of the precious humanity of Christ. It was incorruptible humanity. There was not an element there that Satan could work upon. They speak of His endurance. Oh, how we need endurance in the northward position, when the cold winds blow, and they are cold! We need to learn endurance as we pass through life here, with its pressure and its sorrow, and as we move from one kind of pressure to another we need the endurance that was seen in Christ. Then these boards, which in themselves do not betray what is beautiful, and glorious, are covered with gold. The board is beneath, the exterior is the gold, the pure gold -- divine righteousness, indicating how Christ as a Man here maintained everything that was due to God. He maintained it, He never weakened it, to reach men. He was never diverted from the path of absolutely maintaining the righteousness of God. Now the epistle to the Romans gives us the peculiar light that shows how a man can stand upon his feet before God and before men. Delivered from the bondage of sin, from the power of lust and evil, set apart for God, so that his body can be yielded to God as a living sacrifice. A true son of Merari would appreciate all this, and as he appreciates it, he would be able to carry it. When he carried it in its journey through the wilderness, he would have in his soul the precious sense of what the
{168}
boards supported; that they were part of a structure that was a suitable abode in which God would dwell.
Then the family of the Kohathites had a peculiarly blessed path and service. It was so blessed that Jehovah told Moses that he was not to cut them off from among the Levites. A Kohathite was distinguished amongst all the sons of Levi, in that he was permitted to carry the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and all the holy vessels of the tabernacle. In doing this service they were preserved by what was priestly in Aaron and his sons (@Numbers 4: 17 - 20).
Now in speaking of the ark as connected with the wilderness, I think you will find that it is called the "ark of the testimony". The ark is given different designations in Scripture, which indicate special features that are in view where it is spoken of. There are two great thoughts which centre around the tabernacle; one is that it was the place where God dwelt, and the other thought is testimony. So here it is Christ -- perhaps the most precious type of Christ that there is -- as the blessed vessel of the testimony. God would maintain the testimony in the wilderness. When the ark is taken over into the land, this expression -- the ark of the testimony -- ceases. It is spoken of otherwise, such as ark of Jehovah, ark of God, etc. But as long as it is in the wilderness, it is the ark of the testimony. It was placed in the most holy place, so no Levite could look on it, no stranger could draw near. The order of the moving of the tabernacle was this, that the priest had to go within and cover up the holy furniture, and when they were put into the hands of the Levites every piece of furniture, except one, bore the external covering of the badgers¬ skins. Men do not know what we are carrying; they may reckon that
{169}
we have burdens. 'Why have you to go to the prayer meeting every Monday night?' they say. 'Why not have a holiday? Why must you always put these things first?' They regard these things as burdens. All they see are the badgers¬ skins. You say, 'I cannot go with you, I cannot accept your invitation'. That is the badger skin -- the vigilance, the discerning eye, that would turn aside from things that are not suitable to the glory of Christ.
When, however, they covered the ark of testimony, they put over it first the veil then the badgers¬ skins, then the cloth wholly of blue. It was the only piece of furniture that came out of the tabernacle that had any external evidence of heavenly beauty; it had the cloth of blue. What a beautiful picture all this is, typical of the product of the Spirit of God working in their hearts, carrying all these distinctive features of Christ through the wilderness, and everybody could see the cloth of blue. It speaks of what Christ is in His own blessed Person. It pleased Him to come into manhood for the will of God, and coming into manhood He made that position glorious. He made the acacia wood glorious, He made it distinctive, He made it shine out in all the glories of a Man who was here wholly for God, prepared to endure to the end. The cloth of blue speaks of the distinctive glory of the blessed Person, who was God, who came into manhood, and in manhood bore witness to all that was heavenly. The Person, whose garments are thus typified in the coverings of the ark, though in the lowly condition of a Man, yet He was the Son of God. This cloth of blue distinguished the ark with the outward evidence of what was heavenly.
{170}
Well, we might linger, dear brethren, we might well linger over such beautiful figures of Christ, but the time has gone. It was not on my mind to suggest more than this, that these three families of the Levites, in their respective settings, would learn to appreciate certain features of Christ, and now as the thing works out in regard of ourselves, we have to learn to be of the family of Kohath, of the family of Gershon, and of the family of Merari. We have to learn them all. God would produce, by His work in us, appreciation of Christ in all these beautiful aspects. If you are suffering at the moment from the north wind, if you are finding the exercise of enduring a difficult one, you can obtain grace and comfort and encouragement from the One who endured to the end. You can gather into your own heart these appreciations of Christ which the Spirit of God would use to form the very same features in you, so that you will endure to the end. And if you have found your place amongst the brethren, that is Kohath; he found the brethren, he is an assembly man, he knows all the precious features of the assembly that have to be carried in wilderness conditions. No matter what history outside is recording, these privileges always are available. God has never changed assembly conditions from the day of Pentecost until now. They run on, they are based on great divine principles which speak of what God is, they are based on His love, and that is unalterable; it is the southern position with your brethren. All the warmth and influences of the sunshine of the day are found in the south, and as you walk through this scene, this wilderness scene, you are in the consciousness that you are a stranger, and a pilgrim, that you are in the last days, and that the sun is setting. But
{171}
how glorious is that position! How glorious! Some of us were looking at a sunset tonight, a beautiful sunset. The sunset to a true son of Gershon is a glorious position. I will tell you what it shows, that although the day has run its course, the sun has not lost a bit of its glory. You will find that in strangership, in pilgrimship, and in that position you will learn to appreciate these features of Christ, which the Spirit would form in you.
May the Lord bless His word.

SHEPHERD CARE
A E MYLES
@John 10: 11 - 15; @John 21: 15 - 17; @Acts 20: 28 - 32; @1 Peter 5: 1 - 4
I desire to speak in a simple way about shepherding, particularly in view of the way things are to be carried on among the Lord's people. I notice with Peter and Paul, and indeed with every true man of God, not only are they exercised as to how things are to be maintained in their own day, but they have deep concern as to how they are to be continued after they have gone.
One of the marks of a man of God is that his vision embraces the whole thought of divine purpose. Things may be of very great interest to us in our local meeting, where we are more or less familiar with the exercises of brethren, and with the matters worked out there under God's good hand. But a true man of God is privileged to look beyond the confines of what is local, and to reach out in his vision to the whole circle of the interests of Christ on earth. You say, That is a very embracing view, and it is, but that is not all, for the man of God is not only privileged to embrace every feature of the interests of Christ upon the earth, but he can look into heaven. He can look back, and he can look forward. In other words, the whole sphere of divine operations from the beginning, right on to the end, is brought within his compass. One great mark of a true lover of Christ, as has been remarked, is that he is just as much concerned about the welfare of the Lord's people in a future day as in his own day.
{174}
I introduce that in connection with the thought of shepherding, because I notice the Lord and His apostles put great emphasis upon the shepherding of the sheep, as indicating that that activity would guard the flock in the grievous day that they saw approaching. One of the last things that John's gospel records as to the Lord, is that He gives to Peter the commission to shepherd His sheep, showing it was a matter of the deepest importance in the mind of the Lord. In fact, the giving of this commission to Peter at the close, suggests that it requires moral history, and qualifications, if one is to be entrusted with such a privileged service. You will recall what Paul says in @Acts 20: 28, on the occasion of leaving the place where his crowning work for Christ was done, "Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers". His concern was that there should be those who would shepherd the flock in view of the day that was coming, when wolves would come in from without, and false teachers arise from within. I mention this in view of showing the importance the Lord attaches to shepherd care, trusting that it may tend to promote it among us.
It is noteworthy that the apostles do not commit the care of the flock to 'gift', if you understand what I mean. There would be ministry, surely, the Lord would see to that, but the thought is that the sheep are to be cared for by those who have a shepherd spirit, and who would take up the charge from the very same motives as governed the Lord Himself. If we refer to the two titles, "good shepherd", and "chief shepherd", for a moment, the distinction between them is this: in relation to the former,
{175}
the Lord is alone -- absolutely alone. As the good Shepherd, He stands in contrast to all others who assumed the place of shepherds, as He says, "All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers". As the good Shepherd He stands out alone in contrast to such. But when the title "chief shepherd" is used, others are in view, and I am sure every one who loves Christ would desire to take up in their measure shepherd care for one another, as they have learned it from Him.
If we look at @John 10 for a moment, we find three features connected with the Lord as the good Shepherd. First, He lays down His life for the sheep; secondly, He knows all those that are His; and thirdly, all those that are His know Him. The great basis of intimacy between the Lord and His people is connected with the laying down of His life. It forms a bond of marvellous intimacy between the Lord and His people. What wonderful reciprocity of affection is suggested in these words, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". The laying down of His life is the basis of all; and if you want to be a shepherd, the first essential feature is that you are prepared to lay down your life for the brethren. It will cost you your life, be assured of that! If you take up shepherd care among the people of God, you can only take it up on the principle of laying down your life.
But see what it will promote! It will give you access to hearts, just as the Lord in the actual laying down of His life has reached ours. What opened the door of our hearts to Him? What led us to say, Come in and take possession? The powerful influence of His love, expressed in the
{176}
giving up of His life for us. No one who is a sheep of Christ's could be unaffected, no one could be so hard, so unapproachable as to be unaffected by what He has done; it is bound to break through the hardest exterior and affect the heart.
If we think of the term 'sheep', it presents the people of God in that aspect which calls forth compassion and consideration. You may think of the highest privilege of christianity -- sonship -- and you may find a few with whom you can converse on this theme, but the great fact stares you in the face that the mass of the Lord's people knows nothing of that. I do not mean that sonship is not theirs, for it belongs to every saint, but for the moment what is before me is entrance into it spiritually. You may speak in the same way of what is priestly, the service of God, and how it is carried on by the maintenance of what God has brought into function. But the great fact remains that the majority of the people of God knows nothing of priestly service. But when you think of the sheep, you have no small select company in mind. *All* the Lord's people come into mind practically -- every one; and, as viewed in that character they call forth compassion and consideration. The mass have little ability to gather food out of the Scriptures; they are just sheep, and sheep have to be led to their food, to the green grass that grows beside still waters. And not only do they require to be led to their food, but they require those quiet conditions -- still waters -- before they will feed at all! The term 'sheep', thus suggests the people of God in their helplessness, open to attacks from wolves, thieves and robbers. These will prey on them, and they are unresisting. The consideration of
{177}
this cannot but call forth from every heart something of shepherd instincts and spirit.
I read @John 21 in order that we might take account of the exercises of one to whom the Lord committed the feeding of His lambs, and the shepherding of His sheep. It is very remarkable (I have often pondered it) that they should be committed to the hand of Peter, as he had a very heavy hand. Yet there was no diplomacy about Peter; he was impulsive, a man who was marked by speaking first, and thinking afterwards. But there was nothing concealed; all that was in came out. It is to *this* man that the Lord commits His sheep. I would not suggest for a moment that these natural traits that marked Peter gave him any qualification to shepherd the sheep, for there is nothing in nature that qualifies for that service. Great wealth, mental power, business ability to conduct and organise affairs will not give you the slightest qualification to shepherd the sheep. All that one would rely on after the flesh must be broken, and natural ability as a qualification set aside, before the Lord can commit the least of His flock to us. He makes no mistake in His selection; He does not commit the most precious thing He has on earth, to those who are half-hearted, but to those who are characterised by deep affection. Such was Simon Peter, he was outstanding among the disciples in his love for Christ.
See what the Lord does as His activities here are about to close. He tests Peter, He tests him publicly. Peter has failed, and the Lord probes him that the root may be reached. The Lord never tests any one to find out what is there, for He knows what is there, but He tested Peter here (as He tests us), that Peter might learn what was there, and
{178}
that the brethren might know what was there. In passing I would remark that I have been interested in noticing how the idea of testing comes out in Peter's epistles. You get the idea of the testing of materials. We are tested in public by what we say, and the supreme test here was when the Lord questioned Peter the third time. Almost any one could pass his first examination, so to speak, especially those of us who are versed in a phraseology that enables us to avoid mistakes. But the Lord touched Peter a second and a third time, till it says, Peter was grieved. Now, the point is, what are you to say when you are grieved? When you are cool and collected and have time to think, when there are no emotions surging up in your heart, tending to take possession of your tongue, it is comparatively easy to answer; but when you are *grieved*, what are you to say then? That is the test, the test of a shepherd. And why? Because every shepherd is going to be grieved -- grieved to his very soul, grieved to find, as every true man of God has found, that the more he serves, the more grief he must carry.
How graciously, and yet how wisely the Lord tested Peter! He is a formed vessel now, the product of divine teaching, and he will not trust himself to say anything at all about himself without adding that word, Thou knowest that I am attached to Thee. It is well to be careful when we speak about our love for Christ, not that we would deny that affection is there, for every lover of Christ would readily answer when the question is raised, Do you love Christ? But when we speak of the *measure* we have to be careful.
{179}
So Peter, with all his blunders, with all his impetuosity, has the sheep entrusted to him. It is interesting to take account of the movements of divine sovereignty, but you will observe they do not travel ahead of the work of the Spirit. There was a time in Peter's history, when he placed himself in the very centre of the picture, so to speak, and said to the Lord, "Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death" (@Luke 22: 33). The Lord did not say anything *then* to him about feeding His sheep, not a word, yet as acting in sovereignty He knew all about what He would do with Peter. But the manifestation of the movement of sovereignty awaits the formation of the vessel, and when Peter is prepared to serve the sheep, the Lord commits them to him. Are you seeking some area or sphere of service? Be assured, when your affections are formed for it, the Lord will give it you. For all His movements in sovereignty among the saints, have perfect relation to the measure in which the vessel is formed, the measure in which the flesh and will are broken down, and subdued by the power of God.
When the time comes for Peter's departure from this scene, he writes two letters. In the second you get a word which connects the two together: "in both which", he says. He speaks of his departure, and he has the greatest concern about what is to happen to the saints after he is gone. One loves to see an aged brother, who has borne the burden and heat of the day, one who has a secured place in the affections and estimation of the brethren, manifesting the deepest solicitude as to who is to take up the service of caring for the saints in his room. What a comely sight to see such an one not grasping for office and distinction, as
{180}
it were, amongst the brethren, but thinking of the prosperity of the Lord's interests here when he is gone!
You say, The Lord will prepare some one. He will; but what *He* does is one thing, and what I have an exercise about is another. The Lord can do His work without any of us, if necessary, but the way He loves to do it is by using His people, and I am sure the Spirit of God would search out hearts who have a desire to serve Him.
This is what He looks for -- hearts. When He gets one heart, He can build everything on that. He can build intelligence, for a workman must have intelligence as to the whole plan of divine conception. He can give you skill, for every workman should be marked by skill, not blundering. The Lord can build all that is needed when He gets a heart. Such a movement of surrender that has this end in view, to lay down one's life for the brethren, must come from the heart. Mentality and knowledge of doctrine never produce that. They may lead one to seek a place among the brethren, but that is not laying down one's life. Show me a man, or a woman, on the line of laying down his or her life, and I will show you one whom the brethren love, and to whom they give place and respect. If we move simply on human lines of intelligence, making use of natural ability, the confidence of the brethren is not gained and their affections are not won. One could not but be touched by the most blundering brother that ever sought to serve the saints, if he gave his life for one. So the basis of all shepherd care must be our measure of love for Christ. Do not talk of loving Him, if you do not love the sheep; the two go together. And do not talk of loving the sheep, if you are not prepared to take up the daily toil connected
{181}
with their welfare. "Not by necessity", the apostle says, "but willingly" (@1 Peter 5: 2). If you say, 'I suppose I ought to go and visit a certain brother tonight, but I do not want to', that is "necessity". What should mark service among us is willingness.
Then it goes on, "not for base gain". The Lord will have a word to say to any one who makes a gain of the sheep. He will not have things on that ground; willingness and love for the sheep should be seen in all our service. I would plead for more shepherd care for one another. If I were a true shepherd, I should know how every sheep brought by the Lord within my sphere of activity was getting on. Sometimes we hear it said, 'There is John So and So, he was breaking bread for twenty years, and suddenly he went into the world and threw everything up'. I express surprise, but had I been a shepherd, I should have seen the way he was going. There would have been that care for, and interest in, him, as there should be in regard of all those with whom we walk. As we look at the faces of those with whom we gather locally, we should be exercised to have some knowledge of the spiritual welfare of each one. How it would help to keep out the wolf. The shepherd resists the wolf. A shepherd is not a military term, it is a title that speaks of love that will guard the flock. Oh, how much damage the wolves have done to the flock! If we look abroad among the Lord's people, we cannot but take account of the sorrowful position they are in. How has it come to pass? Through the failure of the shepherds. Every door unguarded by shepherd care, becomes a means of access for the wolf, and the wolf does not spare the flock, and so the sheep have been scattered.
{182}
Then there are the false teachers who have turned many aside -- teachers who speak every evil in the name of Christ, so that the sheep are not fed, but distracted by men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them.
All the terrible things in christendom arise in the main from the failure of the shepherds. No company of the Lord's people can walk together, and be sustained and added to, apart from shepherd care. You go home perhaps many a night tired and weary, and you would fain sit with comfort at your own fireside, but you think of the sheep and you rise up and go forth, not of necessity, but willingly, to care for them. All is done on the basis of sacrifice. If the care you expend on the sheep does not cost you anything, it is not true shepherd care. All is rightly appraised by the Lord, and in the day to come, in the day when He is manifested as chief Shepherd, He is going to single out all those who have cared for His sheep, and give to them an unfading crown of glory. They are going to have in that day a peculiar distinction.
We speak of glory, but it is not, as some suppose, a great blaze of light in which you can distinguish nothing. In the future day when the glory of God is manifested, one of the beauties of it will be the distinctions of glory. It will not be something confused and run together, but the features of it will be distinguished by those who look on. Amongst these distinctions will be the shepherds who cared for the sheep. Suppose you say, I have served the brethren for so many years, and they did not appreciate it, and now I will do so no longer. Ah, my brother, you will lose the crown of glory. And remember it is unfading, it
{183}
will not tarnish like earthly crowns. Paul could speak of his labour for the saints "for three years, night and day, I ceased not admonishing each one of you with tears" (@Acts 20: 31). That is the kind of labour that is acceptable; you can quite understand an unfading crown of glory given to such an one. What marked his service was that it continued; whether he were loved or not, he went on; whether it was appreciated or not, he went on. He said to the Corinthians "Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (@2 Corinthians 12: 15). That is the character of service connected with shepherding, and there is great lack of it, I am assured. There is not lack of ministry, there is much light, but there is lack among the Lord's people of godly care for one another's spiritual welfare; and I am sure we can all say, May the Lord promote it among us, for His name's sake.

{185}
FEATURES OF THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST
A E MYLES
@John 1: 1 - 18
In reading these verses my purpose is to call attention to three wonderful features presented to us in Christ. First, His divine greatness; second, the tangible nearness in which He has dwelt amongst us; and third, the affection and intimacy marking His place with the Father. These features, if rightly understood, would bring the Lord before us as Object. It is a great moment when He becomes the Object of our thought, desires and activities. Unregenerate man is his own object, and refers everything to himself; but the operation of divine grace, amongst many other things, would turn us from ourselves and fill us with Christ as our only Object.
Now one's heart cannot be filled with Christ in a theoretical way. One of the features connected with the Lord is substance. We get the word in @Hebrews 1, and inferentially in @1 John 1: 1, "That which ... we have seen". Not that I would convey the idea that the divine essence, or substance, can be seen, but to show that the idea is there, that there is great substance connected with Christ. If Christ is the object of our lives, if He is before us at all times, and the idea of substance as connected with Him, then our lives will be filled out. They will have something tangible in them, for the precious detail of the way in which the Lord is presented in Scripture will fill our minds.
{186}
In turning to John's gospel we read of the title "the Word". It is a very wonderful title, involving the thought of understanding, or apprehension on our part. Here is a glorious divine Person brought before us, who "was with God", and who "was God", but coupled with the expression of His divine greatness, is this most interesting title, "the Word". What does it mean to us? We love to speak of Jesus as Saviour, that is a title which has the sweetest, most precious meaning, bringing before our minds certain associated thoughts. There was a need of a Saviour, and this Saviour came to our help in such an appealing, loveable way that we delight in His title of Saviour. But then the Lord has many titles, many names. He has one that no one knows -- but connected with all His known Names, there is certain teaching for us, for the Name conveys something definite. Now I would commend to all, the need of understanding His title "the Word". God is made known in this Person; He has come into expression through "the Word", and His mind is to be known. No angel, however dignified, could undertake the great matter of expressing God, and setting forth the greatness and glory and power of God. "The Word" has in view revelation, or speaking, and the speaking is detailed in words; and the words can be written and put down, so that we can turn to them. Their fulness and meaning is so marvellously great that no one could hope to exhaust them. So that the Lord is before us under this title "the Word", having in view that God is to be expressed; He is to make Himself known to creatures. But God Himself must express His own mind. God Himself must come within man's range. He must be the Speaker, that there may be
{187}
the full and perfect expression of all that could ever be known of Him. Now if God comes down, as presented in John's gospel, He comes down with marvellous evidences of His greatness: not indeed, with external evidences of greatness, sufficiently manifest for the world to receive Christ or know Him, for "the world knew him not", and "his own received him not". But there *were* certain marvellous evidences of greatness connected with that Person which it is essential we should understand.
The first is that "in the beginning" He "was". Every creature must have a beginning for his thoughts, and a conclusion. We have no power to carry in our minds the thought of things that have no beginning, and no end. Men of the world love to trace things back; archaeologists and suchlike persons pride themselves on being able by a few scanty evidences here and there, to trace a thing back to its source. But you notice that whether they talk in millions or billions of years, it is always in units of time. Now here is One who, before there was any time, "in the beginning", "was". "The beginning", was not His beginning. Everything else had a beginning. He had no beginning: He "was". He comes before us in His marvellous greatness as the One who "was". He is the "I am", to use another title. But here the thought we are to lay hold of is that there is a beginning of all things, but that there is no beginning as to God. "In the beginning was the Word ... and the Word was God".
Now, I call your attention to the fact that "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being". The Lord is before us as the great Giver of all "being". Whatever
{188}
scientists may say, whatever may be thought in the world, there is nothing that has being, but has received it from the Lord. It has all passed through His hands, so to speak; it exists because of Him. God lives of Himself. He can live in eternity, He inhabits eternity (@Isaiah 57: 15); He is dependent upon no one. But everything that has received being has received it from Christ. So that He comes before us as the great and glorious Originator of everything that has being.
Now to pursue further, we read, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men". The statement "In him was life", brings out another feature of divine greatness. We have no explanation. Our life is dependent on God, "who preserves all things in life" (@1 Timothy 6: 13), but of this Person it is said that, "In him was life". It is a feature of divine greatness, and having man's apprehension in view, it says "and the life was the light of men". When men are in view, you get the idea of "light". So that His divine greatness and these precious features of it, which produce adoration and worship in our souls, come before us in the way of light. Light was here in Jesus. Not indeed physical light, as with the sun. For the sun rose and set and followed its ordinary course in the ordering of God while He was here as before. But light which was the outshining of that life which was in Him, shone in a marvellous way to enlighten every man. Whatever problems there were in the world, whatever there was of darkness and distance, light was here in Jesus. It shone out in Jesus, and was the expression of His life, for "In him was life, and the life was the light of men". John the baptist draws attention to this light; it is a great thing to draw man's attention to the
{189}
light of God. You can talk to a believer, one that has the Spirit, about the features of divine greatness that attach to Christ. But if you want to talk to men, you must draw attention to the light. John was a witness to the light, and he speaks about that light as shining for all men, having all men in view. God came before men in this sovereign way as light, and that light was presented in Christ.
Now the light was refused in two ways: "He was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not". That is, the world had no knowledge, nor understanding of the light that shone. Then it says "He came to his own, and his own received him not". It is important for us all, and especially for young people, to understand that light is not known, nor understood, nor received, without a sovereign work of God in the soul. In the ordinary sense, nothing is so apparent as light. If you come into a dark room, and the lights are switched on, it would not matter what you were looking at, floor, or ceiling, or persons, you would be conscious at once of light. But the Lord Jesus came here, the One who made the world. Surely the world He made will perceive and understand! The world was full of wisdom of its own in that day, full of learning, full of enquiry: but strange to say, this glorious Person with all the light that radiated from Him, passed through the world unknown, or refused by the world! God has expressed Himself before men, and that expression is perfect and full, and marked by the dignity that attaches to a divine Person. But when Christ came He was not known in the world, and was refused by those who should have recognised Him. We learn, however, from verses 12 and 13 that to "as many as
{190}
received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". Here you get the thought of a family -- not sons, but children born of God. The thought of birth is not connected with sonship, as regards us, for we are sons by adoption. God brings in children, and they receive Christ. "As many as received him", it says, suggesting that God is counting them with divine care. And then we get this marvellous explanation of what underlies that. They were "born ... of God". God has worked sovereignly to produce a family, and in that family everyone has received the Lord Jesus, everyone has believed on His name. They all have faith in Him, and God has given them "the right to be children of God". It is a right that Scripture says we have, but God has given us that right.
We have these two thoughts, the world that "knew him not", with all its wisdom and attainment; and the Jew, the carefully cultured man, "received him not". But then you get a sovereign movement that is absolutely of God, the *will of God* asserts itself. God can always come in at a crisis and call attention to His will. When a thing is *not*, He can say, 'I will', and it *is*. There is no one like God! In a crisis like this, when there is complete refusal of, or ignorance as to, all that God would present to men, He can meet it by His will; He can meet every crisis by His will. If you study this gospel, you will find that the ministry connected with John (and the presentation of the divine system in it) is connected with the will of God, not with faithfulness on the part of men. John's gospel comes in after Laodicean conditions have been fully developed. He
{191}
presents the assembly, not in name, but in all it's living character and associations here on earth, answering to the will of God. John himself represents the thought, and of him the Lord says, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?" (@John 21: 22). So here God meets this crisis, this apparent obstruction, by bringing in the great basis of His will by means of which He secures a family, and in it every one has received Christ -- that is our side. It means that we have received Him in all His greatness; not simply that we have received Him as Saviour, but having some conception of His divine greatness. Then as set in the family of God, we learn the affections proper to that. It is the divine school in which to learn the greatness of Christ; by conversation with one another we promote these holy and great thoughts of the Lord in our minds and hearts. We thus come to understand in measure what we have received. We receive Him: in this sense it is a complete idea; but to know whom we have received and all His greatness takes a lifetime.
The next thought before me is connected with nearness. Greatness is one idea: nearness is another. So we read in verse 14, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". How wonderful to think of this glorious Person coming into this condition, and dwelling among us. The term "among us", shows that He would, by the help of the Spirit of God, come under our notice, in conditions that could be understood, He "became flesh". As I think of God dwelling in unapproachable light, beyond the realm of all created beings, I say, what a wonderful thought! But in that realm we cannot be brought near, it is "unapproachable". It is a moral idea, as I understand it,
{192}
that God clothes Himself "with light as with a garment", (@Psalm 104: 2). But now, the Word, the One who is the expression of the mind of God, the One who was God, has come down here amongst men as a Man. That is what is conveyed by the words, He "became flesh", it was His own doing, He was not 'made' flesh, He "became" flesh. It was a sovereign, divine action -- another expression of the greatness of the Person. I could not come into some other condition, no matter how much I wished it; but He "became flesh" that He might dwell amongst men; that He might be known in this tangible nearness, He became Man! An angel could not express nearness. I could not sit down, or dwell, with an angel. I know little about angels, but this glorious Person, who in His own essential form of self-existence could never be approached, came down into manhood condition. He became flesh and dwelt among us, and men were not afraid -- they were not terrified, they were at ease. They were so at home with Him, that they took notice of what was personal to Him. The ability to take note of what Jesus does and says, to take account also of the holy nearness and blessedness of His relations with the Father, is a feature of the family of God. John says, "we have contemplated his glory". The princes of this world saw no glory; they looked upon the Lord critically, but they saw no glory. Think of the Pharisee in @Luke 7: 39, who said, "This person if he were a prophet;" what words to use in speaking of the Lord! But if the world, and the Jew, saw nothing, the children of God saw a marvellous glory, not only something of interest, but glory! Glory is a remarkable term in Scripture. It indicates the excellence of what is presented, and is linked up with complete, full
{193}
development. When the heavenly city comes down out of heaven from God, it has the glory of God, it will be manifested glory. The glory referred to in @John 1: 14 is not that which the world took notice of, it was the glory of "an only-begotten with a father". The disciples contemplated this glory. When the Lord Jesus spoke of His Father, the Jews would have stoned Him. They charged Him with blasphemy, that He, being a Man, made Himself equal with God. But within this family circle, the persons who received Him, who had been given right to take the place of children of God, are filled with the sense of glory, the "glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth". What a contemplation, what nearness! So near had He come that His movements are known, and His words are heard as He speaks to the Father. How He loves the Father, how He praises the Father -- and these things can be taken account of. It is a glorious contemplation. It is not unapproachable light, it does not repel; it fills the soul with contemplation. And this marvellous relationship and glory as of an only-begotten with a father, is connected with His manhood, and with the thought that "the Word became flesh".
All this is not merely something to be looked at, but things are to be heard. We pass on from the thought of tangible nearness, to that of affection and intimacy, suggested in the bosom of the Father. It says, "No one has seen God at any time". That is always true, viewing God as in absolute Deity; but attention is drawn to the fact that God is declared. This gospel is largely taken up with the idea of declaration. Declaration involves hearing on our part. Attention is called to that in chapter 5 and elsewhere.
{194}
And how is God declared? By "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". Our second heading had in view how near Christ came to us, but I think the third point shows us how near He was to the Father, as He declared God. This is not connected with unapproachable light, but with nearness and intimacy. It is affection in its most precious presentation -- the bosom of the Father. It indicates the place the Lord Jesus had when down here as a Man: that was His place in the Father's affection; that was the nearness that was His, even "in the bosom of the Father". You could not have an idea expressing greater nearness than that. "The bosom of the Father", was His place as Man, and it was from that place that He declared God. He would make known the secrets of that place! We can enter into that which corresponds to it now. He was in the bosom of the Father in an absolute way. He is a divine Person; but John would show us in chapter 13 that we can be in the bosom of Jesus; and the bosom of Jesus is what corresponds, for us, with the place the Son has in the bosom of the Father. That was available for John -- the bosom of Jesus! A man who had had his feet washed was there, and consciously there. He was as near as that, and could contemplate the greatness of that glorious Person, who "became flesh", and tabernacled here among men. The Person who is "the Word", has come down into manhood that men might be in this holy nearness to God, to know Him as Father. What intimacy of love! These things are set before us, in this objective way, for our contemplation. If we have vague thoughts of Christ, and are still trying to stimulate ourselves to love Him more, the way to arrive at definiteness, is to contemplate the
{195}
greatness of this Person; and to keep in His company, for you could not have thoughts like these in your hearts without corresponding holiness. As you ponder these features they will fill your soul, and the Lord will be known in your heart in a definite, substantial way. So that if somebody was to say to you, What do you see in Christ? You would be able to say with John: not even the world itself could contain the books, if all the things which Jesus did were written. I believe that what was in the mind of John was that that should be one of the characteristic features of the family of God, that everyone of us should have that impression of His greatness. It may be that I know so little about Him, that I could put it all into a very small book. But John would give us the sense and conviction that "there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written" (@John 21: 25). We could never exhaust or complete the marvellous detail of all that is connected with this glorious Person, who chose to come near to us in this tangible, intimate way so that He might be known. He wants everyone of us to know Him like this, not to be content with a distant knowledge, but to know Him in all the nearness and preciousness of the way He is presented in this chapter.
May He become the definite Object of all our thoughts and all our desires.

THE MOVEMENTS OF DIVINE PERSONS
A E MYLES
@John 1: 14; @John 6: 38, 39; @John 13: 1; @John 14: 23; @John 16: 27, 28
Our understanding of the truth largely depends on our apprehension of the movements of divine Persons. The coming down from heaven of the Lord Jesus, His going into death, His rising from the dead, and His going back to heaven, complete a cycle of divine movements which are detailed in the Scripture, along with certain features of the truth connected with them.
The first movement before us is in @John 1, where we read "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". Here we have presented a condition which is visible, in contrast to one which is invisible, for "No one has seen God at any time" (@John 1: 18). Indeed, we are told that no one can see God. But a divine Person could take another form, in which He becomes visible to men, and that is what is conveyed in the statement, "the Word became flesh". He became something which was not true of Him before; this involved a movement on His part. When He became flesh, it was His own act, an act that clearly indicated God's desire to be known. God is so great that there was no possibility of any creature reaching up to Him in the conditions of Deity, He dwells in light unapproachable. No one could make a movement towards God in that sense; God must make the movement if He is to be known. If He is to be seen by men, or men are to be filled with what God
{198}
is, then God must come near in such a way that men are constrained and attracted to look, and contemplate.
The Word became flesh and the apostle says, "we have contemplated his glory". It was a glorious matter to him, a matter to fill the soul! It was not a cold doctrine or statement of belief; but something that filled his soul with the sense of glory. As we apprehend that a divine Person has taken a form that brings Him within our range, all His movements are full of importance and meaning to us. As understanding these movements, we move towards that blessed Person, and learn in the power of the Spirit, what they mean. There is nothing else within our view, that is of such magnitude, and so attractive.
This movement of the Lord in the first chapter of John is at once seen as holding men, attracting them, so that they become contemplators of His glory. Then it gives the character of the glory -- "as of an only-begotten with a father", as having especially in view His relation with the Father. How delightful He was to the Father! There is nothing more blessed to contemplate than an only-begotten with a father, when that only-begotten is Christ with His Father.
Now what we might speak of as a second movement, is in chapter 6, where we read "I am come down from heaven". That is a change of position, not a change of condition, as in the first movement, nor a question of another form. Who could say, "I am come down from heaven", but a divine Person? What does it mean? He presents Himself as food, "the true bread out of heaven" (verse 32). It is full of meaning having in view that believers should be made independent of that which supports men of
{199}
this world. Whatever feature of glory or greatness you might speak of in this world, there is nothing like this. This movement is not to be compared even with the visitation of an angel, great as that would be, for angels are representatives of God, but they move only as sent. But here is One who can say, "I am come down from heaven" (@John 6: 38). He *came down*. Think of the stoop of it! And then he says, "Not that I should do *my* will, but the will of him that has sent me". You will observe it says first, "I am come down from heaven". That is His own movement, the movement of a divine Person, One in the absolute co-equality of Deity. But now He takes a subject place, that He might do the will of Him that has sent Him. First He "comes down", then He is "sent". God is coming near to us in this Person in an intelligible, attractive way; He wants to be known. He wants to draw men consciously into all the joy and happiness of the knowledge of God as the Father. Before we can understand the Father, and the relationship of sons to Him, we must apprehend these divine movements. For it is a divine Person who comes down from heaven, who then speaks as One sent, not doing His own will but the will of the Father who had sent Him. You see how He is bringing the Father before us. When we apprehend Christ as the sent One, not doing His own will, but the Father's will, we begin to understand the place the Father has in the matter. He is to have a place in our hearts and minds, as the result of the Lord's movements in presenting Himself with such marvellous skill. God is thus made known and becomes a reality to our hearts.
{200}
I pass on to chapter 13, where we have another movement indicated, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father". He was in the world for the Father, and as here He spoke of the Father; presenting Him to men, but there was no response outside the circle of His disciples, and now He is going out of the world by way of death. Oh, what a movement! How much is involved in it! The whole work of linking us vitally with Himself, so that we have a place with Him before the Father. Had He gone to the Father in any other way, He would have been alone. But He is going by way of death in order to bring us into His place as Man before the Father. He wants His saints to understand that movement. Chapters 13 to 20 of this gospel are in view of our understanding the meaning of that great movement. At this point He introduces the precious service of feet-washing, indicating that our understanding is dependent on the removal of certain difficulties, and the solution of exercises in which we require much help.
He rendered this service as One who "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". I have no doubt that "the end", has His death in view; but I would specially call attention to the fact that He brought in this particular service having an end in view. His love found this peculiar way of helping them to understand that great movement of His in going to the Father. It is to make things practical for us that we might know something of going to the Father. How little there is for the Father! as we come together 'in assembly'. We allot but a short space of time to the Father. We linger over that which appeals most to ourselves, rather than move forward to that which
{201}
is specially in the Lord's mind. Nothing is more precious to the heart of the Lord, than that the Father should be reached and worshipped. He says, "My Father is greater than I" (@John 14: 28). We have every reason to eulogise and praise the Lord Jesus, to give Him a supreme place, indeed a place that no one else could occupy. But we should remember that His great service as coming into the world was to make the Father known, and to secure worshippers for Him. So in these chapters He is teaching the great import of His death, as connected with the Father. He is going out of the world to the Father. Do we understand that? His service of feet-washing is to make this practical to us, to make it a reality, and it is an obligation laid upon the saints to wash one another's feet as He did. How intensive the instruction is. He takes a wash-hand basin. A wash-hand basin is a small household utensil, suggesting what would probably be found in every household irrespective of its size. And into that wash-hand basin He pours water and washes the disciples¬ feet. May it not indicate how John would limit the size of a local meeting? Paul would limit the size of a gathering by the cup, how many can drink out of one cup? John, speaking of the wash-hand basin and the towel, would perhaps indicate how large the local company should be. How many saints¬ feet could you wash in a wash-hand basin and dry with a towel? It suggests a family setting for us. All are to have their feet washed. The fact that Peter was not agreeable did not stop the Lord, but He meets Peter's objection -- not by authority, but by explanation. The great way to meet objections that are raised amongst the saints about matters, is by explanation or teaching, "in meekness
{202}
setting right those who oppose" (@2 Timothy 2: 25). The Lord tells Peter that, except He washed him, he would have no part with Him. As soon as Peter understands that, he is quite agreeable, indeed he wants to go too far the other way; to have not only his feet washed, but also his hands and his head. The Lord did not have that in view, for they were already clean, as having been bathed -- @John 13: 10 and @John 15: 3. To deal with a man's hands and head requires a large amount of water, but what is in view here is that which will help us to go forward in freedom from hindering elements, to follow a divine movement. The Lord would accustom us to the idea of His going to the Father by way of death. He does this great service in connection with that movement, so that the saints might be able to move forward towards the Father according to His own desires. What a movement that was! The opening up to His own of that realm of supreme blessedness connected with the Father. There is nothing so great as that for us. It is the highest and greatest feature of the dispensation. What do we know about it? One feels how little one knows about it in a practical way, and yet it is one of the greatest movements of Christ, and that in which He has peculiar joy. How He delights in those who would follow Him in that way, answering to His own desires, and affording the Father that which He seeks.
Now I pass on to chapter 14: 23, where we read, "If any one love me, he will keep my word". Here again you get the truth of a divine movement, which governs the thought of the Father and the Son moving together. "We will come", it says, "and make our abode with him". Notice how this most wonderful movement is put in
{203}
relation to any one -- "if any one". Matthew's gospel requires two or three, having in view what is administrative, but John brings things down to the smallest number "if any one". Let us think about that, dear brethren; it is worth pondering. "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". Meaning that God will extend to every lover of Christ in this way, the same kind of affection as that which extends to the Son. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35). The Son has that unique place, that distinctive place, in the Father's affections, who has given all things to be in His hand. But now there is a door opened for man, "If any one love me, he will keep my word". What is His word? It would be all that He had to say in connection with the Father; for the Father is in view in all this, the One who is to receive all the fruits of divine workmanship in men; the Father is to receive the full result. What an incentive to keep His word, what a lever for the soul! How the apprehension of that would discredit the world, and all its glory and gain. The only thing for a christian to go in for is this, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".
How important to understand that, as here on earth, but as living morally outside of it, as loving Christ and keeping His word, we may become accustomed to divine visitations. The Lord says, "we will come to him". We may know little about it, but can recognise the blessedness of it; that while we wait to be taken up to heaven and enter unhinderedly into all the joy of divine love, the energy of
{204}
love in us, as keeping His word, will bring divine Persons down to us, to make their abode with us. That is how God would express in this living and marvellous way, the value He places upon any response to Himself and to Christ.
Finally, in chapter 16: 27, the Lord says, "for the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God". The Lord at this point is encouraging the disciples to have to do with the Father Himself. While we understand that the Father is only known in the Son, yet the disciples having become lovers of Christ, find their own position now assured as before the Father Himself. He is inviting them to speak to the Father: "the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God". The Lord as coming out from the Father, and sent forth from the Father, and now going back to the Father states that the result of these movements is that we have access to the Father Himself, and know that the Father Himself loves us, because we have loved Christ. It is a kind of climax. What I want to emphasise is the expression "the Father himself". It is very personal. One notices the lack in our worship of that which is connected with the Father Himself. The Father indeed delights to hear us speaking to Him about the Son. But then there is the Father *Himself*, He is to have a personal place in our hearts, and in our worship and thanksgiving. The Father is to be not merely a name to us, but One known personally. So the Lord says, "the Father himself has affection for you". What can one say of the Father Himself? He loves to hear of Christ, and one is deeply thankful for any measure
{205}
of ability found with us to speak to the Father about Christ, but we should bear in mind that the Father has a personal place "the Father himself has affection for you". Why does He love us? -- because we have loved Christ, and have believed that He came out from God.
This presents the believer again moving forward into what is the greatest feature of the dispensation. I do not think any one could doubt that the Father, and what is connected with Him, is the highest and greatest and best! Now the Father is made known in this personal way. The grand and glorious result of these divine movements -- the Word becoming flesh; coming down out of heaven; sent into the world; going to the Father out of the world by way of death; and later presented as ascending to the Father. All these movements have in view that the Father should be known; that He should have a personal place with the saints. Having to say to the Father, is always connected with the Son and the Spirit, as the apostle says, "through him [that is, Christ] we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (@Ephesians 2: 18). This does not weaken the personal way in which the Father is known, but is to support the realisation of it. He has personal affection for the saints, because they have loved Christ, and have believed that He "came out from God".
The result of these glorious movements of divine Persons will fill a universe, in which God will be all in all. Think of the glory and the power, and all the labour that has been taken up by these divine Persons -- all having in view that God should be all and in all. He loves men; He sets a great value on men. He will dwell with them eternally (@Revelation 21: 3). We do not need to wait for our
{206}
translation to heaven, to find spiritual things in function, they are to be realised today.
And these visitations, these movements, indicated in the passages before us, can be realised. If we do not know them, let us ask ourselves if it is because we do not keep His word, and do not love Him. I commend His word to our consideration, as having in view the opening of the door into the marvellous privilege indicated in the words, "We will come to him and make our abode with him".

THE DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS LOVED
A E MYLES
@John 1: 37; @John 13: 22 - 26; @John 19: 26, 33 - 35; @John 21: 3, 7, 21, 22
My purpose in reading these verses is to call attention to divine grace, as expressed in the disciple John. John is especially interesting to us who live in the last days of the assembly's history, for he represents the assembly's position, as dependent entirely on the will of the Lord. Thereby indicating that the Lord is pleased to prolong the phase of things represented in John. That represented in Peter, is not prolonged as the Lord Himself indicated in chapter 21 of this gospel. The phase of things presented especially in Peter, was to end in martyrdom; that is, the victory of the kingdom is seen in that the saints can be put to death without losing anything!
The Lord could trust Peter, He can always trust a man who has broken down and has been recovered. It is to that man that the Lord entrusts His sheep, so far as shepherding and feeding of them were concerned. In chapter 21 the Lord gives over into the hands of Peter what seems to be the greatest work. It was a marvellous thing that the Lord should lay upon Simon Peter the great and grand work of caring for the sheep and the lambs. Now there is always a tendency with those to whom great things are committed, to look round and say, Well I am doing a lot of hard work, and accomplishing a great deal, but others do not seem to be doing very much. Peter's energies, and Peter's devotion, which went even to death, were extended in a
{208}
certain direction. It was of the Lord. I am not in any way discrediting Peter, the great vessel to whom the Lord committed so much; but I think there was, perhaps, a tendency in Peter's heart to question what others should do. So he draws the Lord's attention to John, and says, "What of this man?" If Peter is given the great public feature of caring for the flock, what is there for John to do? I think Peter in his own heart knew. Indeed, the history of the gospel, which I shall refer to presently, would indicate that Peter knew that John had a very great place in the Lord's heart, and so he says, "What of this man?"
Now the Lord's answer is full of instruction, telling us in effect, that John was reserved. He was reserved for something that was outside of, and beyond, Peter's commission and Peter's work, and that something, whatever it was, wholly depended upon the will of the Lord. I need hardly say that when you get such an expression as, 'the will of the Lord', or 'the will of God', you have what is absolute. It gives you a great sense of stability and permanency. There could be nothing greater for us than to know the will of the Lord; it is final. There is no argument, no reasoning, no questioning, there it stands. And so Peter learns that, while the great sphere of public service is very much in the heart of the Lord Jesus, yet He is keeping John for something in reserve for Himself, something connected with His own will, that would come to light as He was pleased to reveal it. John speaks of himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved", and you will not fail to see that what is for the Lord's own heart, what is connected with His love -- not exactly with His care, is to be reserved for the last day.
{209}
We discern therefore from these facts that the special feature of divine grace in John is that of lovability. However distinguished one may be in service and gift, to be loved and to be loveable, are perhaps the greatest features of the dispensation. Indeed, I know of no greater thought for us than that we should be loved by divine Persons. It is far greater that Christ should love me, than that I should love Him. There is ample reason for my love; but what reason can there be for His love! The love of Christ is sovereign, and flows out because it is in Himself, and of Himself, but the true answer to that for me as having fed upon the love of Christ, is to be loveable. A person who is loveable is one whose general behaviour and conduct is such that they can be readily loved. In other words, lovability is a right response to the love of Christ. Now that is set out in John. What a loveable man he was; what an unjealous man. He does not tell us about his own converts. He would tell us about the converts of Andrew and Philip. He would tell you what others do, but he does not tell you much about himself; and if he refers to himself, he does it in such a way that he brings the Lord before you. If a man designates himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved", what do you see in that picture? -- You see Jesus and His love. The disciple is there, but he is unnamed, and he appears as distinguished by the love that Jesus confers upon him.
That is just how the matter should be. While we are to be most thankful for, and to glory in, the love of Christ, yet we should do it in such a way as to suggest that the whole matter originates in His heart, that it is His pleasure to love us. We do not know why He should love us, but we would
{210}
desire to provide for the Lord Jesus suitable conditions for His love. You cannot love unsuitable, obstreperous, insubject, rebellious people. Such characteristics are a constant challenge to love. It may not quench the love, the love is strong, but as to its manifestation it cannot be free to express itself, as such things mark us.
John is a loveable man, and I would say to the younger brethren especially, it is better to be loved, than to be admired, or feared. You may gain a place amongst the saints by service. If you serve them, they will love you for that service. You may gain a place of admiration by acquiring knowledge, by being able to answer questions as to this and that. But the greatest place that you could gain in the affections of the saints, is to be loved because you are loveable. One sometimes hears persons complain that the brethren do not show love. Well, there are two things necessary for the showing of love; one is that love should be there. If there is a work of God in our hearts love is there, for love is of God. But the second thing is that, if I want the brethren to express love towards me, I must be loveable. Love must have conditions in which to display itself, and frequently those who complain that the brethren do not love them are in such a condition that it is put at a distance. If I stand aloof from the saints, if I have worldly friends, or friends amongst christians, who are not faithful to the fellowship of God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to which we have been called, all these things will hinder the working in us of lovability. A christian that is loveable, who wants the closest intimacy with Christ, is one who will continue here entirely at the disposal of the Lord's will. As the Lord said of John, "If I will that he abide".
{211}
True assembly affection, as it will be found at the end of the dispensation, centres in John's ministry, and in what John represents. There will be love for Christ found at the end, connected with this line of things of which I am speaking.
I begin my references in this gospel with @John 1, and suggest that John the evangelist was one of the two who followed Jesus. When you get an unnamed person in this gospel doing something that is to be commended, we are justified in assuming that that person is John. He tells us who the other one was. Oh, what a lovely spirit! One often listens to the brethren giving an account of something and alas, how much of the big 'I' there is at times! But John brings in this delightful feature, that he would always narrate the best as to the brethren, and would attract attention to someone else. How loveable is that feature! The measure of love with us is largely shown by the extent to which we put ourselves in the background, or bring others forward. Love will always search out what is in the background. What is there behind the public position? What is there behind the gospel? What is there behind a good Bible reading? What is behind it is the loveable company. The saints who are content to be amongst the brethren as disciples whom Jesus loved -- these are the people that give stamina, and moral support to every occasion. These who would glory, first of all, in the fact that Jesus loves them. Oh, what a challenge it is to us! If we were sitting down, and taking stock of what we possess spiritually, where would we put the love of Christ? You may say, I know this or that doctrine. I have a library of books, and I preach every Sunday night, and I have
{212}
gathered so many converts. But if you were asking John to give you an account of his spiritual possessions, he would begin, I am sure, with the fact that he was a disciple whom Jesus loved. In such an account he is not excluding others. John would not exclude any one. He is very near to the heart of Christ, but he would always leave room for others, for he is one of the many loved by Christ: that is his distinction.
In chapter 13 you will notice that Peter has the most to say in the first part. He makes himself prominent at a time when prominence is a shame. There are times, you know, dear brethren, when we are together and the Lord Himself is filling out the moment with His service. At such a time it is a shame for us to make ourselves prominent. Perhaps Peter thought he was doing very well, honouring Christ by his words; but Peter was really hindering the service of Christ. The normal service of the moment had to be interrupted, in order that Peter should be put right. The Lord is very gracious -- much more gracious than we are with one another. The Lord tarried to put Peter right, to teach him. Adjustment in this inside circle is by teaching. But now Peter, having been put right, is not prominent, and you will notice that he made a sign to John. Just think of Peter, so notable for readiness of speech, making a sign to John. An occasion like this was one for speaking of the most sensitive kind, and so Peter appeals to John. Peter was not near enough to the Lord, so he turns to the disciple who was in the bosom of Jesus.
You could not gratify the heart of Jesus more; you could not give a greater response to His love, than to lean on His bosom at supper. Love is having its way, having its
{213}
way without any hindrance. Yet John, when he speaks of himself as there, does not give you any impression that he had done anything to acquire that place. He let the Lord put him there. Would you like a place in the bosom of Jesus? It is not a question of attainment, or acquirement: it is a question of letting Jesus put you there. In other words, while service is set out in Peter, and service is a most important feature of christianity, we must not forget the heart of the Lord, and what His heart seeks after is love. He would give everyone of His own a place on His heart. John represents that. John never gives you a sense that He would claim this as his own private territory, to the exclusion of others; oh, no! He would always give you the sense, in speaking of where he is, that it is your place, too. And Peter might have been there. Why was he not there? Did the Lord love John more than He loved Peter? -- who could say that? What was happening was that John was letting Jesus love him, and appreciating it, and Jesus had put John in the place of holy intimacy that He would give to every one of His own. So you see, John comes to the front now. There are times when those who put themselves in the background are the only ones who seem equal to maintaining the service of God in our meetings. There are times when the ready active speakers have to make signs, so to speak, and the one who has been enjoying the love of Christ, and has wanted nothing else, has to do the speaking. I commend that to you, dear brethren. I would take it to my own heart: how much better it is to be loved and appreciative of the love of Christ, than to serve.
I go on to chapter 19: 26, where we have the beautiful record of how the Lord committed his mother to John. I
{214}
have no doubt there were features in all the disciples that the Lord calls attention to. But at this peculiar and distinctive moment, looking round on those that stood by the cross, He has not in view a certain great service that would receive public acclamation, but what you might call a private service. For Mary was the mother of Jesus according to the flesh, and stood in a certain relation to Him, that no one else occupied. So I call it a private service. May I say reverently -- a matter that concerned the Lord Himself in His life of flesh and blood. He was tender concerning His mother according to the flesh -- who was about to lose Him according to the flesh -- concerned that she should be cared for. To whom would the Lord entrust her? It is to the disciple "whom he loved". I think these private commissions disclose an intimacy and a nearness to Christ that are to be coveted. Such a private commission, as when you open your house and take in a saint. Here is a matter that is dear to the heart of Christ. I am not taking it out of its place, I trust; it may not be regarded as of great spiritual importance; but the Lord Jesus never leaves these matters unattended to. One who delights most in being loved by Jesus, would find many a service that the Lord would tell him to do.
Now I call your attention to the thought of witness in verse 35. It says "there came out blood and water". And then John says, speaking in an impersonal way, "and he who saw it bears witness". This feature of the truth, connected with the blood and the water, is the point where christendom, or public profession, turns to the one side, and those who know the love of Jesus in its holy intimacy, turn to the other; they part company here. No feature of
{215}
truth so definitely brings together those who love Christ in a fervent way, those that will not be satisfied with anything but nearness and intimacy. John pauses at this point. He does not say, 'This is an apostle that is speaking to you'. Paul would speak in that manner on occasion, although he would take this same place with John. But John emphasises the truth in this manner, he says, "he who saw it bears witness". He is not speaking second-hand, he is not speaking of what he was told, but of what he had seen. The thing was real to his own soul. He saw it, and his witness is true -- as though he himself attested what he saw as the truth. And then he says -- "He knows that he says true that ye also may believe". The man that lives in the love of Christ has moral weight in himself, he has no need to call on anything official to support what he is saying. Sometimes you will hear words like these: 'I am the oldest brother here, you know; I have been in fellowship fifty years, I have got some ground to speak'. John says he saw it, and what he saw is true, and what is true he knows. It was in his own soul. That is how he emphasises the truth, a beautiful way that can only be taken by one who is habitually in the sense of the love of Jesus.
In chapter 21 John is the first to recognise the Lord. This chapter shows how liable we are to move under influence, even wrong influence. Peter started the wrong movement. But at any such moment how valuable it is to have a brother or sister who, when the enquiry was raised, Where is the Lord? Can discern Him and point Him out definitely, saying, "It is the Lord!" You will get matters put right when this is reached. Peter is put right. The others are put right. What an asset to the company is a person
{216}
who can say, "It is the Lord". The Lord is in this matter, or in that matter. If you put the doctrine first to guide you, without any sense in your soul as to where the Lord is, that shows you are in the distance. Not that I do not need verification of everything from Scripture, but one who is accustomed to letting Jesus love him in intimacy and nearness, would have the sense, early in an exercise, as to where the Lord is. Now that is the man, and the phase of things that continue to the end, so that the Lord says, "If I will that he abide until I come" -- as though He would keep that for Himself. He wants the saints. His heart can never be satisfied with distance; He wants you, and He wants me in all the nearness of the bosom. He wants us so loveable, so submissive in being loved, that His own heart finds its joy in us. There are thousands of our dear fellow-christians, in accredited religious systems around us, who will not submit to be loved -- they lack in lovability. That does not please the Lord; it does not please His heart. If you want to please His heart, dear fellow-believer, you cannot do anything greater than submit to be loved.

THE ACTIVITY OF THE LORD
A E MYLES
@Acts 9: 32 - 43
The movements of the Lord Jesus are full of interest; they are marked by an import and meaning which cannot be overestimated or overemphasised. For instance, when the Son of God came into manhood, it was a movement of far-reaching importance; the bearing of it was such that it affected God and man. When the Lord Jesus took up His public ministry and service on earth, it was a movement of the deepest importance, and great consequences flow out of it. Again, when that same blessed Person died on the cross, it was a movement of immense magnitude and meaning, both for God and for men. Indeed, the bearing of it in its fulness we cannot possibly understand. Then when He rose from the dead, what significance was connected with that! What meaning! What a sphere was opened up for men in His resurrection! Finally when the Lord went up on high, who can measure what that involved, and the great issues bound up with it.
I want to dwell tonight on the significance of the last of these movements -- the Lord taking His place on high. Now this section of the Acts deals with the detail, and I should like to say a few words about the setting of these chapters, in order that you may follow what is on my mind. At the stoning of Stephen, the Lord Jesus was finally and definitely rejected by the Jews. He was rejected in His ministry and service to the nation, and on the cross
{218}
He was cast out as worthless. But here we find that He is seen in the vision of Stephen as standing at the right hand of God. He is *standing*, you will observe, not yet seated; and the testimony of Stephen to the nation was that he saw the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. The Person whom they had rejected in His humiliation and reproach, was now in circumstances of power and glory, but He was not yet *seated* at the right hand of God. That is, He had not finally taken up His new position, and the fact that He is standing there suggests that from the glory, the Lord Jesus would make one more appeal to Israel. What an appeal it was! A marvellous appeal! The words of testimony came from the lips of a man who was very like Christ.
Stephen was a man who was formed in the moral features of Christ. Have you ever noticed how like the Lord he was when he died? It says of him, "And they stoned Stephen, praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (@Acts 7: 59). You remember what the Lord said: "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit"(@Luke 23: 46). Here is a man, a follower of Jesus Christ, about to die a martyr's death, and what we see in him are the features and spirit of Christ. Stephen, however, could not possibly say, what no other but the Lord could say, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit:" but he could say, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit". That was as far as any other man could go. And then it adds, "Kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (@Acts 7: 60). One is reminded of the loud voice with which the Lord Jesus cried when He was on the cross, indicating that He went out, not at the point of utter weakness and
{219}
exhaustion, but at the point of strength. In that respect we see how much Stephen is like the Lord. And then when he said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge", it recalls what Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (@Luke 23: 34). Stephen could not go further than, "Lord, lay not *this* sin to their charge". You see how iniquity and evil in the hands of men had progressed. The Lord Jesus accredited them with ignorance -- He said, "They know not what they do;" but Stephen has to say, "Lay not *this* sin to their charge". The sin was that they were about to slay Stephen, and so reject and refuse the appeal of the One who stood at the right hand of God. "And having said this, he fell asleep".
Now from that point onwards you will find a great change in the character of things in this book of the Acts. Previously the great burden of the testimony, given by those who preached, was that Jesus is the Christ; but having been made, as we are told, "both Lord and Christ", we get the introduction of a new phase in the activity of the Lord Jesus. From that new position we find Him moving as Lord, and directly active from the right hand of God as Lord. Over and over again in chapter 8, you get the reference to the Lord. It says, "they were baptised to the name of the *Lord* Jesus" (verse 16); then, speaking "the word of the Lord" (verse 25); "the angel of the Lord" (verse 26); and then "the Spirit of the Lord" (verse 39). Thus we get in the chapter four suggestions, four features, connected with the lordship of Christ, as exercised from heaven at the right hand of God. First of all, the *name* of the Lord -- authority is connected with the name. Then we get the *word* of the Lord -- light is connected with the word. The *angel* of the
{220}
Lord speaks of His intervention, His power to use angelic agencies in intervention on behalf of His people. And then finally you get the *Spirit* of the Lord, which is connected with the power that sustains His people. But I do not wish to dwell on those features, although they are full of the deepest interest. I only call attention here to the fact that the prominent thought throughout chapters 8 and 9, and onward, is that the Lord Jesus from the right hand of God is now directly taking control of the situation.
The first thing that happened after the stoning of Stephen was that the disciples were scattered everywhere. It was the first general persecution of the saints; a movement, I do not doubt, of the enemy. Satan had seen on this earth, on the very spot where the feet of Jesus had trodden, a man who was exactly like Christ, like the Christ whom he had succeeded in putting out of this world. Here on this earth was a reproduction of Him -- a man who could live and die like Christ -- and at once the forces of evil are stirred up to greater activity, and this great persecution began which scattered the saints. But what is so helpful to see in regard of all Satan's movements is this, that the Lord allows him to go so far, and whenever Satan makes a move, it only serves to bring to pass something which the Lord Himself desired. The result of this persecution was that the saints were scattered, and they preached the word everywhere. Thus you see the first great result of the Lord's movements from on high is this, that evangelical activity is established as one of the great features of the kingdom of God. It says that Philip announced the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And as we see this great effort on the part of the saints to reach out
{221}
to men -- they preached everywhere -- so we see also in the conversion of Saul of Tarsus an evidence of the subduing power of the Lord Jesus Christ, as active from the right hand of God.
Paul speaks of himself as the chief of sinners. When the chief of sinners can be subdued by the activity of the Lord, we do not need to fear to approach any man. There is not one remaining in the domain of darkness but can be subdued by the power of the Lord Jesus. He has power to subdue all things to Himself. Here, at the very beginning of this phase of things, the Lord manifests His power by reaching out His hand to one in the very stronghold of Satan, taking him who was chief and leader in the persecution of the saints, and bringing him right down to the earth. Now Paul is secured; he is the great vessel of the testimony as it is connected with the assembly. You will find that comes out later. At this moment he is secured in the kingdom, and for the kingdom, by the power of Him who is now supreme.
Now we come to the passages I read, where we get the activity of Peter. What I really have on my mind is this, that the kingdom of God is functioning today. It was functioning in that day, and it is doing so in this day with the same power, and there is no moral disease connected with sin, there is no power of evil as it presses upon men, but the kingdom of God can give deliverance from it. Peter finds out this man who had lain upon his couch for eight years. In the second instance I read, they *send* for Peter -- two men go for him -- but in the first instance Peter *finds* the man. It shows the two sides of activity in the kingdom of God. Now this man Aeneas, is not exactly a type of a
{222}
sinner being converted, but rather of one who is in the kingdom, but who is not getting all the gain and blessing connected with being there. Many of God's people are in that case today, that is, they are not getting all the gain from the kingdom of God, that the Lord would have them get, and it is of very great interest to notice what Peter says to this paralytic man. It is this, "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee". Peter does not say, 'Jesus, the Christ, will heal thee'. What he emphasises is the present bearing and functioning of the kingdom of God, in the power which proceeds from the right hand of God. The thing was operative and operating, it was going on, it was present, and Peter would make Aeneas acquainted with it. He says, "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee". I hope you see the bearing of that, particularly the younger ones, for it is a great thing to apprehend that the kingdom of God is acting in real living power from day to day.
You remember the case of the impotent man who is spoken of in the gospel of John. It says that he had had his infirmity for thirty-eight years. When the Lord found him, he began his sad and sorrowful story, that he waited for the moving of the waters, when at a certain season an angel came, and there was healing for the one who stepped down first. That kind of intervention was only an occasional one; it was not in force all the time. But what Peter brings to bear on this paralytic man is that the power to heal is available, it is present, it is going on all the time -- "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee". And then he goes on, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself". Now, let us see just what this incident stands for. Here is a man in the kingdom of God, and what marks him is that he is lying upon his couch. I
{223}
believe he represents those who only travel in the kingdom of God to the point that they apprehend the comfort and support that there is in it.
I should like to make that plain. There are many who know nothing more of the power of the kingdom of God, than what is connected with the relief side. They have found the forgiveness of sins -- that is a matter of relief -- very great relief, but how many there are who stop at that point! Let me ask you, dear fellow-believer, is this all that you have apprehended in Christ? You may say, 'It is a great deal'. It is, surely, but how much more there is in Him! Here was this man who had been lying for eight years on his couch, paralysed. What a picture of thousands of the Lord's people today! They are marked by the couch, by repose and rest. The couch is all right, but it is a bad thing to lie on for eight years! What the kingdom of God did for this man was to strengthen him to make his couch; the man became stronger than the couch, through the apprehension of the power that is in Christ to heal. The couch was all right in its place. That is, the kingdom will give us all the comfort and rest that we need. But there is something more in the kingdom of God than that, there is the power to bring about movement and life and vitality, so that the man himself should control the situation, and make his own couch. I hope you have followed that point, because it is of the deepest significance. How many young people there are who apprehend the forgiveness of sins, and move no further! How many there are who go through the greater part of their life, marked by paralysis. They have not apprehended the testimony: "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee". The bearing and import of His position today
{224}
at the right hand of God, is that healing is going on every day, and all day, not only at a certain season. The operative power is present and faith should take hold of it. This man is not exhorted to pray, he is not told to ask for something, for the thing that he needed was there. The kingdom was there in active power for him, and what he is told to do is to avail himself of it -- to rise up and make his couch.
Now, are you praying, dear fellow-believer, for some mighty power to take hold of you, and lift you out of a condition of paralysis, out of a condition in which you are making no spiritual movement and progress? Let me tell you the power is at your very door. You do not need to pray for it, but you do need faith and energy to take up and lay hold of all that is involved for you in the Lord's position at the right hand of God. "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee". There it is, there is the bearing of it, it is before us now. If any one here is sitting before the Lord in a condition of paralysis -- helplessness, having made no movement of soul for years -- the power and bearing of the kingdom are at their disposal. "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee".
I pass on now to the second incident, where we find a woman. What marks Dorcas is that she is full of good works. It is a good thing to do good works -- Scripture makes much of them -- but good works of themselves, and by themselves, are not sufficient to sustain a soul in vitality before God. This woman was full of alms-giving, and good deeds, but *she died*. There was no power *in them* to sustain life. Ah, we have to learn that life must be sustained from day to day. Formality and routine, even in
{225}
alms-giving and in good works, will not sustain us. Life can only be sustained as we are livingly in touch with the One who is at the right hand of God. So this woman died; the end of the story of all her continuous services to the poor is that she died; it is a sad end. Now the power of the kingdom comes in. They send for Peter, and he comes into the presence of this dead woman. We are told that the widows were there, and that, weeping, they showed him the body-coats that Dorcas had made; it was a scene of death. Now Peter puts all the widows out. They had been all right at the time of her activity in alms, and in good deeds, but the widows -- we can but judge -- were not sympathetic with life. They speak of what is connected with death; and Peter puts them all out. They do not represent those who have apprehended the power of the kingdom of God to sustain life. Christianity is a living system. It is to be marked by life and vitality, hence all that is unsympathetic with what Peter is about to do is excluded. It is of interest that when he restores Dorcas, it says he restores her to the "*saints* and the widows". The saints would be indicative of that element which would support life. The widows are not excluded altogether, but the good works which should be connected with our christian life are put in their proper place; they are not to have the whole place. If they have the whole place, the result will be spiritual death, but when put in their proper place, the saints come first and the widows afterwards.
What suggestions flow out of these scriptures for every one of us! It is a very wholesome question to ask ourselves, How are we getting on? What are we finding in the Lord? Are we finding enough in Him? If we do not
{226}
find enough in the Lord, we shall look elsewhere. Something is going to fill our lives, and we may be sure that every corner of our lives that the Lord does not fill something else will fill. Satan's world is full of what is attractive. He has many cunning devices for turning the Lord's people aside. God means to fill your life, and to fill it full with Christ. If that is so, we shall not die in all the routine of habit and custom and good works. We shall not be found paralysed at a time when vitality and movement should mark us. All these things are in the kingdom now. What I should like to impress upon you is that all these things are actively in operation now; they are going on. If I do not get them it is my fault, for they are there. They are there for every one of us, and they are there in the form of a kingdom; not as an isolated intervention on the part of God. But they are there *in* something -- in a vast blessed system that is functioning every day of the week, and is sustained by the blessed Man at the right hand of God -- and it is there for every one of us.
Now in the light of this, let us all ask ourselves if the things that are thus available are really in our possession. What a man Aeneas would be to walk with! He had a couch, but he had learned how to make his own couch; he knew how to rise up from it. He would know how to rest in all the comfort and support of the kingdom, but he would no longer be a man who would stop at that. He would know something of the liberty of the movements of the kingdom of God. What a thing it is, under God's hand, to be found in liberty, able to explore all the vast range of blessing that there is in Christ! What an expanse our eyes are opened upon, when we see there is something more in
{227}
christianity than just the meeting of our needs! Aeneas would be a man like that. And what a woman Dorcas would be! I do not suppose she stopped making her body-coats, or ceased her alms-giving; but she had come under the power of the kingdom, and she would know that there was more in the kingdom than giving alms; there was life there. Oh, dear young believer, the Lord Jesus can sustain you in life! He can make every day to you a living day! He can give you something fresh from Himself every day! Do you know that the day that does not bring some fresh impression of Christ is a lost day? You know what the thought of life is if you have a garden. At a certain season of the year, you go out and you see something fresh every day. The bud of yesterday is the flower of today. Things are living; they are moving. This is what marks the kingdom of God. It is possible to substitute the habits of formality for the movements of life. We can go on with a routine, which may be outwardly correct and good enough. But the great test as to whether I am in the gain of the kingdom of God is this, that no enemy can take an inch of territory from me, and that every day is a living day.
The import and bearing of that expression, "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee", should be upon my spirit every day. It expresses the power of the kingdom. Satan would seek to put his mark upon us; he would seek to limit us, and to restrict us in our enjoyment of all that is in Christ. But there is power in the kingdom of God to meet all that -- power to make your life a full life. We live in a day when most of those who are moving with the Lord have the impression that He is soon coming for us. There may be but few days remaining to us. What are we going to do
{228}
with these days? If we are content with merely going to meetings we may be like Dorcas, and die. If we are content to have the comfort side of the kingdom only, we shall be like Aeneas, lying paralysed on a couch. But if we come under the precious shining of Christ, the mighty power of the Man who sits at the right hand of God, who has been made Lord, in whom all authority and power are vested, we shall taste the reality of what life according to God is. The Lord is exercising His power for the protection and the encouragement and the enlargement of His people. Now, are we sitting under the shining of Jesus? Do His things look attractive and precious to us? Are they becoming more so, as the days go by? If they are not, then let us see to it. Remember, it requires no special intervention of God to help any one of us in this condition, for the power is already there. The kingdom of God is active in power, and in order to get the gain of it, we have only to take up in faith what is lying at our very door available for us. The Lord help us that we may be sustained in living conditions, finding that He is enough to fill our lives, to fill them so full that there will be no room for anything else.

{229}
THE NAME OF THE LORD
A E MYLES
@Acts 8: 16, 25, 26, 39
My thought is to speak further about the lordship of Christ. I am greatly impressed with the conviction that, generally speaking, there is failure to apprehend the bearing and import of this. We often bemoan our lack of appreciation of the headship of Christ, of all the blessedness that resides in Him as Head, but I feel that this arises in the main from failure to understand His lordship, without learning which, we cannot move on to what is connected with headship.
The first thing I would call attention to is that Christ is Lord by divine appointment, as it says in @Acts 2: 36 "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ". This is a divine appointment which must be recognised, and bowed to by every man. True, the Lord is not asserting His rights as Lord publicly in the world today. Were He to do so it would mean the end of the world-system, and the judgment of all who refused to bow. For when He publicly asserts His rights, He will do it with all the authority and power connected with His place as Lord. He is, however, bringing the claims of His lordship to bear upon His people, so that they may come into the gain of the kingdom of God now by responding to those claims.
The thought of lordship is connected with the individual pathway of God's people, and has to do with the
{230}
wilderness, whereas headship is connected with what is collective. In all that pertains to our responsible path, we are called upon to recognise the authority of the One who is Lord and Christ. While this, as I have remarked, has relation to the individual, yet it is universal in its bearing. The context of the scripture we have read shows that representatives of the three great divisions of Noah's family -- Shem, Ham and Japheth -- are brought into blessing as under the authority of the Lord; showing that the Lord's activities at the right hand of God are not restricted to one nation or race, but that as Lord He has universal rights which extend to all men, and which He can enforce at any moment.
There are two simple thoughts connected with lordship, namely, authority and administration. Authority comes first. We have a beautiful type illustrating these, and showing the setting of the two thoughts, in Joseph in Egypt. He was put in the place of authority, and the people were told to regulate themselves by his commandment (@Genesis 41: 40), and when the time of famine came, the word of Pharaoh was, "Go to Joseph" (@Genesis 41: 55). There we see the combination of authority and administration. Authority is necessary as a prelude to administration, in order that the blessing might be made available. What is in Christ is to be made available; that is, the administrative side of the kingdom, and it is made available for the very humblest.
There are four distinct features of the kingdom of God, which are suggested in the verses before us. They are, the *name* of the Lord, the *word* of the Lord, the *angel* of the Lord, and the *Spirit* of the Lord. These expressions
{231}
refer to great things, and I trust that grace may be given me to speak of them in such a way that our affections may be touched. I shall speak first of the *name* of the Lord. I wonder if we realise what an asset we have in the name. It is more than a designation or a description, which identifies a certain person in our minds. It carries with it the thought of the authority and power connected with that blessed Person at the right hand of God. The name involves the setting forth in testimony of all that was presented personally in Christ. The name of the Lord is a priceless possession for His people. It is said to be a strong tower, into which the righteous run and are safe.
I wish now to bring forward some examples, showing the authority and power of the name. You will recall that in @Acts 4: 7, when Peter and John were called upon by the rulers to give an account as to the healing of the lame man, the challenge they had to meet was this, "In what power or in what name have *ye* done this?" If men do not realise the value of the name of the Lord, the powers of darkness know something of its power! What disturbed the minds of these religious leaders was that another name was being witnessed to amongst men. Behind that name was the authority of a kingdom greater than the kingdom of darkness, a kingdom that was not powerless in face of all man's need, but which carried with it the power of healing in the name. That name will be a passport to us; it will enable us to travel among men untouched and unscathed, even where the powers of darkness seem to be supreme. The confession of the name will bring salvation (@Romans 10: 9). There is no power in saying that we hold certain religious
{232}
views. A Unitarian, who denies the deity of Christ, could say that; the power is in the confession of the name.
I refer to another example of the power of the name. It is recorded of Saul of Tarsus, that as he travelled to Damascus, suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven, and falling on the earth, he heard a voice. There was something about that voice that affected Saul of Tarsus. He had never heard anything like it before; there was something about it that brought these words to his lips: "Who art thou, Lord?" These words would not come lightly, or easily to the lips of that haughty, proud Pharisee, now lying on the earth. The voice he heard indicated that the Person who spoke was "Lord". He spoke with an authority that could not be denied. The Lord answered, "*I* am Jesus". What a precious disclosure to know that Person as Jesus -- the name that speaks of His lowliness, of His down-stooping love, of His service to man! How our hearts are touched with the appealing grace connected with it!
Then another instance we find in Mary, in @John 20: 2, when she went to the sepulchre to seek Jesus. "They have taken away the Lord", she said. So far as Mary knew He was but a dead Man, but dead or alive He was *her* Lord. The limits of His lordship to her were not defined by death, and death was no interruption of His authority over Mary. Dead or alive, He was Lord to her. "Tell me where thou hast laid him", she said, "and I will take him away" (verse 15). What a proposal for a poor weak woman to make! Where could she take Him? What could she do with One who was dead? Mary's love recognised no limitations or barriers. She would undertake anything to have her Lord.
{233}
Another example is found in Thomas. He was not with the other disciples when Jesus came and stood in the midst; and he was unbelieving when told that others had seen the Lord. Thomas had accepted the Lord as living and moving amongst men, but was not prepared to accept Him without special manifestation, as having passed through death into the triumph of resurrection. But there came a time, eight days after (a long period to miss the gain of the risen Lord), when Jesus came again with a special word for Thomas, and then Thomas said, "My Lord and my God" (@John 20: 28). He now knew that the Person who stood before him in resurrection life was his Lord.
One more example occurs to me, this time showing the power of the name, not only over an enemy or a follower, but over one who, it might be said, had prior rights. In @Luke 19: 29 - 36 the Lord sent two of his disciples to bring the colt that was tied. And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to the disciples, "Why loose ye the colt? And they said, Because the Lord has need of it". The name of the Lord was at once the authority for taking the colt. It was not an enemy who was challenging the disciples, but those who thought they had prior rights. But even then, when that word came, "The Lord has need of it", there was an end of all priority. Let me make a simple application. Many a time the Lord Jesus has laid His hand on a boy or a girl in an unconverted family. Perhaps the Lord's right to take the first place in that young person's heart has been challenged by parents. But all prior rights and claims, of whatever character, have to give way to the Lord's supreme claim. It is no use trying to resist it, for what the Lord claims He holds. What I wish
{234}
to show by these examples is the way the Lord sets Himself that we might be brought within the sphere of His authority.
Then there is a striking scripture in the Acts, showing the power of the name as restraining the activities of evil powers. "And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about, took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches" (@Acts 19: 13). Notice that it was the *name of the Lord Jesus* they took in hand to call upon them, but what they actually said was, "I adjure you by Jesus" -- not the Lord Jesus. The word says: "no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 3). That is a plain, positive statement. I have been about the world a bit, and into some rough places, and I have heard men curse, using the names of divine Persons in many varieties of blasphemy, but I have never heard a man curse in the name of the Lord Jesus. In the name of Jesus? Yes, in the world that precious name is only considered fit to add point to some filthy jest, but the apostle affirms that no man can say *Lord* Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit. Those seven sons of Sceva could effect nothing; they were overcome, and fled naked, and wounded. The evil spirit said to them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but *ye*, who are ye?" (@Acts 19: 15). The powers of darkness know well and recognise the power of the name of the Lord.
What an asset that name is to us! You may say, as I have done many times, I have not the courage to confess the name; but "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power" (@2 Timothy 1: 7). Cowardice is not replaced by
{235}
bravery, for that is but a human quality; God would replace the spirit of cowardice by power, and power is of God. It is the power of the kingdom of God behind the name of the Lord Jesus that gives it authority and recognition in the darkest corners of the kingdom of darkness. That power will see you through the world. It may not deliver you from persecution or suffering, for that is not the intent of the kingdom of God, but it will make you superior to such enemy manifestations: "The kingdom of God come in power" (@Mark 9: 1). The martyrs were not delivered from torture, and death, but they went out in triumph and victorious -- a greater thing than having their lives preserved. Life is in the hands of God, and the enemy can only touch it if allowed by God, but the all-important matter is to be saved, that is, made superior to the influences that hold men as away from God. There is much precious blessing to unfold to us, but to enjoy these divine unfoldings, we must be delivered from the power of sin, and the world.
I now turn to the second feature suggested, in verse 25, namely, the *word* of the Lord. The significance of all these features, in the way we are considering them, is that they are linked with the Lord. The word of the Lord covers the holy Scriptures without a doubt, and would include also whatever communication the Lord would make to our hearts from the Scriptures in the power of the Spirit. The Lord deals with each one of us with infinite skill. He knows just the right moment in our histories to give us a certain bit of light. The light was there all the time; it is not something added, but the Lord knows when to give it to us, so that we may be kept in spiritual movement. For His
{236}
thought for us is that we should be kept moving spiritually all our days.
The thought behind the expression, the word of the Lord, as I understand it, is that the word has all the authority of the Lord. Even in the religious world today the Scriptures are not accepted as having authority. Men talk as though the word of the Lord was submitted to them for analysis and criticism, to see if it is worth accepting. So they discard and dissect and refuse, the divinely inspired utterances at the whim of so-called scientific criticism. But the Scriptures come to us with all the authority of the One who sits at God's right hand. It is not a question of whether I am prepared to accept them. There they are, and they stand accredited with all the authority of the Lord, and we cannot disregard them. Hence, if the Lord is pleased to give us light which involves any change in our ways, in order to bring our manner of life into accordance with the light, it is serious to disregard it. For the light is authoritative, and to refuse it may bring us under severe discipline. Who can question the Lord's right to discipline His people? Who can deny Him this right? As Lord, He is set to break down all self-will and insubjection on our part, because they stand in the way of His love. Disobedience was the first thing that came in to break the conditions connected with the garden of Eden. Now *obedience* is to mark the entry into the kingdom of God. We have to *obey* the gospel. It is not a question of taking it, or leaving it; the bearing of the gospel is authoritative. It is presented for the obedience of faith, not for analysis, research, or investigation by the natural mind. The gospel does not
{237}
attempt to explain things to the natural mind; it is for the obedience of faith.
I should like to emphasise the authority of the word of God. Do not think you can afford to slight or disregard any measure of light that the Lord may give you. The word of the Lord is authoritative, and if we do not take heed thereto, we shall have to come under discipline. His love is of such a character that He could not rest content with anything short of having us all for Himself. The lordship of Christ would protect us from every foe, and secure us wholly for Himself. It would put us in a sphere where He can do what He will with us; it would expand and enlarge us in preparation for still greater things. We travel through the kingdom of God, so to speak, in order to reach the assembly. In the kingdom we are subdued, and our wills broken, and thus we are prepared to take up corporate relations with each other. The assembly speaks of what is for Christ. He gave Himself for it, and only the whole assembly can satisfy His heart. We can thus see the necessity of first coming individually under the subduing power of the kingdom, so that we may be qualified to take up assembly relations, in which the individual is to be merged. If we try to take up assembly relations with unsubdued spirits, we shall be a source of concern, and a hindrance to the Lord's people. Would you not like, dear young believer, to grow up comely and straight amongst your brethren, not warped this way or that, but as fitting in with them, and a comfort to them? If you travel by way of the kingdom, under the protection of the name of the Lord, and as submissive to the word of the Lord, when you take up assembly relations you will make progress in that
{238}
which is so dear to Christ. The assembly is not the place where self-will is to be broken; the kingdom effects that. The assembly is connected with the links of affection we enjoy together, and the individual is merged there. The assembly is a corporate thought. There is no room or place there for strong individuality. Dominant natural personalities in the assembly are subversive of its workings, which are to the end that Christ should be Leader and supreme.
We are fitted individually in the kingdom to take part in that. If, while being fitted, we acknowledge the authority of the word, it will save much wasted history, and lost time, and perhaps, many bitter tears. For if the Lord has to bring us to His own thoughts through an ocean of tears, He will do it. It is not the way His love would select, for He does not afflict willingly. But each one of us has to come under the subduing power of the Lord. Some may at the moment be passing through a time of stress, and as they take account of their circumstances, they may not see that the Lord is taking the easiest way, but how could we accredit His love with anything less than that? The pricks are hard, when we kick against them. Sometimes there is that about us, and in us, which the Lord has to break down, to make way for Himself, and so the way may seem hard. He will have us for Himself, and He has all the power to effect His pleasure. How blessed then to yield to Him, and to enjoy all the precious unfoldings of His love! How blessed to let Him regulate the daily pathway for us with all its details! We cannot say, Tomorrow we shall do this or that. We have to say, If the Lord will, we shall do this or that. That does not mean that
{239}
we should not have concern, and use wisdom in relation to our path, but after we have done all we can do, we have to say, If the Lord will. He has the last word, and has the right to come into our lives, and to adjust or change what is not suited to Himself. What He adjusts may have been long treasured, but He will have the supreme place.
Well, that is what I desired to bring before you on this occasion, to emphasise these two thoughts, the gain to us of the name of the Lord, and of the word of the Lord. If you move on these lines, you will make progress. The world will not then hold you for itself, the Lord will have secured you for Himself, and you will be a comfort to the people of God.

THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD
A E MYLES
@Acts 8: 26 - 33, 36 - 39; @Matthew 12: 43 - 45; @Romans 14: 17
My thought is to speak about the features of the kingdom of God, which are suggested in the two expressions, "the angel of the Lord", and "the Spirit of the Lord". I shall say but a brief word about the first, because I feel what is connected with the second feature is of primary importance.
What a great thing it would be if some heart in this company tonight were definitely secured for the Lord. In saying that I am not thinking about unconverted persons. You may have been converted for many years; you may even be breaking bread, and yet your heart not be wholly secured for the Lord. Scripture abounds in examples which show what God can and does effect with one whose heart is devoted wholly to Himself. What an asset it would be, not only to the district in which you reside, but to the assembly of God, if your soul should be wholly secured for the Lord!
I feel sure that some of you young people, as you look around on those who are older, must take cognisance of the fact that some have made soul progress, and others have not. I doubt not that you can discern those who have moved with God, by a certain freshness that makes the part they take in the meetings for edification. Soul progress and freshness go together, as formality and staleness do. We
{242}
are privileged to learn, not only from Scripture, but also from what we see worked out in one another. If we have fifty of the Lord's people to walk with, it means fifty opportunities of learning, and if we note and feel that some have not moved on in soul history, it is a warning to us to avoid the entanglements that hinder progress.
Now I want to show, dear young people, what I have in mind when I speak of your being secured for Christ. It is that you should take up christianity as a living thing every day, as that which actuates you all day, as the controlling feature of your life, and to which everything else is incidental and subservient. That is what marks a heart secured for Christ. The intent of divine Persons, in their activities amongst the Lord's people, is that we should be spiritual. In Old Testament times God would be approached only by the priests. They represent spiritual persons, and God wants such. His end is not secured unless we are formed in what is spiritual. Piety is a good thing; it is a feature of christian life that Scripture makes much of; but you can be pious, attend meetings regularly, and yet not be spiritual. The distinction between those who get on in their souls, and those who do not, is a question of spirituality. How blessed it would be if you made such progress that you stopped at no point short of the divine intention. If Satan can stop us at some point of soul history short of the Lord's thought for us, he has done all the damage he can. But all the influences with which the Lord would surround us would encourage us to move on.
I turn now to the thought of the angel of the Lord. You will recall that we have considered the meaning of the Lord's present place at the right hand of God. He is now in
{243}
the place of authority, so that the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ may be administered to His people. The Lord Jesus has every necessary agency to maintain His activity amongst His saints. The thought of "the angel of the Lord" is perhaps more connected with the Lord's movements amongst His people as regards what is providential. For instance, in our chapter, it was the angel of the Lord who spoke to Philip saying, "Rise up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert". But it was the Spirit that said to Philip, "Approach and join this chariot". There you see the distinction; the angel has to do with getting Philip from Samaria to the desert, and the Spirit has to do with the moral work.
The Spirit is always engaged with what is moral or spiritual. I will try and make the distinction between the moral and the spiritual in a moment. It was an angel of the Lord that smote Peter on the side, while he was sleeping in prison, and rousing him up spoke to him, saying, "Follow me" (@Acts 12: 8). It was an angel who appeared to Paul on that night of fear, with shipwreck ahead, and said, "Fear not, Paul" (@Acts 27: 24). In these instances the activities of the angel are connected with the Lord's intervention providentially. The import and bearing to us is this: that the Lord Jesus from His place at the right hand of God knows how to put His people into circumstances, or to take them out of them, in a way best calculated to promote what is spiritual. He knows the exact time in our history to bring in some trial, and how to bring in some great pressure, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a situation, or some other depressing circumstance. His
{244}
object is not to give us the best possible condition of life here, otherwise we should all have health and wealth. He uses His power from the right hand of God, to intervene in our circumstances, so that we should get the right kind of exercise to promote what is spiritual. Is the Lord taking you through the desert? If so, it is in view of your being spiritually enriched.
I now come to the second feature, connected with the expression, "the Spirit of the Lord". Administration is connected with the Spirit. When the moment came for the ministering of Christ to the eunuch, it is the Spirit who speaks. It is in this way we get the gain of the present moment. I trust the Lord will help me in speaking of this side of things, because it is the point where many miss their way. I feel sure that most, if not all of us, have some measure of appreciation of the work of Christ. The work of that blessed Person stands out prominently in our minds but I wonder what measure of appreciation we have of the work of the Holy Spirit. Yet it is in connection with His operations that the great question of spiritual capacity lies. It is our spiritual capacity that determines the measure of blessing we can contain. Our measure is connected with the Spirit's work.
It is not without significance that the time of the Lord's sojourn on earth was short, and His public activities confined to a very small area. In fact as we read the words of Jesus recorded in @John 14, we gather the impression that the Lord regarded the day of His presence at the right hand of God, and the Spirit's presence down here in believers, as a greater day for His own than their having Him with them on earth. The Lord speaks too, of their doing greater
{245}
works than He did. From this we see the tremendous importance attached to the presence of the Spirit.
In the religious world around, Satan has well nigh succeeded in taking from the minds of those who profess christianity, all thought of the presence of the Holy Spirit as a divine Person. We can learn this from the movements of the enemy, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts (@2 Corinthians 2: 11). Whenever you see the enemy concentrating an attack upon a certain feature of the truth, you may be sure there is some definite blessing in that feature. I press this because I feel there is lack in this regard amongst those with whom we walk.
The passage read in Matthew's gospel shows that Satanic activity is intensified by the outward cleansing connected with a Christless christianity. An unclean spirit is cast out of a man. The great question is what is to take its place, and become the controlling power of the man. The divine thought is that the Spirit of God should take that place. If the place is not occupied by the Spirit of God, it will be reoccupied by evil spirits, and not one, but eight. They return and find the place swept and adorned; that is the mere profession of christianity, which, though it brings about certain benefits, yet only makes room for enlarged evil activity. What a picture of the religious world today! The name of Christ is but a cover for intensified Satanic activity.
There are three features in Scripture connected with the Holy Spirit. First, His presence here as indwelling the believer; secondly, His activity, or the line on which He moves; and thirdly, His normal work. Let us consider the first feature -- that God, the Spirit, a divine Person, is here
{246}
in believers, not as an influence as is taught, but as a Person. This is a fact, not merely a doctrine, and a fact of far-reaching importance. Paul says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (@1 Corinthians 3: 16). All privilege open to us is consequent on the presence of the Spirit. The second feature is the line of the Spirit's activity. "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh" (@Galatians 5: 17). Here we see the line of the Spirit's activity, always against the flesh. The third feature is the normal work of the Spirit, which is unfolded in Colossians and Ephesians. Moral things are unfolded in Romans and Corinthians. The distinction between moral and spiritual is that moral things involve the question of good and evil. God has been pleased to reveal Himself, and this has great consequences for men. It brings to light the distinction between good and evil. Good takes character from God. It is connected with what God is, and the attendant issues of good and evil that arise out of the revelation of God are moral things.
Now to be spiritual is just this -- it is to have capacity formed in us to enjoy spiritual things. Our measure of spirituality is the measure in which the Holy Spirit has taken effect in us. What I am speaking of now lies beyond the question of flesh working in us, and the Spirit being against the flesh, and the great power in us by which we judge the flesh.
I pass on now to the consideration of the expression, "the Spirit of the Lord". You must have noticed in reading Scripture, how many titles are given to the Holy Spirit. We get "the Spirit of God", "the Spirit of God's Son", "the
{247}
Spirit of Christ", "the Spirit of promise", etc. Each title is suggestive of the Spirit's activity in that particular connection. The "Spirit of the Lord", refers to the Spirit's activity in making good to us all that the Lord has made available for us. How comforting it is to think that there is One here, in and with the believer, who knows perfectly all that is in Christ. If we take account of our measure of knowledge of Christ, it is very small, but what a comfort it is to know that there is a divine Person indwelling believers for the purpose of making known every feature of Christ which has been expressed in Him as Man here. The Spirit knows and treasures every feature of the glory of Christ.
I referred to authority and administration as two features connected with the thought of lordship. We now see how administration is going to come into operation. It is by the Spirit of the Lord making available to us what is in Christ as Lord. I wonder if we are all learning from that source. Do we all value that source? It is better than books -- the means used by man to acquire knowledge. This is what a divine Person makes known to the people of God. How shall we ever learn in the flesh and blood condition, in weakness and humiliation here, what Christ is at the right hand of God for us, apart from this divine Teacher? And we do well to note that as the Spirit of the Lord the Spirit is here in all the authority of the Lord.
In another place the Spirit is called "the Spirit of grace", and of some it says they had "insulted the Spirit of grace" (@Hebrews 10: 29). As the Spirit of grace, the Holy Spirit is presented in all the grace of Christ. Grace can be refused, the Spirit of grace can be treated insultingly.
{248}
Grace is the Spirit's attitude towards men, not that they see Him or know Him, but the Spirit is perfectly representative of God and as the Spirit of the Lord He is representative of the Lord. Hence, if we set aside the authority of the Spirit, we shall miss the gain of Christ's present position at the right hand of God, that is, in other words, the gain of the kingdom. We know from other passages that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is an unpardonable sin. When the Lord Jesus was here men did to Him whatever they would, they hanged Him on a tree; yet it is in the name of the Lord Jesus that forgiveness is preached, but to speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit is a sin that will never be forgiven.
I trust you see now what I am leading up to -- that we should get an impression of the importance of the Spirit's presence and activity, and see that He makes good in us what has been made available for us by the work of Christ. The way things work out in @Acts 8 provides an example of this. The angel of the Lord sends Philip into the desert, that is, he prepares the way, so that administration which is by the Spirit may be carried on. Philip was obedient to the word of the angel. As obedient to the Lord's authority, he is now available to the Spirit. The Spirit speaks: "Approach and join this chariot". Philip obeys. He is a man under authority; all the conditions are present for the administration, and the empty heart of the Ethiopian eunuch is to be filled. There are many of the Lord's people who would be obedient to the angel of the Lord, allowing their path here to be ordered according to His word, but it is a testing question as to how many would accept the direction of the Spirit.
{249}
Are we sensitive to the voice of the Spirit? There may be some here tonight to whom the Spirit has given a deep exercise. How have you answered to it? Are you where you were before the exercise? It is a serious thing not to listen to the promptings of the Spirit of the Lord. The Spirit has ways and means of communicating to us, and His voice is often heard in quiet places. Thus the Lord may allow an illness, or a death, to bring about desert conditions, so that the Spirit may communicate to us some spiritual thought and appreciation of Christ. I wonder if we should all be available for such an indicated movement as this -- for the Spirit to say, "Approach and join this chariot". The Lord had His eye upon that eunuch, returning from Jerusalem with an unsatisfied heart. Perhaps He has His eye upon many such. Are we available, sensitive, and obedient to the Spirit's voice, so that Christ might be ministered and those hearts filled?
Now let us see how the Lord works. As they journey the exercise develops in the eunuch's soul. Jesus is presented to him as One whose life had been taken from the earth. The glad tidings which Philip announced stand connected with that One. As they journey the eunuch says, "Behold water". At the right moment in this man's exercises the water presents itself; not too soon, but while the impress of the glad tidings as connected with One whose life was taken, was upon his spirit. The water opens a way, in figure, for the eunuch to follow Christ. "What hinders my being baptised?" he says, as though in his thoughts he saw that he must follow Jesus, and die where He had died. The eunuch was a man of position. He was in charge of the queen's treasure, with much to make life
{250}
here worth while. But something of the attractiveness of Christ, some working which can only be explained as the kingdom of God in power, encourages this man to forego the life that now is. And to follow One who had been "led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth". It was the working of the administration. Christ was made known to him, and possessing Him, the eunuch went on his way rejoicing.
There is no power like this at work in the world. There are powerful influences at work that appeal to men's cupidity or lust, but only the attractiveness of Christ as known in the heart, can cause a man to publicly choose death and burial (in the figure of baptism), because the life of Jesus was taken from the earth. What a power is connected with the Lord's present place at the right hand of God, and the presence of the Spirit of the Lord here! Moral results are seen. Men look for material results from the kingdom, forgetting that "the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit", (@Romans 14: 17). Though this kingdom deals with moral things, it is not small, its ramifications extend to all nations and countries. The world knows nothing of its existence. A sinner turned to God, is not an event worth a place in the world's chronicles, nor do they take account of men and women who own the authority of the Lord, and who find righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
It was on my mind to give some impression of the importance of recognising the presence and authority of the Spirit of the Lord. For the Spirit, as such, is the living
{251}
link and power with a living Man at God's right hand, and with those on earth whom He loves and who love Him.

SOUL PROGRESS
A E MYLES
@Ruth 2: 4 - 9, 15 - 17; @Ruth 3: 1 - 3; @Ruth 4: 1 - 5, 14 - 17
I wish to use these scriptures to illustrate the thought of soul progress. In this book, the Spirit of God has been pleased to indicate how a person may become at home with the people of God and have a living part in spiritual history. Not every believer has a living part in spiritual history; that is to say, not every name may be incorporated in the thought of *the generation*, as having treasured what is spiritual and handed it on to others.
Meetings are to be continued on the principle of the generation, from one to another. In chapter 4, we have presented the generation that is passing, represented in Naomi. We now see her without any sense of bitterness or loss, holding in her bosom a child that is said to be born unto her. Ruth represents the present and fruitful generation, holding the testimony in a place and taking up what is for God. The child represents the new generation that is to carry on the line of David; but you will notice that certain persons are missing. In this bit of history recorded in Israel, certain ones are lost. There were graves in Moab, possibly bearing the names of Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion, but they were not in the land. They missed their way because at a time of famine amongst the people of God they refused to face the exercises of famine; and, in order to find food, they went to Moab, a lower level where spiritual life cannot be sustained.
{254}
In a kind of way, there is a famine today. Some of the saints are facing the exercise of it with God; others, I fear, are seeking to avoid it -- seeking to find an easier way. If you look abroad in christendom, you will notice that there are many platforms -- many different levels -- on which you may pursue christianity. You may take it up according to the highest platform, where every feature of the truth is held livingly and vitally. But if you find that position makes too many demands, you have not to travel very far to find some lower level which will make fewer demands. If you do not like that, you may go still further afield and find some nominal position in christendom which makes no demands at all and where well nigh every feature of the truth has been given up. Accordingly, you will see the importance of facing famine exercises with God, for He has not deserted His people. As He sees the need of it, He may chasten us with trying circumstances; and the affliction may be severe for a time; but God is with His people. Those who stayed in Israel at the time of famine proved that, for the time came when God visited His people with plenty. Naomi came back to join in the plenty, but the experience and knowledge of God had been missed. This may be the histories of some meetings, and frequently one finds that a generation is missing. You see grandparents and grandchildren, but the intervening generation has been lost to the testimony, perhaps in the land of Moab.
It is interesting to note in the midst of this national history, that the Spirit of God introduces a bit of personal history, for He delights to record a personal history that yields so much to God. Ruth, perhaps, is representative of
{255}
the younger people here. You may take account of the fact that some of the brethren are growing old and less able to carry burdens, and if the testimony here is to go on, there must be persons in whom there is soul history corresponding to the history of Ruth. That is why I bring this scripture before you, in the hope that the Lord may bless it to some of the young people, and that they may seek to move on lines which will result in fruitfulness and blessing -- not only to themselves but to the brethren. Every young believer may be a prospective Ruth in the testimony. You may have such a part in the testimony that the Spirit of God would incorporate your name in a generation as having borne the burden of the testimony in your day, and having contributed to the wealth of the people of God.
In pursuing this line, I begin at the point where Ruth, in her gleaning, chanced to light on the field of Boaz. In verse 3 it says, "and she chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech". I would put some emphasis on the word "chanced" as suggesting what seems to be accidental. There may be some young believers whose connections with the people of God are in a way accidental. Perhaps your father and mother were in the meeting before you, and you have never been elsewhere. You are not here by your own choice, as yet, but on account of your parents. Ruth chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz. I wonder whether you young people have realised that. Do you realise that this allotment -- this parcel of land on which you find yourselves -- apparently by incident of birth, belongs to Christ? Boaz is a figure of Christ and it is His field. He has labourers -- and you are to
{256}
get the benefit of their labour. Perhaps you are a gleaner. Do you know what a gleaner is? A gleaner is one who follows in the footsteps of the reapers just to pick up here and there a little that falls from their hands. Perhaps some of you are like that. You come to the meetings, regarding the fact as something to do with your father and mother, or because of your friends. You take note that there are labourers in the field, but you find that you pick up only a little. Now I believe it is true that as long as you are here only on the basis of having chanced on this allotment, you will never pick up more than a gleaner's portion -- what seems to fall accidentally as the labourers work. How many young people are in that position; they gather here and there a little impression of Christ -- a little bit of help, it may be; but their position as connected with the meeting seems to be only on the basis of chance.
This young woman, Ruth, began at that point. It was a good point for a beginning, but Boaz came along and noticed her and made inquiry as to "Whose maiden is this?" Are you conscious that the Lord has noticed you, that He has made some inquiry about you, or have you never had the sense of His special attention in this way? What a wonderful thing in a person's history when he or she becomes conscious that the Lord is inquiring about them. I think the Lord does that, and I think it comes to light in this way: the brethren begin to say, 'There is young so-and-so who has never made any definite move yet, but he is always at the meeting, and so we will pray for him'. When the Lord is beginning to make some inquiry about you, you will find some reflection, some answer in the hearts of those that are near Him -- who are
{257}
sympathetic with His movements -- who would further His interests. And when the brethren begin to pray for you, not only in a general way while praying for the children of the saints, but in a special way by name, then you may expect further developments. That is an indication, I suggest, that the Lord is making inquiry of the reapers as to who you are.
Now Boaz charged Ruth in a way that is full of instruction. She was not to glean in any other field than his, for there was food there, and water too when she was thirsty. Not to glean in any other field alludes to a point where things become definite in one's soul. I want to press this side of the truth, for arriving at this would take one beyond being in a meeting merely incidentally, and put one there happily as having a living part in it; and to this end, the not gleaning in any other field is very important. Many do not get on in their souls because they glean in some other field. They want a little bit of Christ and so much of the world; five minutes over their Bibles, and an hour and a half over a novel; a little bit for Christ just to maintain the position respectably, and then a big bit of the world.
Do we realise that the field of Boaz contains all we need, for there is food and drink there, and there are young men -- that is to say, workers -- who will not interfere with us. They recognise how small is the measure of young people, just beginning to wake up to the preciousness of Christ; and that such can take only a little bit here and there, and they will not interfere with you. Perhaps, in a few broken sentences, you begin to pray in the meeting. The young men will not interfere with you -- not if they are
{258}
young men of Boaz. They will let what is present in your soul develop and grow, and by and by it will be adjusted and be put into relation to greater things. The field of Boaz is yours; Christ is yours; and anyone who is prepared to glean in no other field than His, will prove the all-sufficiency of Christ. As long as you glean in any other field, you will not prove it.
In soul progress, the next step which comes before me at the moment is this: that this maiden comes under the notice of Boaz again in a special way (@Ruth 2: 8). It says, "her sitting in the house has been little as yet" (chapter 2: 7). Some of us may be like that. We may have been connected with the meeting a long time and not gained very much, but Ruth came under the notice of Boaz in a special way, and he instructed the young men to let fall for her handfuls of purpose. I think typically, she had reached a point in her soul where she could not be satisfied merely with being at the meetings, and reading a Bible text from the calendar every morning and a few verses of scripture before going to sleep, but her soul needed something more. You come under the Lord's notice in a special way, when you are prepared to tell Him that you want something of purpose, divine purpose. These young men, reapers in the field of Boaz, know how to drop handfuls of purpose. They would be like some brother or sister who understands where a young man or a young woman is in soul history, and has prayed for such and followed them up, and something comes out of the scriptures that just suits their case. That is a handful of purpose. The purpose is the Lord's, of course; but He knows what your need is, and He sees to it that some handful of purpose is dropped for you. We can all
{259}
see how much greater a handful of purpose is than a gleaning. When you come under the Lord's notice in this way, how He will delight to add to you. I press upon you to think about coming under His notice -- not in a general way but in a special way. He sees all His people and knows them all, for He is the Lord. Not one of them is missed. But what I am speaking about is this, that amongst all the thousands who acknowledge Christ, you should stand out with a certain distinctiveness as one who wants to get on in your soul. One who wants to make real progress and move on to a goal. We should not be satisfied to merely be one of many, but to bear some personal distinction of which the Lord delights to take account and to which He would minister. There is a time in soul history when one becomes conscious of getting handfuls of purpose. You may go home from the meeting, and if your mother says, 'What was the meeting about tonight, John?' You do not have to say, 'I do not know'. But you will be able to give an account of something that was said *for you* -- something that you could carry home. These are handfuls of purpose.
With the thought of spiritual history before us, we now see that this young woman is brought into the gain of redemption; and, as feeling the importance of it, I would linger a moment to speak about redemption. Many would make redemption just the forgiveness of sins; but, as I understand it, it is a greater thought, having in view that we should be known as persons who belong to Christ absolutely, not merely those who have just a certain interest in Christ. Forgiveness of sins would bring relief of conscience and make us at home with God, assured of His
{260}
love, and cause us to love God for all the grace that has reached out to us in our need.
Forgiveness of sins is one of the possessions given to a believer, which he receives on the principle of faith; it is his. But in redemption the thought is that I belong to Christ. He is the Speaker, as it were, and He says, 'You are Mine'. How that would adjust our lives! Forgiveness of sins is a most precious possession: but there are many who have faith in Christ, and who have the forgiveness of sins, who have little sense of redemption.
In chapter 4 the matter of redemption is gone into, and in view of the practical bearing of the truth, let me point out for a moment that this question of redemption involves the exercise of the whole meeting. Indeed, here a care meeting was called about it, showing that those responsible in the locality must understand the bearing of redemption, if we are to impress upon the younger brethren who have not yet wholly committed themselves to Christ, the fact that they have been purchased. Boaz called the elders of the city to sit down, for this was a serious matter. It was not merely a question of saying something to the brethren on the way home. This occasion is one calling for the most definite care and the elders of the city all sat down, and the whole matter was gone into thoroughly.
What I would like to point out in relation to redemption, as it is presented here, is that, not only are the persons taken into account, but their whole history as well -- the history of Elimelech, Chilion and Mahlon and all they possessed. When you realise that the Lord has bought you absolutely, you learn also that He has purchased
{261}
everything connected with you -- everything. There was a bit of land in question that was included; there was also in the picture, Naomi, an old sister, with a sad history. The persons, the land, and all the history, including the failure, are all brought into the light of redemption. The Lord knows the history of the meeting. He knows Elimelech; He knows all the bitterness of Naomi's heart; but He can give us such a sense of His redemptive work that we are put together in holy freedom to be for Him. He has paid the price for it in His precious blood; the purchase has been made, and we are to be absolutely and entirely His. In spite of the history and the difficulties, the bearing of redemption is this: that the Lord would take up all God's people, those in every meeting. All that are sitting on the back seats, and all that have turned aside from the pathway, and He would assert His claim to them all. And what can He do with them? He can put them all together in happiness and liberty.
The Lord can banish all bitterness and bring in fruitfulness, so that there would be no sense of loss as to any missing in the testimony, although we would feel their absence. He can bring in youth with all its vitality. The Lord can set up any meeting on this basis. He can take it all over (the whole history and all the persons -- the troublesome ones too). He would bring everyone in the meeting into the liberty of redemption. In the light of redemption, you are able to say, 'well, the Lord knows all about my past history'. Perhaps it has hindered you from breaking bread and from committing yourself to the Lord amongst His people; perhaps the memories of it are keeping you silent in the meetings.
{262}
The liberty of redemption is marvellous -- the sense that He has bought the persons and the allotment, in spite of past history, although not disregarding it. We are thus freed from bitterness of soul and there is comfort and sufficiency. The old people are honoured and comforted as they need to be; whereas the present generation is marked by vitality, fruitfulness and liberty; and the coming generation has before it the glorious prospects of continuing the line of David right down to the end! The Lord would set up every local meeting on this basis. While I press at the moment the thought of histories -- especially of the young people as entering into the matter most vitally -- yet you have the idea of a local company set up on a basis of redemption, in all the liberty that would permit old age and youth and infancy to go on together. Think of them all going on together! Here, you have an old woman nursing a baby (that is the kind of young people's meeting suggested here -- the two together), and the child is not only a comfort to Naomi, but a restorer of her life, a joy. The history concludes with what I suggest is a happy meeting set up in vitality, and the line of David is preserved.
There is often a great deal of sad history and failure connected with a meeting, and if we are to go on happily we need to recognise the Lord's rights in redemption. The price has been paid which meets every condition, and on that basis the saints being together may go on happily in a locality. There is room for the old people; they are not put on the shelf. There is room too for those who carry the burdens connected with fruitfulness, and the liberty of the meeting is the liberty of redemption. The Lord has paid the
{263}
price -- His own precious blood -- for every one of us. If I am denying the Lord the right to my entire life and possessions, if I am refusing to yield myself and all that I have to Christ who has bought me, I am denying something that He has bought and paid for. I am as unrighteous as though I refused to hand over a piece of land that another has paid me for.
The conclusion of this matter is a most happy one, for the Spirit of God introduces a bit of spiritual history. You will have noticed that spiritual history is often interwoven with failure, but God can forget the failure, and the saints can forget failure too, for God's people are remarkably like Him. What God can forget, we can forget; and although this history of failure is interwoven with spiritual history, it is what comes out of failure that God delights in. God is righteous in forgetting the failure, for the price of redemption has been paid.
The spiritual history is in the reference to Rachel and Leah, which is most remarkable. For if you read the history, you will see that there was a lot of striving between those two women, and yet the scripture says of them, "which two did build the house of Israel". They built a good house. The jealousies and strivings that often mark a meeting are to be judged and forgotten.
Something for God that comes out of failure is treasured and carried forward and takes a permanent form, like a house builded. Then reference is made to Pherez and Tamar, other bits of history so sad and grievous, but the precious light of redemption is shed on all, and God is not afraid to speak of these names among His people. Why? Because they have all been purchased, every saint has
{264}
been bought. God has taken them over as they were, so to speak, with all the encumbrances attached to them, and He delights to pick out of their lives what has been for Himself. The failure must be judged; but having been judged, God can go on with His saints as if the failure had never occurred. The line of David is interwoven with the history of sad failure; but out of it there was something for God, something that was carried forward.
Many of us, no doubt, have histories of failure, and I would just ask this question in closing: Does that history of failure hinder you? I do not mean that failure can be ignored and lightly thrown away out of our memories, but I would suggest that the bearing of redemption is such that God can give you liberty from every kind of bondage. For the very basis of the word "redemption" is that we should be set free. God would set His people free. He has a way of dealing with everything that holds them. There is a divine way, and if any are being held back from entering into all that which belongs to the people of God, I would urge upon you that there is a divine way by which every shackle can be broken; for the price has been paid. The basis of these divine operations was established in the blood of Jesus, and God wants His people -- He wants you, He wants me -- to be free. No bond can hold us away from Christ. I repeat that no shackle need bind us, for there is a divine way by which every such bond can be broken, and we may therefore come into the liberty, the joy, and the happiness of redemption and be attached by spiritual history to what is of God here.
In the book of Chronicles God records what He gained out of the complete history of His people. The
{265}
failure is, for the most part, omitted. Persons who yielded nothing to His heart are disregarded; but He dwells with holy delight on men and women whose names are recorded, of whom we know nothing now, but of whom, I judge, when we get to heaven, we shall learn with delight that there was much in their lives for the heart of God.
I commend to you, dear brethren, the dignity of being here wholly for Christ, that out of your life there shall be pleasure for the heart of God. And that you should be here to continue -- not a history of failure, but spiritual history which is carried on to another generation until we come to the true David.

THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST
J H TREVVETT
@John 4: 12; @John 6: 31, 32; @John 8: 53 - 59; @Song of Songs 5: 9 - 16
I desire to bring before you the greatness of Christ, being fully aware of the immensity of the subject, and, at the same time, of one's feeble apprehension of it. Nevertheless, one is encouraged to know that that need be no barrier to our speaking of His greatness, for we are called on to speak of Christ according to the measure in which we have known Him, and according to the light which we have received concerning Him. Hence the great question which lies at the root of all we say about Christ, is what and how we have believed? The apostle says he believed and therefore spoke: "having the same spirit of faith, ... *we* also believe, therefore also we speak" (@2 Corinthians 4: 13). It is a mystery that some who profess to have the same "spirit of faith", and to believe, are yet silent. If I never speak, it might well raise the question as to what or how I have believed. Hence the great necessity for speaking, but the speaking must have its bed-rock foundation in the fact that we have believed, "having the same spirit of faith".
One of the most potent weapons in Satan's armoury is the weapon he wields against the supremacy and greatness of Christ, by suggesting comparisons with Him. In the minds of men, and even in the minds and hearts of believers, he will suggest some other as worthy of comparison with Christ. Those who love Him with incorruptible affections would never for one moment allow
{268}
the supremacy of His greatness to be challenged. He stands alone -- He is peerless -- incomparable! We may well, beloved, reserve all our superlative language for Jesus! -- expressing in the finest way, and in the highest terms that we can, our appreciation of Him. However much we feel the weakness of our words, we may well reserve our choicest language to express our sense of the greatness of Christ. One of the most serious phases of the opposition to the testimony in these last days is the suggestion of any comparisons with Christ. It is the way in which the enemy is working in the minds of men. At one time denying His deity, at another, His perfect humanity. But with it all ranking alongside of Jesus men of whom the prophet said, whose "breath is in his nostrils" (@Isaiah 2: 22). These are men whose names shine on earth's pages for a brief moment as they pass, but who, as their intellect and influence wane and they are no longer remembered by the sons of men, die, perhaps lamented, but they are soon forgotten.
To the believer -- the lover of Jesus -- there is one name, the name of Jesus, which stands out supreme, eternal, not merely in relation to His movements on earth, but in relation to His movements in heaven. One can well understand the psalmist saying in his exultation as he dwells on the greatness of Christ anticipatively, "His name shall endure for ever; his name shall be continued as long as the sun ... let the whole earth be filled with his glory!" (@Psalm 72: 17, 19). It is not enough that Jesus should fill the vision of my soul as my Saviour, as One who came here meeting all my dire need and distress, but I am to love His appearing. As the beloved apostle said, "Henceforth the
{269}
crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing" (@2 Timothy 4: 8). The rapture is the way out for us, and an exceedingly blessed way out -- for the Lord Himself shall come, He will not delegate this to another. He will descend from heaven and will catch us up to Himself, and so shall we ever be with the Lord -- yet, we love His appearing. It is the return journey, so to speak, for He will surely come, and we with Him -- we shall appear with Him in glory. There is nothing so calculated to stimulate our affection for Christ, and to secure public and unchallengeable testimony to Christ, as that we love His appearing. We long to see the once lowly Man of sorrows, the Man acquainted with grief, insulted, despised, and rejected, yet fully vindicated by the blessed God, when He shall "come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed" (@2 Thessalonians 1: 10).
While these scriptures show, on the one hand, how the greatness of Christ as here in manhood was challenged; yet on the other hand, there was flung back, as it were, such an unanswerable reply by the power and greatness of Christ Himself as could not be challenged or refuted. Alas, with many, the enemy has sought to plant the suggestion that Christ's place might be seriously challenged in our hearts, were He compared with others. What should we say today if challenged, even as the bride was in the Song of Songs, when they asked her, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved?" The question is asked twice, but she is ready to reply immediately. Many of us, alas, might keep silent. We might cherish Him secretly, but unless we are
{270}
prepared in confidence of faith for this taunt of the enemy, we shall not be ready to answer. It behoves us not only to be in the secret of His greatness, but to answer the challenge publicly and fearlessly in faith. The bride when challenged, describes Him from the crown of His head to the sole of His feet, as if to show that she was intimate with her beloved. There is nothing I covet for myself, and for the people of God, more than an increasing sense of holy intimacy with Jesus.
The bride in the Song of Songs says, "His head is as the finest gold". Young believers need to take account of the superlative language she uses to describe the features of the one here, who is a type of Christ. She says, "His head is as the finest gold". Modern teaching is seething with infidel thoughts as to Christ. They will not admit that His head is as "finest gold". Men know nothing of that marvellous statement of the Spirit of God, referring doubtless in the first place to Solomon, but having the greater than Solomon in view, that is Christ. We read of Solomon that "he was wiser than all men", and his wisdom "excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the east" (@1 Kings 4: 31, 30). I may admit the truth of Scripture, in a general way, but am I holding in my affections this stupendous fact as to Christ, that He is "wiser than all men;" yea, that He is the wisdom of God? The intelligence of men, however great the place they assume publicly, pales into insignificance before the wisdom presented in our Lord Jesus Christ -- He whose head is indeed "as the finest gold". And how pure are His thoughts! He is "of purer eyes than to behold evil" (@Habakkuk 1: 13).
{271}
The bride says further, "His lips lilies, dropping liquid myrrh". How different from the speaking of men, from the great swelling words of vanity, of men who long to be heard! What a contrast I learn in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose greatness shines in the grace of His speaking. You remember those remarkable testimonies to Him recorded by the writers of the four gospels. Matthew compels the testimony of those who as yet had not believed, as they say, "It has never been seen thus in Israel" (@Matthew 9: 33). They recognised in their midst One who had power to cast out demons and bring men into subjection to Him, who was to be King of kings and Lord of lords. Then Mark says, "He does all things well" (@Mark 7: 37) -- not some things, but all things; He stands in that way, unique. There is not another of whom it could be said, "He does all things well". And Luke says, "all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth" (@Luke 4: 22) -- "His lips lilies, dropping liquid myrrh". But John gives us the finest testimony, for in chapter 7: 46 the compelled testimony from those who came to take Him is, "Never man spoke thus". Did they not recognise the fragrance of those lips?
These are simple things, which we all know, beloved, but I plead with you, How does He stand in your affections? I once visited a godly old sister, who asked me how I was. Thinking she referred to my health, I told her how I was. But she replied, 'I do not mean that, but do you know Him any better today than yesterday?' I saw her the next day again, and her first question was the same! Whilst my apprehension of the greatness of Christ may be feeble, it ought to be increasing every day.
{272}
The bride speaks about His mouth: she says, "His mouth is most sweet". If I know what it is to come under the law of His mouth, I shall take character from Christ; I shall become marked by simple obedience and piety, as loving the laws of His kingdom. As the psalmist says, "the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver" (@Psalm 119: 72). Then having described every feature, and shown that there is not the slightest discrepancy between His Person and His words, she says, "He is altogether lovely". Not merely that He is "the chiefest among ten thousand" -- for they said of David: "*thou* art worth ten thousand of us" (@2 Samuel 18: 3) -- it was thus that David was appreciated by Judah and Israel -- but here is One who stands out completely and supremely as "altogether lovely". How that should appeal to our hearts! And then she points Him out, with genuine, incorruptible affections, and says, "This is my beloved, yea, this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem". That this was a powerful and convincing testimony to Him may be assumed, for immediately they say, "Whither is thy beloved gone, Thou fairest among women? Whither is thy beloved turned aside? And we will seek him with thee" (@Song of Songs 6: 1). She was not like the man in @John 5, who when asked where Jesus was, did not know. It says that Jesus had slidden away, for there was no desire in the heart of the man to know who He was, although he had been healed by the word of Jesus after lying for thirty-eight years in impotence. As yet there was no desire on his part to be in the company of Jesus, and he knew not where He was. Think of a believer like that! Or of a believer having the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Spirit and
{273}
not knowing the movements of Jesus. Many know nothing of His coming into the air to catch us up, but if I keep close to Jesus, if my affections are on the alert, I shall understand every movement, and shall have light as to what He is saying today, and what He is about to do. The bride knew where her beloved was; she said, "My beloved is gone down into his garden" (verse 2).
In @John 4, the question is raised as to whether He is greater than Jacob, and in chapter 6, as to whether He is greater than Moses, and again in chapter 8, as to whether He is greater than Abraham. And the answer in every case -- as indeed it must be -- is, He is greater! There could be no other answer. Is anyone prepared to compare Christ with Jacob; or with Moses; or with Abraham? Why, the very nature of His gifts, as bringing in living water, and living bread, are positive evidence, if evidence were needed, of His superiority and greatness over Jacob, or Moses, or Abraham. How pained would Jacob have been at such a supposition! "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well?" He had drunk of the well with his children and cattle, and had given it to Israel as a heritage. Thank God for His mercies from Monday to Saturday: cattle have them, and children have them, but a well from which cattle drink is not sufficient for the believer in Jesus. The woman speaks with pride of the well, and it may be all right for the daily journey, but I need something more than that. She says, "Art thou greater than our father Jacob?" Why, Jacob's whole moral being would have been in revolt against any suggestion that he was to be compared to Christ. You know what he did at the close of his great pilgrimage, how he worshipped,
{274}
leaning on the top of his staff. The Spirit would impress us with the transcendent act of faith on the part of the patriarch. And then, having worshipped, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and expired. A man who has control over his feet will be found an asset to the public testimony, and to the local meeting. Jacob had not always had control of his feet; he had wandered often, but in his last moments he was spiritual, and in view of his end, like a true father, he begins to speak to his children. Jacob calls them together that he may tell them the truth. Parents are sometimes afraid to speak the truth to their children, and that has caused havoc many a time; but the patriarch speaks the truth.
Jacob begins: "Reuben, thou art my firstborn, ... Impetuous as the waters" (@Genesis 49: 3, 4). Such is his indictment of the flesh. The natural man would say, He might have spared him that; but no, he is not to be spared in the view of his spiritual father. And when he looks upon Judah, how his eye would brighten as he says, "Judah -- as to thee, thy brethren will praise thee" (verse 8). He begins instinctively to think of Christ; he says, "The sceptre will not depart from Judah ... Until Shiloh come, And to him will be the obedience of peoples" (verse 10). Then he goes on to speak of Joseph, and with what tender feelings he refers to him as separated from his brethren, sorely grieved, shot at, and hated, but how glorious would be his end as blessed with the blessings of heaven above, and of the deep that lieth under. How he reminds us of Christ! I think it comes closely home to each one of us, What place has Christ in my heart? Is my status, or ability, or reputation to stand in the way of the supremacy of Christ? If His greatness were
{275}
better understood by us, it would solve every difficulty, both individually and collectively.
The Lord speaks to this woman in @John 4 of living water -- different in kind from that which Jacob drank and his cattle. He asserts His superiority over Jacob in that He is the Giver of living water. Is there anyone who is not conscious of having living water? I want to ask, Have you within you this spring -- this source of satisfaction which comes from God? "Whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever" (verse 14). You know what happened to this woman: instead of thinking of Jacob, or his children, or his cattle, she left her waterpot and went away to the men of the city. Her unfavourable character was known to the men of the city, but the compelling power within her drives her to them, and she says, "Come" I wish we all had the power to say, Come. And the men went out to Him. Her compelling, powerful testimony to His greatness as enshrined in her heart, drew them to seek Him, and in result they say, "We have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world" (verse 42).
In @John 6 they raise the question as to whether He is greater than Moses. Scripture tells us "there arose no prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah had known face to face" (@Deuteronomy 34: 10). He was, indeed, one of the greatest servants God ever had: and one of the ablest and wisest administrators. @Hebrews 3: 2 tells us he was faithful to Him that constituted him, in all His house. But Moses was but a figure of Christ. These opposers are not one whit concerned about Moses himself, but about something merely historical. If the enemy can use what is
{276}
historical to set against what is spiritual he has gained a great deal. How grieved Moses would have been at this question of the unbelieving Jews. "What sign then doest thou? ... Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat". It was not Moses that gave them that bread from heaven. It was God who had rained down manna upon them and given them the corn of heaven, and made them to eat angel's food. The manna was white and small as the hoar frost on the ground, and it was round, as @Numbers 11 tells us, and like the taste of fresh oil. But what did these men care for the manna? It was to them but a wonderful thing that had happened years before. They were not occupied with what it typified, or with what God would set before them in it. Jesus says, "My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven". Well, He established His greatness, not indeed that it needed establishment, but because of their unbelief. And some say, "Lord, ever give to us this bread" (verse 34). Is there one who has not this bread? Is there one who, like the prodigal, would feed himself with the husks that the swine eat? This heavenly food is available; it is Christ. He says, "I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger" (verse 35).
There is a wonderful description of God's goodness in @Psalm 104: 14, 15, "He maketh the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; bringing forth bread out of the earth, And wine which gladdeneth the heart of man; making his face shine with oil; and with bread he strengtheneth man's heart". We have the wine in @John 2; and the oil to make his face to shine in chapter 4; and then the bread that strengtheneth man's heart in
{277}
chapter 6. What a God He is! He takes account of the cattle and gives them grass to eat, but there are greater things reserved for man -- the bread and the oil and the wine. All these things are reserved for man -- His choicest gifts, speaking of Christ as come down out of heaven, that we might enter into some apprehension of *His* greatness.
The last question they ask is, "Art thou greater than our father Abraham?" How Abraham would have resented that question! The man who looked for a city, whose builder and maker was God; the one who looked on to Christ's day, and who saw it and was glad! Could he be compared with the Christ he looked for? The One in whom he exulted? What need there is for greater spiritual emotion with us! Do we exult in the thought of Christ? It says in @John 8: 56, "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced". We suppress our emotions in the presence of ministry; we will not show how we are affected -- and especially at the Lord's supper. Did we not suppress our emotions, there would be a larger number of thanksgivings -- a greater and fuller response in audible thanksgiving.
We know who Abraham was. Scripture tells us that he went through a certain process of exercise, that he might be the father of all them that believe. He is the father of the faithful; we are to take character from our father. It is right that I should imitate my father; no believer is exempt from this obligation, and "they that are on the principle of faith, these are Abraham's sons ... they who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham" (@Galatians 3: 7, 9). Now we read of him that he went out not knowing where he was going. He answered to God's call. But there are
{278}
many who will not move till they see the path before them. To such I would say, Without faith it is impossible to please God. Faith makes you move out. The next thing that Abraham did was to pitch his tent, having Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; for if he steps out it is in relation to God and to His house. He pitched his tent and reared his altar in connection with the house of God, and he died as he had lived. He was not ashamed of Christ, indeed he would manifest publicly his allegiance to the One who had called him out. He believed God; he was not governed by circumstances, and finally at the weaning of Isaac he was filled with exultation. Sarah says with him, "God has made me laugh" (@Genesis 21: 6). If your heart does not exult at the incoming of Christ, I do not know of another theme that will cause you divine merriment. Once Sarah had laughed in unbelief, and once she had lied, but now she laughs in faith, and says, "all that hear will laugh with me". On the day that Isaac was weaned Abraham made a great feast, for it must be great, if it has Christ in view; and typically this was Christ's day. The angel Gabriel said to Mary, "*He* shall be great" (@Luke 1: 32), and Abraham, anticipating that in faith, made a great feast, for he saw Christ's day and was glad. The Jews said to Jesus, "Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham?" (@John 8: 57). It was said in sarcasm -- that unsavoury feature of the human mind.
Scripture tells us "his visage was so marred more than any man" (@Isaiah 52: 14), the Lord must have looked older than He was, for He was a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. "Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am". We bow in holy
{279}
reverence at the inscrutability of His deity. This is not historical -- this has no reference to time -- it is the truth of His Person. How blessedly He appears before the vision of our souls! -- the *I am* -- ever existing, ever the same. Jacob has passed, Moses has passed, and Abraham has passed, but Christ remains. The *I am*, who was before Abraham! Then in the depravity of the human heart, they take up stones to stone Him, He who was in their midst, God, manifest in flesh. But there shines out a most marvellous reference to His deity, "Jesus hid himself". We cannot say anything about that; we may say much about "a man called Jesus", but if asked to describe His titles and relationships before incarnation and time, one can but bow in holy reverence, and say He is God -- eternal, inscrutable, immortal. He hid Himself. There is more behind this than a mere literal concealment. If He chooses to hide Himself, let not our poor finite minds seek to inquire of that into which He retires -- the inscrutability of Deity.
May the Lord help us by the Spirit to understand more of His greatness, for His name's sake.

EDUCATION IN VIEW OF SERVICE
J H TREVVETT
@Acts 6: 5, 8; @Acts 11: 1 - 5; @Acts 13: 6 - 12; @Romans 12: 12
I have been impressed, beloved, with the possibilities in service, for I believe the Lord is helping us distinctly and educating us in view of service.
We are told in @Numbers 4: 3, in connection with those who enter into the service, that it is a service to which one is subjected, involving suffering, labour, and warfare. Hence we are to be impressed with the character of the service into which, through grace, we are privileged to enter. It is not to be undertaken lightly; it is to be a hard and rigorous service. Not that it is without compensation, for indeed it has many compensations. Nevertheless, that is the standpoint from which the service is first viewed, and those who serve must be acquainted with suffering and labour and warfare.
The long and distinguished line of holy men and holy women who have served as set before us in the Scriptures, only serves to humble us in regard to the poverty of our own service. One cannot think of the prophets, for example, without being ashamed of one's lack of devotion. These holy men of God suffered intensely, but they continued in their service as definitely sustained by God, having accepted from the outset what the service involved.
Now, in turning to the Acts of the Apostles, I desire to draw attention to three servants -- Stephen, Peter, and Paul. Stephen is found serving in the great unbelieving
{282}
profession, and the outstanding feature with him is spirituality. Peter is serving amongst the brethren, and as serving thus, what is stressed is the great need of patience, as we see in @Acts 2. Then we come to Paul. His service is described in chapter 13, where we find him serving in a sphere of hostility to Christ, but he is marked by great boldness and moral power. It is of these three features I would speak -- spirituality, patience, and power.
Most of us are acquainted with the history of Stephen, and I refer particularly to his beginning. It is said that "they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit". Thus we are shown a vessel who was full, there was no admixture, there were no double motives with Stephen. He was a filled vessel, "full of faith and the Holy Spirit". These features marked him as amongst the saints, but we also read of Stephen's public movements in service, and then he is said to be "full of grace and power", not faith exactly, for faith is the inward thing, but "full of grace and power". These four features regarding Stephen are of great importance. He was full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and then he was full of grace and power. That is the basis from which Stephen's remarkable service flows forth. It was not, as we know, a lengthy service, but it was powerful and he served as being filled. Oh! that one might serve like that! If the servant is filled, there is no room for admixture, no room for ulterior or double motives in the service. Then it is said that being full of grace and power, Stephen did great wonders and miracles among the people. His deportment, as serving, reminds us, surely, of the grace and features of another Man, even the Lord Jesus Christ as seen in Luke's gospel.
{283}
I would plead for greater attention to this matter of spirituality in service. In Luke's gospel we are reminded of persons who were filled with the Spirit. Thus John the baptist, and Zacharias, and Elizabeth, are all said to have been filled with the Holy Spirit. Then it is said of Mary: "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee" (@Luke 1: 35), and again of Simeon that "the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ" (@Luke 2: 25, 26). Then, which is surely a very important feature, it is said of Simeon that "he came in the Spirit into the temple" (verse 27). What a trustworthy vessel is this man, one, as we may say, moving entirely under the control of the Holy Spirit.
Now these are the individuals who have to do with the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ. They are privileged to encircle and to handle, as Simeon did, "the holy thing" (@Luke 1: 35). One would speak guardedly in reference to "the holy thing" -- how much spirituality is needed to speak of that! There is Simeon in spiritual power, and as he took the Babe in his arms, he blessed God. That was an evidence of His spirituality; and after he had blessed God, he blessed Joseph and Mary. In @Luke 10 we have one who as having set herself down at Jesus¬ feet, was listening to His word. Following that we have the request on the part of one of the disciples who heard Jesus praying, "Lord, teach us to pray" (@Luke 11: 1). I mention these things, hearing and praying particularly, because of what occurs in chapter 12. It is said that the multitude was so great that they trod one on another. This marks men today in increasing measure. But the Lord began to speak to His
{284}
disciples first. He had as yet nothing to say to the crowds, but He had much to say to His disciples, and in the presence of the crowds He called them a little flock, and one outstanding feature of the *little* flock is spirituality, and this in a hostile world.
I have no doubt at all that Stephen understood these things; so that, being full of grace and power, as in the service, he is at once apprehended, as if the enemy would say, This cannot go on! He is arraigned before the council, and it is said that they saw his face "as the face of an angel". What a most delightful countenance! *They* saw it, but how must that face have appeared to heaven? At first they could not resist the wisdom and Spirit with which he spoke, but now his spirituality shines through his countenance, in the presence of those who hate him and who would finally put him to death.
Another very precious thing about Stephen is that he was not only marked by spirituality, but by a very wide knowledge of the Holy Scriptures. You remember in @Luke 12: 12 that the Lord, encouraging His disciples, tells them they were not to be careful as to what they should say when brought before the synagogues, magistrates, and powers. He says, "for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said". Now we have the thing exemplified in Stephen. He is full of grace, full of power, full of faith, full of the Holy Spirit, and he begins to speak. One has often been ashamed of one's little knowledge of Scripture, when reading this seventh chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. How few of us could give an impromptu *résumé* of the testimony, and the ways of God in it, as Stephen does here! He has no time to prepare his address,
{285}
but he is taught in the same hour. He begins by speaking about the "God of glory", and says, He appeared to our father Abraham. There are no partial thoughts or feelings with Stephen, he would claim even those men sitting in the council as of Abraham. Then he speaks about eight others who were links in the chain of testimony Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, and Solomon, showing what wonderful knowledge he had of the Holy Scriptures, how he must have read them.
How we are challenged, beloved, by our comparative ignorance of the Holy Scriptures! Here is one who can give a summary of the ways of God, beginning with the "God of glory" and coming down to the Just One, interposing this delightful remark as to Moses: "This is the Moses who said ... A prophet shall God raise up to you out of your brethren like me" (@Acts 7: 37). What kind of man was Moses? He stands unique among God's servants. He said, "My doctrine shall drop as rain, My speech flow down as dew" (@Deuteronomy 32: 2). He was a gracious minister, a faithful servant, and the Spirit of God says of him that he was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth. Do you not think that the spirit of Moses had its counterpart in the spirit of Stephen as he stood before the council? Has he hard feelings about his circumstances? Is he becoming irritated by this persecution? Not at all! He is concerned about the testimony of God to the profession. He speaks with power of the coming of the Just One, and as he mentions the Just One we find that there is a remarkable change over the council. They show their hostility. But Stephen with great courage continues his witness, for spirituality involves great moral power and
{286}
courage, and he says, "O stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, *ye* do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, *ye* also" (@Acts 7: 51). Is not that the great sin of christendom? Not only ignoring, and setting aside the Holy Spirit, speaking of Him as an influence, but, as it says here, resisting the Holy Spirit. "As your fathers, *ye* also".
Then as these men were gnashing on him with their teeth, Stephen looks up into heaven. These are not gross men, but the elite of the religious world, yet they gnashed upon him with their teeth, being cut to the heart. Has his demeanour changed? Has he lost his spirituality? Is he weakened in any degree? Listen to this: "But being full of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 7: 55). There is no diminution, no deterioration; he is still full of the Holy Spirit. Whether in persecution, or in public testimony, or as in the company of the believers, he is full. He, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven. That was a sustained look. How spasmodic is our gaze into heaven! One of the most challenging verses in the hymnbook to me is that of beloved Mr. Darby's
<blockquote>'And, filled with Thee, the constant mind <br>Eternally is blest'. (`178:3)</blockquote>
Here, we may say, is this constant mind, this steady, sustained gaze into heaven, but it is as filled with the Holy Spirit. He sees "the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God". Again he renders testimony, not as to all that he had seen, but to part of it. He does not say, 'I see the glory of God and Jesus', but "I behold ... the Son of man standing at the right hand of God" (@Acts 7: 55, 56). It
{287}
was the Son of man. How discriminative! He was a man of spiritual discernment. The Son of man, refers to the kind of testimony publicly, involving finally, the supreme authority of Christ in that day when He will cover the whole earth with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.
As Stephen was saying these things, they rushed upon him. Now mark again, beloved, this great feature of spirituality in Stephen. They "rushed upon him with one accord;" -- a serious word that -- "and having cast him out of the city, they stoned him" (@Acts 7: 57, 58). How did they stone Stephen? Calling upon God: they stoned Stephen as he was praying. Does he change his position? No. He does not alter his posture. "They stoned Stephen, praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (@Acts 7: 59).
Referring to Peter, what is emphasised is the great need of patience. It is said of Peter that as he went up to Jerusalem those who were of the circumcision contended with him. Now we have an atmosphere of contention, and contention from those who did not understand. That is a very serious thing. If I do not understand I should at least seek not to contend. There are things in the way of ministry that one has not understood at times, but I am not called upon to contend in regard of that which I do not understand. Against what were these men contending? Consciously or unconsciously, it was against the operations of God, and of the Holy Spirit. Think of that! They contended with Peter. Does he assert his apostleship? Does he say the thing is so plain and apparent that I do not need to give an account of it? Not at all. The scripture says, "But Peter began and set forth the matter to them in
{288}
order". These contenders are to be met by patience. It is a serious thing, if I do not understand, to contend about a thing. It is better to be like Jacob in @Genesis 37: 11, when Joseph told his second dream to his brethren. They envied him, they did not understand that kind of ministry it was something entirely new, and they envied him; "but his father kept the saying", he did not contend. That is wisdom. If something is suggested in ministry, which is the result of the operations of God and of the Holy Spirit, as described in @1 Corinthians 12, should I not be well advised to keep the saying, not to contend about it?
Think of the kind of man that Peter was naturally. He had been an impulsive, forceful man; he had cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. As they came to Capernaum on one occasion, men came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?" And he said "Yes" (@Matthew 17: 24). Why should he reply for Jesus? Why not wait to ask his Lord about the tribute money? But the Lord, in His tender, ever patient, grace, anticipates Simon and says, "the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers?" (verse 25). But, He says, "that we may not be an offence" (verse 27) -- that is the principle that Peter must learn. We are not to offend.
Peter in this chapter is marked by great patience; a quality totally foreign to him on the line of nature; but having acquired great spirituality and patience, he "set forth the matter to them in order" -- not always an easy thing to do. The tendency is ever present with us to exhibit the irritability of the flesh in such matters, for impatience marks us naturally: instead of which the Lord would have
{289}
us in patience and grace to rehearse what we have known to be the operations of God through the Spirit. So, as Peter rehearses the matter and speaks of the Holy Spirit falling on them, he adds, "Who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God?" (@Acts 11: 17). The first impression that Peter would give to these contenders was just this, "I was in the city of Joppa praying". Think of ministry coming like that! His patience flowed from that same dependence upon God. Many things are given to us, committed to us on this line of praying. If we fail to understand the sayings, shall we not keep them? They would lose nothing by keeping, and they may gain much. It is said of Mary in @Luke 2: 19 that she "kept all these things in her mind, pondering them in her heart". I commend to the young the importance of storing the mind with these precious divine things. You may say, I do not understand them; or, as some have said, Why does not the ministry come down to our level? But of what value would it be? Ministry is intended to allure us, to help us on, to encourage us to reach 'higher and higher yet', as we sometimes sing -- until we reach the precious truth described in the epistle to the Ephesians.
Peter says, "I was in the city of Joppa praying", not preaching, nor being entertained by Simon the tanner; but the first thing in his mind was that he was in the city of Joppa praying, and he became "in an ecstasy". Our service as amongst the brethren, and even those that may contend because they fail to understand what is said, needs to be marked by this precious feature of patience. Peter stresses it; he says, "in your faith have also virtue ... in temperance endurance" (@2 Peter 1: 5, 6). He encourages the saints to be patient in relation to all that they are passing through.
{290}
Again, Scripture reminds us of the long patience of the labourer: he has long patience; he waits for the early and the latter rain.
Peter was able in moral power to silence the contenders; and we should be ready to serve like that. Much has come before us of late that is of inestimable value, and the ministry has given us a fresh and spiritually enhanced view of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if it is not understood, shall I contend? If there are contenders, we have need of patience, yet in that patience surrendering nothing that has come to us by reason of the operations of God, and the operations of the Holy Spirit. He operates in those that teach and in those that minister, and we must see to it that we take heed to these things.
I now refer briefly to Paul, who was serving, as I have said, in a scene of hostility. He was serving in the glad tidings, and the scripture says that at Salamis "they announced the word of God", but there is no record of any results. Now, I believe the patience of Peter finds expression in Paul, in relation to this service amongst men. It says, "Having passed through the whole island", the whole of it, as if to say they were combing it out. And when they came to Paphos, there was there an intelligent man, Sergius Paulus. The Spirit of God designates him thus -- an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God. Would that there were more like that today! Paul is in the public sphere; he is serving men along with Barnabas, and as he seeks to serve, the enemy becomes increasingly active. I believe we are surrounded by this kind of thing today. There was a man named Bar-jesus; what a fine name that
{291}
seemed! How many of the simple and unsuspecting ones have been deceived by names like that -- Bar-jesus -- son of Jesus. He is with the deputy -- an influential man. The Spirit of God unmasks him, calling him "Elymas the magician", saying, "(for so his name is by interpretation)". He withstood Barnabas and Saul, "seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith", not now contending about certain things, but here as a direct and definite opposer of the truth, and opposed to the gospel preachers. How is that kind of thing to be met?
We meet this kind of person time after time in our course through this world. There are the magicians, there are the spiritualists, the scientists who label themselves christian; there are the millennial dawnists. How are we to meet these deceivers? How did Paul meet them? Would Gamaliel have helped him here? Anything he had learned at the feet of Gamaliel would be useless in such a crisis as this. Paul did not attempt to meet him as come from a school of modernism, or from a theological institute, or from the universities of the world, he came from Antioch, where they were ministering to the Lord and fasting. In that spiritual atmosphere, charged with piety and dependence, the Holy Spirit had said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". Then it is said that the brethren "fasted and prayed" (@Acts 13: 2, 3), not that they prayed and fasted, but "fasted and prayed". The brethren would be careful to fast *before* they prayed, so that they might ask right things in relation to this unique, this hitherto unknown service upon which Barnabas and Saul were now to embark.
{292}
"Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go". They did not say, When these men are gone there will be more room for us. I have not the slightest doubt that in their hearts they were sorry to lose these valued servants, but they let them go. They bowed to the sovereignty of a divine Person in His choice, and laid their hands on them and let them go. That is where Saul and Barnabas had come from, and so as this position arises, the Spirit of God, speaking of Saul, says, "But Saul, who also is Paul", Paul the *little*; see what strength he has, what moral power he has acquired! "Filled with the Holy Spirit ... said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of the devil". He names this magician according to his right designation. He did not root him up. He left him as he said, "Thou shalt be blind ... for a season". Such was Paul's power, and I believe we may have something akin to that in these last and difficult days. We may ask what was the secret of this great power, wielded by the apostle? The secret of it was prayer. He began with it. "Behold, he is praying" (@Acts 9: 11), is what was said to Ananias, and he finished up with praying; for in 2 Timothy he reminds Timothy that he prayed night and day, having in the meantime exhorted the Thessalonian saints to pray without ceasing. Do we pray night and day? Paul says, "unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day" (@2 Timothy 1: 3). That was the kind of servant Paul was. His power in a hostile scene came that way; he was a man of prayer.
I would remind you in closing of that remarkable expression in @Romans 12: 12 -- "As regards hope, rejoicing". That was seen in Stephen; he was rejoicing in
{293}
hope. He was soon to be actually taken up, for he could say, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit". What kind of spirit was that? A spirit ready to be transported. Are our spirits like that? We must often feel how much mellowing is needed to take place in our spirits. But Stephen says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit". He was rejoicing in hope, and that in regard of "the glory of God" (@Romans 5: 2).
Then we have "as regards tribulations, enduring". A remarkable and much needed word in these last days, when the pressure falls heavily on the saints, as upon men in general. No doubt this is governmental amongst men. But we need patience in serving amongst the brethren. Then finally there is to be perseverance in prayer, so that our service publicly amongst men might be marked by moral courage and power, so that we might rebuke what is unholy and not of God.
We need skill to watch over and guard carefully the work of God, however faintly it may appear; for we are reminded in the two persons, Sergius Paulus and Elymas the magician, of two results from the preaching: the one a savour of life unto life, and the other a savour of death unto death. Sergius Paulus was as a plant which the Father had planted; an intelligent man, desiring to hear the word of God. As he saw the effect of Paul's power and teaching, he believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord. But alongside of this delicate plant, there is this noxious weed, this deadly poison, and how much skill is needed so that we should secure the good and discover the work of God in souls.
May the Lord help us in these three things, so that we shall be found in our service, "As regards hope, rejoicing:
{294}
as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering".

@Isaiah 6: 1, 5; @Jeremiah 1: 4 - 9; @Ezekiel 1: 1; @Ezekiel 3: 1 - 3, 8, 9, 12, 13
One of the least read portions of Holy Scripture is, I suppose, the section devoted to the prophets, not only the major but the minor prophets. We are counselled by James in his epistle to consider the prophets. He says we are to take the prophets as an example of suffering and patience. Evidently James believed, as we must all believe, that the lesson and example of the prophets would stand us in good stead in face of any complaining one against another. "Take as an example, brethren, of suffering and having patience, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord" (@James 5: 10). No one could read the prophets, from the beginning of the book of Isaiah to the close of the book of Malachi, without feeling that these two features of suffering and having patience shine out in them.
Now no one can suffer for the truth or be marked by patience in relation to its moral issues, unless they have a right objective. Each of the prophets had a distinctive viewpoint of divine things as well as of divine Persons. Isaiah treats of the King; a theme which ought to move every heart that loves Jesus. Jeremiah treats of the interrupted relationships between Jehovah and Israel; speaking with feelings of great sorrow, and using that divinely given outlet for sorrow -- his tears. He feels with God about the sorrows concerning Israel as only a man of
{296}
God can feel, and as only a son formed in love can feel. Ezekiel is a son of light, and he reminds us at the very beginning of his prophecy that he saw visions of God. He is a first-hand witness of certain positive things which he has seen. Woe to the professed leaders of Israel, and to the elders, who, going on with a merely heartless profession of believing in Jehovah, failed to hear the words of Ezekiel, for the man enhanced what he said by the spirit in which he said it. He was a son of light.
Isaiah, I suggest, was a son of the kingdom, and what marks a son of the kingdom is that he has seen the King. No one can be rightly described as a son of the kingdom if he has not seen the King: "mine eyes have seen the King". You may, like Isaiah, be able to give a correct outline of what is under the eye of God. For his prophecy opens with a stern denunciation of Israel, a sinful nation, laden with iniquity, full of wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, "from the sole of the foot even unto the head" (@Isaiah 1: 6). He indicted them in the strongest possible manner, but he was speaking generally. In @Isaiah 6 the prophet speaks specifically, not primarily of the nation, but of himself; and each one who comes to a right judgment of himself will acquire light as to the Person of Christ. Isaiah had had much to say about the nation, he had indicted them and proved their guilt; but there was something that he himself had yet to learn, and he learnt it in the year that king Uzziah died.
Most of us are aware of the history of king Uzziah, one of the most energetic and attractive of all the kings that reigned over Judah or Israel. He began to reign at the age of sixteen years, and he reigned fifty-two years, and
{297}
the scripture says he was marvellously helped whilst he pursued a certain course; a course which related to the days of Zechariah the prophet, who had visions of God. As long as Uzziah came under the prophetic influence he was safe. "He was marvellously helped, till he became strong. But when he became strong his heart was lifted up to his downfall" (@2 Chronicles 26: 15, 16). There is nothing so serious as for a believer to move out of his divinely appointed orbit. Uzziah was helped marvellously till he was strong. As long as he remained in his divinely appointed orbit, he was helped, but the moment he coveted the gift of another and would usurp the office and function of a priest, God was at issue with him, and eighty-one priests withstood him.
Men would say he was outnumbered; but it was not a question of numbers but of spirituality, and that is what we should be concerned about. The body of spirituality was with the priests. Eighty-one of them withstood him as he left his divinely given place and sought to function as a priest. The Spirit of God says they were valiant men. We must never, in these spiritual crises, judge by the human mind. It is not a question of the number of the priests, but rather of those who are with God -- the priests were with God. They ordered Uzziah out of the sanctuary; no mean thing, that, for he had been a great king, a husbandman, a builder, and a man of war -- indeed, there were many features about Uzziah that must have endeared him to his subjects. I ought to know from the Lord Himself what is my own divinely appointed orbit and keep within it, so that this self-assertion has no place in my heart or mind, and I do not covet the office or service or gift of another.
{298}
Isaiah says it was "In the year of the death of king Uzziah", that he saw the Lord. His death synchronises with Isaiah seeing the Lord "high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple". I wonder if everyone here has seen the Lord like that. The correct title here is 'Adonai', which is said to convey the thought of 'lordship in blessing'. Isaiah saw the Lord high and lifted up, not terrorising him, but impelling and attracting him. He was attracted and allured to the spot where he saw the Lord thus "high and lifted up". As he saw that sight he saw also the seraphim. Each of them had six wings, "with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he flew". Then he goes on to say, "one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts". That is the holy mutuality that marks the house of God. It is like the law of the house, most holy.
This is the conversation that takes place between holy persons; the kind of conversation which, I believe, would take place at Colosse or at Philippi, where the minds of the brethren were to be centred and fixed on things lovely, and pure, and honest, and of good report. Alas, how often we feed on things that are of evil report! "Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" What an outlook there, instead of speaking now of the sorrowful evidences of the state of God's earthly people as the prophet had had to do, we have the speaking of the seraphim, and they say "the whole earth is full of his glory". That is the outlook of a son of the kingdom. Peter was a son of the kingdom. He says nothing about the rapture, but he dwells much upon the appearing, and the glory that is about to be revealed. Who could make Peter
{299}
downcast, or discouraged? He had the most blessed outlook upon the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, when the whole earth will be "filled with his glory".
Isaiah said, "Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips". Have we all come to that? James reminds us of the deadly power of the tongue. He speaks of what we *see* in chapter 1, of what we *do* in chapter 2, and of what we *say* in chapter 3. He describes the tongue in the most trenchant way: "the tongue can no one among men tame; it is an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison" (@James 3: 8). It is a little member, and yet the most potent weapon for good or for evil. Do I bless the Father with my tongue? How do I use it? Isaiah says, "I am a man of unclean lips". He is not now denouncing the nation, he is speaking of himself. Believers should have an understanding of @Romans 6 and 7. No one is really happy until they have been through that experience. This painful experience has cost some of us more tears during the years we were passing through it than all the rest of our lives. It is an experience that cannot be obtained by reading Scripture. Do not misunderstand me, I value Scripture, but this experience one must go through between oneself and God alone. Then we are at liberty. So in @Romans 8: 1 you have one in liberty, bursting forth with a note of exultation, "There is then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus", then he speaks of being made free from the law of sin and of death. Oh, to see greater liberty amongst the people of God!
Isaiah says, "I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips". He is like Peter in @Luke 5: 8, when he says, "Depart from me, for I am a
{300}
sinful man" -- and yet Peter stays. Have we known that experience? The repulsiveness of sin in ourselves; coming to the point that we are full of it, saying, depart from me, and yet remaining in the Lord's presence; finding we were held to Himself by an indissoluble link of affection. Isaiah stayed; and he heard the Lord asking, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" (verse 8), and he adds, "Here am I; send me". The footnote says the emphasis is on the word send. A son of the kingdom has lost all sense of 'me', or 'I'. He is content now to be sent. This service of bringing in the King is of the greatest importance, and Isaiah was concerned about it; and so he gets wonderful enlargement. In chapter 7: 14 he gets light about the birth of Christ -- "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel". He begins with that: a most precious glory of Christ. Obedience to Christ as Lord will settle every difficulty in our minds as to the Person of Christ. Then he goes further, for in chapter 9: 6 he dwells upon a most profound thing, he says, "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace". See how this son of the kingdom is growing in his apprehension of Christ! He knows no limit; his eyes are fixed on Christ, his spirit subject to His blessed authority, and as he gets further light as to this blessed Person, nothing less than the whole earth for Christ will do for Isaiah.
In chapter 11: 6 he speaks of the world to come, and tells us that "the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb". Are we to wait for the millennium to see that? Is it not possible
{301}
that spiritually that feature should be seen in every local company? Let us, like Isaiah, have a blessed outlook upon the glories of Christ, and we shall see that already the wolf and the lamb can dwell together. Even that is not enough for this son of the kingdom, for he would have the whole earth filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea. Again in chapter 35: 6 he speaks about the healing power and the blessedness of Christ as filling the millennial earth; he says, "then shall the lame man leap as a hart". Have we not seen it? Not only in @Acts 3, but in our own day? A man coming in having the legs of the lame which are not equal, but as brought under the authority of Christ he can not only walk, but has power to leap upon the earth! Thank God for that.
Isaiah dwells on these things, and he goes forward until finally he claims the whole gentile earth for this blessed Person. There is no prophet that has such a wide outlook as this son of the kingdom, Isaiah, and he suffered in view of the prophetic word, as we are reminded in chapter 20: 2, 3. He was a man of strong affections, a married man with two remarkable sons. It ought to be a matter of concern with all who have gift, and some commission and service from the Lord, that their household should be in entire support. Isaiah's household must have been one such. He calls his wife a prophetess, not that she had an official title, but because she was in full sympathy with his service. Then he had two sons, and they were remarkable lads; wherever they went they were signs to God's earthly people, they not only had distinctive names, but they had names which conveyed something, Maher-shalal-hash-baz and Shear-jashub. As people saw
{302}
these lads of Isaiah's, they would remember that the remnant was to return, and that God was speaking through these two. You have thus a complete household supporting the prophetic testimony in view of the coming in of the King.
With Jeremiah it is different. He was a single man, he was to have neither wife nor children, (chapter 16), and yet he was a most loveable man. I question if there was any man in the Old Testament with such deep feelings as Jeremiah, he had most sensitive feelings, and I am going to speak of Jeremiah as a son in love. Jeremiah was loved before he was born. That is a very striking word, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations". A marvellous thing! Who knows what is in store for our children? Who could tell, as Jeremiah was born, what God had in mind for that child? "Before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee". What a vessel would he be! What filial fear would mark him, what subjection of heart and mind! He was nurtured and nourished in love, a son in love; and he begins to speak in answer to the commandment of Jehovah, and says, "Alas, Lord Jehovah! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child". What a comely thing for a young man to say! I would encourage the young to serve and say, "I am a child". God will fill your mouth with words, as He did for Jeremiah. Jeremiah was not like Moses. Scripture records that he made excuse after excuse, until finally Jehovah was angry with him and said, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well" (@Exodus 4: 14). It is not a question of your ability to
{303}
speak, but rather of dependence, so that God may be with you and He will touch your mouth, as He touched Jeremiah's mouth.
When Jeremiah began to speak, he spoke about love, for he was a son in love, not the kind of love that would gloss over matters of unrighteousness. Divine love is never active at the expense of righteousness; it cannot be, for it would not be of God. Jeremiah at once speaks about love. He says, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals" (chapter 2: 2). If you speak in love you may have to suffer. Jeremiah is one of the great sufferers of the Old Testament, he is like Paul in relation to suffering, persecuted, vilified and misrepresented. What suffering and insult he had to bear! He was accounted worthy to die, to be smitten, insulted and ill-treated, and yet a man with the most refined sensibilities and spiritual feelings.
We talk lightly about the weeping prophet, but he was a man of intense spiritual feeling, and he was with God. He bursts forth again in chapter 9: 1, "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eye a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night!" How little we shed tears in relation to the sorrows of the church. It was said of Joseph that when he saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, that he sought a place where he might weep. We speak of a drawing room, or dining room, perhaps, but do our houses contain a chamber where we may weep? Every lover of Christ ought to have a chamber where he or she might weep. Jeremiah desired to weep "day and night" (@Jeremiah 9: 1). When God told him to weep, (chapter 14: 17), he was to weep "night and day", not day and night, and when Paul
{304}
wept at Ephesus, he wept night and day, for a church weeper weeps in view of the morning. He does not pass out, as Jeremiah did in the ways of God, weeping -- for "at morn there is rejoicing" (@Psalm 30: 5).
I believe there were two answers, in the goodness of God to Jeremiah's weeping. One was Ezekiel and the other was Nehemiah. These two taken together show us the issue of Jeremiah's weeping. You may be sure that tears like that are put into God's bottle, and Ezekiel comes to light as an answer from God, and he sees visions of God. Nehemiah comes to light as an answer to Jeremiah's tears, and the very gates and walls that Jeremiah had sorrowed over, and wept over, were rebuilt by Nehemiah. If there are any weeping over church sorrows, I would commend to you the example and tears of Jeremiah. Be with God in your exercises and they cannot but be fruitful sooner or later.
Now Ezekiel is a son of light. Ezekiel saw visions of God, and he was familiar with the divine glory. I do not want to lessen the blessedness of that, or minimise the importance of it. Ezekiel stands out in the Old Testament as a man who familiarised himself with the glory, and believers like that are few. He saw visions of God, he saw the Man in the glowing brass, and he watched the glory. He could tell you its exact whereabouts at any time, he knew just where the glory was, and he could tell you what few believers could tell you -- when and how it would return, and the basis upon which it would return, and what would characterise it when it returned. One of the most interesting features about the book of Ezekiel is this dwelling upon the glory. Ezekiel was familiar with it. I
{305}
commend that to you. He was not only concerned about it, but consciously in the enjoyment of it; and so, as a son of light, he felt whatever savoured of darkness.
Another thing that marks this son of light is that he has amazing courage in relation to the truth. He is undaunted, he has a forehead harder than flint, and he cannot be moved, yet his heart is tender; he is loveable and is marked by the deepest and most intense feelings. Ezekiel becomes a widower. It is remarkable what is said of these men -- one a family man, one without human ties, and one a widower. Ezekiel dearly loved his wife. Scripture speaks about her as the desire of his eyes. God says, "Behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down" (@Ezekiel 24: 16). The prophetic testimony must not cease, there must be no surrender of the service on account of sorrow; the volume and power of the prophetic testimony must continue, therefore Ezekiel was not to weep. If ever Ezekiel was proved to be a man of God it was when he lost his wife. That is one of the most touching incidents in Scripture, that a man of such fine sensitive feelings, who loved his wife, the desire of his eyes, was not allowed to weep, as bereft. Oh, to be in the service of God with feelings and affections like that! -- showing that what is spiritual rises far above what is of nature, even though it be the sweetest divinely given relationship in nature.
Another feature about Ezekiel is his absolutely unswerving obedience to God. It is a rebuke to one. If he is told to take a barber's knife and shave his beard, and his head, he does it; not a complaint, nor a word about the
{306}
hardness of his path, he does it. If told to take a tile and portray the siege of Jerusalem upon it, he does so; and if he is told to take a captive's baggage and pass out in the most abject humiliation, (@Ezekiel 12: 3), he does it. If he is told to lie three hundred and ninety days on his left side, he does it. How we might have complained to God in suffering thus for the iniquity of Israel! And then to be forty days on his right side, as it is said, "when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year" (@Ezekiel 4: 6). He was suffering in his spirit with God about the iniquity of Israel and Judah. One could enumerate the instances of Ezekiel's obedience and how he suffered. Not only did he speak to the elders in counsel, warning them as to the voice of Jehovah, but finally he brings into view a world where Christ shall be supreme, and the temple, of which he says the law of it is most holy. One thing I learn from Ezekiel is that in the house of God I cannot do what I like; there must be no assertion of my will. Ezekiel speaks about the house, and the law of it, it is most holy. When he has dwelt upon the specifications and the measurements, and the outgoings and the ingoings of the tribes of Israel, he tells you the name of the city, and says from that day the name of the city is Jehovah Shammah, Jehovah is there (@Ezekiel 48: 35). This is what a son of light looks for.
I desire that we might be more in the gain of the kingdom, that we should become sons of it, not merely subjects of the kingdom, but sons. Then sons in love, as those who feel with God about the state of the church. And that we should be sons of light, holding the truth inviolate
{307}
as having foreheads as adamant, harder than flint, and if it be a question of a suffering people, that we may suffer and sympathise as Ezekiel did, for he dwelt among the captives. May the Lord help us in these things!

SPIRITUAL INFLUENCE
J H TREVVETT
@Exodus 4: 2 - 4, 20; @Luke 1: 32, 33; @Revelation 11: 1
I have in mind to say a word about influence, with special reference to spiritual influence amongst the people of God. We are told that none of us lives to himself, hence the consideration of this question brings home a definite challenge to each of our hearts, as to what kind of influence we wield. The thought of influence is brought before us early in the Scriptures, and I am referring now to material influences. We are told in @Genesis 1: 16 that God "made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night, -- and the stars", indicating doubtless that the earth was to be definitely influenced from heaven. So in @Psalm 136: 8, 9 we have the appreciation on the part of God's earthly people of these two great influences; for the psalmist says, "The sun for rule over the day, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever. The moon and stars for rule over the night, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever" -- as if it were in the mind of God that men were to be responsive, as affected by these heavenly influences over the earth, and to answer in chorus, "His loving-kindness endureth for ever".
God did not confine Himself to material influences, for after He had made man, He gave him dominion -- or made him to rule -- "over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth" (@Genesis 1: 28), indicating that there should not
{310}
only be authority, but an influencing of the whole creation, through this man whom God had made. As we are all aware, Adam failed in this responsibility, and primarily because he came under an influence other than the divine influence. Every failure among us has its roots in this, that we have come under another influence and that, one which is not of God. Adam was intelligent, he was the handiwork of God; he had marvellous dignity, and wisdom, and resource enough to name intelligently all the beasts of the field, and the fowl of the air. Think what a marvellous creation Adam was! -- having ability to thus name the cattle and beasts and the fowl of the air, as Jehovah Elohim brought them to him! He had no recourse to a dictionary, or to other sources of information, but he named them with marvellous intelligence and wisdom, as having come from the very beginning under this beneficent divine influence.
Later Adam failed, for he came under another influence, that of his wife. What an influence that may be either for good or evil! Scripture says, "a prudent wife is from Jehovah" (@Proverbs 19: 14). One thinks of the wife of Manoah; what an advance she was on Eve! Eve held conversation with the serpent, losing the light and practical gain of the influence of headship, whereas the wife of Manoah would not converse even with an angel of God apart from her husband. She ran and told her husband, (@Judges 13: 10). What a delightful expression that is in contrast to what is current today. Then they prayed that the angel might come again a second time, and the word says, "And the Angel of God came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field" (verse 9). I wonder how many sisters find
{311}
time to sit in the field today. This woman is not so obsessed with the constancy and monotony of her work that she cannot meditate; neither is she occupied with what is transpiring in the world; she finds time to sit in the field to meditate. I believe that if sisters gave themselves more frequently to meditation, the local meetings would greatly profit. Even when the angel came the second time, Manoah's wife did not speak to him; she was in the recognition of headship. What an advance on Eve! She hasted and told her husband, and he did the speaking.
The book of Judges corresponds to our own day, and I refer to that in passing, to show the kind of influence the wife of Manoah recognised, and what an asset she was to her husband. She says later, "If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands" (@Judges 13: 23). Is that the line of exercise with our sisters? -- occupation with Christ as the burnt-offering and the meat-offering, so that they are rendered pliable, and readily come under the influence of headship according to God. Well Eve failed, and Adam failed, but if so, we find that God raised up men of great spiritual influence later.
Think of Abraham! He says of himself, "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you" (@Genesis 23: 4) -- he is marked by the feelings that become a stranger and a sojourner but the sons of Heth say, "Thou art a prince of God among us" (verse 6). He was no niggardly person; he has great wealth; silver and gold and much cattle. I question if there was any man in Abraham's time so rich as he. But of what value were his riches unless they were held in the joy of stewardship? Isaac, too, was very rich, it says "the man
{312}
became great, and he became continually greater, until he was very great" (@Genesis 26: 13). What was his spirit? It was heavenly: if his opposers come to him he makes them a feast, that is how he spends his wealth. He is not establishing his own position or furthering his own social status, but acting like God, diffusing a heavenly influence. So with Abraham -- he influences a king and a captain. They came to Abraham, but he reproves them because of a well of water Abimelech's servants had violently taken away; and then the king sees seven ewe lambs set by themselves, and he inquires as to what they were. They set forth the kind of influence Abraham would exert. He would say virtually to Abimelech, If your servants are on the line of violence, this is my attitude towards you, this is the kind of spirit in which I would be with you. Seven ewe lambs -- creatures utterly defenceless, but suggesting ripeness and fruitfulness -- that was the spirit of Abraham. They would be a constant reminder that in the presence of violence, Abraham's spirit and influence would dominate the situation in grace.
So one loves to think of @Psalm 8: 6, for if Adam failed, God had before Him One who never failed, and the psalmist says, "Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands". There is not one of us but who would accept that in theory, but I am going to plead that we accept it in practice that *He* is to be great among us. He is to be the pre-eminent One, and that He should have the rule over each one of us. What marvellous spiritual influence would emanate from us if we were in the good of this in our daily pathways. We may object to certain leaders, and resent their rule; but who could object to being under the rule of
{313}
the Lord Jesus Christ? As the Spirit of God says in @Luke 1: 32, "*He* shall be great" -- before ever He was born, before ever He was called the Son of God in incarnation, the angel could say "*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest". I know we sing about it, and speak of it, and pray about it. Thank God for all these movements; and that we have the world to come before us as a subject of conversation, involving the day when His greatness shall be manifested publicly. The day when He shall reign "from the river unto the ends of the earth" (@Psalm 72: 8) -- there is not one amongst us but exults in that blessed prospect! What sweet influences will radiate throughout the whole earth in that day when the word in @Luke 1 is literally fulfilled: "*He* shall be great;" but may the Lord give us grace to make it true now, as we come under His rule.
I want to raise a question in all simplicity and transparency: what kind of influence are we each one wielding in public, and locally, and in the house? It is a most important question. So I want to speak of Moses and John, two great leaders among the people of God, who suggest the line of spiritual influence. I would ask you, as God asked Moses: "What is that in thy hand?" That is what matters for the moment. I am not speaking of what is in your heart, God knows what is in your heart, and we all desire to be true in heart -- but has the testimony been obscured by what is in your *hand*? Jehovah says to Moses, "What is that in thy hand? And he said, A staff". A staff means that either consciously, or unconsciously, I wield a certain influence over those with whom I am in contact. Jehovah says, "Cast it on the ground", and Moses is obedient. I desire that we may all be attentive and follow
{314}
prayerfully this word to Moses. As he cast his staff on the ground it became a serpent, and Moses fled before it. What a revelation to Moses! He had to learn the solemn result of what authority had become in man's hand, as surrendered to Satan, that such was the influence it would yield. Moses has to learn the necessity of divine control of himself. A most important lesson, if he is to influence the people for God. He had already learned one lesson, thank God! -- that "our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12: 29). But He does not consume the brethren; He says as it were to Moses, I am going on with this people marked with frailty. There is that in them which is delightful to My heart. Moses would say at the end of this lesson, I am going on with them, too. Do we all desire to serve the people of God? What kind of influence do we wield over them? What have we wielded hitherto, and what shall we wield henceforth? Moses fled from before the serpent; it was all he could do under the circumstances. I believe that the Lord would expose to our hearts, if we desire it, the influences which are otherwise than heavenly -- He would show us their true character. Then Jehovah says, "Take it by the tail". Think of the scene into which the Lord Jesus came -- a scene dominated by the power of Satan, who had wielded influence over the sons of men for four thousand years, so to speak. But as the Lord comes into the scene, He takes complete control of authority according to God. Delivering men from Satan's power, He brings them under authority for blessing. "He taught them as having authority" (@Mark 1: 22). Moses takes the serpent by the tail and it becomes a staff again. It is not now Moses¬ staff, but the staff of God! That is a wonderful staff! If I wield it, it means that I do not lord it
{315}
over God's heritage, I look upon the saints with all sympathy and compassion. Paul says to the Corinthians, "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and in a spirit of meekness?" (@1 Corinthians 4: 21). Thank God he did not come with a rod, he went in love and in the spirit of meekness, for he says in @2 Corinthians 10: 1, "But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ". That is not using the Scriptures against them, but bringing to bear upon a well-nigh impossible situation the meekness and gentleness of the Christ; for he had both these features. And so, here, Moses went with the staff of God in his hand, and think of the influence he wielded in Israel with that staff! In @Exodus 17: 9 he says to Joshua, "Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand". If the saints are harassed by Amalek, I will go to the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand. Do we pray for the saints like this? Without complaint or murmuring? I believe our prayers would be heard if we prayed in this wise. Moses went up with the staff of God in his hand, and with love in his heart for God's earthly people, thus he became king in Jeshurun. These are the features that belong to spiritual influence.
It says of the Lord in @Luke 1: 32, "*He* shall be great". The emphasis is on the word "He". So that however much failure there might have been in others, there is the unfolding before the eyes of our hearts of this One who *is* great, and who shall rule over the house of Jacob for ever and ever. Think of what He effected for God! Men wondered at the words of grace that were coming out of His mouth in the synagogue of Nazareth. Did He not know
{316}
that if He referred to God's sovereignty, rebellion would come out of their hearts? He knew the end from the beginning, but nevertheless He went on, shedding abroad the sweet and holy influences of heaven. He had in His hand, as we may say, the staff of God -- what an influence! Even in the house of Simon the Pharisee, what an influence He had! Did He not know what kind of a woman was there? Did He not know what was in the heart of Simon -- that cold Pharisaical influence that would wither up every movement Godward? But He went on shedding abroad the influence of heaven, and He became exceeding great in the eyes of His disciples; the great anti-type of the one in @Genesis 26: 13, who became continually greater, until he was very great.
The first book of Samuel is written in order that we should have before us the kind of influence that is pleasurable to heaven. It is said of Saul about seven times in 1 Samuel, that he had his spear with him. It says in @1 Samuel 19: 9 that "he sat in his house with his spear in his hand". If he lay down to sleep, it was with his spear by his side. What kind of an influence had such a man? Think of going to a brother's house to find he has his spear in his hand! What is he going to do with it? Slay his brother? Saul was going to slay David. But what does David do? He has the spirit that marked Abraham when he set the seven ewe lambs by themselves. David had resources in God -- he played with his hand. Then it says later, when Saul tried to smite David to the wall with his spear that David played with his hand as at other times. There is the excess of grace! It was not that he did it once or twice, or even three times, but it was his constant
{317}
occupation; he played with his hand. He brought in the influence of heaven, like the staff of God, and he brought such heavenly influences to bear upon Saul that the evil spirit departed from him, but finally we read of Saul falling upon his sword and dying by it (@1 Samuel 31: 4). What trust he had placed in it! Carried by his side, wielded by his hand, stuck into the ground at his bolster when he slept -- trusting in the arm of flesh. Are we, as David did, playing with our hands when persecuted and under reproach? We are made to suffer if we continue with the harp, but the man that wields the sword falls on it; and the man that plays with the harp becomes the "sweet psalmist of Israel" (@2 Samuel 23: 1), and he sets all Israel singing. That is what we need, the kind of influence that will set the people of God free from every personal feeling, and from every kind of bondage, whether social, political, or religious -- setting them free for the service of song in the house of the Lord.
I refer to John, for he is the great leader in love, for the saints of God. He does not lead exactly in authority like Moses, but in love. It is not what John says that impresses us so much, as what he is and what he does; it is the great volume of love that he expresses for the people of God. He says to the young men, "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong ... Love not the world, nor the things in the world" (@1 John 2: 14, 15). The great snare for young men is the world -- it has an unholy glamour and influence that is satanic. John would preserve you from that, young man! He did not read the newspaper to have the world exposed; he did not get his knowledge of its character from outside sources, he got it from his
{318}
knowledge of divine Persons. All that is in the world -- "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life" (verse 16) -- are what hold men in bondage. He comes nearer home still in writing to an assembly, and he speaks of the kind of spirit that may come into a local meeting; he says in @3 John 9, "I wrote something to the assembly". We do not know what he wrote, for Diotrephes kept it back. Think of the gravity and solemnity of such an action. One brother does not compose the assembly, or one sister -- but "Diotrephes, who loves to have the first place among them, receives us not". "The first place" -- is that the source of the trouble?
The only subject upon which the disciples strove together as far as is recorded was as to which of them should be greatest. It is at the root of many a division. The Lord said, "Of what were ye reasoning by the way?" (@Mark 9: 33). John was silent, James was silent, Peter, too, was silent, they were utterly ashamed of themselves, as well they might be -- as well we might be in like case. And the Lord calls a little child and sets it in the midst, according to Matthew and Mark, and Mark gives an additional touch: he says Jesus took the child in His arms -- that is the kind of spirit and influence that is pleasing to divine Persons. "Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receives me" (@Mark 9: 37). In Luke He does differently; it says, He "set it by him" (@Luke 9: 47). That is the answer to every human ambition; it is the answer to any striving to be the greatest, and is to show the correspondence between the Spirit of Jesus and that little child. John told the Lord they had seen someone casting out demons in His name, and that they had forbidden him.
{319}
All that the Lord did, was to place a little child by Him -- He did not ask a single question, but the word says, "And John answering said" -- he understood the challenge. How this searches our hearts as to whether we are on the line of being the greatest, or on the line of being as a "little child". John's answer was as if he would say, Lord, I will tell you what *we* did, proving how unlike the little child we have been.
Dear brethren, let us not keep anything back from the Lord. If He wounds, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are profuse" (@Proverbs 27: 6). John never forgot his lesson. How did he know how to deal with Diotrephes? He got his power through intimacy with Christ -- through leaning on the breast of Jesus. Not one of us is immune from this snare, this love of the first place. A sister likes to be first in hospitality, or a brother in the meeting, he wants to lead, or to minister. Are we going to lead in suffering and love, or are we going to lead in giving information or even light, merely? John learned how to influence from lying in the bosom of Jesus, and he says of Diotrephes, "If I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words" (@3 John: 10). Think of speaking against John, or against any leader who is marked by the Spirit of Christ! You may say it is unthinkable, but it is not, for we have seen and heard this many a time in our own short histories; and John says, "I will bring to remembrance". He expects that there will be sufficient power in Gaius and others in that locality to deal with that difficult situation.
{320}
In @Revelation 11: 1 we find that John is given a reed like a staff to measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it. Think of the mighty influence wielded by the apostle John: what a heart he had! What a vast amount of love for the saints! Truly a leader in love! Think again of Paul: "Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (@2 Corinthians 12: 15). Think, too, of Peter: he speaks of himself as their "fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ", and then says, "shepherd the flock of God which is among you" (@1 Peter 5: 1, 2). He exhorts the elders not to be as "lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock". Thus we may hear the voices of Peter, John, and Paul. The weakest brother and the weakest sister are part of the assembly, and though they may appear to us to be the least intelligent, yet they have a judgment of things according to God. Paul says you cannot despise them. We are to be clothed with humility, so that our influence may be such that God may give us grace in relation to one another.
Now the reed is like a staff or rod. If I am going to measure things with that, I must have love. We can only measure such things by love, and according to love. So that the question is raised at once, What do I love? Are my movements among the saints of God the movements of one who loves? See what scope for service there is there! I am not to take up too much time -- there are others there. As I take account of the temple, I learn that I must shed there the influence of one who loves. Then John is to measure the altar. We may speak of our sufferings, and of
{321}
what we have surrendered personally, but what about measuring the altar? Think of the sufferings of Christ! Of His mighty surrender! Of His giving up all that He had! -- Yes, giving Himself! Can I measure the altar unless I am in some little way in accord with that altar -- prepared to surrender *myself*?
John is also to measure those that worship, perhaps the most difficult thing of all. We often say, I do not think there is much in this one or that one -- we are measuring up the saints. But how can I measure the worshippers unless I love them in deed and in truth? So John, the great servant chosen for this service, is the outstanding leader in love, and his influence remains -- thank God! According to @1 Corinthians 13: 7, 8 "Love never fails;" it "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things". Love does not behave itself unseemly, and is not puffed up, but it seeks the wealth and the spiritual good of others.
That is the kind of influence that I would plead for at this time. John is the great leader amongst the people of God in love, his influence emanating from his place in intimacy in the bosom of Jesus.
May the Lord help us and bless His word.

GIVING
J H TREVVETT
@1 Chronicles 22: 14; @1 Chronicles 29: 1 - 5; @2 Kings 12: 9, 10; @Acts 20: 33 - 35
In speaking about giving, I have in mind that the closing moments of the church's history on earth will be marked by this precious expression of the divine nature. One feels that a word in relation to giving is necessary, that the Lord, by the Holy Spirit, might move our affections, so that what characterised the disciples in the early days of the church's history, might in some measure characterise those at the close. We are reminded of the word which says, "Freely ye have received, freely give" (@Matthew 10: 8). One is surprised at times at the poverty of our giving. There ought to be in the house of God an affluence that speaks of heaven; no niggardliness, but rather conditions brought about by surrender, in which the fatness of God's house is made manifest. One of the earliest and certainly one of the most princely givers in scripture was Abraham. He was a man very rich in gold, in silver, and in cattle. Indeed, he must have been in his day one of the wealthiest of men. Yet what marked Abraham was that publicly he was content to be little. He was not trusting in the uncertainty of riches, which might at any time, in the ways of God, take wings and fly away. Abraham was trusting in God. How wealthy was Abraham when he went to the children of Heth and desired to buy a burial ground for Sarah. He has nothing to say about his affluence, he is not pleading for any social
{324}
status, but he says, "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you" (@Genesis 23: 4). They said, "Thou art a prince of God among us" (verse 6), and truly he was. Abraham is one of the most princely men in scripture. See how princely he was with Abimelech. (@Genesis 21: 22 - 32). It is said that he reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. How should we stand in the light of such violence? If reviled, do we revile? If we are persecuted, do we threaten? There is all the wealth of the house of God -- yea, of heaven itself -- at our disposal. In such circumstances, whilst reproving men and fastening certain things upon their conscience, should we not exhibit the features which belong to the divine nature? One of the primary features of the divine nature is giving. It is said of Abraham, though he reproved Abimelech, that he gave him sheep and oxen. He gave them to a man whose servants had acted violently towards him. He was not animated by personal feelings. He was not pleading for social status; he was giving. Then further, he "set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves" (@Genesis 21: 28). You can visualise the position. There is the king, and there is the chief captain of his host: that is, not only the throne, but the military power supporting the throne. But Abraham is not afraid; he manifested before the king and the captain of his host the kind of spirit which, though foreign to them, yet disarmed them. It was a kind of spirit that Abimelech could not understand. Those seven ewe lambs -- what are they? What do they represent? It was the kind of spirit that Abraham had. He says in effect, as he presented the seven ewe lambs to Abimelech, 'this is my spirit towards you, this is
{325}
how I would comport myself towards you'. There is nothing offensive about a ewe-lamb, and what about seven of them? They were intended to be a constant reminder of the kind of spirit that marked this princely giver, Abraham, in contrast to the violence and the military spirit.
Isaac, in @Genesis 26, was like Abraham, only that he had an additional feature to contend with. Abimelech came, and Phichol, and with them Abimelech's friend. So that you have the king, representing the political sphere, and the captain of the host, representing the military power, and the king's friend, bringing in the social side, which is the greatest snare of all for many believers. Many are unable to withstand the patronage of the king's friend; they say, 'I have a friend at court'. Is Isaac flattered? Does he seek the favour of the king? Is he pandering to the world in its social aspect? Not at all! Though they had hated him, he can be a giver. He made them a feast. Ah, beloved, there is nothing which will disarm men like the manner of our giving. You may say they hate you. That is not to be wondered at, for the Lord Himself said, "If the world hate you, know that it has hated me before you" (@John 15: 18). But instead of personal feelings, or animosity arising in our hearts in the presence of the world's hatred, there is to be the lavishness of divine giving. As we learn of Him, we become blessers instead of persecutors: we become givers instead of receivers. Saul is one who takes (@1 Samuel 8: 11), and there are plenty of takers. Do not let us add to their number. Six times it is said of king Saul, "he will take". That is the spirit that marks the world, the line of demand. We are not to be like that; we are to be givers.
{326}
One is reminded of a later day when there was collective giving on the part of the children of Israel, as recorded in the book of Exodus. That was most delightful giving; and how freely they had received. A way had been opened for them through the Red Sea. They had stood still, and seen the salvation of Jehovah, and they had begun to sing. It was a song of glad response to the operations of divine Persons. And what did they sing? "This is my God, and I will glorify Him" (@Exodus 15: 2). How God loves to hold the believer to his early vow: thus later in the book we find that the time had come for the children of Israel to fulfil their vow, and they are bidden to bring their offering. "Every one whose heart is willing, let him bring it, Jehovah's heave-offering" (@Exodus 35: 5). There were wise and willing-hearted women as well as men, and they brought Jehovah's offering to the work. Oh, what pleasure God had in this wondrous giving! Indeed, He says of it in a later day, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown" (@Jeremiah 2: 2). God never forgets giving like that. They brought in such abundance that it is said, "The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work ... Then Moses gave commandment, and ... . the people were restrained from bringing" (@Exodus 36: 5, 6). Is that the measure and manner of our giving? Is there too much? The Lord would delight to use a company to administer His bounty, where there was "too much". There is ample scope for the outlet of our affections in relation to giving.
I draw attention now to David, for he was the most princely giver in relation to God and His interests. Men
{327}
talk about wealth; they speak about millionaires and multi-millionaires, but I would draw attention to David's giving, and the manner of it. He gives in three ways. In @1 Chronicles 22: 14 he says, "In my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver". Think of that! No millionaire in the world could give what David gave! People pierce themselves through with many sorrows in the pursuit of riches; it is a most baneful thing, but "Piety with contentment *is* great gain" (@1 Timothy 6: 6). "Freely ye have received, freely give". Again, David says in chapter 29, "I have prepared according to all my power for the house of my God gold for things of gold, and silver for things of silver, and brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood". "According to all my power". It is not in poverty and affliction now. It is the power of the Holy Spirit producing in the believer such affectionate response to divine Persons, that he gives according to all his power. Have you done that? There is great need of it, that there should be no deficiency in the house of God. Then David says finally (verses 3, 4), and best of all, "Moreover, in my affection for the house of my God I have given of my own property ... three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir", that is the very finest gold. Then he speaks of "seven thousand talents of refined silver". He is not bringing, as they did in Malachi, what is lame, or despised, or has a blemish. He brings up what is "refined". He brings the choicest and the best, for the offering is not for man, but for God, and it must be what is costly and magnifical. So David gives in these three ways, and I commend them to our earnest and prayerful
{328}
consideration. He gave in his affliction, that is, in poverty, or distress. Is there anyone here in poverty, anyone under pressure? I am not asking you to give gold and silver, if you have not gold and silver; but I am asking that you should give to divine Persons out of your very poverty and pressure, that you should minister to them. Think of David's gift, one million talents of silver, and one hundred thousand talents of gold! How it puts the giving of this poor world in the shade. Then he says to God, "of that which is from thy hand have we given thee" (chapter 29: 14).
Do we understand stewardship? We often think that it has to do with surplus, but it has to do with my home, my salary, it may be my week's wages, or my day's wages. I look upon all that I have and say, 'I am a steward', not of what is left when the household expenses, and food, and clothing are paid for, but a steward of the whole. I wish I understood that better. I speak practically, as receiving everything that I have as coming to me from the hand of God; I am a steward in relation to the whole, and not a part of the whole. That governs my spending. There are things that I can buy, for all things are lawful, even in these straightened times, but there are things that I can do without, for all things are not expedient. The Lord is coming soon, and in these last moments we should be governed, not by what is lawful, but by what is expedient. Let us think of what we spend during the week; how much have we given to divine interests? Stewardship would set us right in regard to the value of things. It would help us in relation to our giving. You can give in your poverty, your distress, your afflictions, your pressure. Few, if any, have ever been as poor as the widow in @Luke 21. She had two
{329}
mites, which make a farthing. In @Mark 12: 41 - 43 the Lord sat over against the treasury, and watched *how* they gave -- not what they gave, but the manner of their giving, and He said, "This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury". She casts in two mites. She might have kept one, and the Lord appraised the gift at its proper value.
Then David says that he gave according to all his power. And finally, he says, in his affection for the house of his God, he gave of his own property. Now what about that bank balance? -- that excess? In @1 Chronicles 29: 3 you come to the excess, and what governed David? His affection for the house of his God. What delightful giving is this! "In my affection for the house of my God I have given of my own property". How delightful is that excess of affection in the sight of heaven! David does not take the slightest credit to himself: he says to God, "Of that which is from thy hand have we given thee" (@1 Chronicles 29: 14), while he says to Solomon his son, "And thou shalt add to it" (@1 Chronicles 22: 14). What a comforting word to you and me -- "and thou shalt add to it!" Then he raised a searching question: "Who is willing to offer to Jehovah this day?" (@1 Chronicles 29: 5). Are we willing hearted? If we are, we shall give more lavishly for the rest of our time than ever before. Who then is willing? You may ask, How am I to give?
I think Jehoiada the priest gives remarkable instruction typically of the manner and quality of our giving. He was a remarkable man, and he has written across his tomb, what is probably one of the finest epitaphs in the Old Testament. He "grew old and was full of days,
{330}
and he died; ... And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward his house" (@2 Chronicles 24: 15, 16). He saw the need, and in @2 Kings 12: 9 we read "And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Jehovah".
Now I want to raise a very practical question. What governs my giving? Am I influenced by the altar, or do I give mechanically? Have I made up my mind beforehand what I shall give, or do I lend myself to having my affections moved by the altar? In Kings we go by way of the altar, for if we are to give worthily, our impressions must be formed by the altar. It is evident that the box should be beside the altar. The love of Christ for the assembly is presented in the loaf, and there is the love of God as made known by Christ in the cup. What lavish giving it speaks of, as Paul says, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift" (@2 Corinthians 9: 15). What lavish giving! Am I to be unresponsive? Is it not fitting that these things should find an answer in my heart? That I should respond to the love of Christ and the love of God in the loaf and the cup? So there is the box, and it is beside the altar. I may give in small measure because I have only feebly been affected by the death of Christ, but the contemplation of His giving would surely move my heart. He surrendered everything. Seeing one pearl of great price, He went and sold *all* that He had that He might purchase it.
In @Acts 20: 28 we read of "the assembly of God, which he [that is, God] has purchased with the blood of his own", without saying who "his own" is. Oh, the lavishness
{331}
of divine giving! Am I to be unresponsive? There is the chest beside the altar. You will remember in the early days of the church's history, the lavishness of the giving that obtained. How the saints came to light as givers. If they had land or houses, they sold them, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles¬ feet. There is the recognition of apostolic authority, and no murmuring or complaining afterwards about what was done. If our giving was more in accord with the altar, the administration of our bounty would be a very simple matter, for what is given in love, would be administered in love. Great grace was upon them all. They ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and were in favour with all the people.
Then Barnabas came in. The apostles named him the "son of consolation". Why? Because he came in just at the right time to manifest what was an outstanding feature of christianity. He had some land, and he sold it. The last few moments of the church's history ought to be marked by what obtained at the beginning, not only in a spiritual and moral way, but in some measure in a material way. People ask if there are those capable of administering. Well, if we give rightly, it will certainly be administered rightly. There is not a long period left for anyone of us here, let us see to it that, as Peter says, "the rest of his time" (@1 Peter 4: 2), may be marked in this way by giving.
Barnabas brought his offering to the apostles, and laid it at their feet. That is what the Lord loves, that we should trust the local brethren's administration, and if we have love in our hearts, we shall give. So the apostle Paul in @Acts 20 reminds them of "the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive".
{332}
"I have shewed you all things:" and then, "I have coveted the silver or gold or clothing of no one". He speaks in the most touching way: "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus". You cannot find those words in the gospels, but it shows the importance of being near to Christ, so that we may get our impressions from *Him*; "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said". I can imagine the beloved apostle laying emphasis on the word, "that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive". That is the last public word to the assembly, and it is calculated, if rightly apprehended, to enhance our thoughts as to giving; so that the word may be responded to, "freely ye have received, freely give".
May the Lord bless the word.

SATISFACTION
J H TREVVETT
@Psalm 104: 14 - 16; @Philippians 4: 11 - 13; @Acts 27: 35 - 38
I desire to speak about satisfaction, keeping in mind the scripture in @Psalm 104, which says, "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied". That is a feature which, as I understand it, is contemplated in scripture as marking the believer, that he or she is satisfied. We do not need to be reminded that, in the large majority of cases in which trees are mentioned in scripture, they refer to men. So it has been pressed upon my spirit to urge the great need amongst us for evidencing, as together and amongst men, that we are satisfied persons. If we think of the patriarchs, particularly Abraham and Jacob, we see in them at the close, this great feature of satisfaction. We know that Abraham not only walked before God, but we know that he walked *with* God, and thus features which would otherwise have ministered to the flesh, become ultimately almost entirely absent from Abraham. He died, as the word says, "in a good old age, ... and full of days" (@Genesis 25: 8). His years were one hundred and seventy-five. The passing away of that great patriarch reminds us of one of the trees of the Lord full of sap, one who had in his day and generation, not only afforded to God His due, but who had rightly represented God amongst mankind, even before kings. The way Abraham spoke to the Philistine king, as he set on one side the seven ewe lambs, suggests one who had enough and was entirely satisfied, so that he could become like God, the giver. In
{334}
Jacob's case this feature, if I may say so, was even more pronounced for we read in @Hebrews 11: 21, that Jacob, when he was dying, worshipped "on the top of his staff". He had been a man marked by cunning, by craft, by self-seeking; a man who had amassed wealth; and yet at the close he is marked as being a worshipper. God in all His blessedness was before his soul -- he worshipped when he was dying. Other men in the Old Testament have evidenced this precious and remarkable feature of satisfaction; a feature that can only be evidenced as the result of God's mighty operations amongst mankind. And so we are reminded of the possibilities that lie in being satisfied. I hope to show later how this satisfaction is arrived at, but in the meantime I desire to draw your attention to Jotham's parable in @Judges 9: 6 - 21.
You will remember that it was in a day of great lawlessness, when dissatisfaction prevailed on almost every hand, that Jotham uttered his parable. A lawless one, a figure of antichrist, I have no doubt, had arisen. He coveted the throne, he would rule the people. Unqualified, unspiritual, as he was, he would rule them, and he would adopt any and every means whereby to bring them under his rule or authority, for there are the *artifices* of the devil. He is not confined to one method of attack, there are his "wiles", the word is plural. It was at that time Jotham uttered his parable, and he says, "The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them". They appealed to the olive-tree, and the olive-tree said, "Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to wave over the trees?" -- as if to say, 'The thing is unthinkable'. And who that has in any wise known the joy
{335}
of the Holy Spirit would wish to move from the appointed path of the will of God? What promotion could it be which takes anyone out of the path of the will of God? So I have in mind at this juncture the honouring of God and man, and I believe for that honouring, it is essential that we should pay attention to, and make room for, the Holy Spirit. A most important thing, for the Holy Spirit in these last days is ignored, is insulted. He is forgotten, He is quenched, and yet He is a divine Person, with feelings and affections as strong and as sensitive as the Father and the Son -- a divine Person co-equal with both. One would stress the importance of resting in the conscious sense of having the Holy Spirit. The trees appeal to the fig-tree, and the fig-tree says, "Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?" That again reminds us that the fig-tree was satisfied. I suppose the fig-tree in scripture speaks of what God sought for, and at one time found, amongst His people Israel, that they should represent God amongst men. So He says in @Hosea 9: 10, "I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness; as first-ripe fruit on the fig-tree, I saw your fathers". I believe in that early day of Israel's history, there was not only a response Godward, but there was a desire to set forth God amongst the nations. Then the trees appealed to the vine, and the vine says, "Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave over the trees?" Again it would appear as if the suggestion were unthinkable. It is one of the trees of the Lord and it is satisfied. I believe that these features seen in the olive-tree, the fig-tree, and the vine, remind us of a precious response Godward which should mark every believer.
{336}
Now I come to @Psalm 104. It is a psalm which is well worthy of contemplation, for in the soul of the psalmist at the beginning there is a profound sense of the greatness of Jehovah -- he says, "thou art very great" (verse 1). Then he begins to describe in the most minute detail His operations. He operates for the benefit of all creation, in spite of being misunderstood, and mistrusted. He continues as a beneficent Creator to consider for, and care for, every part of His creation, even the young lions, for it is said, "the young lions roar after the prey, and to seek their food from God" (verse 21). Marvellous thing! And as the psalmist views the different species in creation, he says, "These all look unto thee", -- all of them -- "that thou mayest give their food in its season" (verse 27). What a God He is! In spite of men and in spite of the lawlessness of men, there is not one single bit of creation that is out of His hand. He has surrendered nothing, neither will He, in spite of what men do, He continues to be good. As His people sang, and as we sing, 'For he is good' -- 'How good is the God we adore'! (`23:1). We have the most abundant proof of the goodness of God, whether to the birds, or to the beasts of the field, or to the fish of the sea, *He is good*. We cannot too insistently press upon men that He is good. So this beautiful psalm reminds us of what He has done. He has caused grass to grow for the cattle. That is a wonderful thing. Even the cattle are in His mind, and, if the cattle, how much more His people, how much more man, made in His own image and likeness! He has gone further. He has caused the herb to grow for the service of man, relating probably to the abundance of His mercies, how He encompasses men, not merely His people, but men, with
{337}
abundant mercies day by day -- food to eat, air to breathe, and rest of mind and body. He would care for men, however unthankful they may be, and however unholy they may be. He cares for men. Oh what a God He is! But again, He has gone further, and He has given, according to the verses I read, three specific things for men, and I believe they specially refer to His people. He gives wine to make glad man's heart. He gives oil to make his face to shine; and He gives bread to strengthen man's heart.
Now I would remind you of how this operates in the believer, and I turn now to John's gospel, for in chapter 2 we have wine; in chapter 4 we have what answers to oil; and in chapter 6 we have bread. I would dwell on those things for a moment as suggesting the activities of the giving God, and showing how completely He would set up and establish the believer so that he is rendered entirely independent as to his spirit, of anything there is in this world. If we come to it in any small degree it will give us great joy. So I would refer to what took place at Cana of Galilee. When they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine" (@John 2: 3.). This is not a gross and evil scene depicted here, this is not a company marked by lawlessness such as exists amongst men, particularly today. It is the best in nature, a marriage, a time when natural joy runs high. It is nature at its best: the bridegroom is there and the bride is there, and the disciples of Jesus are there, and the mother of Jesus is there. It is the best in nature, but, though Jesus is there, they wanted wine. I wonder how many of us have come to that, that the very best in nature, the most precious links, the most endearing ties, can afford nothing to compare with the
{338}
profound joy the blessed God is willing to give to His people. So the Lord answers Mary in what seems to be a very hard way, He says to her, "Woman" -- He does not say 'Mother', mark that. He says "What have I to do with thee, woman?" (@John 2: 4), as if to say that the most precious tie cannot be allowed to interfere with what is about to take place. The transition here is from the best in nature, with its solemn deficiency, to a region where everyone is made profoundly joyous by the introduction of the new wine, which makes glad the heart of man.
I come to chapter 4. You remember that there you find a woman who was greatly dissatisfied. There are thousands such, who are dissatisfied. And as this woman comes to draw water Jesus said to her "Give me to drink" (verse 7). Think of the blessed Son of God there, as One who deigns to ask -- "Give me to drink". Was it the mere literal water that He desired? He was weary with the way that He had come; the "way" suggesting to one's heart the ceaseless, untiring activity and zeal in relation to the holy interests of God, and of His people. He was weary with the way that He had come -- weary physically, as many have been since -- but never too weary, thank God, to enter into conversation with one who was in a state of serious dissatisfaction, and who longed for something to meet her deepest need. Then he says "If thou knewest the gift of God ..". (verse 10). Ah, the giving God was there, He was about to give living water, He was about to speak of a divine source of satisfaction from which, if a person drank, he would never again thirst for ever -- and I want to speak of the effects of that. When Christ as the prophet had
{339}
probed the conscience, and when everything was settled, beyond the region of mercies, it says the woman "left her waterpot" (verse 28) -- the finest thing a person can do. It had engrossed her, she had looked to the waterpot as a means of satisfaction and she had looked to the well, and she had said, "Art thou greater than our father Jacob?" (verse 12). Of course He was! In chapter 4 He is greater than Jacob; in chapter 6 He is greater than Moses; and in chapter 8 He is greater than Abraham. Oh, let us hold at all cost to the greatness of Christ, He supersedes all, He is above all! The woman says "Our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle". Think of persons, think of believers, being satisfied with a well from which cattle drink! There is no "living water" for cattle. There *is* the well of Jacob, there are the mercies of God, and the care of a beneficent Creator -- for cattle. But He has much more for us. It says, "The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men ..". Do you not think that she would be known! Do you not think that prior to this her countenance had probably been something like Cain's? And God takes account of men's countenances. He says to Cain, "Why is thy countenance fallen?" (@Genesis 4: 6) -- a striking reference to the compassions of God, who is the observer of all men. Do you not think that as she came to the well with an aching void and a heart marked by deep sadness, her face would have betokened the inward dissatisfaction of her heart? She went to the men of the city. She did not shut herself up, or just speak to the neighbours on occasions, but she went boldly in her courage, having something at least of the reputation, it may have been, of a Rahab, to the
{340}
men of the city. They are the persons to go to, persons who know you, persons who know me. She went to the men of the city, and she said to them, "Come".
I hope we are all accustomed to saying that word. I do not mean to each other, I mean to those in the office, in the world. You cannot say more than that? "Come". "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" (verse 29). Do you think that any one of us would, apart from the grace of God, readily invite a person to come and hear a truthful and accurate account in detail of every saying, and every thought, and every deed of ours from the time of our birth? We would cover our faces with shame, apart from the grace of God. Do you not think her face shone with oil that day? -- oil to make the face to shine. So effective, so compelling, so convincing, was her testimony that they came. Oh, how full our meeting-rooms would be for the promulgation of the gospel testimony, -- in spite of the reproach that rests on many of them, -- if each one of us were saying to the men of the city, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" And thank God, they came. Oh, the compelling power in testimony of a person whose face is shining as with oil.
Then, in chapter 6 we are reminded by John the writer that there was *much grass* in the place where Jesus was -- a very significant allusion. You see how God would disarm the prejudice of men, there is much grass. Any intelligent right-minded person would say -- especially if they had read @Psalm 104 -- This is one of the sovereign movements of God in creation: no one but God could make grass to grow. It says, "there was much grass in the place" (verse 10). If any one took account of the grass, they would say, Grass
{341}
was made to grow for the cattle, and if God has cattle in mind, He must have me in mind. Then John goes further and describes the feeding of the five thousand. They sat down and they were filled, one of the simplest things possible, but it is not the end, it is not appropriation, it is reception. Every believer has received -- there is not a single believer who has not received, "Freely ye have received (@Matthew 10: 8)". But the Lord has something more than the mere handing out of food, the mere reception on the part of His people of food which is His to give. He begins to speak later of what was to some a hard saying. They speak about Moses and they refer to the manna, as if Moses had given them the manna. The Lord says, "I am the bread of life" (verse 35). Bread had rained down from heaven -- the manna -- day by day, unfailingly it had come down. I think alongside the wastage of the flesh learned in the wilderness, there would be correlatively the appreciation of the manna that had fallen from heaven morning by morning. Oh, how ugly the flesh is in the sight of the manna, how repulsive, how obnoxious! As I see the manna come down from heaven, how repulsive the flesh is! I think those are the two great lessons of the wilderness, that we learn to refuse the flesh as being repulsive and ugly, and we learn to appreciate Jesus as the Christ once humbled here. The Lord goes on to say "I am the bread of life" -- and He exhorts that we should eat that bread now. Now so long as I am only on the line of receiving, I shall never develop a constitution. Receiving is a poor thing if I continue in it, but if I am on the line of appropriating the bread of life which comes down from heaven I develop a spiritual constitution. My heart is strengthened -- bread
{342}
which strengtheneth man's heart. May we say like Peter in this chapter, "Lord, to whom shall we go?" (verse 68). Difficult times are upon us, increasing lawlessness, one thing and another all tending to distract and divert the saints of God, and we need to bring into evidence as before men that what we have is a state of the most blessed satisfaction. "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied".
Now I will just make one or two brief remarks about Paul. We never tire -- and rightly so -- of referring to Paul. He is the great model for the believer, and I want to show, in conclusion, how what we have been speaking of operated in Paul. I again remind you of the epistle to the Philippians, where the apostle, speaking from prison, says, "I am full" (@Philippians 4: 18), and he says, "*I* have learnt" (it was not a gift, he had learned it) "in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself". Oh, what a marvellous thing! The lusts of Egypt, the lusts of the world, had no place with him, the pride of life, as in Babylon, never entered into his mind -- he had judged those things as filth, and he had done with them. What had he? He had wine to cheer his heart, he had oil to make his face to shine, and he had bread to strengthen his heart. His words to the Philippians from the dungeon at Rome indicate a state of profound satisfaction. Do you not think they would say, 'We do not wonder at it. This is the servant, this is the man, who manifested even in Philippi, a state of such satisfaction that, though his feet were fast in the stocks, though it was midnight, though he was smarting under cruel scourging, he was with another satisfied 'tree' of the Lord, praising God with singing'. What a tree! Once a cedar of man's planting, once a great
{343}
religious colossus, fascinating and attracting men by the force of his own personality, he is now a tree of the Lord full of sap -- satisfied. He is a cedar of Lebanon which the Lord has planted. Paul and Silas in the prison at Philippi are trees of the Lord's planting, and as we read this letter we are reminded of how satisfied Paul had been in earlier days, and he is no less satisfied at this juncture. He is writing under the most uncongenial circumstances, and from the most cramped surroundings, yet he says, I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.
What is he doing? He is serving the Lord's people, not only cheering God and man, but he is serving in bringing before the Lord's people from the prison in those four epistles, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians and Philemon, the highest level of spiritual ministry. Was he obsessed with his circumstances? Was he complaining about his environment? Was he not like the olive, content in his lot, honouring God and honouring man? Was he not like the fig-tree, exuding sweetness all around? And was he not like the vine, as in the prison at Philippi, cheering God and cheering man? For the prisoners listened, and, as the prisoners listened, I have not the slightest doubt that they were cheered, for every one's bands were loosed, and the jailer was converted. That is how it works. Oh, if we were only set more diligently and devotedly for God and His precious interest, how much might be wrought!
I only want to touch on the last scripture in closing as suggesting how this state of satisfaction amongst the people of God might take effect amongst men. We are reminded in Luke's graphic account of this journey, of the most precious details, and he tells us that at this juncture
{344}
Paul took a loaf; although he says there were two hundred and seventy-six souls in the boat, he took *a loaf*. This, obviously, was not the breaking of bread, yet I believe it is intended to remind us of what has been recovered in these last days, for the apostle Paul did here what Jesus did as the disciples were around Him. He did here what he did at Corinth, he took a loaf and he gave thanks -- in this case to God -- and then he broke it and then he ate. As he ate and was satisfied, others ate and were satisfied. Then the word says, "And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea". I do not think that was wrong, the ship was about to be broken up, the journey was to come to its conclusion, but they cast out the wheat into the sea.
And now in conclusion, I want to say a word as to activity in gospel preaching. There is one feature that men will never be able to gainsay; they may complain about our grammar, they may speak against our dialect, as they did with Peter and John. They may bring to nothing our theology. They may ask us the most pertinent questions; but there is one thing they will never be able to gainsay, and I plead for this one thing, that is, that we are trees of the Lord and are satisfied. If we are satisfied, and full, our words may be feeble, but men will never be able to deny the fact that we have something, we have a source of satisfaction about which they know nothing.
*Place and date unknown*.

BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM THE MINISTRY OF J REVELL
Editor's note -- the following eight short words are taken from 'Comfort and Other Re-published Papers' which was published in 1935. Our brother was taken to be with the Lord in April 1900, so the words were obviously given at a much earlier date.
(1) COMFORT
@2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4
In a world like this everyone needs comfort, more or less, at one time or another. It is very blessed to know God as the God of all comfort. There is a great difference between human comfort and divine. The former is found in dwelling upon the resources which may still be left to us in this world, and in thinking of the possibilities which are before us. Thus many who are in sorrow derive comfort from seeing that things are not so bad as they might be, and from the hope that they may yet be better. When there are no resources left and no possibilities to present, human comfort is dumb.
Thus when Job's friends came to comfort him in his overwhelming grief, they wept, and sat in silence for seven days and seven nights. His resources were completely gone. When, at length, Job opened his mouth and poured out the bitterness of his spirit, they undertook to vindicate the God of whom they knew but little. In so doing they insinuated that there must have been secret evil with Job,
{346}
or he would not have been so completely stripped. "Grievous comforters are ye all" (@Job 16: 2), he exclaimed.
We may observe further that when there are resources left, and comfort is derived from them, we are exposed to fresh and more bitter grief, for these may be taken away, and the expectations we have cherished may fail. In the meantime the heart is, by such comfort, bound closer to the earth and present things. We may see thus how poor and ineffectual human comfort is and also how it may prove even disastrous to the soul. The God of all comfort is the One who raises the dead. When man's resources are all exhausted and the very worst has come, then God acts. It is often said, man's extremity is God's opportunity.
Sorrow and death are here on account of sin. Jehovah Elohim spoke of sorrow, toil, and death as the result of man's disobedience (@Genesis 3: 16 - 19). So man's life commonly begins with the cry of sorrow, continues in toil, and ends in death. Men propose many things to mitigate this, and they would if possible remove it, but this they cannot do. As sorrow and death came by sin they cannot be removed without sin being taken away. The Lamb of God has come to take away the sin of the world, to put it away by the sacrifice of Himself. The full results of that offering are not yet made manifest, but He has been raised from the dead, and He now lives to God in His presence. There He lives for us, as our representative. Because He lives we shall live also. Into that circle where He is sorrow and death can never enter. It is a scene of cloudless favour, peace, and endless delight. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, who has come to us, brings us to present enjoyment of that
{347}
wondrous place. We are still subject to sorrow here, but by the Spirit's ministry we find our joy where Christ is, and this is to us unfailing comfort.
Great pressure had rested upon Paul in his devoted service to Christ in Asia. He had even despaired of life. But he said, "We ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead" (@2 Corinthians 1: 9). Instead of human resources being counted upon, there was the recognition of the sentence of death resting upon all that was of themselves, but God was known in the faith of their souls as the God of resurrection. They were delivered by His power and they comforted the Corinthians with the comfort wherewith they themselves had been comforted of God.
From the whole drift of 2 Corinthians we may see how different is the comfort ministered from that which is human. No mitigation of things here is spoken of, nor held out in expectation. What man would call the very worst was anticipated, the dissolution of our earthly tabernacle house. But we have been divinely wrought for heavenly glory with Christ, and even now are our eyes set upon unseen and eternal things. The heart is bound to the place where Christ is, and morally severed from things that are here. This leaves no room for disappointment. Death cannot touch the things that are there, nor can sorrow enter to mar them. There lies the fullest blessing of the Lord which maketh rich and to which He adds no sorrow.
We can understand therefore how the apostle bade the Thessalonians to comfort each other with the words he wrote for them, which showed that nothing could intervene
{348}
to rob them of all that was theirs in association with Christ. We can also understand how he could speak to them in his second epistle of everlasting consolation which is given to us by our God and Father who loves us.
May God grant to each one deliverance from the delusive comfort which is connected with the flesh and the world, and a knowledge of the true and everlasting encouragement of which He is the Author.
(2) PRESENT MINISTRY
Nothing changes the love of Christ to the assembly. We have failed, but He cannot fail. His gracious love continues to the end. And, as a consequence of this, He still nourishes and cherishes the assembly, as it is said "No one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly" (@Ephesians 5: 29). There is, therefore, never a time when His people cannot count upon Him for a present ministry, suited to the special need of the moment.
The other side of the truth connected with a present ministry is given to us in the Lord's words in @Luke 12: 42, "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give the measure of corn in season?" Unfailing love is the spring of a present ministry; those who are used in it are described as faithful and wise. One such said, It is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. It is the Lord Himself who is before such, not their own importance; and because He is before them His household is precious to them. The servant who sought to be faithful to his Master said of His household,
{349}
"*I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (@2 Corinthians 12: 15). We may be sure that such will be entrusted by the Lord with a portion of meat in due season for His own.
There is, however, a further point to be considered. A present ministry will ever be the object of Satan's bitterest attacks. His aim is always to frustrate the purpose of God, and with this in view he opposes any setting forth of the present mind of God concerning His people. In doing this he may most successfully use that which is past. He constantly sought to seduce Israel to idolatry, out of which Abram had been called; he now draws away christians to judaism, not to idolatry. The same principle is seen in regard to ministry. No one can read the history of Israel under the direction of Moses without seeing how persistently he was opposed. When we reach the days of the Lord we find His opposers saying, "We know that God spoke to Moses; but as to this man, we know not whence he is" (@John 9: 29). The ministry of Moses, which was rejected in its own time, is held as orthodoxy and constantly brought forward in opposition to that of the Lord. Yet the close of @John 5 shows that these zealous supporters of Moses missed the whole point of his ministry, for, as the Lord said, "he wrote of me" (verse 46).
The same principle remains true. It is easy to adopt as orthodoxy a past ministry which in its own time was persistently rejected, for the bitter opposition of Satan is against a present ministry. But however greatly prized may be a past ministry to those who are in the enjoyment of Christ's love to the assembly, they will count on Him to
{350}
speak in present power, presenting that which is peculiarly applicable to the condition and need of His people. May we have grace to discern that which is from the Lord, and to receive it humbly and thankfully!
(3) THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
@Revelation 22: 17
The Spirit's voice is the expression of the present mind of God. Of old the priest in the house of God had the Urim and Thummim by which God made known His mind. Now, the Spirit maintains a living testimony within the house of God, and shows what is the mind of God. Thus, in the early chapters of the Revelation, the one who has an ear to hear is called to hear the Spirit's voice to the assemblies. We are not called to hear the assembly's voice, but what the Lord has to say in the testimony of the Spirit to the assemblies, and about them. If the assembly speaks there cannot but be in its voice the sad evidence of all the corruption which has found a place within it. In the voice of the Spirit there is the maintenance of all that is according to God, even though it be to the condemnation of the church. All that in which man rests in self-complacency, and of which he boasts so loudly, is exposed, as the mind of God is made known, and judgment is pronounced upon it as evil. This bows the heart that loves the Lord in deepest humiliation, that that which bears His name should be found so evil that nothing can prevent its becoming the subject of the righteous judgment of God.
{351}
But now, in the close of the book, we hear the Spirit's voice in a different way. The Lord presents Himself as the One in whom all blessing lies, and the Spirit leads in the suited cry of invitation to Him to come: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". It is not His voice alone which utters the cry, for joined with His is the voice of the saints in whose hearts bridal affection has been formed, and with it the intense longing to see the face of Him whom they love. In the solemn testimony of judgment in the early part of the book, the Spirit's voice gives the message of the Lord. In the cry of invitation, He leads the saints to a suited response to the Lord. In both, He maintains the mind of God.
The Lord presents Himself as the Root and Offspring of David, and the bright and Morning Star. In chapter 5: 5, He is announced as the Lion which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David. He is thus made known as the subject of prophecy, from that of Jacob, when he blessed his sons, to that of the later prophets. Yet He appears in the midst of the throne in the character of a Lamb standing as slain. He has overcome, but He has done so through suffering and death. He comes forward to take up the inheritance, and to fulfil in regard to it all the will of God. The first strokes of His power must of necessity be in judgment for the overthrow of evil in its various forms, but all this is with a view to bringing in all the blessing which God has purposed for the earth. How happy will be the day when the power of the evil one shall be broken and abolished, and the Lord alone shall be exalted!
The darkness of the night seems most intense when in chapter 2 we read the message to Thyatira. Then it is that
{352}
the Lord speaks to the overcomer of the day when His own shall share with Him His reign, and adds, "I will give to him the morning star" (verse 28). He makes Himself known in the heart as the pledge of the day, and the assurance of its being near. The day of which He is the blessed harbinger is the day of God, beginning with His reign for the subjugation of all things, but passing on to when God shall be all in all, the day of eternity. We taste the joy of that day in the knowledge of Himself. Here, in this closing presentation of Himself in this character, He adds the word "bright". It is as though the nearer we come to the close, and feel more the darkness around, the brighter becomes to us the character He bears. He is the bright Morning Star.
It is significant that in this way the Lord presents Himself at the close. We ourselves have had to learn the truth much in the order in which it is presented in this book. That is, we have had to learn the evil that has crept into the church, which has brought it, as an outward body in this world, under judgment. Along with this we have learned something of the working of things in the world, and the details which are given prophetically in Scripture of the Lord's coming. Now, the Lord would draw us from the contemplation of the evil, and its judgment, and would wean us from the absorbing study of prophetic details, that He may have our eyes and hearts for Himself. The great theme of these closing verses is what He Himself is: "*I* Jesus ... *I* am". Whatever the world is, and whatever the church has become, He remains, and all blessing is found with Him.
The great end of the Spirit's present work is that we may be brought to the consciousness of union with Christ.
{353}
It is dependent upon affection for Him, for no one could value union with Him to whom He is not the absorbing Object. Leading us, therefore, by the path of deliverance, and of the knowledge of the purpose of God, He so presents Christ to us that our affection for Him grows. In this way does He form the bridal cry which is here spoken of, in which He Himself leads, as showing that it is the present mind of God. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". It is the language of the heart divinely instructed in our relation to Christ, that longs with affectionate yearning after Him, that He may have His place and that His joy may be full.
Beloved brethren, let those who wish to do so count dates and investigate the signs of the times. But let it be our earnest desire to be formed by the Spirit in the intimate knowledge of the One whom we love, and of our proper relation to Him, that there may be produced in our hearts and upon our lips, intelligently and fervently, the response which the Lord looks for to the presentation of Himself -- "Come".
(4) IN POVERTY OR RICHES
@Psalm 16: 1 - 11; @Philippians 4: 10 - 13
The psalm speaks of the One who was perfect in His dependence as a Man here upon earth. The closing verses, which are quoted in the New Testament and applied to the Lord Jesus Christ, leave no doubt as to the One who is in view. @Philippians 4 is the language of one who was not himself perfect, but who followed the perfect One. He
{354}
speaks as one who had passed through the school of God. He could say, "*I* have learnt". All believers are in that school, for it is said in @Hebrews 12: 7 that all are partakers of discipline, "For who is the son that the Father chastens not?" To us, therefore, who are in the school, the experience and language of one who has passed through it are of great importance. The Scripture not only sets before us the perfect One, but also gives us the experience of one like ourselves, one who could say, "*I* have learnt".
Our circumstances vary. They may be of joy or of sorrow; and, though we would naturally prefer the former, the latter may be far safer to us. For in joy we may be forgetful of God, whereas in sorrow we are made to feel that we cannot do without Him. But whatever our circumstances may be, God uses them to our schooling; He disciplines us through them. The end of His discipline is that He may be better known in our souls, and the provision of His love may be appreciated and enjoyed. Now though our circumstances vary, we ourselves should be steady, and the secret of steadiness lies in having God before us, as One well known by us through our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus the word in the psalm is, "I have set Jehovah continually before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved". And Paul says, "I have strength for all things in him that gives me power". I have quoted it a little more literally, because the thought of power is not confined to activity, it is made manifest in suffering and in endurance also. The apostle had known in a great degree what suffering was, and in it he had patiently endured. Now at the present moment he was rich; as he said, "I have all things in full supply and abound; I
{355}
am full" (verse 18). What made him so was not any earthly possession, but his having received the expression of the affection of the Philippians for him. This made him rich.
As a general principle, I should say that the richest man is the one who possesses affections. The man who has money, and has no love, is really very poor. A man may be poor, and yet possess the affections of those whom he loves, and he is happier, in my judgment, than the man who only has money. In the case of the apostle it was not natural affections, but those which are divinely formed in the saints by the Spirit; but I speak of the general principle; to love and to be loved is the truest riches. But the apostle was not carried away with his abundance, for God was before his soul. The very expression of the love of the Philippians was an offering to God, in his sight. "An odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God" (@Philippians 4: 18). This was the secret of his steadiness. The God who was his portion in the midst of adversity was before him in his abounding plenty, and he was perfectly restful. May we have the Lord always before us, so that in sorrow or joy we may be perfectly restful in His love.
(5) OUR LEADERS
@1 Thessalonians 5: 12
In other places in Scripture besides this the leaders are spoken of. Three times in @Hebrews 13 they are named. We should not misunderstand the common translation, "them that have the rule", and think of such as though they had rule like a magistrate or an officer. This has been the
{356}
thought of many, while others, who revolt from this, refuse to recognise anything like oversight. Such do not deny that the Scriptures speak of overseers, or bishops, but they suppose that they passed away with the days of the apostles, and we are not now to look for such. The question, therefore, becomes a deeply interesting and important one, Who and what is a leader, and may we look for such at the present time?
It may scarcely be necessary to mention that the word "bishop", as used in Scripture, simply means one who exercises oversight; "the presbytery" simply means the elders. Both terms have acquired an ecclesiastical usage, but it is well to return to the simplicity of Scripture. The work of an overseer is very simply and beautifully named in @1 Timothy 3: 5. He takes care of the assembly of God. And the first verse of the same chapter shows that he does this as a matter of desire, a desire which is no doubt begotten of love for those for whom he would care, and love for Him whose they are. The apostle shows what should be their character. In perfect agreement with all this are the words of the apostle Peter (@1 Peter 5: 1), where he exhorts the elders to shepherd the flock of God. He forbids the thought of gain, or of lordship; they are to give themselves to the care of the saints readily and freely, and as being themselves examples. And this brings us to the true thought of a leader. A leader is one who shows us the way, because he himself knows it; and he encourages us to take it, because he himself is so perfectly convinced of its goodness. He is aware of the difficulties, but he knows how they may be overcome. He is conscious of the dangers, and would tenderly guard from them those for
{357}
whom he cares. He knows the end, and he would allow nothing short of that end to be the goal for himself, or those whom he loves. It is therefore clear that such would be a leader in the apostles¬ days, and such is a leader now. He may not have now, as he might have had then, the sanction and the expression of fellowship which were indicated by the laying on of the apostles¬ hands. But none the less his heart yearns over the saints in his desire to help them, and the Lord will no doubt cause his affections and fitness to be felt by others.
The spring of all true intelligence and clear discernment of the way which the saints should take, lies in the knowledge of God. Doctrine may be pursued philosophically, and often has been so pursued, but we may grieve for the man who entrusts himself to the guidance of such a philosopher. It were no wiser so to do than for a traveller to place himself under the care of a guide who only knows the region through which they pass by information which he has gained from books. Neither of these guides is practical. The man who has trodden the road in all sorts of weather is practical; and the man who has learned what God is amid all the varying circumstances of life is also practical.
Again, the man of precedents is not in divine things a reliable guide. He may relate what has taken place in the past, but that may not at all be the mind of God for the present. The true guide has rather a knowledge of moral principles, with wisdom from God for the true application of them. He knows what the flesh is so that he can discern it, whatever the varied or plausible forms it may assume. He sees beneath the merely external shape of things and
{358}
lays hold of their moral principle. In the knowledge which he has of God he can understand what is befitting His people at every juncture. Not only does he plainly see what God has called His people from, and he would have no mark of it left upon them, but also he sees what God has called them to, and he labours that all that blessedness may form their character now.
Love is the only motive of a true leader. In this respect (though in other respects the analogy fails), he resembles Deborah of the time of the judges. In her song (@Judges 5) she describes the misery of Israel until she arose "a mother in Israel" (verse 7). She was not a father, neither did she pretend to a father's place, but she had a mother's heart. She loved the people, and she did what she could for their relief. It is not that love behaves itself unseemly, for that it does not, but where love exists there will be care for the saints, according to the measure and position of the one who has it, without waiting for anything like ecclesiastical approval, or without any sort of pretension.
To the elders at Ephesus Paul gave himself as an example (@Acts 20). Instead of aiming at position or gain, he had with his own hands ministered to his own wants, and of those that were with him. "I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring we ought to come in aid of the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive" (verse 35). His devotedness in service knew no bounds. "For three years, night and day, I ceased not admonishing each one of you with tears" (verse 31). We live in days of great feebleness, but may the Lord graciously give to us true leaders of this sort. Where there are such already (however
{359}
small may be the measure), may grace be given to us to discern them, and to regard them very highly in love for their work's sake.
(6) THE DISSENSION OF PAUL AND BARNABAS
It is sorrowful to look upon dissension between two beloved servants of Christ, and to see them severed in their paths of service, which had previously been as one. But the Spirit has recorded that which took place between Paul and Barnabas, and has done so for our learning. Let us consider it with this in view, and free from the spirit of curiosity or criticism. I call attention to the source of the contention, so far as we can trace it, and the consequences flowing to each.
All that we have concerning Barnabas in the Acts previous to the dissension is very beautiful. His beginning was bright (@Acts 4) where in his wholeheartedness he received from the apostles the name of Barnabas, the son of consolation (or encouragement). Then not only was he regarded as a son of encouragement in the work at Jerusalem, but he became the link between that city and the work among the gentiles at Antioch. And rejoicing without jealousy in the grace of God to the gentiles, he encouraged them also to cleave with purpose of heart to the Lord. Then his links with Paul were close and sweet. He introduced him to the saints at Jerusalem when they were afraid of him, and afterwards was the means of introducing him to the saints, and the work of the Lord at Antioch. How suitable in every way it seemed that he should be chosen and called of the Holy Spirit to
{360}
accompany Paul in his mission (@Acts 13). And again we cannot but admire the beautiful delicacy with which he seems to have accompanied Paul, without jealousy of the growing prominence in the work of him who was called into it later than himself.
But we are all tested, and the effect of the tests which are applied is to bring out to ourselves, and it may be to others, motives and weaknesses we did not suppose existed. If the motives are judged, and the weakness casts us upon the Lord, it is well. We have gained by the exposure. If otherwise, it is ill, for the motives which have been allowed sway us and turn us from the path.
@Galatians 2 gives us the first intimation of weakness with Barnabas. @Acts 15 shows us that he and Paul were appointed to go together to Jerusalem about the question of circumcision which was agitating the saints at Antioch. In @Galatians 2, Paul tells us that he himself went up by revelation. We may gather from this that he was indisposed to go to Jerusalem merely at the request of the saints at Antioch, but God had willed it so, and made it known by revelation. We may suppose that there was no such indisposition on the part of Barnabas, for, from what follows, we find that Jerusalem and its "pillars" had a place with him which they had not with Paul. If Paul was indisposed to go to Jerusalem, it was no doubt owing to the fact that already in his own soul he apprehended that the saints form the temple of God, where His mind may be known, and thus the work of God was not dependent upon any ecclesiastical centre. For him, all that connected itself with the flesh and with the earth was gone from view. He saw the testimony of the Lord maintained alone, in
{361}
wisdom and in energy, by the power of the Spirit of God. The revelation he received to go to Jerusalem did not annul all this, but in the wisdom of God the question of judaising was to be settled at Jerusalem. If Barnabas was disposed to go, it may have been that Jerusalem, with all its glorious associations, and now with its pillars of the church, was still great before his soul.
This seems to be manifest in what follows. After they had returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, Peter came there, and having perfectly known the truth that God had received to blessing gentiles as gentiles, he ate with them, without any question or scruple. Then certain brethren came from James, and before them Peter separated himself from the gentile believers, to eat with the Jews only, thus distinctly recognising judaism as though it still had place with God. Now all this is spoken of by Paul by a strong term -- dissimulation, or hypocrisy, for, as he says, they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel. Peter knew better, but acted contrary to his knowledge. In this he was joined by all the Jews there, and even Barnabas, who should have stood in the truth pre-eminently, was carried away.
Here, then, was the clear discovery of his weakness. Jerusalem, James, Peter, and the Jewish brethren, still had a place as such in his mind. In a word, he was not clear of the flesh in its religious prestige and glory. Well would it have been if he had accepted this exposure of his weakness, and, profiting by Paul's noble maintenance of the truth of the gospel, had sought humbly to walk according to it. But all that we have in @Galatians 2, throws light upon the dissension related in the end of @Acts 15, and
{362}
prepares us to understand it. The immediate cause of the dispute was John Mark, who had first gone out with them from Antioch, but who, when faced with all the difficulties of the work, had abandoned it, and returned to his home at Jerusalem. Now John was nephew to Barnabas, and, moreover, was a link with Jerusalem. So that when Paul proposed to Barnabas again to set forth, the latter insisted upon taking Mark, notwithstanding his previous defection. This Paul refused, and the contention being sharp, they separated in their paths of service. What we find, therefore, is this, that underneath all that was so lovely with Barnabas, there was found, when tested, a lingering love of that which lies in the flesh; kinship; nationality; and ecclesiastical order and position. This being not judged when exposed, it eventually led him from the path of association with him who was evidently pre-eminent in the work of the Lord.
A few words may suffice as to the consequences to each. As to Barnabas we read no more. It is as though he became of little account in the work of the Lord. He began early and brightly, and ran well, but here, alas, he drops out of view. To Paul, the severance from Barnabas seemed the breaking of the last link with Jerusalem, so that it is after this that we have what appears to be the most definite character of ministry and work. All his epistles were written after this time, in which we see set forth so clearly the worthlessness of the flesh, and that everything is found in Christ and in the Spirit. The lessons for us are evident. We may run well, but if the flesh is not judged, as it becomes exposed, it will eventually carry us away from the true path, and we may find ourselves severed from
{363}
such as the Lord is graciously using in His work and testimony. May the Lord keep us.
(7) ETERNAL THINGS
@Revelation 21: 7
In @Revelation 2, 3 we see all that connects itself with the name of Christ in this world, as all passes in review under His eye, and about it all we have the declaration of His mind. Nearly the whole of it is found contrary to Him, and is threatened with judgment. He would have us feel the intense seriousness of this. We are called to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. Then while He bids us hearken to His judgment of things, He encourages us to rise in spiritual energy above the moral elements which surround us, and to overcome. This He does by presenting various things which are present to His eye, and which He would have steadily kept before the faith of His people. These things are not connected with the existing state, which is so hopelessly ruined, but either with His own kingdom, which He will shortly establish in power, or with eternal blessing. We can only overcome in the present state of things, as our eye is steadily fixed upon that which is future. Yet that which is future becomes a present reality and joy to the man whose eye rests on it in faith, and whose heart is stirred in affection to reach the Lord. In reaching Him we get anticipatively the delight of heavenly and eternal things, by the power of the Holy Spirit. As we enter thus into the delight of all that is found with the Lord Himself, we are conscious that we have reached that which
{364}
can never fail, for it is the fruit of divine love, and is sustained in divine power.
In chapter 4, a heavenly scene is before us. There God's rights as Creator are celebrated. Man has refused to own them, but they are owned in the mind and praise of heaven. In the following chapter the One is found who is pronounced worthy to open the book which is sealed. It is the Lamb that has been slain. In the recognition of all that is suited to God, and in devoted obedience to His will, our Lord Jesus has suffered even to death. As the holy Sufferer He has overcome all the moral elements of the world, and has proved Himself the suited One to take up everything and subdue it to God. The chapters which follow show how He clears away by judgment all that which is hateful to God, and He eventually takes up the kingdom. The kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ comes to pass. It will be a blessed day for the earth when He, whose feet once trod it in holy strangership and suffering, shall rule over it! In those days which are past, He fully showed what was the heart of God in compassionate goodness and power to relieve man, whom Satan had led captive. In the day of His rule He will make all this good, establishing in divine power upon earth all that is in God's heart for man. "In his days shall the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace till the moon be no more" (@Psalm 72: 7).
How sweet it is to have the eye directed to these scenes of peace and bliss, away from all the existing confusion and misery! In the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, everything which has been committed to man, and in which he has so grievously failed, will be taken up, and God's thought in it all carried out. Thus will God be
{365}
glorified in the very world in which He has been dishonoured, and man will be blest according to all the previous indications of God's mind. But when all this shall have come to pass, and when every question which has been raised in the course of time has been divinely solved, God will make all things new, leaving no trace of that which formerly existed. A new heaven and earth will be brought in, the first having no place. The holy city will be found in perfect suitability to the whole scene, for she is described as New Jerusalem, and is seen in bridal beauty and adornment, the object of Christ's love eternally, and His everlasting glory. She is the centre of administration during His reign (for those who suffer with Him shall reign with Him). But she passes into the eternal state as perfectly suited to it.
The blessedness of those who are on the new earth consists in this, that God's tabernacle shall be with them, and He will dwell with them, they shall be His people, and He shall be with them their God. They are simply spoken of as men, for all the governmental distinctions which God has formed and recognised, even on the millennial earth, shall no longer have place. They shall be one complete, happy company; happy with God's own presence. Not, as in Eden, when man was innocent and God visited him, but in the full intelligence of all that God is, as it has been demonstrated in His wonderful ways; and thus known and loved He will dwell with them. All that has marked the present course of things shall be abolished, death, sorrow, crying, pain, and God Himself shall have wiped away all tears from their eyes.
{366}
Now, the overcomer shall inherit these things. God has not only exposed for us all the workings of evil in this world, and shown us their judgment; but He has also given us a sight of all that He is about to establish. So that, strengthened and deeply stirred in our souls, we may rise superior to all that surrounds us at the present time. As these eternal things are before us, all man's glory becomes dim, and we grow independent of all man's resources. We find all our springs in that blessed God who triumphs over all the power of evil, and who will bring in everlasting blessing and glory. He was not ashamed to be called the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who waited for the city which He has founded, and who were content to be strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Thus also, is He the God of the overcomer, who is to Him a son.
Oh, for eyes which look steadily upon the things which are not seen, and hearts that love the things which are eternal! One has said, "Our momentary and light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal" (@2 Corinthians 4: 17, 18).
(8) THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST
@2 Corinthians 5
There are two great lines of truth running through Scripture which are never confounded, but ever kept distinct. One of these is the maintenance of man's
{367}
responsibility; the other is the setting forth of God's purpose concerning us. In our present chapter both are found, for the judgment seat of Christ is the end of man's course in responsibility on earth, while a man in Christ is new creation according to the purpose of God.
When man was first formed he was placed on earth in responsibility to God, and this was signified by the commandment which he received concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Man's sin, which so quickly followed, was failure in responsibility; and not only so, but the principle of sin finding a place in him, the fulfilment of his responsibility was rendered difficult, for he had entered upon the path of self-will, in which he sought his own pleasure, in the neglect of God's will.
When God's gracious work begins in our souls we are led to repentance in regard to our sins. Then, though we may be assured of the forgiveness of our sins, we begin to feel the contrariety of the flesh to God, as it is said in @Romans 8, that the mind of the flesh is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. All our thoughts and motives, in the flesh, whatever our outward appearance may be, are essentially opposed to God. Then it is that we begin to appreciate the value of the gift of the Spirit, by whom we may be morally apart from all that we are in the flesh, as it is said, "*Ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you" (@Romans 8: 9). When we have learned this important lesson, instead of relying upon the natural energy of our own mind and strength, we rely upon the power of the Spirit, and thus it is that the righteous requirement of the law (the measure of man's responsibility) is fulfilled in us.
{368}
Man has naturally no power to fulfil it, for sin has too far depraved him; nor did the law give power for its fulfilment, for it was only a righteous measure of man's responsibility; but it becomes fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. The Spirit is the energy of those who once were slaves of sin, but who, having been liberated, have become servants of righteousness, and of God. Their liberation has been brought about by the coming to them of all the marvellous light of God, and rejoicing in that light they seek to do God's will, and find power for this in the Spirit whom they have received.
Yet the Spirit has not come to revive man after the flesh. On the contrary, His presence is the sign to us that the flesh has no place with God; and He maintains us in righteousness, only by the refusal of all that is of the flesh. As the Spirit of Christ, He is the spirit of the second Man, and He forms us in all that is of Christ. In this way we pass from the thought of the fulfilment of righteous requirement here upon earth, to that of a new order of things which is according to the purpose of God. We cannot, if we would, remain ever upon the earth, for the power of the Spirit, by whom alone we walk righteously, is connected with the acceptance of death as that which is upon all men, and as that into which our precious Saviour has come on our behalf. But God is forming a new creation, in which all things are of Himself, and the Spirit forms Christ in us, not merely for present requirement, but for the enjoyment of a sphere of new creation.
In this epistle the apostle has spoken of the new covenant in which is set forth that which God is toward us.
{369}
The glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ. Every moral attribute of God, and the truth of His nature, having been expressed in the lowly life and service of Jesus on earth; that expression culminating in His death where all was fully vindicated; is now seen in triumphant repose in Him where He now is. The light of it had shone into the apostle's heart, that he might be a vessel of testimony to it here on earth. It was a wonderful treasure to be placed, as it was, in an earthen vessel, which, humanly speaking, might have been broken up in the tribulations through which he was caused to pass; but he was sustained by the surpassing power of God. In this chapter he makes his boast of what is before him even should death intervene. There is a building from God eternal in the heavens, in contrast with this present frail tabernacle-house; and for the moment, if absent from the body, he will be present with the Lord. He was therefore always confident. He was willing rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord.
Then comes another thing. In thinking of the Lord's presence, which he would gladly reach, he thinks also of the Lord's pleasure, and it is this which brings into view the judgment seat of Christ. At this we must all appear, that each may receive the things done in the body, according to that which he has done, whether good or evil. It is important that every christian should be clear that no question of his guilt can arise at that judgment seat. The One whose seat it is has Himself suffered and died for our sins, and has been raised for our justification. Even now the believer is, by God, held perfectly cleared of guilt, and the sign of it to faith is the resurrection of Jesus our Lord
{370}
from the dead. Every righteous claim has been met in His death, in which God has been glorified, and His resurrection is the proof of this. If we gaze upon the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, no disquieting influence can arise, for we are assured of the love which God cherishes toward His own. Moreover, God has given to us His Holy Spirit, which He could not have done, had we not been cleared in His sight. But while all this is known to the believer, it is not yet put into open manifestation. The world knows nothing of the resurrection of our Lord, nor does it take account of the presence of the Spirit. For the present, therefore, all that is before the eye of God and of faith, is hidden from the world. But it will all come into display, and previous to this we shall be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, where everything will come under review, and the divine estimate of everything will be made known.
We may be perfectly sure that the judgment seat of Christ will fully confirm that which we have, in mind, already come to, that is, that righteousness is not found with the first man and his seed. It does not lie in the flesh. Everything, therefore, that has had its spring in ourselves will find no favour there. Whatever there may have been of guilt in it has been borne by Christ; but all that has had its spring in the Spirit will find approval, and this is that in which the believer even now finds his delight. The apostle could say, "We ... have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences". He waited not for the actual judgment seat to make all manifest, for he had already come to it in mind, and if the conscience of the saints was formed
{371}
according to divine judgment, the true character of his course must also appear to them.
It is well for us to get outside the thought of man's judgment, and to be in the light of the righteousness of God, according to which will be the judgment at the seat of Christ. As it is so, all that man naturally esteems will have no place with us, being abominable to God. In our weakness, seeking to walk in the power of the Spirit, we shall be greatly encouraged in the consciousness of the Lord's approval, which may be secretly ours now, and shall be openly ours in that day when each shall have praise from God. Thus, freed from any burden in our spirits which might otherwise connect itself with the thought of our responsibility to God, we may enter into the blessedness of all the purpose of God concerning us, as being consciously in the love of Christ.

{373}
LAWS OF THE KINGDOM
A M HAYWARD
@Matthew 5: 1 - 6; @Matthew 6: 9 - 14; @Matthew 7: 1; @Matthew 20: 6 - 10; @Matthew 22: 11 - 14; @Matthew 25: 6 - 10
I thought we might look into the thoughts relating to the saints viewed as a "holy nation". What I have particularly in mind is what one might call the laws governing the people of God. The first, in chapter 5, is what one might speak of as the *law of prosperity*. Prosperity as marking a kingdom, or nation, must lie on recognised lines. In chapter 6 we have the *law of petitions*. Petitions have to be made according to order. In any nation that is so. In chapter 7 we have the *law governing our relations* with one another. In chapter 20 we have the *law of promotion*. In chapter 22 there is the *rule for the habiliments* -- the dress. And the scripture read in chapter 25 might be referred to as showing the great objective or end.
One uses the term prosperity in connection with chapter 5 because it calls those marked by certain features "blessed". It is the way of prosperity. God is over His people for blessing, but the blessing comes on divinely assigned lines. It begins with "Blessed are the poor in spirit". It is so contrary to nature to be poor in spirit. It comes out supremely in Christ. Think of the Lord here, of who He was! Think of the majesty of His Person, that He could claim to be equal with God, for He *was* God! -- yet found in fashion as a Man, looking up to heaven and saying to Jehovah, "my goodness extendeth not to thee; --
{374}
To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said, In them is all my delight" (@Psalm 16: 2, 3). Think of that language! -- language which we would not attribute to the Lord were it not in the Scriptures! The apostle says to the Corinthians, "If any one think that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know it" (@1 Corinthians 8: 2). That is the reverse of "poor in spirit". "Poor in spirit", is beautifully exemplified in the apostle, when he says, "*I* do not count to have got possession myself" (@Philippians 3: 13). You might say, Paul, what is there you have not attained to? But he would not count himself to have got possession; he would forget the things behind, and stretch out towards the things before, "towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (verse 14). He was a man "poor in spirit", who said of a truth that he counted himself less than the least of all saints. I know of nothing more testing, nothing more exacting, than to measure oneself honestly thus. It was no poetic utterance of Paul's; no frenzy of excitement; it was a sober, considered judgment, that he was less than the least of all saints. With what dignity he must have clothed the saints! How great they were before his eyes! What an entire effacement of self it shows! He was a man who had seen Christ, and who could say of himself that *he* was crucified with Christ. He had seen such a display of himself in the crucifixion of Christ, that he was glad to disappear in that crucifixion. Crucifixion, one has said, is not so much to emphasise death, as exposure and shame. He had seen himself *exposed* in the cross of Christ. There was only one thing that Saul desired as becoming Paul (that is, little), and that was that Saul should never be seen again! He says
{375}
henceforth, "for me to live is Christ" (@Philippians 1: 21). It is the line of prosperity to be "poor in spirit;" always conscious of the vastness of the knowledge of God that lies beyond the extremely minute apprehension of the very greatest of us. Such is the man the Lord calls "blessed".
Then, "Blessed they that mourn". It is in the plural, but it has to be taken up individually. It is a feature of the holy nation. I wonder if we have mourned! You say, I lost my mother, and I mourned. Well, the Lord would be sympathetic with you in that, but that is not what He is speaking of here. It is those who feel in their spirits, and mourn over what is lacking Godward. They look at the meetings of God's people and, without being critical, they consider how small the measure of what is for God, and they mourn. They look at the prayer meeting; they look at the attendance on the Lord's day as compared with other times, and they mourn the lack; they feel it intensely. They feel for God. The Lord, as He passed through this scene, did so as One marked by sorrows, so that "his visage was so marred more than any man" (@Isaiah 52: 14). He was characterised by mourning. He did not pass through this scene critically, but He felt for God. He could not look upon a cripple without feeling for God, for a cripple could not enter God's temple for praise. He had compassion on the cripple, but He felt for God. The man whose hand was withered could not serve God; the man who was deaf and dumb could not praise God. As He brought relief to such, His visage was marred by the intense reality of His sufferings as He felt these effects of sin. For thirty years God had watched Him; He had seen His spirit and His feelings; He had seen Him marked by intense sympathy
{376}
manward and intense feeling Godward. No wonder God could commit Himself to Christ. "All that he doeth prospereth" (@Psalm 1: 3). God opened the heavens upon Him, the Holy Spirit came down with complacency and abode upon Him. It is good to mourn; it is the way of prosperity. It is not good to complain, or to criticise, or to get habitually depressed. A discouraged and depressed person is useless in the assembly, for he is looking at himself. But it is right to mourn. What you mourn over, God will give you power to deal with, so that the things that are lacking may be made good. He would bless such a person, and blessing means prosperity. It is not, however, a mourning without hope, for those that mourn and carry things in their hearts before God will see results.
So the Lord says, "Blessed the meek". God will stand by a meek man. How He stood by Jesus, when assailed on every side by the scribes and Pharisees -- able and powerful men who on every side laid snares in His path! But He trusted in God to deliver Him, He was characterised by meekness. What I understand by meekness is the reverse of pushing oneself. If a thing does not go, a meek man waits on God. He says something in a meeting and no one follows it up. He makes a proposal and it is turned down. He waits on God. That man will prosper; he will come through. The Lord, at every step of His way was opposed by men, but He prospered. He did not force the position. How easily He could have forced things! Instead of that, He says, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-
{377}
pleasing in thy sight" (@Matthew 11: 25, 26). He was triumphant over all that was externally against Him, and He praises. What a blessing it is to have God with us! "What great nation is there that hath God near to them as Jehovah our God is in everything we call upon him for?" (@Deuteronomy 4: 7). What a nation! What a God! "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes". We want these babes; they are the beginning of a new generation. It will be small, but if it is the beginning of a new generation, it is something God can work with and develop, on lines which ensure that the glory of the great King will be maintained, which is the great objective a holy nation has before it.
In chapter 6 we come to the *law of petitions*. I wonder sometimes that we get our petitions answered, they are often so lacking as to order. If a petition is taken to the courts of this world, and is not presented in the due order, it is non-suited, and you have had your trouble and expense for nothing. The Lord says, "Thus therefore pray *ye*", and He also says, "use not vain repetitions" (verse 7). We do well to pay heed to that. If one brother has asked for a thing in so many terms, we do not want to repeat it. There may be something we can add to the requests by way of enlargement -- but "use not vain repetitions". But "Thus therefore pray *ye*: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified". Whatever we are going to ask for, we begin with "Our Father who art in the heavens". The consideration of *His name* will greatly regulate our petitions. We want the Father's name to stand out as sanctified from all other names; we want to begin at the top. We should practise it at the prayer meetings. Is there
{378}
nothing to ask of the Father in the heaven that His name might be sanctified? Think of the greatness of heaven, and then of the name Father. Think of the intensity of His interest in man; think of all His interests vested in the assembly here. We want that name made great. Then follows, "Thy kingdom come". Every subject will be searched, if we think of "Thy kingdom come". How is it to come if not in us? "Thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth". It is a searching prayer -- first, that the Father's name might be made great; and, secondly, that we might be in order, as subject under the hand of the Lord. If the prosperity of the kingdom is to be promoted, it must be promoted through His people. Think of the chariots of God, even thousands of angels, waiting on the blessed God! There is but the slightest word on His part, and these attendants carry out His bidding. "His eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men" (@Psalm 11: 4). That would bring about very tender feelings and sensitiveness as to the will of God -- "Thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth". How long earth and heaven have been divorced, and how the heart of God has grieved over it! Now there is a spot on earth where heaven and earth are brought together. It is in the assembly, which is the house of God, the gate of heaven; where the divorced conditions no longer exist, but where God and His pleasure hold sway.
"Give us today our needed bread". How simple the affairs of our life become after this! Could anyone who prayed on the lines of this prayer move out of relation to the assembly for his bread? Do you think God forgets His people, or that He will not satisfy them with bread? The
{379}
enemy sought to turn the Lord on this point, but He had come here to do the will of God. He was forty days without anything. We have never been forty days without food. "Afterwards he hungered", we read (@Matthew 4: 2 - 4). "If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread", said the tempter. He knew the Lord had but to speak; but His answer is, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth". All the bread in the world would never keep us alive spiritually, and we become lawless apart from "every word which goes out through God's mouth". No word from God would take you away from the assembly. I am not speaking of what I have not experienced. If we will face these things in our youth, we shall know as we get older that "Give us today our needed bread" is all we need to pray in such matters. So that is the order -- first, that the Father's name be sanctified; then for His kingdom; after that our matters, and then for forgiveness -- "forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors". That does not mean you forget your bills. Bills have to be paid, both *to* me and *by* me, but if we have been offended, let us forgive. *We* shall need forgiveness sooner or later if the Lord sees fit to leave us here. James says, "For we all often offend" (@James 3: 2). All of us come under this. We are inclined to say, It must be put right; but the *must* is, it must be *forgiven*. If I do not forgive my brother, the Lord will not forgive me.
Then, "lead us not into temptation, but save us from evil". That is an important part of our prayer. It comes right down to all the conditions of life -- whether our business, or the children at school; whether it is a matter of
{380}
going to this place or that; or whether it is taking up anything in relation to the Lord's interests. We still need this prayer, that we might be delivered from temptation, that we might not be put in a place too difficult for us. The Lord knows our spiritual stature, and our requests are to be in accord with the stature which He knows. He has put it there. It is beautiful to reach the stature of the psalmist, who says, "Neither do I exercise myself ... in things too wonderful for me. Surely I have restrained and composed my soul, like a weaned child with its mother" (@Psalm 131: 1, 2). How often we try things too high for us in matters of the kingdom, it may be, as the holy nation, but only to disgrace the kingdom, for if what we do breaks down, it brings dishonour on the holy nation, and on the name of God.
Now in chapter 7 the Lord speaks of a very simple law of relationship. "Judge not, that ye may not be judged". It is not a case of wickedness here. Wickedness must be judged. There are plenty of scriptures to tell us that wickedness must be judged. This is our relationship with one another as walking together. James says, "He that speaks against his brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if thou judgest the law, thou art not doer of the law, but judge. One is the lawgiver and judge" (@James 4: 11, 12), and that is God. "Who art *thou* who judgest thy neighbour?" (@James 4: 12). That is to check the critical tendency with us. It would preserve from a lot of interfering with one another. If I can do a thing and you cannot, let me do it, and let you desist, and let us both give thanks to God. That is clearly laid out for us in @Romans 14. A weak brother may not be able to
{381}
do a certain thing; let him desist, and give God thanks. If one is stronger, he can do it, and does so, and he also is to give God thanks. So they go on together. It is a most important item in the law governing our relations with one another as brethren. No one carried it out like the Lord. "Behold my servant ... mine elect in whom my soul delighteth" (@Isaiah 42: 1). Better to go on with God, leaving things to Him, or, if need be, taking them to Him. It is His nation, and they His people; it is for Him to judge. There is one Judge, says James. If I begin to judge, I am putting myself in the place of God. It is an important scripture, and it must have full place with us. It needs liberty such as is proper to believers, for if I am legal I shall be inclined to judge my brother, and the sooner I get free of legality the better. The great remedy for legality is sonship, which lies behind the thought of the nation as indicated in Matthew's gospel. Sons have great liberty; they know what they may do. "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 26). We have to walk before God in the enjoyment of His thoughts. If there is wickedness, it has to be judged, and if we mourn, God will bring it to light. Nothing passes among His people that is unsuitable to Himself, without His taking account of it.
Then there is promotion, chapter 20. Every one in a nation looks for promotion. The idea of a nation is not that anybody sits down and takes what comes along, but that each in it performs an active part. It is a corporate body, having laws that regulate the privileges and the responsibilities of every individual. So that we have our part to do if we want to be promoted. There is nothing happier, nothing more delightful to the saints of God, than
{382}
to see someone promoted, and the way of promotion is very simple spiritually, but very difficult according to the flesh. It involves coming to the consciousness in our souls that we are not even worth hiring! The labourers had stood in the market-place all day long, and no one wanted them, and they accepted it. The fact is, there is a great deal of reduction needed with each of us before we can serve as chosen ones. Our lot is cast in a peculiarly propitious time, at the end of a dispensation when things are in much weakness. Only in the sense of this can we rightly serve. But He delights to call, from time to time, those who feel in their own souls they are not worth hiring. One can understand how standing thus idle would bring each in his own spirit to acknowledge the fact that that is his proper valuation -- that he is *worthless*! That is the kind of person the Lord promotes. Have you a desire to serve the Lord? He says, "Go also ye into the vineyard and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive". When they come to be paid, they each receive the same amount, and those that were called at the last minute find themselves ranking with the first. They did not expect to find that. What an encouragement in these eleventh-hour days, when all is exceedingly weak, that God will take account of the conditions in which we have laboured! He knows how to measure us, and the conditions in which we are set, and He will render to all in accordance with His grace. I think that those who will submit themselves as under the hand of the Lord as worthless, but nevertheless available, will find that He will send them into His vineyard. He gives them something to do, for He delights to promote those that move downwards in their own esteem; they are such as He
{383}
*chooses*. There should not be anyone in the assembly who has not anything to do. The assembly is a body of persons labouring to a definite issue, and every one should have something to do, whilst in our spirits we should feel ourselves worthless. Remember that every one of us has received grace from Christ.
Think of the greatness of Christ. He led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men according to His wisdom. You have grace; the one sitting next to you has grace; we all have grace. The whole question is whether we will use it in the sense of our worthlessness, but as cast upon the grace of the Lord. There is no bargaining, but full confidence in the husbandman -- "Whatsoever may be just ye shall receive". But when the day came for settlement, they found how gracious, how large the outlook of the husbandman, and how they were further promoted. They were found to rank with those who had laboured in the heat and burden of the day. He closes that example with what comes in twice in Matthew: "many are called ones, but few chosen ones" (verse 16). Would you not like to be one of the chosen ones? All christendom is outwardly in the position of being called. For they profess to be in the position of labourers. We certainly cannot do other than admit *we* are called -- but few are chosen. Thus the heart of God comes out. He finds delight in a people who write themselves down as worthless, who are willing to serve in the vineyard; not those who say they cannot do anything, but those who are conscious of their worthlessness, but are nevertheless ready to serve the Lord. Every Lord's day we take the bread of which He says, "this is my body". Think of how in that body He served us! What can we do in
{384}
return but serve, worthless though we may be? The Lord has served us, even unto death!
In @Matthew 22 we have the habiliments of the nation. We are not to dress as we like. God was very particular about the dress of His people -- even the tassels on the garment were specified (@Numbers 15: 38, 39). One looks round on the brethren and wonders a little sometimes, as to the habiliments -- not that one would criticise, but there are things that pain. The great feature about the wedding garment is that we disappear and Christ appears. The movements, the deportment, the speech, the manner of life, even the material manner of dress, are all to be such as honour the King's Son. No other habiliments are accepted in the holy nation. Every one of us knows that the natural tendency of our hearts is to endeavour to leave with others a good impression of ourselves. But let it be an impression of Christ, and not an impression of ourselves! Books are written on how to leave a good impression of oneself. The only impression left by those who are chosen persons, who have come to the marriage feast according to God, as having on the wedding garment, is that they have come to it with this understanding in their hearts, that there is only one Person to be made great whilst here on earth, and that is the King's Son. We wait the day when God will fill this scene with the glory and beauty of Christ, but our testimony now is to His excellence. Our deportment, our habiliments -- in other words, the wedding garment -- are to indicate that our concern is to make great the King's Son. Great detail is given in the New Testament as to actual dress. How we naturally love to adorn ourselves! If we put on anything that is not necessary for dress, it is adornment
{385}
(see @1 Peter 3). It is calling attention to oneself instead of to Christ. The wedding garment would be the whole exterior as seen in our school, at our business, or in our home life, and in the assembly. Our one concern would be to make our Lord Jesus Christ great.
Christ's object here was to make nothing of Himself, but everything of God; whether it was in His contact with the Jews, or among His disciples. Whether it was amongst wicked men, or whether it was in His teachings and utterances, His one concern was to make God great. They challenged Him whether they should pay tribute to Caesar, and He brings them to the one great point. He says, "Pay then what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God" (@Matthew 22: 21). How that must have cut home! There is what is due to this one and that one, according to the government of God down here, but above all, to God -- "Pay ... what is God's to God".
There was one man at the marriage without the wedding garment; he had no regard for that kind of thing. I trust there is no one here like that. He represents those who take a place in the profession of christianity, but have no interest in magnifying the King's Son. He was only thinking about himself. We may not go so far as to have *no* concern as to Christ, but do not let us be on that road. It leads to darkness. "Bind him feet and hands, and take him away, and cast him out into the outer darkness". How solemn to be bound in the presence of the light. It speaks of those who have professed christianity, and have handled christian things, but who disregard God's provision in Christ. We do not want to be tainted by any feature that
{386}
calls for "outer darkness", for "there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth".
The great objective of the holy nation is the coming of the Lord in manifestation. Many are occupied with the rapture, but that is not exactly what the assembly waits for. We show forth His death "till he come" -- I do not think that is the rapture. Every lover of Christ wants to see Him have His rights. The true rendering of @Matthew 25: 6 is not 'the bridegroom *cometh*', but "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him". Though going forth to meet Him involves His coming, attention is called to Himself. Our affections are to be cultivated and true to Christ, so that there might be a people here whose hearts long and wait for Him to have His rights. We are not to be like people of this world, looking for better days. Prosperous days do not help us to go forth. There is only one thing that will satisfy those who love Christ -- the Bridegroom Himself! What a day that is for the heart of Christ, when He sees a soul stepping out thus to Him! The lamps are for Christ, to show the way, so to speak, for the Bridegroom. In the day of His power, He will find a willing people. He comes amongst those who are waiting for Him in affection. Our attitude is to be that of a people who wait to see Christ reigning here in glory, but by faith we see Him now as glorified. If anyone is asked, Why do you not take part in this or that? our answer should be, Christ has not taken part in it yet. What about recreation? Young people say, we must have our recreation. Well, I would reply, that day has not come yet. I am going to have a thousand years of recreation when Christ comes into the scene! The great day is dawning -- the millennial day, when "nation shall
{387}
not lift up sword against nation, ... And they shall sit every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree" (@Micah 4: 3, 4). How can we enjoy ourselves, while He *waits* the day of His rest? We want to recognise in our hearts today that this is not the day for ease, it is the day of labour, in order that the great issue may be brought about. The conditions of God's people are to be such that their lamps are burning, so that Christ may come in and enter into His glory. The virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. They are diligent to have everything in accord with Himself that He may come quickly.
So, to refer to chapter 26: 30: "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". The mount of Olives suggests the known sphere of the Spirit, a sphere of holy elevation, but as still down here we can find support to carry out the laws of the kingdom.
May the Lord help us, for His name's sake!

THE TERMS UPON WHICH GOD IS WITH US
A M HAYWARD
@Deuteronomy 5: 1 - 29
I thought, beloved brethren, we might consider in some detail the covenant, as setting forth the terms upon which God is pleased to be with us in public relationship, so that we may be here practically as His people, and He as our God. He *is* our God. He has taken that place in His grace; but what I want to dwell upon in connection with this setting forth of His terms, is the way in which the value of that may be secured and maintained for all His beloved people. As we look upon the saints as a whole it is not very manifest that God is their God, or that they are His people.
If a people professedly stand in relation to God, and God says He will be their God, it is a public matter and should be manifest that they are His people. It is like a man taking a woman as wife, and he is for her and she is for him. It is a publicly avowed position; and such is the position which God has been pleased to take in relation to His people. It is, therefore, for us, individually and collectively, to consider how far God is seen as our God, in the place where we live. How far can men take account of us as being God's people in the place where we are found? -- not merely that we profess something, but that they have to acknowledge that somehow or other that man or that woman gets through, and that not by human strength or ability, but because God is our God, and we are
{390}
His people. I think it should touch every one of our hearts that God, having brought us out of Egypt, out of the bondage of the world, out of darkness, and from under the power of sin, has brought us into liberty. He has granted us rest of heart, and peace of soul, that He might say to us, I want you for Myself. The only way we can be for Him is upon the terms which are laid down for us in this scripture. We may be inclined to relegate this to what we speak of as the Old Testament period, but there are no headings 'Old Testament' or 'New Testament' in relation to the inspired writings -- these are merely human titles. All are "the scriptures". The Lord referred to them as such; the apostle Paul referred to them as "the scriptures". We do well to do so also. There is as much authority behind Deuteronomy, as the Revelation. Scripture stands as one. As the Lord says, if you break one item, you break the whole. They cannot be broken. As to the reading of them, we have to read them intelligently. Deuteronomy is a most interesting section. It is the book in which God would set before us how He will support us and bless us on certain conditions, as having received grace and blessing from Himself. It is spoken not from Sinai, though it does not set Sinai aside, but from Horeb. We do well to consider and bow down at the greatness and the terrors of the God of Sinai. "Our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12: 29). Paul said; "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men" (@2 Corinthians 5: 11). Grace and love have been presented to such excess, that we may almost forget the holiness, majesty, and terror of our God. That is connected with Sinai, and it stands. There is no alteration of Sinai as indicating God's greatness and majesty. God has not
{391}
changed; God cannot change, though His approach to us in Christ provides, as in mount Zion, very different conditions.
Here we have Horeb, and a considerable difference is indicated there, typically, in the people, but not in God. There is an immense change in the people, which is brought about typically through the death of Christ and the work of the Spirit. Three times there is this touching expression between the first and fifth chapters of Deuteronomy: "Jehovah was angry with me on your account". Christ had to bear the wrath, and to meet the majesty and holiness, and the righteous requirements of our God, who, as has been said, remains unchanged. When Moses says, "Jehovah was angry with me on your account" (@Deuteronomy 1: 37), there is no mention of his speaking unadvisedly with his lips. That is not under consideration in Deuteronomy. This book views the people that, in flesh, could never come into the blessing of God, but in order that they might do so, Christ, typified in Moses, had to die. This is presented in a threefold way. First, that one generation might be removed and another of a different order brought about -- "Ye ... are alive every one of you this day" (@Deuteronomy 4: 4) -- how delightful! It came about through the death of Christ. There could be none alive that is marked by movement, or affection for, or appreciation of, God, except for the death of Christ. It is after He has spoken of the judgment of one generation and that their children would come into the inheritance, that he says, "Jehovah was angry with me on your account". Secondly, the flesh was incapable of appreciating God or Christ, and that is met by the Spirit. The flesh is always to be met by
{392}
the Spirit, not by altering it or suppressing it, but by the Spirit. There is no way of changing it. Trying to reckon yourself dead to yourself is useless. You reckon yourself "dead to sin" (@Romans 6: 11), that is, to the world's system practically. So, again, Moses says, after meeting Sihon and Og and overthrowing them -- after they have secured territory, figuratively, in the power of the Holy Spirit, "Jehovah was wroth with me on your account" (chapter 3: 26). Thirdly, in taking them up for Himself as His inheritance, Moses says again, "Jehovah was angry with me on your account" (chapter 4: 21). Christ had to die that we might become an inheritance for God. God could not have an inheritance in dying men and women. He has an inheritance that was secured for Him by the death of Christ.
That is the setting -- a people of a new generation. It is wonderful to think of it. "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 17). Are you in Christ? What cannot God do with a man in Christ? He took a man like that up to the third heaven: there is no limit to a man that is in Christ. The very first feature that marks him is entire liberty -- liberty from the law of sin and death. If you have the Spirit of God, God has transferred you from Adam to Christ. You are in Christ. You are entitled so to take account of yourself. "So also *ye*, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus" (@Romans 6: 11). That is the great standpoint from which we can view with equanimity the proposals which God has to make to His people. The covenant is made at Horeb; "not ... with our fathers but with us".
{393}
We may look along the line of our origin in flesh, and deplore it, but God is not occupied with that. He says, I am speaking to you "who are alive". It comes to every one of us that is spiritually alive this day. We have heard God speak. We all ought to know what it is to hear God speak from the fire. Have you never trembled to hear God speak from the midst of the fire? Think of the intensity of the furnace of affliction in which Christ suffered on the cross! It is out of that that God spoke in His love, to declare His love to us in the death of His Son. He spoke from the furnace, from death! Think of the sufferings through which He had to pass! All that He had to take upon Himself in the condemnation of sin in the flesh, in order to bring about through the Spirit given, a new generation that could respond to the heart of God. He spoke out of the midst of the fire, and we begin to apprehend that we can face the righteous requirements of God -- but not in ourselves. Moses said, "I stood between Jehovah and you at that time". I believe God has great pleasure in our recognising Christ as appointed by Him, so that we look to Him in every distress, and as looking upon Him we can see all that the blessed God is. On the one hand, we see all the holy requirements of God perfectly met in Him, and, on the other, we see Him as He perfectly sustains us in relation to God. If we were to come into the presence of God in conditions of sinful flesh and blood, there could be nothing for us but destruction, but we can be maintained in the grace of the Mediator. His power, as Mediator, is indicated in @2 Corinthians 3: 18. He is "the Lord the Spirit". He represents all the authority of God as Lord, and has the power to write upon us as the Spirit, the very requirements
{394}
that are demanded by God. Hence we do well to look upon the Mediator.
The Lord has prepared fleshy tables in our hearts, corresponding to the stones Moses made (@Exodus 34: 1), and has written on them. There never would have been fleshy tables in our hearts unless they had been prepared by Christ. You have never found them in your heart, except as the product of Christ. If there is anything impressed on your hearts by what is revealed in Christ, it has come about by the work of the Lord the Spirit. The One who represents, in full, God's authority, has also the power to exercise it; to bring us into accord with that which that authority demands. The writing is deepened as we give Christ, as Mediator, greater acceptance in our hearts. We go to Him with difficulty after difficulty, and prostrate ourselves at His feet. We find how great He is, and then, as we behold His glory, we take on His image. The result is we move on from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit. It is having to do personally with Christ. It is not ministry exactly; it is not reading the Scriptures exactly; that will not effect it. It is not exactly prayer, though all these are necessary. It is occupation with Christ, who has the power to enable us to stand in the presence of all that God is, and, on the other hand, who is able to write upon us, so that we correspond to Him, as revealed.
So Moses is taking them up on that ground. You need not be afraid of that ground. He goes back to the beginning and reviews their history. @Romans 5: 8 gives us the beginning of the covenant line. The apostle goes back to the beginning, "we being still sinners, Christ has died for
{395}
us". It is not what we preach exactly; it is what we teach. It is not addressed to sinners; it is to us who are alive this day. "God commends *his* love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us". You can understand something of the meaning of the "waste" in @Genesis 1: 2. What a waste it must have been as God looked upon our hearts! He falls back on His own resources in the Mediator. Christ died for us, and God in that commends His love to us. We do well to meditate upon the love of God thus expressed; it is so entirely unmerited.
I think that is the first thing He would bring to bear upon us. What could there be in sinners that would in any way move the heart of God? He would take us back to that, as the character of the love we have to do with. He *commends* such a love to us. Christ died for us. There is no need for anyone to be disappointed if they find they have not moved on the lines they thought they were going to do; or if they find they have failed; or that they have been untrue to the Christ that has died for them. Not that one would make little of it, but they need not be despondent. Disappointment means that, after all, we connected some merit with ourselves. There was a time when things were worse than that -- "we being still sinners", and then He commended His love to us! But if that love is to be constantly enjoyed by us, the conditions must be maintained. That is the great value of the covenant teaching -- that the conditions might be maintained so that the heart of God, as open to us in Christ, might have full flow. So far as He is concerned, it has had the most manifest outpouring in the death of Christ. The same chapter -- @Romans 5: 5 -- tells us, "hope does not make
{396}
ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit". We need not be afraid of tribulations even, for they lead into the love of God. If the love of God has been expressed in the midst of the fire -- in the sufferings of Christ, we may depend upon it, it must be enjoyed on the line of suffering.
The apostle says, "we also boast in tribulations" (verse 3). When you find that someone who owes you money is bankrupt, or there are difficulties in the family, do you boast in it? I do not say *I* boast in tribulation, though I think I can say I have learned to be thankful for it. The apostle says we boast in it because tribulation brings endurance, which is such an essential thing if we are going to learn the love of God. Endurance brings about experience. You begin to understand how things work, which is a great asset in a scene of complexity. Experience results in hope -- in buoyancy. As we get older, difficulties may become greater, but we should become more buoyant; we are not cast down. Experience has taught us to hope, and hope has a *present* recompense, filling the heart with the love of God, for "hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". That is all very blessed, and those are the conditions which, so to speak, God wants to further with us. As far as He is concerned, He has poured out His Spirit, and He wants each one of our hearts to be filled with Him. We read of a man filled with the Spirit, in Acts. It means that nothing else had any place in Stephen -- nothing else had any claim, nothing else had priority -- God stands out with him as the only God.
{397}
This, in effect, is the first of the terms laid down by God for us -- "Thou shalt have no other gods before me". What about your business? What about your wife? What about your family? We get up in the morning. We say, I must get to business; and we are late, so perhaps we start with a hasty, or no, prayer, or reading. That, if continued as a habit, means that God is not allowed His proper place; some part of the heart is screened from the love of God! It is essential that He has the supreme place. No man can serve two masters; he will love the one and hate the other. If there is anything else that has a claim upon me, there will be movement in that direction. If we make business, or our families, so important that what is of God must be set aside, we may depend upon it, it is a rival to God. We rush to business thinking we must start to do this at once, and we may take half a day to do what God would enable us to do in half an hour. I believe this is a keystone to the enjoyment of the covenant, namely, that in all things *God* gets the first consideration. Perhaps some matter comes up that will affect one we are partial to, and we say, I could not think of supporting anything that adversely affects him. But the first thing is, how does it affect God? People may say things about us which are trying; though actually they can never say anything bad enough, if we only know ourselves in the flesh; but the real point is -- has anything been said against God? Is there anything with us active against God as contrary to this item of the covenant?
The welling up of the whole heart is what God counts upon in His love. God, seeing the weakness of flesh, sent His Son as Ambassador of His love, to deal with the flesh. He sent Him forth after thirty years of secret life before
{398}
Him, as His constant joy and delight. He sent Him forth to serve, and, in that service, to die! He sent His own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin and for sin, that He might condemn sin in the flesh. That does not mean that He might prove it wrong. We all know it is wrong. He came to *end* it -- to condemn it, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us" (@Romans 8: 4), or, as we might say, that God might have the supreme place in our hearts. "Thou shalt have no other gods before me". Do you think Christ was not satisfied here? Do you think He found satisfaction anywhere but in God? When He was a Babe He began with God. Instead of trusting in nature, He said, "thou didst make me trust, upon my mother's breasts" (@Psalm 22: 9). When He was a Boy He trusted in God. He found His delight in His Father's business. It is put before us as the happiest, and the safest, and the most blessed path we can pursue. We are not to give God a little place, and ourselves a large place; or even to give God a large place, and ourselves a little place. We are to give God the whole place. He is a jealous God. The apostle raises the question of jealousy with the Corinthians, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?" (@1 Corinthians 10: 22). If God is in controversy with us, who is going to save us? "Our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12: 29). That is not poetic language; it is a solemn fact. If we come into conflict with God, we shall find He is a consuming fire.
"Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image". There is to be no settling down to formal statements. People sometimes say, I have believed that for thirty years, and I am not going to change that belief now. They have made an image; facts have become stereotyped. Think of
{399}
the living God -- how great He is! Do you think you are not going to gain fresh light every year? Think of God showing this view of Himself; and that view of Himself! The creeds are graven images which have utterly failed; indeed, they belie God. Every Lord's day is the time for getting a fresh impression from the Mediator. I believe the Lord is exceedingly active as the Mediator at the Supper. When we come to the cup, He wants those fleshy tables at His disposal. He wants to write upon them some new impression of the love of God. That is not a hard commandment. None of the commandments are hard. They flow from the very nature of God. "Oh that there were such a heart in them", God had to say. Thank God, there is such a heart in us. The apostle says, "We give thanks to God always for you all ... remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@1 Thessalonians 1: 2, 3). That is a new generation, begun in Christ. My joy is that I can speak to the people of God with the consciousness that there is something to appeal to. If any one be in Christ, there is a "new creation", and even to the Corinthians he can say, "But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30). "In Christ Jesus" is the kind of spiritual material of which the saints are composed. That is not tables of stone, but involves fleshy tables of the heart. It is something God can write upon by the Spirit, so that the person becomes more and more brought into accord with the image of God. God speaks very solemnly in this passage, for though His covenant goes on, He nevertheless visits "the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation". I do not think
{400}
grace has altered this one iota. As surely as anyone pursues a pathway in controversy with God, it will bear fruit to the third and fourth generation. I have seen traits go through three generations -- first the parents, then their children, and then their children's children. If only someone would cry to the Mediator! He is there; He is available, so that the thing might be judged, and the course of God's government would be stopped. For His covenant is for us, and if a heart is moved under the love of God, it moves to Him and finds *mercy*. If God brings us to face any features of the flesh in our hearts in relation to His love, it is because of His mercy. He has the rights of mercy, and they form part of His covenant. "Shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me", He says. You show you love Him by crying to Him through the Mediator. You hate the flesh like the man in @Romans 7. He loathed it, but who could deliver him from the body of this flesh? This unholy corrupt element that is bound to myself, but is not part of myself, as in Christ. The answer comes, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 7: 25). Immediately the Mediator puts out His hand and touches him, as indicated in, "There is then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus" (@Romans 8: 1). That is not a statement, or a doctrine; it is an experience. If you read it as a statement, you will not understand it, even though you read it thousands of times. It is the experience of one who comes under the touch of the Mediator.
"Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God". One seeks to remember that. Think of all the Lord said about God, yet when He was challenged as to who *He* was, He could say, "Altogether that which I also say to
{401}
you" (@John 8: 25). That was Christ. Do not let our language go beyond our experience. We take up the language of others; it may be unsuitable; it may not fit us. Ananias and Sapphira were the first who did it. They came in and made a great profession of being moved by the love of God, but they lied to the Spirit. If we give the impression to the saints that we are more with God than we are, we lie under the eye of God. Do not let us do it. If we want to grow, let our language be kept in accord with our experience.
"Keep the sabbath day to hallow it". There is nothing more precious than the sabbath day. There are six days in which to work. We have to pass through exercises; we are not always in rest. At every step, there is a fresh exercise. It means passing through experiences which in some way issue in our learning of death. We come at last to a point of rest, where we find everything really lies in the Mediator, and we submit ourselves to Him, and He writes in our hearts the love of God. The answer to every exercise is by death working in us, which involves the parting with something that stood in the way, and then, as putting ourselves unreservedly in the hands of the Mediator, He writes upon us the love of God, and there we can rest. It is lovely to see the saints of God in any place as Christ's epistle! In a wicked world where everything is getting worse, where they are plotting and planning against Christ, the character of God is manifested, and it is evident they rest in the God they know. That is the seventh day -- the sabbath. "Thou shalt not do any work". They make plain that all is *God's* work. What an influence it would have as
{402}
we come into the understanding of the love of God! Think of the effect upon others!
"Honour thy father and thy mother". That is necessary for anyone. It is necessary for children, but I do not suppose that is the only reason for which it is written. Do you honour your father? Do you give profound respect to the light that God gives? We need to give profound respect to all that God gives in the way of light. We are not to say, I think differently. That is entering into controversy with God. I am not suggesting that all ministry is infallible. The "father" thought refers to light especially. Sometimes we are together, perhaps in assembly, or in the care meeting, and light is brought in. Do you honour it? Or do you pull it to pieces outside? I speak of what I have seen -- alas, what I have done myself. It is light to direct our feet, like the counsel of a father, and it is to move us in a direction where the love of God may get a larger place with us. All these exercises are that God might be known as our God and we as His people. Then there is the "mother" side, the maternal exercises. Some think that is not so important. The maternal side is as important as the paternal. It is all-important in this day when all tends to independency. We need to give heed to the concern of our brethren. It does not mean that they are infallible. There may be times when you have to take a course that they question, and it may be according to God. But in the general run of cases, the maternal side is right. We do well to give heed to our brethren, for the Spirit of God dwells in them. This injunction will maintain us in the land. It will enlarge our inheritance. It will lengthen our days. It enlarges our capacity for the apprehension of the love of God.
{403}
"Thou shalt not kill". I need not say much about that. If I have a feeling against a brother or a sister, that is killing. John is absolute in handling things; he says, if you do not love, you hate. There is nothing in between. He that hates his brother is a murderer. You never find the Lord carrying a grudge. He looks upon them, and because of their hardness, He is angry. He has to tell the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Herodians what they are; but He dies for them. He gave Himself a ransom for all. He died for them as much as for any others. He held nothing in His heart against them.
"Neither shalt thou steal". I think we slip into that. We sometimes put out things that we have got from someone else, as if they were our own. Something comes to our memory, and we put it out. If it is someone else's let us say so. Our memory gives us an appearance of greater stature. It is like walking on stilts. The question is how much can I bring that I have from God. Memory has its value, and we can bring in what others have given us; but let us seek to get it in such a way that, as cultivated, it becomes our own. You see what the teaching is, down to covetousness.
What a thing to be preserved from covetousness. We read, "piety with contentment *is* great gain" (@1 Timothy 6: 6), because in such a case the love of God fills the heart, and there are no chambers which are a bar to the free flow of the Holy Spirit, and open to covetousness.
So Moses reviews all their history and the terms of the covenant, and the Lord would do the same with us from time to time, that we might have these experiences and be found in the free current of His love.
{404}
May God grant it to us for His name's sake!

SHEPHERDING
A M HAYWARD
@John 10: 1 - 4, 7 - 9, 11 - 16; @John 21: 1 - 19
One would look to the Lord for help in relation to what I have before me at this time -- the more so in that it is a subject which affects every one of us. It is not so much my thought to speak of the Lord as Shepherd, though one would not for a moment set that aside; but rather to take Him as Model from which *we* can learn how to shepherd. It is a responsibility that is put upon every brother and sister, that we should shepherd. I would base that on the scripture in John's epistle that "*we* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives" (@1 John 3: 16). There is no question of age or maturity from that standpoint. It is a broad statement that we *ought* to do so. It is an obligation resting upon every one of us, and it can be fulfilled only in shepherd character. I thought we could look at the Lord and take account of Him as the Model for any who would shepherd. He is the great Shepherd and Overseer of our souls. One would suppose every believer has some appreciation of the Lord's shepherd care; but it is another thing to exercise that shepherd care ourselves; and to be prepared to have it exercised in relation to ourselves. I have no question that where there is right shepherding, there is great prosperity. But it has to spring, first of all, from the feelings of Christ as begotten in us; and secondly, from an appreciation of the saints as to what they are to God. The apostle speaks of the household of Stephanas as
{406}
having "devoted themselves to the saints for service" (@1 Corinthians 16: 15). Now that is the practical spring, as you might say, of shepherd care -- devotion to the saints for service. The tendency is to be devoted to the service, and to have a care secondly for the saints, but the order is otherwise. I think it is that which the apostle Paul appealed to the Ephesian elders about, when he spoke of the assembly which God had "purchased with the blood of his own" (@Acts 20: 28). It was a strong appeal to the feelings of the elders at Ephesus, on the ground of the intense value which God set upon the saints. The idea of the assembly there is something which is valued, and which belongs to Another, and is to be cared for. Only Christ could speak of *His* sheep. No intelligent christian would speak of the people of God as his flock, although one hears of such expressions. The Lord only can speak of them as His sheep, and the apostle appeals to the elders at Ephesus on the ground that they are "the assembly of God", and that it has been purchased at the cost of "the blood of his own".
Now I want to point out certain features of shepherding. I am not going to occupy you with what is dispensational in @John 10, but just to gather up certain features, to show what is His opinion of His own. "He that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep". *Firstly*, evidently a true shepherd must come in by the door. That is an important element to remember. You get a young sister wanting to help another young sister, and a young brother wanting to help another young brother, and it is very good. How are you going to help them? We may give them advice from our experiences, or we may bring moral force to bear upon them, but that is not "the door". You
{407}
must enter by the door. It is of all importance, that I reach them through the Scriptures. I have no doubt myself that the door, viewed dispensationally -- the door the Lord came in by -- was the way indicated by the Scriptures. There could not be a flaw found in His manner of coming in. It was perfectly in accord with the Scriptures. If it were a question of where He was born, He was born, as the Scriptures said, in Bethlehem. He came from Nazareth, they thought, but He was born in Bethlehem. Every scripture as to the manner of His coming was fulfilled; and that is the first matter of importance, if we want to help one another. Let us be acquainted with the Scriptures; it is the Scriptures which give us entrance to the sheep.
The Spirit will always respond to the Scriptures. We may bring to bear what is perfectly right, and true, and serviceable, but unless supported by, and having the authority of, the Scriptures, we may doubt whether the Porter will open. It is the Porter who opens. There is nothing after all that *we* can effect in the hearts of one another; it depends upon the Spirit of God, as the Porter, opening. The Scriptures are a kind of pass-word; they have their own authority. We may advise certain things for help, but the credentials in support of that advice to any soul must be the Scriptures. To one coming thus, the Porter opens: he gets an entrance to souls by the door, and any so helped stand henceforth assured.
*Secondly*, the sheep "hear his voice". That is of great importance. If anyone hangs upon *me* as having received help, if a person gets attached to *me* because I have done something for him, I must have conducted the thing in a manner which is irregular. I have not done the service as a
{408}
true shepherd. The effect should be, whilst I admit there will be affection and respect for any vessel used, the *attachment* is not to you, but to Christ. You want them to hang on Christ. They "hear *his* voice". The voice means that the Person is there in presence. What a lovely service, to be able to give someone, by way of the Scriptures, a touch so that they hear Christ's voice! That is prophecy. "I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy ... your young men shall see visions" (@Joel 2: 28). The Lord delights in using the agility of young affections, that they may prophesy. The effect of prophesying is that, never mind what a person's state may be, they are brought consciously, for the time being at least, into the presence of God. This is invaluable. Some may pass on and the word is plucked away, but His own "hear His voice". The effect would be that a link is formed, or a new link established between the soul and Christ.
*Thirdly*, it says, "He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out". It is very difficult, but it is extremely important, as to whether we know the names of one another. You go around a meeting in mind, and can you say you know the name of each? We cannot do much with one another except as we know the names. I am not speaking about the names their parents gave them. I am speaking about their christian names, about what the Lord is doing with them, and the name He is forming in them. Now "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair" (@John 11: 2). That was her name. "*The* Mary". Before ever she did it, the Lord knew her name. He knew what she was to be
{409}
brought to in her soul history. All His dealings with her are in regard of that name. He shepherds her. Think of His shepherding in that case! What intelligent affection, what unselfish affection would lead Him to stay away when her brother was dying; which would let him die, that she might be brought to the value of her name! It is important to ask ourselves our names. How can we fill out our part in the flock of Christ (which is John's way of speaking of the assembly, or the body of Christ), unless we know our names? Every touch of the Lord has in view the intelligent relation of the soul with Himself. That is of vast importance. We may be trying to build up something in a person's soul, the *basis* for which has never been formed. Simon was the name his parents gave him; Peter was the name the Lord gave him. He is given another name in relation to the assembly. It is of all importance to get so into contact with souls by spiritual dealings with them, that we understand the character of the touch they have with the Lord. You may forget their natural names amongst men, but you do not forget their spiritual names -- the character of the link they have with the Lord, and it is on *that* you can build.
*Fourthly*, He "leads them out". His activities are to bring them into a sphere where that name can have full scope. How much He has to lead us out of! In the fold, you see, there was the idea of restraint. Well, that is right in a way. I daresay your parents have restrained you. What a mercy if they have! It preserves against the outbreaks of lawlessness, and the damaging effects of sin upon us, effects which may never be healed as long as we are here. But the object of the Lord is to bring us out. He wants to
{410}
bring us into a sphere where our name is not only known to Him, or perhaps to one or two here, but where we are characterised by it in the whole of our deportment and activities, and in our environment. Think of Peter, think of the Lord's dealings with him! Simon, impetuous, unstable, ardent, easily diverted; but the Lord names him Peter, and He says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire. But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God" (@John 21: 18, 19). You find Peter's history, indicated by the Lord, as closing in all the endurance and stability of a rock, in the presence of the violence of men. He once said impetuously he would die for the Lord, and at the end in all the stability of divine formation he does die for Him; but the Lord had much to lead him out of.
It is not by suppression or limitation that things will finally be held; it is by liberty. The Lord *leads* them out. That means He goes in front. That is another thing we must be concerned about in shepherding -- going ahead. There is nothing that so much induces spiritual movement amongst others, as going ahead ourselves. Making straight paths for our feet, so that the lame are not turned aside, is a manner of shepherding. There is a deep-seated sense in the soul of one who goes ahead, that everything lies before. There are such vast fields that lie in the knowledge of God, that you cannot speak of attainment. Paul says, "*I* do not count to have got possession myself; but ... I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 3: 13, 14). At the end of
{411}
his course, when you might say he had ripened and matured, you find Paul full of the sense of the vastness of what is before, "forgetting the things behind". How easily the things behind detain us! We think we have reached this goal and that. Thank God if we have reached any point in the varied chapters of our history! But he says, "forgetting the things behind" -- with the whole energy of his soul he is pressing forward.
The Lord *led* them. Leading involves suffering. Peter could tell you something of that. He says, "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am their fellow-elder" (@1 Peter 5: 1), not that he was officially an elder, but a matured, older man, and one who had witnessed the sufferings of Christ. Peter is near the moment of stretching out his hands and being led where he would not. He had seen the sufferings of Christ, and they had made indelible marks on his heart, and he is prepared to go through anything as supported by the love of God, and in the light of the glory. He says, I am a "witness of the sufferings of the Christ" (@1 Peter 5: 1). These had made a profound impression upon Peter. But he adds, "who also am partaker of the glory about to be revealed". He writes to elders as such. He would indicate to them that the way to profit the flock of God, is to go forward, as conscious in their spirits of the sufferings of Christ, and that this involves suffering for them. He says, It is better to suffer if the will of God be so; and "he that has suffered in the flesh has done with sin" (@1 Peter 4: 1). But then, we may be partakers of the *glory*!
The sheep follow the Lord, for they know His voice. It is a great thing if anyone is exercised to hear. Do you
{412}
know His voice? You may read ministry, or listen to it, but do you know *His* voice? When you hear something that is different, do you reject it? You say you hear this in one place, and that in another. Is there anything you hear that gives you the sense that the presence of Christ is there? It is the voice of the Lord! That is what moves the heart of the bride, "The voice of my beloved", she says (@Song of Songs 2: 8). Where was it? It was behind the wall; it was outside the lattice -- things she had allowed to shut her in, so that she was not in liberty with her beloved. But she hears his voice, and he would lead her out. She would have his presence, and he would have her presence. If you find the presence of the Lord in any company, take your place there. It is where He is leading, where He is moving, and you will find it is there that He gives life. It is no longer a fold, but the power of life which preserves us. The great object and end of the Lord's dealings with us is that we might have life, and have it more abundantly. It is not obtained by rules and regulations, by a code of morals, or even by imitating Christ Himself; but in the power of life, that great vital element which God effects by the Holy Spirit, linking us up consciously with a Man in heaven. "This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was of which he spoke ..". (@John 10: 6). Is that like you? That you do not understand His leading out?
Then He says, "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture". That is extremely attractive. It brings us back to the first point, that the whole object of shepherding is to bring the person consciously into contact with Christ. "I am the door". The knowledge of the Lord
{413}
as a living Person; as the One who has died to make the way out of the environment which otherwise would hold us, and entangle us, is a way of salvation. This would promote that holy liberty Godward, and towards one another, going in and out in the liberty of life which is proper to the flock.
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep". How good to appropriate the Lord on that line! That is not a question of your sins. The good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep. He is speaking to sheep -- to persons who know Him. He has given His life, that there might be complete emancipation from every kind of bond, and that there might be holy liberty in the presence of God. No fold can preserve us, but the Lord proposes to preserve us by each being brought into the power of life.
Now I just want to refer to @John 21 to draw attention to the working out of things in a detailed case. "There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples" -- all good men; each one of them was a good man. Simon Peter -- Simon brings in his responsible life; Peter is his spiritual name. God is dealing with him. There is Thomas -- a delightful man is Thomas. When the Lord was going to Judaea to die, Thomas says, "Let *us* also go, that we may die with him" (chapter 11: 16). Nathanael, a man without guile; a man who was in entire simplicity of soul in relation to Christ. The two sons of Zebedee, and the two other disciples were there. "Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish". I would suggest that indicates a person who is devoted to the
{414}
service rather than to the saints. He had the light. The Lord had called him to be a fisher of men. He says, "I go to fish". That is, the service is before him. They go, and "that night took nothing". Then the Lord comes, and He says, "Children". The shepherd character of Christ is always so tender. He says, "Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No". He is really asking them how their service has worked out. Look over any bit of shepherding you have done and see how it has worked out. I have to look over my work of shepherding. Has it prospered? If not, there is something wrong. You may say, I have done it with the best intention. That is the *service*. The household of Stephanas devoted themselves to the *saints, and then* to the service. The Lord does not challenge the motive; He challenges the result. You look around over one and another you sought to help, over one company or another where you have sought to bring in something for God; how has it worked? Has it prospered?
Then the Lord said, "Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find" -- on the *right* side. That is where your heart is, if you are wise. "The heart of a wise man is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left" (@Ecclesiastes 10: 2). God's heart is at His right hand. He wants all the affections in relation to His beloved people in motion in the act of service. That would involve spiritual direction from Himself. He says, "ye will find". "They cast therefore, and they could no longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes". It was a great success.
"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord". I believe it is very important to know how to recognise the Lord in any movement. Out of all
{415}
those disciples there was only one that recognised the Lord, and it was not the leader. Peter was the leader. But Peter in this was not the leader, for he did not recognise the Lord. That was left for the disciple whom Jesus loved. When things go heavily, when they go wrong, we may consider whether the Lord is in it. When things run well, and what is done prospers, the Lord is there. So John says, "It is the Lord". Peter now discovers he is naked; he has been exposing himself. That is always so, if service has not been in the Spirit of Christ. If any element comes in, however minute, as you may say, which the Lord cannot support, there will be some kind of evidence of self. It is one of the most important things to guard against. The more prominent the servant becomes, the greater the tendency to become naked, for the person comes into evidence, and may become important in his own eyes, and before the brethren.
The whole object of shepherding is that the sheep might hear *His* voice. John is a true shepherd here, he says, "It is the Lord". Yet Peter is not occupied with John. He puts on his overcoat, for he recognises he needs to be clothed; he needs to be hidden, and he casts himself into the sea. The affections are there, but they wanted adjusting and directing, and the Lord, in the grace of His heart, has adjusted them. Peter is not repelled, but, being attracted moves out to the Lord.
"When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread". It is very humbling to find the Lord has been there long before us. Fish and bread and coals of fire! -- persons who have been brought into accord with Himself by the apprehension of
{416}
His death, and who have become available under His hand as food and spiritual support to others, whilst we have been wandering! He says in @John 10: 16, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring". I can understand the Jewish brethren could hardly take that in -- "other sheep". He says, I must bring them -- there must be one flock, one shepherd. We are inclined sometimes to discredit other sheep. We may find that all we have been labouring for has gone amiss, yet the Lord has been securing His end; He has other sheep. Where we have got no food, He has food. Where we have had no success, He has had success, and He has done it without us; but now He says, You bring what you have. In the grace of His heart, the Lord delights, if only we will be submissive, to link us up with what He is doing: "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken". The net was not broken, not one was lost. There are very few crises we can come through and say, Not one was lost. The Lord comes through a tremendous crisis, and He says "... those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition" (@John 17: 12).
"When therefore they had dined", brings in another important feature in shepherding. This shepherding we are now considering is more that of an overseer character. Shepherding is mostly feeding. Now there is this additional thought -- of adjustment. It is a very difficult, very delicate, operation. You look at yourself and you say, Whom would I pretend to adjust? We do not want to be like the man who could see the mote in his brother's eye, and had a beam in his own. There is nothing more delicate than to seek to adjust someone else. "When therefore they
{417}
had dined", the Lord had satisfied their affections, filling them with good things; then He begins to adjust. We have to pass through this process, and we have to be prepared to exercise it with one another; but do not forget, it was when they had dined. We must always have food with us for such before we seek to adjust.
"Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" He knew his spiritual name and He also knew his responsible name. Responsibility lies with Simon. The Lord covers it with the thought of Peter; He credits him with the divine work in his soul. "Simon ... lovest thou me more than these?" Think of the spiritual discernment in that question! I suppose there are few who would not have started with Simon and said, Simon, you have denied the Lord. Perhaps some might go so far as to say, I cannot walk with you. The Lord does not actually say a word about it, though indeed He knew of his tears. You will not find his denial mentioned from the beginning to the end of this manifestation. That was only the fruit of the tree, but what about the root? In shepherding, it is of no use to deal with the fruit only; we must deal with the root. "If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended" (@Matthew 26: 33) -- that was the root. It was his self-confidence in his own affection for Christ, as exceeding that of his brethren; *that* was the root. How easily we drop into it! We think our love, our energy, our zeal exceeds that of our brother, but alas! that will yield fruit that is not good. We have to deal with the root. He answers, "thou knowest that I am attached to thee". Jesus says, "Feed my lambs". He gives him the service of elementary ministry.
{418}
He tests him the second time. He says to him, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" This time He does not say "more than these". Simon replies, "thou knowest that I am attached to thee". Jesus says, "Shepherd my sheep". He commits more to him.
Then the third time He tests him. "Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep". The Lord's shepherding here is in the manner of overseeing or adjusting; but the Lord had first fed Simon. I want to call special attention to that -- the Lord's manner of shepherding, so as to arrive at last at the adjustment. First, He feeds, which was essential, and He does not leave the matter until Peter speaks with a character and manner which demonstrates that he has now got to the bottom of himself. When Peter considered what his course had been, in the distress of his soul, he recognised that nobody but Christ could know that he loved Him. He casts himself at the feet of Christ. He goes to the very bottom, and now the Lord says, "Feed my sheep".
One just leaves these few thoughts with you. I do not speak as competent. I can only commend it to my brethren. If one looks at one's own activities in shepherding, one is ashamed; but we look at Christ, and we are delighted as we observe His way of doing it. He does not speak to us directly always. He speaks largely through the brethren, and if we do not hear His voice through the brethren, we may find ourselves on a course which does not prosper His sheep. The Lord reckons on our ear being ready, so that
{419}
when He speaks to us -- and it may be through the brethren -- we may hear *His* voice. May the Lord help us!

CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS FOR HIS BRIDE (1)
A M HAYWARD

I would like to leave some impression of the love of Christ upon all our hearts. My thought in speaking, is not so much to enlarge on the bride, but rather upon the character of the sufferings of Christ, as depicted in the scriptures we have read, all of which give us different aspects of the assembly for which He suffered and died. I suppose we may rightly say that these scriptures all speak of His death, in some form. There is much suggested in the very first type of the bride, that is Eve, in the fact that she *is built*. It does not suggest something that is suddenly brought into being, but a progressive, steady work. Provided you have the right material, you can build what will abide, and Eve suggests that character of vessel. The building is going on at the present time, and I trust we shall all be concerned about it. The building up in our hearts of that which is entirely out of Christ, every bit of which is the result of some apprehension of His death, and what was set forth in Himself in that death. It is a long process. @Psalm 139: 15, 16 delineates something of that process. It says, "My bones were not hidden from thee when I was made in secret ... Thine eyes did see my unformed substance". It is not what we generally speak of as "unformed". The vast vessel which is to display the excellencies of Christ is not yet completed; but every bit that is accomplished is in itself
{422}
perfect, and all is carefully preordained in the mind of God. "In thy book all my members were written; during many days were they fashioned, when as yet there was none of them" (@Psalm 139: 16). It is delightful to think of that. Think of the greatness of Christ! Think of what He must have been as here, so that John says that if all the things that He did were written, not even the world itself would contain the books written.
God is now producing *living* books, living members, preordained. One likes to fall back upon that. Where would we be if it were not for the blessed foreknowledge of God? So every feature of Christ is being reproduced in the power of the Spirit, according to the eternal plan, the fruition of which will be a complete expression of Himself in the assembly. You think of the millions and millions of men it takes to express fallen Adam! There are no two alike. Each has his own features, his own make-up, alas, true to the life of fallen Adam. God is producing millions and millions of living beings who are an expression of His Christ -- every one different! Every one marked by some peculiar glory, some feature which is to illuminate the scene in that day when the bride will appear as "the fulness of him who fills all in all" (@Ephesians 1: 23). It is a marvellous expression! People speak of talking too much about the assembly, but she is the fulness of the Man that fills all in all. What a vessel! We are let into the secret, so to speak, of God's own holy operations. There were no exercises with Eve; that is not the aspect of the figure which is taken up: no imperfection, no past history of sin! She begins with Adam, and ends with Adam; she is altogether of Adam. It says, "Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall
{423}
upon Man". I would commend that aspect of the death of Christ to your heart. It is good to contemplate the death of Christ from that standpoint, that in our thoughts there might be nothing transferred from the scene around, from what is natural. Let this conception of the bride be before us, let it be as in the purpose of God, itself perfect. Nothing that defiles was ever intended to come into the bride of Christ. He caused "a deep sleep to fall upon Man". Apart from any question of sin, God indicates here that Christ would die, in order that there might be brought forth from Himself, outside of all that preceded, that which was to be His complement.
"Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone" (@John 12: 24). It is an immense thing to apprehend Christ coming into the scene as of an entirely new order; "the heavenly one". The divine thought is that there shall be "heavenly ones" -- myriads of them, as heavenly in origin as Christ, as sure to go into heaven as was Christ. As bearing "the image of the heavenly one" (@1 Corinthians 15: 49), they are *of Him*, and as He has gone to heaven, so they must go to heaven. It is important that we should lay hold of this aspect of the death of Christ for the assembly. It would help us as partaking of the Supper on the first day of the week. We look upon one another as of divine workmanship. Think of Christ as moved to give Himself for us! There is no need to add anything to it. It is for us. "This is my body ... for you" (@Luke 22: 19), He says. Think of the liberating effect as coming from various wilderness circumstances, to sit down and clothe one another with divine thoughts! We look upon the saints as
{424}
members of His body, as a continuance of Himself, as all written in "thy book".
God took a rib out of Adam, and of it He built a woman. There could have been no true knowledge of God apart from the death of Christ. His death was essential. There could have been no full expression of His love apart from that death. As governed by the constraining power of His love, we judge that if He died for all, it was because all had died, and hence there is no possibility for any element of that order to be carried over. On the other hand, all that God is is seen in Christ for our heart's delight, and the effect of that is divine formation in our souls -- God building a woman! Think of what it must be to the heart of Christ, to look into your heart and to see there what God has wrought as of Himself -- not a bit of flesh of sin, or of the will of man has ever tainted it! It is *of* heaven, and it goes back to heaven, and it abides because it is of Himself, and *He* abides. "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone" (@John 12: 24). You cannot bring in the vicarious sacrificial thought there. That is not the thought in "the grain of wheat" dying. It indicates what is essential to bring forth fruit in continuance. We are privileged to take account of this origin of the assembly as out of Christ. It is what God has wrought.
I like to look upon the saints, and in my heart say with the apostle, "of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus!" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30). It is dignified; it is magnificent! Of God are ye -- *God's work*. Think of God's workmanship -- "in Christ Jesus". In order that it might be brought about, Christ went into death. All the will of God came to light in Him, in His life, death, resurrection and ascension. The making known of
{425}
the heart of God, the revelation of it, and that the Father would have those standing in suitable relation to His Son, and having part in all that is the Son's -- was all secured through His death. The thoughts of Christ's own heart too, as desiring something upon which He could expend His affections, and which could respond adequately to Himself, came to light in His death.
I believe if we are prepared to abstract ourselves more frequently in relation to the production of what is for Christ, on this line, we shall find it is calculated to increase spirituality and heavenly-mindedness, as we grow in the apprehension of the love that has gone into death to secure this great end. Think of the eternal character of it! The Spirit says, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife". I have no question whatever that that is an allusion to the extraordinary fact that Christ remains a *Man*. It is an extraordinary thing to contemplate, and exceedingly essential to us. It is of the greatest possible importance. Think of the Son of God when the millennial rule is all over, when He has subjected everything to God, death having at last been put down, Himself being placed in subjection to God, that "God may be all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15: 28). He abides there, that we might share with Him through all eternity the blessedness of God as all in all! One would greatly desire to have one's affections quickened, and spiritual capacity increased, so that one might afford to the Lord more of this character of enjoyment. "This time", says Adam. There is much exercise through which we pass, and there are varied results, as indicated in green things springing up, and animals named by Adam; but he says, "This time", as
{426}
referring to something peculiar which is arrived at, "it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh". We might thank God we have been brought out of Egypt, and that we can sing the song of the Red Sea with holy delight. We might be filled with the sense of the goodness of God satisfying us with manna from heaven, and with water from the rock, and we might know what it is to sing to the well, "Rise up, well" (@Numbers 21: 17), but what about "This time?" All these other things are deliverances on our side, but what about something for Christ? Have you thought of that in yourself which is altogether of Christ? Think of the sobering and elevating effect it should have on you! Think of the power of it as you move through the world, where there is no thought of Christ -- I have part in that which is altogether of Christ! The intense, unbounded interest of the One who gave Himself for us! Individually, there is a past history, closing in death, in trespasses and sins. We know that. Then there is this divine operation of God, who, when we were dead in sins, "because of his great love wherewith he loved us, ... has quickened us with the Christ" (@Ephesians 2: 4, 5). Where from? Out of death. And He has "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (verse 6). A vessel that heaven is not ashamed of! Indeed, heaven will make room for her. She is the greatest created vessel in the universe. She has a place beside Christ, the Son of God, the One who can speak of Himself as equal with God, and yet He has been pleased through incarnation, death, and resurrection and ascension, to take up this place in abiding relations with those who are secured by His love. As we understand the feelings of His heart we take form, so that there is spiritual
{427}
intelligence to enjoy what He enjoys; to move in what He moves in; to take in with profound interest all that He has done, and is doing, and is about to do, and will yet do throughout eternity.
I think that is a very attractive presentation of the love of Christ, because it stands outside all question of sin, and it is a very attractive presentation of the assembly because she also is viewed in Him entirely apart from the question of sin, and as God's workmanship. What conversations Adam and Eve must have had together! What thoughts would pass through the mind of Eve as she apprehended she was altogether out of Adam! What entire understanding would be between them! What sympathetic feeling, what intelligence, what oneness of mind and heart! You could not apprehend anything more absolutely united than that man and the woman who was taken out of him.
Well, now we go on to Rebecca. Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi. He dwelt in the south country. This is another presentation of the results of the death of Christ, as He is here viewed as the heavenly man who died, in order that the living God might be made known. He died sacrificially; figuratively, Isaac was offered up in order that the living God might be made known, and now he is waiting on the results. The living God who reveals Himself -- that is what is indicated by the name of the well. Meanwhile, he dwells in the south country; that is, everything is maintained as most favourable to us. Christ has accomplished all that is needful, so that everything may be favourable to our movements towards Him. He wants us to move towards Him. Rebecca had to be sought by Abraham's servant.
{428}
Paul, in the power of the Spirit, was the first great servant corresponding to the type, who went out seeking a bride for Christ. He knew what kind of bride was needed -- a heavenly bride, one of Christ's own order. Paul's ministry is calculated to move our hearts in that direction. How the Lord, like Isaac meditating in the field, must wait for a movement like Rebecca's! The servant is seen in our chapter as having been through the travail of his journey, and he is now bringing back with joy the results of his service. Alas, there is much service that will fall short of this. Rebecca is not the figure of one newly converted. There was much that was fine in her before she moved towards Isaac. That must necessarily be so. She was spiritually beautiful, through grace already received, when Abraham's servant found her. We might say, in antitype, she was found suitable to be for Christ. She had taken on the character of God. If there was a thing to be done, she would do it bountifully, like God. He asked for a drink, and she would give it to him, and for all his camels also. One great mark of the character of one who is ready for this step is the feature of bountifulness, doing whatever we put our hand to with all our heart. You never find God doing a thing with a restrained hand, unless it is judgment. He pours out His blessing, and He delights in those who act likewise in all the liberty of the bountifulness they have learnt from God. It would have been right enough when he asked for a drink to just give it, and pass on; but she said, "Drink, my lord!" (verse 18) showing the respect she has for the servant. Then adds, "I will draw water for thy camels also". Thus the Lord raises with us, after a time, questions calculated to move us out to Himself in bridal character.
{429}
He has noted the appreciation in our hearts of the divine grace which has been shown towards us, as expressed in the well, where we can drink liberally, and thus learn to know God as presented to us in a living Christ. It is a marvellous thing that, while in a dead world, God can be made known to us livingly in Christ, at His right hand in heaven. It is at this point that the Spirit of God, in His servants, loves to raise a further question with us as to whether we are prepared to take a journey to Isaac? Has the love of Christ, in going into death to secure entirely favourable conditions for us, touched our hearts so as to make us want to be for Him as He has been for us?
It is a new challenge to our hearts when we thus apprehend the love of Christ. Think of what the Lord has been to us! He has given Himself for us. What other right answer can there be than that we yield ourselves up to Him, not in service exactly, but for His heart! Christendom is full of service, but how much of it is for His heart? Isaac lifts up his eyes and sees the camels approaching. What that must have meant to him! Rebecca was one who had had everything provided on her side, so that she was in every sense satisfied. She was provided for at home; she was beautiful; that is, instead of the sad traces of sin, there were the evidences of divine beauty there. She was marked by grace -- grace learnt from the God who had revealed Himself, and yet she takes a journey which means the leaving behind of everything that naturally would hold her, so that she might comfort the heart of Christ. It is a question of comfort here. He has lost someone. Bereavement is always touching to contemplate. Think of Christ in all His liberty of heart towards Israel when He
{430}
was here in flesh and blood conditions, and yet He died without securing response. His cry on the cross, "I thirst" was only answered by mockery. He has been waiting ever since by the well, so to speak, of the supplies of the Spirit, maintaining before us the God who reveals Himself -- the living God who makes Himself known! What He waits for is that our hearts, being thus satisfied, might be prepared to embrace the thought of being a comfort to Him here on the earth, in the loss of Israel. During the time when every advance of the love of His heart, and kindness and mercy, has only been rebuffed by His people Israel. What it must have been to see this woman, with a veil upon her! She is exclusively for one man. She has moved out of all the surroundings that might have held her naturally, with good reason, and she has taken advantage of all the ministry that came to her through the servant, and has moved towards Christ, and she comes to Him as a veiled woman. She is exclusively for the love of *His* heart. And, we read, "Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent".
Isaac "took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her". He appropriated her in the place of the one who was dead, and she was willing to accept it. If we will go over these features prayerfully, as connected with the death of Christ as the heavenly Man, I think we shall find what it is to have the consciousness in our hearts that He loves us. This is as being in the place of wife, to fill out the requirements of wife to so great a Person, in the grace and the power of the Spirit. This in a particular way draws forth His love.
Now in chapter 29 I think we are entitled to look upon Jacob as a figure of Christ, though not in all his dealings.
{431}
Rachel represents Israel, the earthly bride of the future; and Leah the gentile, the assembly. Jacob fled from Esau, for his brother's heart was filled with murder. It is a figure of Christ as cast out by Israel, when the spirit of murder moved those who crucified Him. Hosea says, Jacob fled to Syria and "Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep" (@Hosea 12: 12). It is beautiful to think of Christ serving to this end. Have you accepted this service of Christ? You think of all that Israel has missed, and all that we may be missing! How beautiful was the meeting of Rachel and Jacob! He kissed her, and he lifted up his voice and wept; but in the antitype there was no response. I am speaking now of the fact of Christ coming to Israel. With what love in His heart He approached, and how He wept over them! How He would have gathered them as a hen gathers her chickens, and they would not! He saluted Israel with a kiss, so to speak. That was the manner of His coming amongst them, but He was refused, and had to find refuge outside Israel. Jacob is told it was not the custom to give the younger before the elder. But God has a right to do things in accordance with His own will. So that, refused Rachel, Jacob receives Leah. She was tender-eyed. Rachel had been cultivated ceremonially, at least, for Jacob. Israel had been prepared by divine cultivation for the reception of Christ. She should have been ready, as the result of all God's ways with her, to have hailed the incoming of Christ with intelligence; whereas Leah was tender-eyed. The gentiles had no outlook in relation to Christ. But as the reward of His service unto death, Christ receives, not Rachel -- that is Israel; but Leah -- the assembly. Then we get certain painful exercises with Leah. We need not think
{432}
of them with disparagement, but may look upon them as indicating the way by which God passes every one of us, that we might be competent to fill out our place here, whilst He waits for the day when Rachel shall be fruitful. He looks into our hearts and finds His satisfaction in the exercises that result in fruitfulness. Such exercises rendering us more suitable to Christ in the scene of His sorrows, in the world out of which He has died. How truly He might say with Jacob "in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night" (@Genesis 31: 40). What it must have been for the heart of Christ to move through the scene where there was not the slightest response to God. It was a scene of drought to Him. He felt it all, and the more so because treasured in His heart for them were these great thoughts of God in relation to Israel. Leah's firstborn is named Reuben, which as we know means 'a son'. You start with sonship. There is nothing less than sonship for us. It is a great thing to begin where God begins. Being a son, means something for the heart of Christ, for He is bringing many sons to glory -- and is serving still to that end. Jacob is not presented here as being near at hand to support her, as you might say. Christ is on high. The question is whether we are prepared to move in our affections after Him, without having Him manifestly with us. In His service to us He would bring us to know what He has passed through. The first result of Leah's exercise is a son. There is nothing more liberating, more calculated to bring in a sense of nearness, than the thought of 'a son'. It connects us immediately with all that is heavenly as in relation to the One who is absent. He is not here. He is in heaven. Sonship links us up at once with heaven, as
{433}
liberating us from the earth. It does not belong to this scene! And yet as children, or heirs, we have a certain interest in the scene around. It belongs to Christ, and we can look around on it as ours, in that sense. "Christ's joint heirs" (@Romans 8: 17), however, involves waiting for Christ. We could not take up the present scene until Christ does. Leah is passing through these exercises in the consciousness of His absence. It is very precious to see young people with a sense that they belong to heaven. Christ is not here; He has left this scene. He belongs to heaven, and they belong to heaven. Hence, though heirs of God, there is an aloofness with them in relation to all that is around, as arriving at the truth expressed in the name Reuben, a son.
"And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon". Leah had the constant feeling of the spirit of hatred around her, and what is her resource? Simeon -- the consciousness of being heard in prayer. Another definite chapter is arrived at in her history. It is right to pray, and to have stated times as with morning and evening prayers; but how often we may pass on unconscious of being heard. Leah typifies a person who has arrived at an understanding that she has been heard, and is conscious that she has the ear of Christ, in a scene where she is hated and tested in her affections.
"And she again conceived, and bore a son, and said, Now this time will my husband be united to me, for I have born him three sons; therefore was his name called Levi". That is a thing we have to learn -- what it is to be united to
{434}
Christ. We may expect *Him* to be joined to *us*, as apparently she did, but are *we* seeking to be joined to Him practically? What we have to learn is to go on and continue as Levites. The levitical spirit is marked by unwearied consideration for the Lord's interests. It says of Aaron he was *the* Levite. How pre-eminently this was seen in Christ, as He depicts Himself, journeying from Jerusalem to Jericho in @Luke 10. He comes in no official garb, but as a Samaritan. He who was to be *the* High Priest, comes as a Samaritan, with all the levitical grace in His heart that knows how to serve. It is a great thing to come to the levitical outlook. Levi never considered for himself. The great point about him was the holy response to Moses¬ challenge -- Who is for Jehovah? That marked Levi. He thus exhibits the Spirit of Christ. If there was anyone who served diligently, it was the Lord and His one consideration was what was due to the blessed God. He prayed that we might know what it is to be truly united, that we might be one, not on the lines of flesh, but on spiritual lines. He died to secure the conditions whereby henceforth we might know no man after the flesh.
Another aspect of the death of Christ was that He might secure our hearts for praise to the blessed God -- to secure the praises of Israel. So Leah bears Judah, that is, 'praise'. All that matters to her now is praise to her God. I can understand that the heart of Christ would be held by that. You must not be diverted from the teaching by the apparently disparaging way in which Leah personally is presented in this scripture. She represents the gentile, who had no part in the promises or in Christ. The gentile is always brought in in that way in the Old Testament
{435}
scriptures; and it should magnify to us the compassions of God (@Romans 12: 1).
Joseph had two sons by Asnath. She presents another aspect of the assembly as for the heart of Christ. Think of the afflictions of Joseph as the iron entered into his soul. What he felt as he was driven forth from his family to be henceforth amongst the gentiles. Even there he was put in prison. He knew what it was to go down to the prison house as maligned. He would not be unfaithful, but preferred to be maligned for righteousness sake. The Lord had every opportunity presented to Him in His path to make Himself great -- all the kingdoms of the world were offered to Him by Satan. But God has made Him Lord of all. Think of the wonderful period this is, when the true Joseph reigns supreme in relation to God. It is not that He has yet taken to Himself His kingly glory, or that Israel has yet been restored, but we are in the secret of the place He has before God. The whole scene is given into His hands! "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (@Acts 2: 36). Asnath, so to speak, stands in relation to Christ in this secret knowledge of His greatness, and brings forth fruit *now* to Him, so that His heart is cheered, and, as is indicated in the name of Manasseh, He forgets His toil. "For God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house". Think of the toil of Christ! And the loss of Israel (his father's house). So the firstfruits of Asnath to Joseph are set forth in Manasseh, which speaks of what she is to his heart whilst in exile. There is one thing said about Joseph which fits in here, that is, that the blessing of God was to come upon him, as the one who was "separated from his brethren"
{436}
(@Genesis 49: 26). This refers to Joseph as being a Nazarite. See what the heart of Christ is for us; He takes this place of a Nazarite for us, and it involved the separation of death. Think of the Lord dying that He might separate Himself from everything here, so that in the gift of the Spirit we might have power to separate ourselves from everything here, and be altogether for God. Asnath shared the glory of Joseph. I can understand her thinking of God, and thinking what a God He must be to have given her such a place in relation to one who had such glory. His greatness would increase before her eyes every day. So, though all is yet in mystery, as we would say today, the Lord can say He has forgotten His toil and His father's house.
The Lord is contented with the assembly -- and cannot we be contented with the Lord? You can understand that Asnath needed the Nazarite; she was a daughter of Potipherah, priest in On. We are surrounded by, and our very origin is in relation to, all that is unclean, especially as to what is religious. Hence, how we need Nazariteship! There was the special vow of the Nazarite. It is good to be prepared to enter into this, as we realise the love of Christ and the love of God. If a man or a woman -- it is open to both -- will make the Nazarite vow, they will indeed realise it is worth while to do without things here, though they may have every right to take them up, that they may be more for Christ. Thus He may forget His toil, and forget His father's house.
Ephraim is a kind of further result, and would indicate double fruitfulness -- fruitfulness Godward and fruitfulness manward. Thus all that the Lord came for He would see
{437}
carried out in the people He has taken for Himself in the time of His rejection. In this fruitfulness He would see the glad tidings going out, the kindness and love to man of God expressed (@Titus 3: 4). Mercy and grace are manifested, and the loving of righteousness and hating of lawlessness -- all according to His mind. On the other hand, there would be the true priestly element, and response to the God, who is His God, and our God, His Father, and our Father. The consideration of @John 17 with @Genesis 41 should prove fruitful, as we see the way in which the Lord wants us to enter into all He is taking up. This is in entire separation from this scene to which He has died, so that His heart might be gratified by His people. Thus He asks that we may be with Him and behold that peculiar glory the Father gives Him, for He says, "thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" (verse 24). All that come in by Christ in blessing was determined by God, as looking forward to the coming of that blessed Man. Anticipating this, He was loved before the foundation of the world. May the Lord grant us greater affection for Himself for His name's sake!

CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS FOR HIS BRIDE (2)
A M HAYWARD
@Exodus 4: 24 - 26; @Exodus 18: 1 - 5, 12; @Numbers 12: 1 - 3; @Ruth 3: 8 - 11; @Ruth 4: 9, 10; @1 Samuel 25: 10, 18 - 24
I desire to continue some of the varied aspects of the assembly as presented in these scriptures, and to connect with them the sufferings of Christ relative to each presentation. We are well acquainted with most of the scriptures, and one only intends to speak briefly on each. This first one is exceedingly interesting. Zipporah represents what Moses had for his heart during the time of his rejection. That is a great factor in itself to contemplate. How intensely Moses would feel the rejection of those that should have received him, while dwelling a stranger in a strange land. This is indicated by the name he gives his firstborn -- Gershom (meaning, a sojourner there); "for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land" (@Exodus 2: 22). These feelings have never left the heart of Christ. I believe we should be intensely sympathetic with the feelings of Christ in relation to His rejection, and particularly His rejection by Israel -- His brethren after the flesh. Zipporah represents the consolation that the Lord has in the assembly during the present interval. Moses, as depicting the Lord here, is on his way to effect the judgment of this world. He is about to enter Egypt to bring judgment upon it. During that judgment, it is true, he will effect the deliverance of God's people Israel, but he will execute judgment upon Egypt and upon all its gods.
{440}
At this point Zipporah comes to light in a remarkable circumstance. It says, Jehovah sought to slay Moses. We might draw from it that Moses, as a man, had been lax as to circumcision, but that is not what I desire to dwell on, but rather to use it as indicating what *we* shall lose if we do not accept in our hearts the circumcision of the Christ. I believe the point the Spirit would draw attention to, is that if He is to bring judgment on the world, there must be with His people the complete correspondence to this "in the putting off of the body of the flesh" (@Colossians 2: 11). It is a great thing to consider. If God is to righteously enter into judgment with the world, how essential that those who are His should anticipate that judgment in themselves. It should touch our hearts -- this matter of the circumcision of the Christ, the cutting off of Christ after the flesh -- and enable us to accept practically the complete putting off of the body of the flesh. Now, it was a serious moment, and Zipporah saw that it was serious. Jehovah was about to slay her husband. If you were to ask me what we lose by neglecting circumcision, I should say, the gain of Christ as Head. We lose the blessed living flow of ministry from Christ as Head; "from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God" (@Colossians 2: 19). He would maintain us in responsive life to Himself; that is a serious thing to lose! Jehovah was about to slay Moses. That stirred Zipporah to the depths; the thing had to be faced. It is not an easy thing to face this question of circumcision. It is "the putting off of the body of the flesh". If you ask me how saints are to be together in the blessing and unity of the Spirit; how they are to have one mind, and come to a common
{441}
judgment, so as to be found in the liberty of the light which God has granted us in Christ; I should say that on the negative side (yet it is most positive in effect) there must be this "putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ". It is worth considering. The apostle, in writing to the Colossians, showed them how the flesh stood in their way. If there is not the acceptance of the removal, in its entirety, of the man of flesh in the circumcision of Christ; there will be all kinds of differences of thoughts and judgments arising. There will be questions regarding meats and drinks, regarding holy days and new moons, and a thousand and one other minor things that the religious man holds on to. But Christ has been down into death that the whole man, *in his entirety*, might be removed. It is a weakness with every one of us that we attempt to hold on to something of the man that has been removed in the death of Christ. It is found very close to every one of us; the reservation of some features, or some elements, of religious flesh may even engage our consciences. The result is we come under bondage, and the free flow from the headship of Christ is hindered. That is what he points out to the Colossians. Unless there is the maintenance of the full bearing of the death of Christ, there will not be the holding of the Head individually. Consequently there will not be the flow through the body from the Head, as the blessed Source of life, and light, and holy feelings from God; uniting the saints as one living organism, in response to the heart of God, and the heart of Christ.
It is a lesson refused by the mass of believers, and this seems to be indicated in Zipporah's unwillingness to come
{442}
to it, and the lack of grace in the way in which she accepts it. But there is no greater blessing than the acceptance of the complete putting off of the whole body of the flesh in the death of Christ. We often find in matters that arise, how individual conscience tends to intrude itself in the assembly. I must keep an individual conscience before God, but in the assembly I must learn to merge with the saints. That cannot be unless one has accepted the complete removal in the death of Christ of all that constitutes man in the flesh. Thus we shall all see from one standpoint, and the result will be light from the Head. There is nothing more delightful than that; and Christ has suffered the most ignominious death on the cross, in order that He might bring that about practically for every one of us. If Christ after the flesh is gone, who is to remain before our eyes? As the apostle says, if Christ has died, "*we* henceforth know no one according to flesh" (@2 Corinthians 5: 16). Think of the delightful spiritual outlook which results from the simple and full acceptance, practically in our hearts, of the circumcision which has been effected in Christ. So that we are not occupied with the discrepancies which attach to the saints of God, nor with the features which may be pleasurable and attractive to us naturally, but only with that which is of God in them. I do not refer to wickedness, which must ever be judged. The effect is there will be emancipation, and the free and holy flow of the blessing of Christ as Head, through the members of the body, which is what He desires.
The name Zipporah means 'a little bird'. I suppose we might attach something to that. Littleness is proper to the present day, but it suggests to the mind and heart
{443}
something liberated in the heavens, something above the thoughts of men, and the matters of men, and able to rise to God and to Christ. Yet, as I was saying, she comes to circumcision here very unwillingly. I trust that may not be our attitude. I fear it is the attitude of the great mass of christendom. If a thing is secured in some, God accredits that to the whole, and that is a very great encouragement to us. If He can only find a few who hold themselves as regulated by divine thoughts, God accredits that to the whole assembly. We have to recognise that the assembly publicly is in ruin, nor is there in Scripture any thought of its ever being recovered as a whole down here. But we must never let go the thought that, as viewed according to divine workmanship, it is perfect, and that to which sin cannot attach. That must be held to. We have a right to think of the assembly as out of Christ Himself, as altogether of Him, and entirely suitable for Him. There is perfection in Christ, but there must also be perfection in what is of Him down here. If there are the features of the work of God down here, though the work may be going on continuously -- as it says prophetically in @Psalm 139: 16 -- the members "during many days were they fashioned, when as yet there was none of them". In the measure in which that work is effected, there is perfection.
Now, however, we are dwelling on the assembly as viewed in relation to mixed conditions, and this question of circumcision comes up. It is beautiful to see how Zipporah makes progress. What a magnificent end @Exodus 18 shows! One's heart delights to picture that scene. What a moment when she comes forth with Christ, as sharing His triumph and glory! The Jew (Israel) in his place, the
{444}
gentile (Jethro) in his place, the assembly (Zipporah) in her place, and Christ (Moses) supreme over all! It is a great day to look forward to, when God will manifest what He has wrought, and how He has brought through every company perfectly in relation to His Christ. Jethro has a great place here. It is beautiful to see him stepping forth with divine intelligence, and taking a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God! Praise is an immense feature in the present day, and we can understand how it gains impetus as we are in the good of circumcision.
Zipporah has two sons, Gershom, of whom we have spoken, and Eliezer. As we are prepared to accept circumcision, it will make us sojourners in a strange land; we shall not mix with the world. But that is not all, you will also be able to say, God has brought us through -- Eliezer meaning 'God is my help'. These two sons are the fruit of the apprehension of Christ as the One who has died that there might be the complete putting off of the body of the flesh, and the learning that our life is hid with Him in the God who is our help. That is Zipporah. One could say a great deal more in relation to her. She is worth considering.
We go on to the Cushite, the Ethiopian woman -- typifying another aspect of the assembly which we have to take account of whilst we are down here. I need not say that there will be no Cushites in heaven. It suggests a feature which will ever mark us whilst we are down here. There will be certain elements which we recognise as undesirable, yet have to go along with, maintaining what is due to Christ in relation to them, and to one another. Miriam and Aaron were complaining against Moses
{445}
because he was content to take a Cushite for a wife. It involved a very bitter experience for the heart of Moses. I do not think anyone except the meekest man on earth could ever have taken a Cushite for a wife. *They* only thought of her faults; but it expresses how completely Moses was in the mind of God, that he could take up one whom men would despise, and in whom fault might be found on the line of uncomely features. As long as we are here with the flesh in us, such features, alas, will mark the saints. Yet Christ is content to take such to Himself, even though in it He suffers ignominy. Nothing brought more hatred, or jealousy, or anger against Christ than that He should have extended His grace to the gentile. It was hateful to the Jew that Christ should extend the grace of God to the gentile. Paul takes it up in his sufferings. He fills up the tribulations of Christ for His body's sake, that there might be maintained for Christ here that which He has been into death to secure. He would feel the bitterness of those who were angered that He should bring such persons into the assembly of God.
Now I think that is a feature we want to look at and to weigh. There are many uncomely things about us that we have to bear with. The fact governing us is that Christ has died for such. If He has died for them and accepted them, we must accept them. Our concern is to enter into His feelings. Do you think He does not see the uncomeliness? I am sure He does. But, on the other hand, He sees that for which He has died, and He is going to stand by that for which He has died. That is a great feature to lay hold of. The Ethiopian was black; it was her very nature. There are things that are deep-seated in us, and natural to us, which
{446}
yet are not wickedness. A great deal of labour is involved, and many pains on the part of the Lord, and the Spirit of God, before that can be changed. It is a long and gradual process with every one of us, if we are going to be brought out of these deep-seated features, so that our uncomeliness might disappear, and that we might appear altogether in the character of another Man. The process is severe and protracted, but we continue in love one to another because Christ loves us.
Miriam and Aaron were not content to go on patiently with God. It is a lesson we each have to learn -- how to go on patiently with God. If God is doing a thing, I can afford to wait. There may be much that one could put one's finger on, but, unless there is wickedness, we go on with such, knowing that Christ in His love for them, gave Himself up even unto death. You can depend upon it there must be beautiful features there. Whatever it was Miriam and Aaron saw, you may depend upon it there were beautiful features in the eyes of Moses. The work of God is there, and *it is always* lovely; it is perfect! The day will come when there will be nothing left of the Ethiopian character. All will stand out in the holiness and purity of Christ, as the holy and blessed workmanship of God; but it is a matter of long patience. We have to guard our hearts lest we murmur against Christ, because He has been pleased to take up such persons for Himself, and He will carry them through to glory.
Now I leave that and pass on to Ruth. Ruth is a very attractive presentation of the assembly. Boaz is typical of Christ. He is found in the threshing floor, and his heart is full of joy. He has the fruit, so to speak, of his labours
{447}
before him, and he lies down "at the end of the heap of corn" (@Ruth 3: 7). It says, "at midnight ... the man was startled, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet". There is no heart but should be affected by the touching presentation of the feelings of Christ, with the joy of the vast harvest of fruit for God before Him. Yet, in the night, awaking to all that He must go into because of the woman that lay at His feet! If He was going to bring the assembly through into the largeness of the inheritance of the blessed God, it necessitated His going through death in order that He might secure her in liberty for Himself and for God. Ruth claims Boaz as her kinsman. It is a right thought -- we have a claim upon Christ as Kinsman. How elevating to think of the order to which we belong, whatever poverty we may have fallen into. And what poverty she had fallen into! Every bit of the inheritance, so to speak, had escaped her hand, but she recognised Boaz as her kinsman, and she asks him to spread his skirt over his handmaid.
It is a beautiful and gracious approach to Christ, as learned from Himself. The Lord has approached us in an infinitude of grace. He has come down from heaven; He has become incarnate. He has been through this scene of sin and distress. He came into this scene with His heart filled with every thought of blessing that was in the heart of God, only to find that those whom He would call to enter into it have lost all through unfaithfulness. The only way by which He could bring it to us was through death. Boaz speaks to Ruth of her kindness to him. Christ has approached us, but have we ever approached Him, in relation to the thoughts of God as to His assembly? The
{448}
Lord would appreciate it greatly. Ruth was moving on her side now, as he had moved on his side. In figure, she asks of Christ that He might bring about in her soul the appreciation of the greatness of the divine thoughts that He had declared by His coming into the scene, and had secured in His death. Christ came charged with the very greatest thoughts. In @Ephesians 1: 3 we read of our being blessed "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ". Think of the greatness of that! Spiritual blessings in the heavenlies! You may say we do not know much about it. Why not approach the Lord, and ask Him as to it? Then think of being before the Father "holy and blameless before him in love" (@Ephesians 1: 4). Would you not like to know that? It is a very practical matter. And then again, that we should partake in the adoption, that we should be sons of God; having the real thing in our hearts, the consciousness of being sons of God! Then to think of being continually in the holy liberty of acceptance in the Beloved!
I can understand a young soul saying, I have not the slightest idea what it means. I sympathise with you fully; but I would say this -- ask of Christ. There is nothing that delights His heart more than to have us put ourselves at His feet that we might be enlarged in the understanding of the divine blessing brought to us in Him, as liberated through His death. The Holy Spirit would thus become known to us as, "the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of his glory" (@Ephesians 1: 14). We do not have to wait for the redemption of the acquired possession to enjoy this, for the Spirit even *now* is the earnest in us of this vast inheritance
{449}
which we have in Christ. He brings before us spiritual things. He would occupy us not with earth, but with heaven. He would engage us with things that tend to holiness, so that we might be without blame before Him in love. He would bring us into all the liberty that belongs to us, as those God has called in the greatness of His love. He has been pleased to place us before Himself in the character of His own Son. That is what it means by "accepted in the beloved". That is not forgiveness. It is the consciousness, as coming before God at any time, that you are delightful to Him in the Beloved. Thus, the Spirit is the earnest to us of the inheritance.
You get a great deal about the redemption of the inheritance in the book of Ruth; but we must remember that Ruth, strictly speaking, is a type of the remnant of Israel. We can, however, take it up as typical of the assembly, as indicating our outlook in relation to what is for Christ and for God as found in the heavenly company. Boaz sits down in the gate. I can look on to the day when Christ will sit down in the gate, when He will publicly declare that He has liberated the assembly. It does not say 'redeemed;' it says he *purchases* Ruth. He sets a value on her. If He gave Himself for us, He has a right to us. He has bought us. As to the inheritance, God has a right to it for Himself, and it is redeemed. When we come to the redemption of the acquired possession, it embraces the day of glory, when He will bring out His assembly in all its beauty before a wondering world. It will be seen publicly, in the gate, that He has effected the release of every divine thought, and made it good in the hearts of His people, as
{450}
well as taking to Himself, at such a cost, what He has purchased for His own heart's satisfaction.
We can understand how we, as the saints of God, as those that constitute the assembly, will look with wonder and love at Christ. He is the great living Head, who has been into death that He might secure the liberation of every divine thought, and secure it for God, and for our hearts.
In Abigail there is another thought. There we have a very serious position, which concerns us today. There is nothing, perhaps, more solemn than this sending by David for a portion from Nabal. He sends in a good day, when Nabal is dwelling at Carmel. Everything speaks of the abundance of the wealth provided in the knowledge of God. Yet Nabal's heart is perfectly cold in relation to Christ. I think we may safely say it indicates the present time, and the final issue to which christendom is so rapidly proceeding. It is a day of abundance of light. People may not be taking it up, but there is abundance of light. It is a time when we can feast. If we take account of the ministry Christ is giving to His own at this time, there has never been a period, I believe, in the history of the assembly, since apostolic times when Christ has ministered such wealth to the hearts of His people as now. If we are to get this vast supply, however, we must read the ministry as recognising that it is from Himself, during His rejection. He is sovereign, and gives it where He pleases, and in conditions suitable to His mind; but ministry in any one place is for the whole assembly, for the whole body. Whether we get the good of it depends on our own activities. On the other hand, we get the world making
{451}
itself great in the light of christianity. I suppose we may say that civilisation, and the development of all that is considered most excellent in the present day, has been evolved out of christianity. Yet as Christ knocks at the door, as in Laodicea, what answer has He received? Who is David? Alas, alas, we find people taking prominent places religiously, who do not even know the true David. We have it on every hand, in every country, people taking prominent places in that which takes the place publicly of the church of God, who do not even know Christ!
In contrast to that, you get Abigail. Abigail means 'source of delight'. She is an immense source of delight. I mention that because I think it has a great place in this instance. Where is Christ to find anything for His heart and His affections? Where is He to look for anything to mitigate the present conditions? He finds it in Abigail, in the one who has no kind of affinity with the condition of things which is around. Nabal was her husband, which views what is for God here as outwardly connected with the whole profession, but she dissociates herself from what is mere profession by saying, "Nabal is his name, and folly is with him" (verse 25). People often say how hard it is to part with this one or that one, that they might be separate to Christ. I do not think we could speak of anything as hard, if our hearts enter into the greatness of the joy of Christ in seeing anyone step out in simple love to Himself, as desiring to be here for His pleasure. He says of such that they are a source of delight to His heart. As Abigail moves forward with her offerings, there is food for all those that are Christ's. What it must be for the heart of the Lord, to see those that are engaged in bringing food to the saints of
{452}
God! She brings abundance with her. Even if it is refused by the mass in christendom, yet spiritual food is in abundance for all. It may be found practically amongst a few, but whatever the number, it is a few who have entered into the feelings of the Lord, and are concerned that those that are His should at least be supplied with abundance of food.
Another thing is she moves downwards; she is not elevating herself. I think you will find that every system on earth elevates itself, and seeks to take a place of prominence in the world. She is not taking that route. She is taking a downward route. She went down, and David comes down over against her. She is in the understanding of the way of the cross. She has learnt to come down. David goes down over against her, as much as to say, I will encourage you on that line. It is the line in which my heart delights. The Lord came down from God, and, as Man, humbled Himself even to the death of the cross. The assembly is moving in the character of that. One can understand how the Lord could say, she is a source of delight. How it moved David, and how it must move the heart of Christ! And another thing it does is, it postpones the judgment of the world. It is in line with the prayer of Christ on the cross, "Father, forgive them ..". (@Luke 23: 34), whereby immediate judgment was deferred. Since the world had refused God's Christ and crucified Him, judgment should have fallen upon the world. But He prays that they might be forgiven. The assembly is seen in these last days as being in line with the priestly feelings of Christ. We cannot say "how long", like Israel, as calling for judgment. We are not looking for justification -- neither
{453}
amongst ourselves nor in relation to what is outside; but we are waiting for the day when it will please God to give Christ His own place in glory. She is perfectly clear, as was Abigail, that He will reign supreme, and His enemies will be put under His feet.
In the meantime, she is content to be for the pleasure of His heart, the source of His delight as expressing here the features she has learned from Himself. So he takes her as his wife. Nabal is smitten. The world will be smitten; christendom will be smitten. It comes under the severest judgment of God. Then the Lord will bring forward that which has been, and will be for ever, for the pleasure of His heart. He will publicly make her His, in the presence of wondering worlds.
May the Lord encourage us! One feels the need of addicting one's mind to the contemplation of what Christ has suffered, so that the Holy Spirit might have more freedom to form these features which are for Himself.
