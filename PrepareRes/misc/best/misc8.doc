THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS (1)
S McCallum
@John 1: 1 - 14
S.McC. The knowledge of divine Persons and divine things is to be considered. It is essential that the importance of John's gospel should be apprehended by us. Mr. Raven said that it is the backbone of all the gospels,¦ and Mr. Taylor remarked that it is the backbone of all the Scriptures,¦ showing what an important place it had in their minds. It is especially important as bearing on what we are about to consider together in connection with the revelation of God -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things. In the consideration of our subject together, divine personality will be before us in each of the Persons of the Deity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and particularly before us now we have the divine Personality of the Word, the Son. We need to see the place that the Person of Christ has in these holy writings. It is important that in seeking after light we should not miss the glory of the Persons about whom we seek light. They are presented in John's ministry in a manner which is calculated to touch every feature of spiritual affection begotten in us through the operations of God. The knowledge that we are referring to -- spiritual knowledge -- seems to run right

through all John's ministry, in the gospel, and the epistles, and the Revelation. If we were to consult a concordance, it would be surprising the number of times that the word 'know' and 'knowing' comes into John's ministry. It is especially important in view of all that is abroad in the public profession, that we should come into the knowledge that John has in mind, and, as quickened in our affections, be affected by that knowledge, and especially in view of the enriching of the service of God.
Now, in the first portion we have read the matter of knowledge is presented negatively, which is very interesting. John opens his gospel with negative references to knowledge, whereas when we come to chapter 17 it is replete with references to positive features of knowledge as to the men that God has given Christ, out of the world. He says in @John 1: 10, "He [that is Christ] was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world *knew him not*". Then in verse 26, "John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye *do not know*, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". Then John says, as to the Lamb of God, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me; and I *knew him not*; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water. And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him. And I *knew him not*; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and
{3}
borne witness that this is the Son of God" (verses 30 - 34). This is what we should keep before us in this first reading, the negative side, throwing into relief what is in mind on the positive side in our enquiry.
J.A.P. When he says, "I knew him not", is he referring to His eternal personality?
S.McC. There is no doubt he is not alluding to Him on natural lines, for John stood related to the Lord on the natural side. It seems to refer to something very definite on John's part, when he says, "a man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me; and I knew him not".
The moral side is in mind in the first negative suggestion, the condition of the world morally, the created sphere into which the Lord came, "the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not". It is the moral side in regard to knowledge. Then it is the religious side in the second reference, those that came out of Jerusalem -- the priests and Levites who should have known, but John says, "whom ye do not know", which suggests the religious darkness marking that setting. But when we come to the baptist, it is more an allusion to the exclusion of the natural side in the matter of this knowledge.
M.G.W. Is the acquirement of positive knowledge reached by way of our *seeing*, which is the result of the work of the Spirit in us in the way of enlightenment? I was thinking of verse 34. John says there, "I have seen".
S.McC. Yes, new birth in its radical character in us brings about the ability to see things which we did not see before. Seeing is brought much before us in John's ministry, and it is important that our eyes should be open
{4}
spiritually to see what comes within our range in the movements of divine Persons in this gospel.
A.P.B. Is one of the first steps in acquiring knowledge the realisation that we are without it?
S.McC. Yes, the negative side would throw that into relief -- the great need there is for the true knowledge of God, which John's gospel would bring on to our view, beginning with this Person. It is important that we should get an impression as to the divine Personality that is before us here in the Son -- the Word as He is referred to. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". Our affections need to be quickened in relation to the Person of Christ. John's gospel makes a lot of the Person of Christ.
J.S.E. Had you something further in your mind in alluding to these three categories: the world, and the religious circle, and what is natural?
S.McC. I think John is stressing the negative side as he opens his ministry, to bring into relief what was in the assembly; the realm to which we belong. The Lord has great pleasure in referring in chapter 17 to what is known in that realm. He says, "They have *known* that all things that thou hast given me are of thee" (verse 7); "they … have *known* truly that I came out from thee" (verse 8); and "these have *known* that thou hast sent me. And I have made *known* to them thy name" (verses 25, 26).
J.S.E. Is it of any interest that Peter's wife is not referred to in this gospel?
S.McC. Say what is in your mind in that regard.
J.S.E. I was thinking of your allusion to John ruling out the natural element, and I was wondering if the Spirit
{5}
keeps us, in the narrative, entirely in relation to what is spiritual. I suppose most of us have, in our minds, ruled out the element of the world, and of the religious circle, but I wonder whether we sufficiently face this natural element. I wondered if John is a model to us in that way?
S.McC. I think he is. He would help us to see the importance of coming under the hands of divine Persons, in view of the knowledge that we are speaking about. It is quite evident that we need divine help when it comes to the matter of the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
A.J.G. In his first epistle he says, "we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one" (@1 John 5: 19). Does that fit in with what we have before us here?
S.McC. Very good. That is an interesting passage. One was thinking of it in relation to this subject, because he immediately continues, as you will recall in the following verse, "And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life". It bears on what we have here. John would help us to see what we stand related to, in the environment that we are in -- we know that we are of God.
E.J.H. Would you say that these negatives of John the baptist's are all the more remarkable on account of what we might speak of as the excellency of John the baptist on the natural line?
S.McC. Yes, because John was a remarkable personality himself -- a distinguished personality, marked
{6}
out by an intervention from heaven. One who was filled with the Holy Spirit. He was a remarkable man in that way, and yet he says in such a precise, definite way, "I knew him not", showing that there is no pretension on John's part to advance any premium that he might have put on his link with Christ along natural lines.
A.W.G.T. I wondered if the fact that the Spirit of God uses two words for 'knowledge' or 'know' would help in the enquiry. One is conscious knowledge, and the other is objective knowledge?
S.McC. Yes, it does help. There is what we know objectively, and there is what we know consciously. It is remarkable that in verse 9 he says, "the true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man". It is not that every man has the knowledge. It is not the idea of enlightenment, as Mr. Darby points out (see note *f*); it is light to every man, sheds its light upon every man; that is, the bearing of it is towards all. But then we know that we need the Spirit in regard of knowledge that we are speaking of -- christian knowledge -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
J.R.U.B. Is the basis of all this, "born of God"?
S.McC. Well, we should never know divine things unless we are the subjects of divine operations. "Born of God" brings on to our view a class of persons here, that are distinctly marked out as having a right -- a right to take a certain place. In the light of John's epistle it would be a class of persons who know God, because they are begotten of God.
{7}
A.H.G. Is it in your mind that in approaching the knowledge of divine Persons the first essential is the appreciation of Christ, and who He is?
S.McC. That is what is particularly in one's mind, and that we should not miss the wonderful Personality that is before us in "the Word;" in this opening section of John's gospel. The very use of the appellation 'Word', reminds us that the thought of the revelation of God is a prime matter in John's mind. It is important that we should allow the Spirit of God to have His way in fastening our attention on the glory of this divine Person, of whom John the evangelist, in the Spirit's power, writes.
F.W.K. So would the negative in verse 18, "No one has seen God at any time", be important in that connection?
S.McC. Well, it would, because there is what we cannot know -- what we cannot apprehend. Even in regard to what we are saying as to our subject of the knowledge of divine Persons; we are not seeking in any way to intimate that we can know all that there is to be known of divine Persons, because we cannot, and we do not. There is what we do not know, and what we do not see, and John would remind us of that to begin with -- that we have limitations.
A.M.P. When it says, "the natural man ... cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned" (@1 Corinthians 2: 14), does it refer to what can be known?
S.McC. Yes, the Spirit of God is alluded to as the great instrumentality by whom God is revealing these things to us. He reveals them to us by His Spirit. "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (verse 10).
{8}
J.H. Have you in mind that the features you have named, what is moral and religious and natural, are calculated to militate against our apprehension of the presentation of the Person?
S.McC. Yes, we have to have a judgment in our souls as to this negative side, if we are to come in for the knowledge par excellence which John has in mind -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
J.S.E. Would it be in keeping to ask if there is in the three outstanding titles in these verses an off-set to the three spheres that you refer to?
S.McC. You mean "the Word", and "the Christ;" and what other one are you referring to?
J.S.E. I was thinking of the Word; and the glory of an only-begotten with a father; and then finally the Son of God.
S.McC. Yes, it is important that we should see the way in which Christ is presented in this section, first as "the Word". Then as the Son, the only-begotten Son, and the glory of an only-begotten with a father -- the truth of Christ's sonship, which the religious world does not understand at all. Then what we have coming in later in regard to "the Christ", and "the Lamb of God", and the "Son of God", and He "who baptises with the Holy Spirit". All that is important in our apprehension of Christ, over against these environments that are suggested in the negative statements that we have referred to.
J.L.F. Does it help to see that there are three more negatives that are referred to in verse 13 as to the way that the believer is born?
{9}
S.McC. Yes, it does. "*Not* of blood, *nor* of flesh's will, *nor* of man's will, but of God". We are reminded thus of the impotence connected with that range of things, so that in coming into the knowledge of God as revealed in this gospel, it is important that we should see how much depends on divine help.
A.W.G.T. I wondered whether that was not really the force of your calling attention to the negatives, that as we accept the negative side, it throws our thoughts and activities in the direction where what is positive can be secured. Is that what is in your mind?
S.McC. That is right, and the negative side can only rightly be understood, and fully apprehended, as the glory of the Person of Christ is apprehended. That is what helps us to see the negativity of what is in these different realms, or environments.
W.S.S. Does verse 14 bring before us what we may enter into?
S.McC. Well, it is an allusion to Christ's sonship. John's gospel does not treat of sonship in the saints, he would fasten our gaze spiritually on the uniqueness of Christ's sonship. But then in relation to what you say, we can see that that is the mind of God for us, because the mind of God for us as to sonship is set out in Christ in sonship in manhood.
W.S.S. Yes. I was thinking of the contemplation of the glory and the fulness that was there.
S.McC. Yes, how important that word 'contemplation' is in that regard. We need to allow our minds and our affections to be given over to this contemplative attitude.
{10}
J.A.P. Would you say something about verse 18 in regard to the relation between sonship and the declaration, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". His sonship there would of course be of a special character?
S.McC. Yes, only a divine Person could be referred to in this way, "the only-begotten Son". It is important to see that sonship not only hinges, as we have been taught, on Christ's humanity, but also on His eternal personality. It is an important thing to see that, because it is His eternal personality that gives a unique touch to His sonship. Only a Person who is divine could be referred to as He is in this section.
J.S.E. Do we come to the term "the only-begotten Son" by way of "the Word was God". And "the Word became flesh"? Is that right?
S.McC. Well, you mean the allusion in verse 1 to what He was in the pre-incarnate condition of Deity?
J.S.E. Yes, as you said, His essential Personality.
S.McC. Yes, so that the mediatorial system is involved in what we have in verses 14 and 18 -- the position the Lord has come into; taking a place, as He has, in incarnation, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us", and then being "in the bosom of the Father". The mediatorial economy is thus suggested to us in all its attractiveness to begin with; it comes before us officially in its operations later on.
J.S.E. I wondered if that is why we have no allusion to the Lord's nativity in this gospel, because there is a certain
{11}
way in which we can be affected naturally by that, is there not?
S.McC. That is so. So it is interesting to see the whole bearing of John's gospel as standing outside of dispensation. It is not what can be limited to dispensation, although what enters into it particularly characterises and affects our dispensation, but it cannot be limited to it, because of the Persons that are referred to in the revelation of God in it.
C.H. Would not what verse 1 gives us indicate what has to be borne in mind in this enquiry, that the One who was the Word -- known here as the Word -- the full expression of the mind of God -- was nevertheless God Himself?
S.McC. It is important that we should see this, and verse 1 is very much on one's heart in regard to what we are considering -- the way the appellation "the Word" begins this gospel, "In the beginning was the Word". It is not that He was the Word then, but John the evangelist, in referring to His position in Deity, uses the appellation "the Word". Not that He was the Word then, but that He was known in testimony here among the saints in that way. It seems to suggest at the outset of John's gospel the way the intelligence and affections of the saints were affected by what came within their range in this Person.
C.H. And thinking of the three Persons, we can only identify Them by the names They have taken?
S.McC. Yes, so that John's gospel presents to us God in the majesty of His Being, revealed in Christ; a glorious Being as He is, the supreme Object of worship. But He has come within our range in Christ, and is known in Christ,
{12}
known in this Person that is referred to as "the Word", particularly alluding to His ability -- His inherent ability to make God known.
A.J.G. So that Luke's gospel speaks of "those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on *the Word*" (@Luke 1: 2). That throws light, does it not, on the use of that expression?
S.McC. It does, showing how much they had been affected by what came out in the Person of Christ as to the knowledge of God, because "the Word" is particularly expressive in regard to the subject that is before us.
P.J.B. So would you say he is emphasising rather the truth of His Personality?
S.McC. Yes, it is a Person that is before us, His eternal existence is in mind, "In the beginning was the Word", that is before anything began to be He was, He existed. It is the greatness of the Person that is in our minds, and it says, "the Word was with God". Sometimes one wonders whether the significance of that lays hold of our minds and affections as it should. We must never forget the distinct Personality who was always there. His Personality is not lost sight of, we might say, reverently speaking, in conditions of abstract Deity. "The Word was with God" is a reference to His distinct eternal Personality.
W.O.S. Is that what is in mind in @John 17: 5, "Now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was"?
S.McC. Just so. We cannot say what the relationships were then, or describe what was there, but we do know in the light of @John 1: 1 and @John 17: 5 His distinct Personality. There is One God, but three divine Persons,
{13}
now known to us in the economy, distinguished for us in Their operations, in all the glory of the economy, in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the way in which God is revealed and known.
W.S.S. In that connection would you say a word about "his fulness" in verse 16? Does that fit into what you have just been speaking of?
S.McC. Well, that is alluding to manhood.
W.S.S. Quite so. I was thinking of what has come into revelation.
S.McC. Yes, but that would not be the fulness of Deity. We are speaking of how God has come into revelation, how the Deity has come near to us in Christ, in One who has the ability to make God known, to reveal God, as conveyed in the expression "the Word". When we come to verse 16, the allusion in that section is to the glory of His manhood, and to what is coming out in His position in sonship in manhood.
W.S.S. I was seeking really to bring out the difference. Would the fulness be connected with what we speak of as the economy, as distinct from what you have been saying in regard to His deity?
S.McC. Yes, I think that would be right.
W.S.S. I was thinking, while we have been speaking, of the beauty of the two settings. There is what has come into revelation, which we contemplate, and which we take on; and there is something that is beyond that, unreachable by us, but to be known in a certain sense as the distinct glory of the Person of whom we have been speaking.
S.McC. Yes, exactly. So that we are to keep in mind in that way the glory of the two settings -- what John refers
{14}
to in a past eternity, and what he refers to as before the disciples, and before our eyes in testimony, in the Lord's position in sonship in manhood.
W.S.S. I wondered if it would help just to have the two thoughts set before us in that way.
S.McC. It does, because in the first part of verse 1, John is alluding to a realm into which we cannot enter, into which the creature mind cannot penetrate; it is beyond our comprehension. Yet the Person who was there, eternally there, and His Personality standing out distinctly, and His deity too -- it says "the Word was God" -- is the Person that is before us in the incarnation. So that in this wondrous position of manhood God is so near us, because this Person is God.
E.J.H. And would the array of titles given to the Lord in this chapter move us in the spirit of worship in regard to that which has come within our range?
S.McC. It would. The presentation of a divine Person is calculated to elicit some feature of homage from our hearts. How wonderful it is that God should have come within our range in this way, in a Person who is referred to as "the Word", and a Person who is referred to as the "only-begotten Son". These two features of His glory are intended to help us in regard to our knowledge of God.
A.B. Would these two titles, "the Word" and "the only-begotten Son", have in mind the thought of declaration? Only one who was "the Word" could really declare God, and would the declaration involve the shining out of His love?
S.McC. Yes, the declaration does, and God is made known, declared as the word is, "No one has seen God at
{15}
any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". The allusion would be back to "No one has seen God at any time", but the declaration proceeds from this setting, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". We are reminded of the way that God, and the knowledge of God, comes within our range. It is not a question of acts of power; it is not a question merely of attributes, great as they are; but it is God, known in this way, according to what He is in His nature. For God is love, the relationships intensifying the thought of love -- what God is in His nature.
A.J.G. Is it significant that although we do not get it in this gospel, we do learn from other gospels that immediately before the Lord entered on His public testimony, He was saluted from heaven as God's beloved Son?
S.McC. Very significant, and something that in the synoptic gospels is intended to arrest us right at the outset in regard to the service of Christ as He entered upon His public ministry.
F.W.P. How is it that John says to Him, "Art *thou* the coming one? or are we to wait for another?" (@Matthew 11: 3). The Lord in replying to that seems to tell him that he ought to have known?
S.McC. Well, John the baptist in the synoptic gospels reminds us of ourselves -- our infirmity and weakness in regard to knowledge. We all know how we begin to wonder just what the truth is, and where the truth is. There might be a good deal of that among the saints, you know, at times, when difficulties arise, as to where the truth really is, and what is the truth. That is just where John was
{16}
in the synoptic gospels, and the Lord graciously answers him. He says, in effect, 'Look at what is being done'. He does not tell him exactly what He was or who He was. He sends a message back as to what was happening -- the works of power, and the glory of them, that were taking place, and John was confirmed.
J.S.E. Do the two allusions to backbone meet that matter?
S.McC. Well, John's ministry being the backbone of all the gospels would help us as to the person of Christ.
J.S.E. I notice that John is never referred to in this gospel as John the baptist.
S.McC. Well, that is interesting; nor is there any record of any distinct failure on John's part. We say John the baptist to distinguish him in John's gospel from the evangelist.
J.S.E. So it is right, from the standpoint of this narrative, to view him apart from the place he had in an earlier dispensation, and to take account of him in relation to these high and glorious matters that are coming before us. He is singled out in this chapter as the only man who ever saw the Spirit, and that cannot be dispensational can it?
S.McC. No, it is not. He is unique in that way. John the baptist is unique in many ways, and I think it all bears on the excellence of the spiritual knowledge that John the evangelist has in mind that belongs to those that are under the divine hand.
E.J.H. A man sent from God -- under the divine hand.
S.McC. He was, showing the environment he came from, under the divine hand.
{17}
F.V.W. Is there any difference between this thought of declaration, and what is said in @Hebrews 1: 3 "the expression of his substance"? Is that the same idea?
S.McC. No. I think "*he* hath declared" is a formal service here, with a public bearing upon the whole position. It is not a reference to His public service so much in @Hebrews 1, but a reference to what He is, what He was, as Man. He was the expression of His substance -- it was there in Him as Man. But here it is a formal service that is in mind. Now if we could just dwell on the titles "the Word" and "Son" for a moment as bearing on this matter of knowledge that we are considering. The Word particularly refers to His ability to make the whole mind of God known, not only in One who can be the instrument of that service, speaking in a reverential way, but One who in Himself *is* God, and therefore can adequately express God and the whole mind of God. Then the title "the only-begotten Son" is a peculiarly endearing reference to the place that He has in divine affections, stressing the love side. The Word hardly stresses the love side, it stresses the side of intelligence; but the only-begotten Son stresses the love side. It is God coming near in His nature -- "God is love", and the economy is devised so that we should know and understand love, and see, that in making Himself known, God is drawing near in relationships intelligible to us, that are calculated to affect our souls.
A.J.G. In John's epistle it says, "he that abides in love abides in God" (@1 John 4: 16). Is that the great end that God has in mind?
S.McC. That is the great end in mind, that we are to abide in God, and John would help us to see the
{18}
importance of the love side, the important place that love has. We were seeing in the reading in the house this morning the place that faith and love have. John stresses both: the great necessity of faith, and the great necessity of understanding love.
H.F.R. It says in verse 14 that "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". Is that so that we might take account of love? I was wondering whether the word "became" would indicate His sovereign action, that He became flesh and dwelt among us, that is in nearness to us, tabernacled among us?
S.McC. Exactly, so that John gives us the real truth of the incarnation. "The Word became flesh". That is, it was His own divine act. Luke stresses the Holy Spirit's part in the matter, but John stresses that it was His own act. And so God has come near to us -- it is God -- the Deity is drawing near to us -- in this way, to be known in these intelligible relationships which are not only to affect our minds, but to affect our hearts.
E.J.H. Does that gloriously supersede the law mentioned in the previous verse?
S.McC. Yes, of course it does, because in the law, as Mr. Darby says, God did not come out to man, and man could not go in to God. ¦ But in Christ God has come out and man goes in, so it is a direct contrast.
E.J.H. And grace is mentioned first.
S.McC. Well, it is.
¦ J.N.D., *Notes and Jottings*, page 188
{19}
J.A.P. When you speak of relationships, do you refer to our relationships with the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit?
S.McC. I am speaking of their relationships with one another. How would we have known love had not the Father sent the Son, and had the Son not died? And then the Spirit comes into that too, in regard to what we are saying.
J.R.U.B. Is that why Mr. Darby hyphenates "only-begotten" in the New Translation?
S.McC. Well, it is a term intensifying the thought of endearment or affection. In what we are speaking of, and enquiring in relation to, in the matter of spiritual knowledge of divine Persons -- as to God, we have to be helped as to what comes out in Christ's sonship and manhood -- the excellence of what is there. It is there to help us in the knowledge of God, because God is love. How can we understand it? We cannot understand the pre-incarnate conditions of Deity, because God dwells in unapproachable light. Christ is before us here in manhood, and we can apprehend it here in these relationships intelligible to us. God is within our range in these relationships.
G.A.L. You have said nothing about verse 4. Is that not very important to our enquiry, "in him was life"? Is that one of the distinctive glories that is seen in Christ as incarnate?
S.McC. Well, it is. It is referring to what has come within our range in this Person in manhood, "the light was the life of men". I suppose the life would be the light of
{20}
love. That is what it would be, a testimony to the love that was there.
C.H. Referring to this matter of love again, it is clear from Scripture that love existed between Them in those pre-incarnate days. But the form or expression of it we shall never know, but that love has been manifested, as you said, in an intelligible form in the love of a father for a son.
S.McC. Quite so. We need to see that the love in the relative is no different from the love in the absolute. It is the same love, only that we do not understand the relations of divine Persons to one another in absolute Deity; but the relationships as seen in the economy we do apprehend -- the mediatorial economy, seen in the Father, the Son and the Spirit.
W.S.S. What you were saying about knowledge would refer to the relative side, would it not?
S.McC. Yes, of course; we are speaking of what is within our range. Knowledge would allude to what has come within our range, not what is without our range. So it is important to see that after the Word is mentioned in verse 1, we get all these conditions as to the world and men, the moral darkness in the world, and what is said in verse 5, "the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not". That is to be noticed, and then we get the reference to the only-begotten with a father, a figure of speech; and then in verse 18, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". After we get the affection side -- the love side, stressed. We get this position alluded to in verse 19 onwards, where there is such darkness as to the Person of Christ.
{21}
A.P.B. Might I ask for help as to the question of relationships between divine Persons in the economy. Is it right to say that the relationship between the Father and the Son is outstanding?
S.McC. Well, what is to be noted is that the relations between the Father and the Son are clearly defined, that is "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father". The Spirit's relations with the Father are not so defined. It is to help us to see the glory and attractiveness of the economy, that one divine Person enters a position where He is an Object of peculiar attractiveness, not only to men, but to divine Persons, to the Father and the Spirit. So that in verse 18, He is the peculiar Object of the Father's affections, but in verse 32 "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him". He is the peculiar Object of the Spirit's movements in that verse.
T.J.G. And does this emphasise these peculiar relationships now? Are we entitled to carry that back into the pre-incarnate state?
S.McC. Do you mean these relationships that we have been just alluding to?
T.J.G. Yes, the peculiar emphasis on the intimacy between the Father and the Son as it appears in some sections of Scripture, and the Son Himself as the peculiar object of the Father's affections and the Spirit's affections. Are we right in taking these back to the past eternity?
S.McC. Not in what we are referring to here in verse 18. We could not carry the relationships there back into these conditions that you refer to. The Lord does say in @John 17: 24, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of
{22}
the world", but that would allude to what was between divine Persons in that realm.
T.J.G. I just wanted to guard that; the fact that these relationships are emphasised in their peculiar setting, does not give us the right to think of them as being in the past eternity?
S.McC. No, we cannot carry back what is before us in the economy, in the way of relationship between divine Persons, into the abstract conditions of Deity, and make them descriptive of that, because they are not. They are descriptive of relationships that are linked with the revelation of God in the mediatorial economy into which He has come, where He is known in Christ.
M.P.S. Might I ask how far the last verse of chapter 17 goes -- "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them"? I have in mind your earlier reference as to the love not being different in the relative to what it is in the abstract.
S.McC. The love referred to there is the love of sonship, the love linked with sonship, the Father's love to the Son. We are to keep that clear, lest anyone should carry that back to the abstract conditions of Deity. What the Lord is alluding to there is the love between the Father and Himself. "The love with which thou hast loved me" is the love that is linked with the position of sonship in manhood, into which He came and in which He was the particular object of the Father's affections.
A.R.A. Does not @Colossians 1: 18 confirm what you are saying where it speaks of Christ as "the beginning"? He is the beginning.
S.McC. Yes, it does. That is what it says, does it not?
{23}
A.R.A. And as to all our thoughts of God, we have to begin with Christ in manhood.
S.McC. Yes, and John would help us to see, as he opens his gospel, the unique place that Christ has both as "the Word" and as "the only-begotten Son". We shall never know God apart from Christ. God being who He is, we are wholly dependent upon Christ in relation to the way He has been made known.
G.A.L. All this stresses the great thought of the incarnation, does it not, and this is what we are really considering, the Word become flesh. God coming into His own creation in the Person of the Son?
S.McC. It brings out, and should affect us as we think of it, that God is so near to us in this way that, as it says, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us", and then there is the reference to the relationships.
A.J.G. Would you say that there was in that way a certain intimation of what eternal conditions were going to be, for the tabernacle of God is going to be with men, is it not?
S.McC. Exactly. God will tabernacle with men. God will be with them, their God, so that we can see that the thought carries through, right into eternity.
L.T.R. Would you say a word as to the Lord's reference to Himself as "the Son of man who is in heaven" (@John 3: 13)?
S.McC. Well, it helps in this way, that it is always good for us to be reminded of the element of inscrutability in regard to the Person of Christ. There is that about the Person of Christ which is entirely beyond us, that we do not know, and we do not understand, and we just have to
{24}
be humble and simply accept it, and say that we do not understand it, because our minds are finite. How He could be here, and how He could be there, how can I understand it? And how could any of us explain it? We do well to be reminded in that way of the greatness of the Person, and what is inscrutable, and also of what has come within our range, so that we can understand it and apprehend it, as we are privileged to do.
W.S.S. So the two things must be kept distinct. I am thinking of the economy, first of all -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit made known to us. But there is that which is outside the economy, referred to in the beginning of the first chapter, to which you have been drawing our attention, which is beyond us, and yet which throws a certain lustre on all that is known. Would that be right?
S.McC. Yes, because what gives character to the economy is the greatness of the Persons that are before us in it. God has come into the economy. We are to be reminded that in what we have here -- the Deity -- God has drawn near, and is presented in Christ, and all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him.
W.S.S. I was wondering about that word fulness, as to whether it would link up with Colossians, that all the fulness dwells in Him bodily.
S.McC. @Colossians 1 relates to the fulness being pleased to dwell, a particular allusion to what we have here, and then @Colossians 2 would bear on what He is now. He is still a Man, and in Him, *towards us*, the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.
W.S.S. So that in contemplating the Lord in @John 1: 14 they were contemplating the fulness, I judge? It goes on
{25}
to say, "of his fulness we have all received" (verse 16). Is not all the fulness presented there, in the Lord?
S.McC. In verse 16? You are not linking that with the fulness of @Colossians 1, are you?
W.S.S. I am asking whether that would link with @Colossians 1, the fulness was pleased to dwell in him?
S.McC. Well, in @Colossians 1 it is the fulness of the Godhead, it is the Deity, but in @John 1: 16 it is not Deity.
W.C. Is not the fulness here, that which links on with "full of grace and truth"? That is what we have here, is it?
S.McC. Yes, it is what came out in Him as Man, in relation to His manhood.
W.C. And would that be to set us free for contemplation, because we need both grace and truth, being what we are, do we not? In view of our being set free to contemplate?
J.A.P. Do you think in the thought of the fulness of the Godhead you have what is inscrutable, as the Lord could say, "no one knows the Son but the Father" (@Matthew 11: 27). Whereas in this fulness there is that which we can apprehend -- the fulness as presented in @John 1?
S.McC. The thought of the fulness alludes to what is coming out, and alludes to what is before us in Christ. We should keep that in mind so that @Colossians 2 -- the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily -- represents what has come within our range. The "bodily" alluding to the fact that it can be apprehended.
C.H. It has been said that the fulness of a thing is not so great as the thing itself?
S.McC. No, exactly. We might allude now to the last section we read, where John says, "I knew him not", first
{26}
in verse 31, and again in verse 33. It should help us in relation to what is within our range in the mediatorial economy that is contemplated here, to consider whether we are arriving at things on natural lines, or arriving at what is here under the divine hand, and helped by divine Persons Themselves. John says, "and I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". The emphatic *He*, "*He* said to me … And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God". We see how John comes into the truth of the sonship of Christ here, because he comes under the hand of a divine Person and is instructed in regard to the Person of Christ.
{27}
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS (2)
S McCallum
@John 3: 7 - 13; @John 4: 10, 19 - 24, 46 - 54
S.McC. The subject we are considering together is that of the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things, as set out in this gospel. We considered the first part of the first chapter in the earlier reading, especially alluding to the way in which Christ is brought on to our view as "the Word", and as "the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father". All this is suggestive of what enters into the revelation of God as we have it according to John. Someone has said that we need to know John's God. These passages that we considered earlier bear on that -- how God has come within our range in Christ, involving such wondrous knowledge as it does, and also entering into our subject there is the thought of divine personality. We considered the Lord Jesus in the first chapter, and now He comes again before us in these scriptures that we have read, with added thoughts in the interim. We have now three individuals specifically before us. What we considered earlier bore on the general position, the light being shed on every man, and the declaration standing related to the whole public position. Now we come to the operational side in regard to individuals. We have Nicodemus, and the woman of Samaria, and the nobleman -- the courtier of Galilee. The brethren will notice that the Lord says to Nicodemus, "Thou art the teacher of Israel
{28}
and *knowest* not these things!" (@John 3: 10). The Lord brings up the matter of knowledge especially, with a man that professedly knew the Scriptures. For the teacher of Israel would be one who supposedly and professedly had the Scriptures in his hands, and, if he did not know them, should have known them, and the Lord says, "We speak that which we know" (@John 3: 11). The Lord is referring to a class of persons who know what they are speaking about, and He sets out the ideal Himself. Then to the woman of Samaria, the Lord says, "If thou *knewest* the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee" (@John 4: 10), again stressing the greatness of the Person. Then when the matter of the worship of God comes up, He says, "We worship what we know" (@John 4: 22). The courtier, you remember, was an observant man; he was following up the truth, and watching what was transpiring even to the reckoning of time, and it says that he knew. "The father therefore *knew* that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him" (@John 4: 53). We can see in these passages how knowledge is accumulating in regard to divine Persons and divine things. We have the Spirit and new birth in the first, and the Lord Jesus Himself presented to us again; then the Spirit and the worship of God in the second; and then the matter of healing. Perhaps these things may yield to us as we enquire together.
It is to be noticed in the first passage that we have read, that the element of inscrutability, both as to the Spirit and as to the Son of man, again comes out. There is nothing we need to keep more before us than the element of inscrutability in regard to divine Persons. There is much that we do not know, but there is much that enters into our
{29}
subject that we can know -- we are privileged to know, and therefore the importance of coming under the divine hand.
A.H.G. What is it you are referring to as to inscrutability?
S.McC. I was thinking of verse 8, "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is everyone that is born of the Spirit". Then there is the reference to the Son of man (verse 13), "And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven". The element of inscrutability is there. What one is thinking of is that it is good to be reminded, and to have constantly kept before us, our finiteness, because of the creature mind and understanding which marks us.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that that would keep us in lowliness of mind, and thus in a condition suitable for divine operations?
S.McC. That is just exactly what one is thinking of, the need for lowliness. When we come to the exalted subject of the knowledge of divine Persons, and divine things, we cannot presume to know everything -- we are reminded of our limitations.
A.Hn. Does verse 2 illustrate the pretentious religious mind? He says, "we know" and so on.
S.McC. It is important to see this side of Nicodemus, because he represents what is all around us, especially in a religious and pretentious way, and we have to judge it in our minds and hearts. What the Lord says takes the ground from under the feet of Nicodemus, so that he has no ground to stand on.
{30}
E.J.H. Would you say in that sense that he had to learn that he could carry nothing whatever over into the spiritual sphere?
S.McC. Yes, the Lord is teaching him as to this matter of new birth. There is nothing like new birth to take us down. If that was kept before our minds in the working out of soul history, it would have a very salutary effect. It removes all the bombast, pride and greatness of man, just that radical touch of new birth.
E.J.H. And yet it introduces us into something that is infinitely great.
S.McC. Exactly, introduces something into our beings that changes us throughout. It is the introduction of something that is going to affect every part of us -- affect the way we think, and what we do.
G.A.L. And it gives us the capacity to begin to understand, and drink in the glory of the Son?
S.McC. Just so. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. We get a suggestion there of the affinities that are produced in this action. It is not 'that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit', but "is spirit" -- it partakes of that character. We are dealing now with the knowledge of divine Persons in relation to a spiritual order of things. "God is a spirit", it is said, referring to the spiritual character of things we have to do with in God, as He has come within our range in this way.
P.H.H. How do you understand the three things? Those who are born anew (verse 3), and then born of water and of spirit (verse 5) -- are they cumulative?
S.McC. I would say they are. The one stresses the sovereign action of the Spirit in introducing into our
{31}
beings that which changes us entirely. The other introduces the moral element, does it not, "born of water", the negative side, and "of Spirit", the positive side. The one has to do with seeing, the other with entering. So it is cumulative in that way.
J.A.P. What does the Lord include in the thought of the earthly things, which Nicodemus ought to have known about?
S.McC. Well, new birth is an earthly thing. New birth is not exactly what we might call an eternal thing. What it produces, of course, has to do with eternal things. But new birth is something that is introduced in connection with the ways of God, and it is linked with the earthly side of the truth.
J.A.P. You are referring to @Ezekiel 36: 24 - 27?
S.McC. Yes, Ezekiel brings in the matter of new birth.
P.H.H. Would that be the principle that God has operated on from the beginning -- the principle of new birth?
S.McC. That is it.
P.H.H. It did not commence with christianity.
S.McC. No. From Adam onwards the principle of new birth applies, does it not?
C.W.O'L.M. Does the thought of the kingdom of God, into which new birth introduces us, become a basic matter now?
S.McC. It does. Especially would it help us to this matter of lowliness and subjection; the necessity of being humble, lowly and subject, to get the gain of the knowledge that we are considering in this gospel. The
{32}
kingdom of God would have a great place in the displacement in us of what would be contrary to that.
J.P.H. Is there a particular point in the reference to the flesh? "That which is born of flesh is flesh". Is there something besides contrast in that verse? I was just wondering whether we need to discern the workings of the flesh, which might come in in some subtle way to hinder us from arriving at the full thought of God?
S.McC. The Lord is dealing with things which lie at the basis of christianity -- what we have to learn in the very elements of things, the rudiments of things in christian teaching. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". It may take some of us perhaps some time to arrive at it, but it is introduced into the very rudiments of christian teaching.
J.S.E. Are we not being helped, as we go over the truth now, to arrive at what has already been established in detail and set out plainly in the Lord's own ministry?
S.McC. Yes, I am sure we are. One of the great services of the Spirit is to bring into our minds the Lord's own ministry here.
J.S.E. He covered, did He not, the whole range when He said to Nicodemus, "Do not wonder that I said to thee, It is needful that *ye* should be born anew". As though He is introducing something to Nicodemus which in its effect pertains to the whole earth.
S.McC. Yes, exactly. So that what we had earlier bore on what is set out in relation to Christ and His deity; first His place in the form of God, and then His place in manhood -- Object of divine delight, bringing out the spirit of excellence in His manhood in that delightful
{33}
environment referred to in @John 1: 14 - 17. But now, we are coming to what bears upon ourselves, moral conditions with and in ourselves, and how individual persons are coming under the divine hand. Nicodemus was a subject of new birth, but was in darkness as to it. He was in darkness as to what had really transpired in his own soul.
A.Hn. In connection with the moral side, would you say a word as to the distinction between seeing the kingdom of God and entering it?
S.McC. Well, it is one thing to see it, it is another to enter it. None of us could see anything apart from the operation of new birth. New birth brings about a total collapse. Mr. Raven likened it to a rent balloon -- the whole thing collapses, and that is what happens in new birth. ¦ Then there is the thought of being born of water and of Spirit which affects our ways -- our manners and deportment; it comes out initially.
E.J.H. Would you say that one of the greatest comforts of new birth is that it results in spiritual tastes, and a desire for a sphere in which they may find full scope?
S.McC. Well, it opens up the way to that. New birth does not give us much. We cannot build too much on it, but there is something mysteriously and inscrutably introduced which affects us radically throughout.
A.W.G.T. You would not say it goes so far as to bring in very much consciousness?
S.McC. The only consciousness it brings in is helplessness -- the consciousness of helplessness, and
¦F.E.R., N.S., Volume 5, page 33
{34}
weakness. Mr. Raven says, all it produces is a cry, a cry of want or pain,¦ then the glad tidings comes in with light, as to the Saviour, and as to the kingdom.
A.B. Do we need the Spirit to get practical deliverance? That is, the Spirit working in us, practically setting us free from the flesh, as we have in @Romans 7 and 8. So that the man says, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man" (@Romans 7: 22). Would that be somewhat akin to "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"?
S.McC. Well, that is further on than what we have here -- I mean in progressive teaching. New birth brings about a complete collapse of the man; and later, what often happens, I suppose, is the revival of the features that have been collapsed, so that there is disturbance within. We need to know deliverance as it is set out in those chapters that you refer to, @Romans 6, 7 and 8.
E.C.L. Does new birth bring in the ability to believe what is presented? What is developing in John is the believing on this Person.
S.McC. Yes, it makes us sensitive to divine impressions -- that is what new birth brings about. For instance it says in @John 1: 5, "The light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not". Well, what brings about a change in our souls? It is the action of new birth that brings about something that renders us sensitive to what may be presented in the glad tidings in the way of light.
¦ F.E.R., Volume 10, page 168
{35}
G.A.L. So that the cry from Saul of Tarsus was, "Who art thou, Lord?" (@Acts 9: 5).
S.McC. That is it -- "Who art thou?" There was still the element of darkness in his soul, but light was coming in.
A.H.G. Would this prepare us for divine teaching?
S.McC. Well, yes. I think we need to understand this principle as seen in Nicodemus, and the action of new birth in regard to a person like him, because it is laying the foundation for an act of faith in relation to the teaching running through these three passages. The Lord has in mind active faith, in which we progress in relation to the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.
A.W.G.T. In a certain sense it involves a kind of demolition, before anything positive can be built in the man?
S.McC. Well, it is the collapse of the man, but there is something positive introduced. You see it is not entirely negative; there is a positive thread introduced into the man's moral being which changes the whole texture.
W.J.B. Is it introducing something of very great potentiality?
S.McC. That is what it is. Something is introduced in principle into the man's make-up, his being.
W.O.S. Is that seen in verse 8, "Thus is everyone that is born of the Spirit"?
S.McC. Yes; it says, "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is everyone that is born of the Spirit". That is to be noticed, "thus is".
{36}
A.J.G. And is all this to emphasise the sovereignty of God? As it says, "The wind blows where it will". Is it not a question of our being brought back to the sovereignty of God?
S.McC. It is, and it should help us as to the divine Personality of the Spirit, in His part in this great operation; that is, making a way for us in regard to the knowledge that is within our range. We owe it to Him.
P.H.H. Does not being born of water and of the Spirit ensure that there is something pure there as to the source?
S.McC. That is it, so that the Spirit is not only the active agent in new birth, but He is the source of the new birth.
A.R. Would it be right to say then that new birth is entirely the sovereign work of the Spirit and is apart from human agency?
S.McC. Well, it is, and we see its bearing here, its full bearing here, on the religious side, not in @John 4, but on a man like Nicodemus, an instructed man, a man who is a teacher in Israel. But the Lord says to him, "Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things! Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen". It is striking how the Lord brings in the knowledge that was with Him, and those that are embodied in the "we" over against what marked Nicodemus, "and knowest not these things!"
F.W.K. Is new birth antecedent to what we had this afternoon as to those who were born not of man's will but of God? Would you distinguish, please?
S.McC. Well, new birth has to do with things in principle. When we come to "born of God" we come to
{37}
what partakes of the traits of the children of God; they come out in moral traits that mark them as of that generation, children of God.
A.W.G.T. That is shown in the reception of Christ, is it?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, so that you have something positive in that relation.
J.S.E. Have we to see, in this discourse with Nicodemus, how the Lord meets him point by point, so that He can come to this matter that you referred to as to inscrutability, and leaves him in the sense of his own complete ignorance of anything? Nicodemus first speaks as a patron, does he not. "We know that thou art come a teacher", and the Lord says that unless a man is born anew he cannot see the kingdom. Then Nicodemus speaks from a natural and logical standpoint, referring to the womb of his mother. The Lord then brings in the matter of entry, does He not, and then finally introduces the positive thing, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". Does not Nicodemus represent a person who has some status on a certain line, and that is all laid bare, whereas in chapter 1 those who received Christ have never had a status, have they?
S.McC. That is right. The Lord is taking this person up on the ground on which he stands as a teacher of Israel, and the Lord is stressing this matter in a peculiar way with him, as if it is to affect Nicodemus in regard to the matter of his knowledge of divine things and divine Persons.
E.J.H. Do you get three features running through these passages which you have called attention to? That is, what
{38}
is religious in Nicodemus; what is moral in the woman; and then the side of what is natural with the courtier?
S.McC. Yes, all that runs through the passages that we have read together, especially stressing the Lord's hand-to-hand service, if I might reverently say so, in regard to individuals. That is, the Lord is viewed here as taking persons on in relation to the different states of soul that are expressed in these passages.
A.H.G. In that way, do we need to apprehend the Lord as Teacher? Nicodemus says, "thou art come *a* teacher". Has that to be corrected to see the greatness of the Lord in this way as Teacher?
S.McC. Yes, that is interesting, in contrast to what the Lord said to him, "Thou art *the* teacher of Israel". The Lord does not say, 'Thou art a teacher of Israel', but "Thou art *the* teacher of Israel". Nicodemus was no ordinary man; he must have been a man of good capacity, as men would speak of him, and all around we see that. But the Lord takes him up and speaks very faithfully to him about this matter of new birth, which really leaves Nicodemus wondering as to where he is.
H.F.R. Three times the Lord says to him, "I say unto thee". I was thinking of what you were saying as to the feature of 'authority' in the economy, how the Lord comes in in such a distinct way to teach Nicodemus.
S.McC. How important that is; it is the Word that is speaking -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". The One who is anointed to unfold the whole mind of God. He is here speaking, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee", and who can speak after Him?
{39}
A.Hn. Would you say a word as to why, with such sterile material as Nicodemus seems to be, He speaks to him of love in a way that He speaks to no one else, "For God so loved" and so on?
S.McC. Well, surely it is an example set before us, as to whether we are learning. There are those that are always learning, but never seem to come to the knowledge of the truth, and Nicodemus represents that side. He is not extricated from the associations and links in which he was held. This knowledge that the Lord introduces in His ministry and service to Nicodemus should have had an extricating effect with him.
E.J.H. Do you think that the Lord chose Nicodemus, as having everything religiously, as best setting forth the necessity of new birth?
S.McC. Just so. So that we might not be inclined to say, 'Well, they are the worst', the Lord introduces it in relation to the best. Because that is where the trouble lies, it is in persons like Nicodemus, who do not feel they need help. All around we see that, and we have to judge it in our own hearts as a principle.
A.J.G. I was just wondering, as you were remarking about the Lord taking on each of these cases individually, whether we get the secret of that later on, where the Lord says, "All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out" (@John 6: 37). So that is not each soul the subject of the Father's giving, and of the Lord's taking on and instructing, and of the Spirit's operations? Is not each soul the subject of the operations of the whole Godhead?
{40}
S.McC. Well, exactly, so that it sets in wondrous relief the blessedness of the economy from that side -- not only the love that has come into expression in what divine Persons are towards us, as shown in the Father's love to the Son, and the Son laying down His life, but this matter of taking us in hand in view of our instruction in the knowledge that has come within our range in the economy. I think it is most affecting in that way.
G.A.L. So that the Spirit quickens in new birth those whom the Father has chosen in Christ from before the world's foundation. Does it not emphasise, as you were saying, the divine Personality of the Spirit as well as that of the Son?
S.McC. Well, it does, and I am sure that we must not eliminate the element of responsibility from new birth in the preaching, because the Lord is speaking to Nicodemus, and saying, "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew;" -- that is, the emphatic "*ye*".
Ques. What is the difference between being born anew, and born of water and of Spirit?
S.McC. Well, that was asked at the beginning of the reading, and reference was made to the sovereign action of the Spirit in new birth, being born anew. The other is a little further on in the teaching as to the moral side.
Ques. A further operation of the Spirit?
S.McC. Except any one be born of water and of Spirit brings in the character of the thing now.
C.H. Does that involve the teaching of death -- born of water?
S.McC. Yes, the water is the negative side; we would have that in mind -- the separative side.
{41}
E.J.B. Would you say a little more about the side of responsibility in new birth?
S.McC. Well, here it is. The Lord is saying to Nicodemus, so that Nicodemus should be arrested, "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew". He is laying it on him.
W.J.B. So that it would be right to draw attention to it in the preaching, would it not?
S.McC. Well, certainly, especially bearing on persons with religious airs, and religious thinking and feelings.
T.J.G. Is the responsibility, then, to recognise the necessity for new birth, not that the person can do anything about it, but must recognise that it is an absolutely essential thing?
S.McC. Well, that is it. The Lord lays it upon him in that way. The way that it comes in, in relation to a religious man, is important. The worst thing to bring down in any of our minds is the religious element, if it gets enthroned in any shape or form, as the religious and legal element did at Galatia; it is a most difficult thing to bring down. The Lord is stressing the radical side of the truth in connection with that feature.
P.H.H. I suppose the full answer to being born of water would work out in baptism, would it not?
S.McC. Well, it would; there is the link there with baptism, the moral element entering into baptism.
P.H.H. So that when the light of being born of water and of Spirit is recognised, you can understand that the moral and responsible element must enter into the person.
S.McC. That is right.
{42}
R.C. Is the Lord laying the responsible side before him in verse 12?
S.McC. Well, that is the point too. He goes on teaching, and says, "We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness. If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?" Now notice the Lord uses a plural pronoun "we" in verse 11, but the personal pronoun "I" in verse 12. He is speaking in a general way in verse 11, of a class of persons that have knowledge according to God, "We speak that which we know". But then when He comes in verse 12 to "If I have said the earthly things to you", He is alluding specifically to what He said to Nicodemus.
W.S.S. Does that put responsibility upon us, in relation to the teaching today?
S.McC. Well, it does, so the Lord says, "and ye believe not". This matter of active faith in relation to the teaching is important.
W.S.S. I was thinking how we need to take home to ourselves what is said to Nicodemus, that we may be marked by believing, as the truth is unfolded.
S.McC. Well, that is the point, I think; that is the lesson for us. Mr. Raven said, as you will recall perhaps better than I do, that if a man goes off in his latter years he always wondered if there was something rotten in his foundation. ¦ Well, when we have difficulty as to the truth we might well go back and see whether we have what the Lord is saying here in the teaching.
¦ F.E.R., N.S., Volume 14, page 13
{43}
B.H. In the matter of learning and receiving the truth, do you distinguish the part played by the spirit and the mind?
S.McC. I am not sure that I follow you.
B.H. I was wondering if it was a faculty that is deeper than the thinking faculty. "For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?" (@1 Corinthians 2: 11); new birth coming in, in connection with the spirit. I wondered if there was something to be learned besides acquiring knowledge.
S.McC. Yes. The element of new birth entering into a man affects his thinking faculties as well as affecting him throughout, so that he does not think in the way he formerly thought.
A.W.G.T. Is that not involved in being born anew -- that means, from top to bottom?
S.McC. Well, that is the point. It is, as the word has been used, radical; that is, it is throughout, from top to bottom.
W.J.B. The fact that we make room for the Spirit does not in any way eliminate the mind, does it? It means that we think with subject minds.
S.McC. That is it, and renewed minds, minds that have been affected by new birth.
J.A.P. Was it said that new birth is not a matter of divine sovereignty?
S.McC. Who said that?
J.A.P. I am asking whether you are saying that, suggesting that there is responsibility connected with it?
S.McC. We did not put it that way. What was said was that in stressing divine sovereignty in the act of new birth
{44}
we must not eliminate entirely the side of responsibility, and that it is presented to a responsible man, and his responsibility is stressed in relation to it. "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew". That was what was said.
H.W. Does the word "*ye*" refer to the Jewish nation?
S.McC. It refers to the religious man, but he is taken up by John the evangelist to show us the best in a religious way.
H.W. And would you be free in the preaching of the gospel to say emphatically, "*Ye* must be born anew"?
S.McC. Most certainly I do. Especially if you are having to do with a religious person, built up in his religious thoughts, or a religious audience, it certainly would be quite in keeping to stress "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew".
A.W.G.T. That is, you are not putting the onus of being born on the person, but making room in his mind for the fact that he needs to be born anew?
S.McC. Well, that is the point.
J.P.H. Does Peter touch on it in @1 Peter 1: 24, 25? He says, "Because all flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass … this is the word which in the glad tidings is preached to you". Does it come into the preaching?
S.McC. Yes, it is very interesting the way Peter puts it; it would involve an action which affects the intelligence. He says, "being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God" (verse 23). That should affect the intelligence of the person.
{45}
F.W.K. Would it be right to say that all men are responsible, but that new birth will give men to realise their responsibility? Is it the element of new birth that would give souls some measure of light and responsibility?
S.McC. Well, new birth gives us our first initial touch, you might say, which brings into our souls our feeling of responsibility towards God.
A.J.G. Is not all this instruction to Nicodemus to prepare the way in his soul to receive the light of the cross -- the Son of man lifted up, and the gift of God in eternal life to those who believe?
S.McC. That is it, so that the Lord says as He continues, in verse 12, "how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe? And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up". How searching the teaching is now; the Lord is building up in the teaching.
G.A.L. I was wondering whether it was desirable to see that this chapter is teaching rather than preaching.
S.McC. Well, it is. It is the Lord teaching Nicodemus, but that does not eliminate the insistence on the new birth in the preaching.
G.A.L. I can understand that. I was thinking that it comes out in the setting of teaching, that is all.
S.McC. That is how it comes out in @John 3 here, but Peter says, "this is the word which in the glad tidings is preached unto you", involving what we have here, although it is really more advanced.
{46}
W.J.B. It was really the word through Isaiah, was it not?
S.McC. You mean all flesh is as grass?
W.J.B. I mean, in principle, that is what is implied in @Isaiah 40.
S.McC. Peter was referring to that, no doubt, in what he is alluding to.
Ques. Did you say that Nicodemus was born anew although ignorant of it?
S.McC. Yes. Nicodemus is one in whom new birth has taken place.
J.H. So that verse 21 would apply to Nicodemus in that regard?
S.McC. Yes, "he that practises the truth comes to the light". Although we cannot say much about Nicodemus, we must not build too much on him either, as to practising the truth, but nevertheless we give full credit for what is there, and the Lord is treating him now as one in whom new birth has taken place.
J.S.E. Does the Lord, in this conversation, bring Nicodemus low in himself in relation to the matter of new birth, and then find pleasure in expanding the teaching to the points to which Mr. G. has referred, in the Son of man being lifted up and God so loved the world. In each of those cases He brings in the great matter of believing. Is not the earlier part of the chapter what you have rightly called the laying-low principle, in order that there might be more room for these expanded things which are connected with the Lord as the Son of man and God's only-begotten Son?
{47}
S.McC. I am sure that is right, so that in regard to what we have been saying, while the Lord is teaching Nicodemus patiently in regard to the truth, He is seeking to expand him in regard to the whole gospel vista. What is before us here in this section is the great vista in the gospel, and especially is it needful over against popular evangelism, which does not deal with the state of man. The Lord is bringing in what is essential to help us in regard to the great vista of things in the gospel, "thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish but have life eternal". As Mr. Darby says (see note *b*), the sense would be that He has loved men in view of eternal life. This is to expand our vista in the gospel, so that we preach the gospel with this kind of vista.
A.Hn. Mr. Stoney used to remark, you remember, that we change our man,¦ and does the teaching of this chapter really help us in that, and so liberate us in view of the service of God?
S.McC. Well, it does, so that we should get on to the matter of what comes in in chapter 4.
P.H.H. Do you mind first saying another word about inscrutability attached now to the Lord? Is it right to say that in what the Lord has said as to "the wind blows where it will" He is really bringing forward the inscrutability of the Spirit? But then He says, "no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of
¦ J.B.S., N.S., Volume 2, page 465; Volume 6, page 23
{48}
man who is in heaven". Does that prepare our minds for greatness in the person of Christ which we can never compass, making us worshipful?
S.McC. It does, and it is important to keep that in mind in regard to divine Persons; especially it would save us from limiting divine Persons, or fixing upon divine Persons any position that They may take, or limiting Them to a position that They take. We need special help as to that, that even as we think of certain things and positions that They have taken up we must always bear in mind that there is something beyond that that we cannot compass.
P.H.H. Does the very title Son of man tend to make us think perhaps that the Lord Jesus has come so near to man, to take everything up for him, that we might possibly lose sight of the greatness of the Person who has done it?
S.McC. Well, exactly, so that it is important to see how the Lord brings it in here, "No one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven". Now some one might say, 'Well, explain that'. How can we explain it? We cannot explain it, we are just to believe it; there it is in the Scripture. How the Lord could be there, and how He could be here, how could we explain it?
P.H.H. And yet it serves to magnify all the heavenly things which He is about to speak of.
S.McC. Yes, so that we are reminded in speaking of the Lord as Man, and speaking of Him as a Bondman that we must be careful not to limit Him to that -- there is that which is beyond either of these positions.
C.M. Would you say more in regard to the inscrutability of the Holy Spirit?
{49}
S.McC. Oh, just that it says, "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is everyone that is born of the Spirit". We are reminded of the element of inscrutability in regard to divine operations; the Spirit operating in relation to new birth. We cannot explain it or give account of it -- there it is.
We must move on to chapter 4 to consider this passage which brings in the Spirit in the figure of the living water, and then knowledge in that relation. Then the matter of the worship of God, as the woman brings it up and the Lord speaks to her about it; and the matter of healing. The thought of faith -- active faith is important in all this. The Lord says to her (verse 10), "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee" -- that is, she is reminded now of the Person who is speaking to her. Again, we might say it is the Word that is speaking to her, the One in whom the full mind of God is made known -- is revealed.
E.J.H. The woman says, "when *he* comes he will tell us all things".
S.McC. That is it, and the Lord says to her, "I who speak to thee am he" -- showing the greatness of the Person who is there.
E.C.L. Do you get the thought of responsibility being raised with the woman directly she says, "Give me this water", which the Lord had proposed? The Lord raises these moral questions with her: "Go, call thy husband, and come here". Have these things to be settled first before we can receive anything?
{50}
S.McC. Yes, they have. Showing the importance of the adjustment of moral matters. The Lord brings up the thought of the living water first; that is, He does not say, 'He would have given thee the Holy Spirit'. He says, "He would have given thee living water". As we have pointed out, He is treating the woman according to her capacity as a learner. We have to learn how, with certain persons, to treat them according to their capacity, and that is what we have here; but the figure in the living water suggests the Holy Spirit.
J.S.E. In a certain way, would it be safe to say the Lord exhibits more grace in His dealing with this moral wreck, than He did with the religious assumption of Nicodemus? There are radical statements, are there not, in chapter 3, but are not the statements somewhat more attractive in this chapter?
S.McC. Well, they are. The patience with which He takes her on and serves her is most affecting, especially the fact that He says to such a disreputable woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him". A woman of social disrepute, and yet the Lord is stressing the thought of His Person -- who He is, to her.
A.H.G. Have you a word as to what is involved in drinking? In the previous incident it is a matter of believing; here it is a question of drinking?
S.McC. Well, it brings up this matter of the Spirit. In regard to the feature of knowledge of divine Persons and divine things that we are considering, this matter of the Spirit is important, because it is going to involve inward
{51}
deliverance from what is morally degrading and corrupting.
A.J.G. And not only deliverance, would you say, but also satisfaction?
S.McC. That is it, so that we have the positive suggestion in the living water of what would be satisfying.
E.J.H. Has it not been described as satisfaction over against gratification?
S.McC. Yes, she no doubt was seeking to gratify certain desires and lusts in her way of living, but the Lord would bring her to a satisfied state of things, a region of satisfied desires, as has been said.
E.J.B. Are there two stages: one the Lord giving, and the other our drinking? The Lord gives the living water, but then it is "whosoever drinks" -- on our side.
S.McC. Yes, showing the importance of our side. So that the Spirit is in mind in this chapter, and it is an essential part of what we are considering. The necessity for the Spirit; not the necessity for new birth here, but the necessity for the Spirit, in setting us up in purified relations with God. That is the teaching here -- purified relations with divine Persons.
A.H.G. So that drinking would involve appropriation would it? And is that not sometimes where we are lacking in relation to the divine service, because there has been so little with us on the line of appropriation?
S.McC. That is it. We need to drink, we need to be on the line of desire in this way. She says, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw" -- come *here* to draw. She already has a judgment of what she has been going on with, feeble as it may be, but there it is, and
{52}
"Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here". Come here. That is, He is going to bring her back after the moral issue is searched -- bring her back to this position.
A.B. Would the drinking bring in the service of the Spirit in engaging our hearts with Christ, so that we learn to find satisfaction in Him? And then the further thought of the Spirit becoming a fountain in us, giving spring to our affections. Is that needed if God is to be served rightly?
S.McC. Oh, it is, because a living state of things is in mind, especially in view of the service of God, and the Spirit is introduced in that way, setting out what is living, as living water. Why should the Lord stress living water, if it is not that a living state of things is in mind. And the service of God necessitates a living state of things.
C.H. And the retention of the person -- "the Father seeks such" -- that is the persons, is it?
S.McC. Well, it is an important thing to see that -- the kind of persons -- for she says in verse 20, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the *place* where one must worship". Jesus says to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". Notice how He brings in the Father now; this is an added touch in the instruction, "worship the Father". "Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth". Now the Lord is bringing in the refined side of knowledge in christianity here. He brought it in in speaking to Nicodemus, enlarging our outlook in
{53}
connection with the glad tidings -- the great gospel vista. Here He is bringing it in in relation to the woman -- knowledge in connection with the refined inward side of the worship of God.
M.P.S. Is there something for our help in the woman's occupation with place -- as to the word "Come *here* to draw;" "our fathers worshipped in *this* mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the *place* where one must worship"?
S.McC. Well, I think it is important to see that the Lord is seeking to remove from our minds geographical thoughts and material ideas. There is nothing more important than that material and physical thoughts should be removed in this matter of the worship of God, because God is a spirit -- not 'the Father is a spirit', -- that is not the point here. "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth". That is, the worship of God is spiritual, not material.
H.F.R. Do the three Persons come in in this scripture leading up to God -- I mean, there is the Lord Himself as the Giver of the living water, and then there is what the water becomes in him, and then the Father seeks?
S.McC. Exactly. So we are reminded again of the full scope of the activities of the Persons of the Godhead in relation to this matter, all serving with a great end and objective in mind. The way the Lord brings in the Father here is instructive: God before us in that relation, in the thought of the Father; God coming into a certain relationship in view of a full end that is in mind.
A.J.G. Does the fact that the Lord says, "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in
{54}
spirit and truth" show how God has in mind that we should be in wonderful affinity with Himself?
S.McC. That is it. It would bring up the need for the Holy Spirit, do you not think. How could we worship God in this spiritual way without the help of the Holy Spirit?
A.J.G. Quite so.
P.H.H. Were you going to say some more about the Father?
S.McC. Oh, I think it is important that we should see the Person that is presented to us in the Father. It is not exactly the relationship here -- it is the Person, the wonderful glory of that Person in the Godhead, that God is presented to us in that Person.
P.H.H. So graciously.
S.McC. Yes, so graciously.
E.J.H. Do we see the skill of the Lord as Teacher in that He transferred her thoughts from "our fathers" to "the Father"?
S.McC. Well, He is bringing in something that she had never heard of before; she had never heard of *the* Father. It is remarkable how the Lord brings the name in without explaining anything about it. He says, "when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father". Is it not a credit to the work of God in the woman? He is treating her as a subject of the work of God, so that she would take in this knowledge that He is imparting as to "the Father", involving the place that Person has in the economy. God is presented to us in *the* Father.
{55}
W.S.S. And I suppose it would bring in all that is under the Father -- the many families, what is under the Father's hand, so to speak.
S.McC. The Father puts His impress on every family.
J.S.E. Is it interesting that the Lord removes from her mind first of all the two places -- this mountain and Jerusalem; and then He removes from her mind two classes, ye and we, coming to *they*, who worship the Father, "the Father seeks such as his worshippers"?
S.McC. Very good.
J.S.E. So that the Lord arrives at a point with her when He accepts the position of being a Jew. But then He goes further and says, "the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers". It does seem, does it not, that He is attracting her now away from place, and away from classes, to bring her into the one and only setting where this matter of worshipping the Father can operate. Is that right?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, so that all the knowledge that is being imparted in the teaching is leading to this final result that the Lord has in mind in the thought of worship. First of all, worship in the special way to which He refers in verse 23, "the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers". That is, God as having come in in this way, in that special name by which He is known in this dispensation. But then the Lord does not leave her there, He brings in the great general thought as to God. He does not leave her without an
{56}
impression as to the general thought of God -- God in His majesty and greatness involving all three Persons. "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth". We approach God in a known relationship -- in the relationship in which we stand to Him in sonship, revealed as He is in the wondrous name of Father in the economy. But then, that is not the final thing -- there is the great thought as to God, Christ's God, the God who has come within our range in Christ, and who is now the great exalted Object of worship. "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth".
H.F.R. Are we limited to the economy, or is there any sense in which we worship God as inscrutable?
S.McC. We are always regulated by the economy, because we have only creature minds and understandings. The only way in which we have to do with absoluteness is as alongside of Christ, hearing Him say, "my God". We get a sense of what is beyond us in that, and yet He goes on to say, "and your God". We worship God as having made Himself known -- not in conditions, or an environment where He is unknown to us.
C.H. But it is the same God.
S.McC. It is the same God, that is what we should see; no less than God, so that, as the teaching has very persistently drawn our attention to it, we cannot limit God to a relationship into which He comes. We have to do with Him and approach Him in a known relationship, and stand before Him in that known relationship, but the God who has come into that relationship is the God who is the
{57}
Supreme Object of worship, the Supreme Object of all things.
A.J.G. The very fact that He has initiated the economy itself compels worship, does it not?
S.McC. It does. It is all directed towards that end.
W.B.H. Would you say, the more we appreciate the great thought of the Father, the more ready we shall be to move on into the appreciation of this great thought of God?
S.McC. We shall never know God, as God, rightly, if we do not appreciate the thought of the way in which He is presented in the Father.
W.M.B. Does the thought of the Father seeking, bring out the peculiar grace of this dispensation?
S.McC. It does. That is the whole point in the presentation of the Father in this way; it is God known in grace, and the seeking is very affecting in that way. We think of seeking in @Luke 15, in regard to man's need, eventuating in God's pleasure of course; but the grace of it here, "seeks such" to worship, is affecting as you think of it.
J.A.P. In the New Testament you get the thought of God the Father, or God our Father, or God and Father, more than forty times; is that to stress what you have been saying, that we worship Him in a known relationship? That occurs constantly in the epistles.
S.McC. Yes. We never have to do with God outside of a known relationship. We are always in sonship. If we think of manhood in the final stage of the service of God, it is manhood in *sonship*. It always is so; but the God who has come into the relationships we have been speaking
{58}
about, is the God of whom Scripture says, "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever" (@Romans 11: 36). That is, God as God is the supreme end in the service of God -- the worship of God.
C.H. That is, we do not limit God to any name or position He has taken?
S.McC. Well, that is the point. God must be greater than any relation He enters into or upon.
A.M.P. But we may worship God as inscrutable, may we not?
S.McC. Well, in the sense of the doxologies, yes.
A.M.P. And in our hymn book we sing, 'O how inscrutable, Yea, how unsearchable' (`48:1).
S.McC. Yes, exactly. Paul in @1 Timothy 6: 15, 16 utters such a doxology, and there are other doxologies that bear upon that.
A.M.P. Although our relationship remains a known one, and we are sons in relation to the Father, yet we may reach out in our worship to the God who is inscrutable?
S.McC. Well, it is the God who is inscrutable that has come within our range in Christ, you see. What we have to be careful of is that we do not make the terms of the economy applicable to abstract deity, and make them descriptive of the inscrutable form of God, because they are not.
N.K.M. Why is the Lord stressing not only "in spirit" but in "truth" also -- "must worship him in spirit and truth"?
S.McC. Well, it is to bring in the side of what is spiritual as opposed to what is material. And then the necessity for truth -- that involves adjustment. The truth
{59}
has come in in Christ. Christ is the truth, and the Spirit is the truth. The truth has to do with the asserting of what is in another, and Christ asserts what is true in regard to God and in regard to man, so that He is said to be the truth. He is the truth objectively, as the Spirit is the truth subjectively in the saints here according to @1 John 5: 6.
J.S.E. Is it right to say that that touch from the Lord to the woman has such force to her that she can afford to leave her waterpot? All that comes in between those points is to do with the disciples, is it not?
S.McC. Well, exactly.
J.S.E. But is it not helpful to see that the woman is affected by that very word, and she abandons all that she had held in relation to what was material, and goes forward with the power of that impression in her soul?
S.McC. That is it, so that if we had been there it would have been a very active reading after verse 24; but the woman goes on and says, "I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when *he* comes he will tell us all things. Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am he". And that is all that we get. The Lord leaves her with that impression, and that impression remains with her -- "God is a spirit". Without opening up all that is involved, He just left it upon her mind and her spirit, "God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth".

{61}
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS (3)
S McCallum
@John 6: 66 - 71; @John 8: 31 - 59; @John 9: 24 - 34
S.McC. The subject that is before us is the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things. We come now to a very solemn and sobering section of John's gospel, but a section in which knowledge shines, both in Peter and in the man of @John 9, and in the Lord Himself when He speaks in chapter 8, as in conflict with the Jews. There is the drift of unbelief in chapter 6, but in the midst of it, and over against it, we have the wonderful feature of knowledge in Peter, "We have believed and *known* that thou art the holy one of God". Then in chapter 8 the Lord alludes to knowing the truth and the truth setting us free. Then there is the stress on the greatness of His Person in that section -- the great "I am", as He refers to Himself, "Before Abraham was, I am". Then the delightful setting in @John 9 of the subject of the works of God -- the blind man, and the remarkable way in which knowledge appears in him, which may yield help for us. "He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I *know*, that, being blind before, now I see". He could speak of one thing he knew, anyway, and he held to that whatever they did to encroach upon his testimony, and to turn him from the truth. He held to what he did know, and the Lord comes in as he is cast out and imparts further knowledge to him. So as we begin with this section in @John 6 we should
{62}
see the way the work of God is appearing among the saints, and also, especially as John would have us from beginning to end, we should keep before us the glory of the Person of Christ. It is important, I think, that the Spirit of God uses John to keep us constantly reminded of who the Person is: that He is God, and nothing less than God. He begins with that, and there is a person at the end saying, "My Lord and my God" (@John 20: 28). We may say that is on a lower platform, but nevertheless it is coming out of the mouth of a man who is affected by the Person who is before him. So that John the evangelist would impress our minds with the glory of the Person of Christ: that He is never anything less than God, wherever we see Him, in whatever circumstances we view Him. He is never anything less than God, as to His Person.
A.P.B. Does that give a peculiar importance and lustre to all that He says and does, because it is God who is doing it and saying it?
S.McC. John would remind us in that way of the greatness of the Person, who is not bounded by this dispensation, but who is outside of all dispensation -- the I AM. In @John 6 He is before us in the blessedness of His manhood, as Peter says, and as has often been noted. It is not only a question of revelation here, it is a question of progressive knowledge -- what Peter arrived at, representing no doubt what there is in the body of the disciples, "we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God".
E.J.H. Is the personality of the "we" having believed and known, standing over against the unique and distinctive personality of "thou art"?
{63}
S.McC. Yes, John says, "Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away?" How much was bound up in these words. How the Lord values what there is in the twelve. It brings out what there was generally among them. And I think one thing that impresses one, in moving around amongst the saints, is what there is in the body of the saints.
A.J.G. Does this statement of Peter's involve that they have apprehended in Christ the perfect answer in manhood to all that God looks for -- "the holy one of God"?
S.McC. That is it. "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". God is holy, and we get an answer in Christ in manhood to what God is in that way -- the holy One of God. It has been said by Mr. Darby¦ that when the Father is mentioned in John it has to do with the expression of grace, but when God is mentioned it has to do with what He is, in holiness, and man in responsibility. So that the holy One of God would be a perfect answer on the responsible side in Man in Christ, to God's great thought.
A.J.G. The woman of Shunem said, "I perceive that this is *a* holy man of God, who passes by us continually" (@2 Kings 4: 9) but now there is *the* holy One of God.
S.McC. That is excellent -- the contrast in that way to what we have there, a holy man of God, and now *the* holy one of God. He is unique in that way.
W.B.H. Is there a suggestion of that in @Proverbs 9: 10, and @Proverbs 30: 3, "The knowledge of the Holy"?
¦ J.N.D., *Collected Writings*, Volume 25, page 192
{64}
S.McC. Well, it is interesting how that expression comes up in Proverbs, because the knowledge of the Holy would call for holiness on our side, and I think the apprehension of the holy One of God would have a progenitive bearing on us as to holiness on our side.
P.H.H. Do you mind saying a little about the name which comes a few times earlier in the chapter, "Son of man"? It says, for instance, in verse 62, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before;" and then earlier than that, in verse 53, "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood", and so on. Would you mind saying a little as to the bearing of that on this part of the teaching?
S.McC. Well, I think what you now refer to is very interesting, because the lines are becoming defined as to Judaism. Chapter 6, in its teaching, bears particularly on what is beyond the confines of Judaism. The Lord repeatedly refers to the world, as He says in verse 51, "the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world". Then, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before". The title "the Son of man" refers to His universal rights, and the universal side is before us in the teaching in @John 6. It is interesting that it precedes @John 7, where, as Mr. Raven taught us, the change of dispensation comes typically on to our view. ¦ In the same way Stephen, at the great transitional point in the change over, stresses the Son of man; his vision is filled with the Son of man in glory.
¦ F.E.R., N.S., Volume 1, page 3
{65}
P.H.H. Is it remarkable that in speaking to Nicodemus in chapter 3 the Lord says, as was quoted yesterday, what pertains to His Person as Son of man? "No one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven". Is it remarkable that He should have said that to one who was the teacher of Israel?
S.McC. It is. And is it not remarkable that He says this again in verse 62 to those who were not understanding the teaching? Now this is to be noted. He says it to Nicodemus in chapter 3, and He is saying it again to those that do not understand the teaching here. They are finding it hard. They say, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" It was not even a question of who can believe it; it is a question of "who can hear it". That is, they were not prepared to give it an entrance, and the Lord says, "Does this offend you? If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" It is, as we were saying at the outset, the way that our attention is constantly focused on the greatness of this Person, that He is nothing less than God, wherever we view Him. Even though He may be in the condition of manhood before us, we are always reminded of the greatness of who He is personally.
J.S.E. Is it right that when the Lord is speaking to His enemies in this gospel, He is very emphatic as to His place in the Deity, but when He has His own around Him He speaks more intimately in relation to His place in manhood?
S.McC. Well, that is interesting, especially as we shall see as we come into this section which involves conflict. The Lord is asserting His own Personality, asserting His Deity, and John's ministry, bearing on the last days, would
{66}
impress us with that. In the church councils of old, centuries ago, there was an attempt to protect the truth by the formulation of creeds, but it led into error, and was derogatory to the glory of His Person in that they put His sonship back into eternity, into the pre-incarnate conditions of Deity.
J.S.E. Yes. Was that because there was a lack of understanding that "the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God" (@1 Corinthians 2: 14)? Has it not always been damaging to try and adapt the truth to the mind of man naturally? Whereas this gospel shows that it is impossible for the mind to take it in, so that the opening of the narrative emphasises that the writer and those with him understood and valued the deity of Christ. "The Word was God", but the insistence on the term "I am" is invariably made by the Lord to His enemies, is it not? And is not that where our protection lies?
S.McC. It is, because the Spirit of God, in superintending the writing of this gospel, has in mind to protect that glorious Person who has come so low, who has entered into such a subordinate position involving relative inferiority. The Spirit of God protects the glory and greatness of His Person at every turn throughout the gospel.
A.Hn. Do you think that the speaking of the Lord in this gospel is calculated to impress our hearts with who He is? I was thinking of the remarkable passage in chapter 5: 18, where He has been speaking to His enemies, the Jews, and they sought to kill Him, because "he had … said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God". I wondered whether the ministry thus, as John records it,
{67}
has in mind to impress our hearts with the greatness of the Person of Christ.
S.McC. Well, it is important that we should see that the greatness of the Person of Christ is to be maintained. Therefore, care is needed lest we should advance anything that is derogatory to the Person of Christ, because we have to maintain in our hearts and in our thoughts the greatness of who He is -- not only who He was, but who He is. He is unchanged in His Person, and wherever we view Him His Person is the same.
W.M.B. Is that borne out by @Romans 9: 5 -- the reference to His coming in flesh, and then immediately guarding it, "who is over all, God blessed for ever"?
S.McC. Yes, it is; that is one of the great passages that guards the truth as to the Person of Christ, lest in thinking of the economy and the lowly subordinate place He has come into in the economy, we should think less of Him. The Spirit of God desires to guard it in our minds, lest we should have any thought that He is any other than God.
W.J.B. And yet at the same time to hold to the genuineness of His humanity.
S.McC. John insists on that, and so it comes out in @John 8: 40, "but now ye seek to kill me, a *man* who has spoken the truth to you". And as was referred to earlier, "the holy one of God", a beautiful allusion to His manhood, especially on the priestly side -- what is due to God, because Aaron, as we have often heard, would be suggested as a type of this aspect of Christ.
P.J.B. Would it be right to suggest that the disciples would speak together of Him, so that Peter, when he says, "we have believed and known", was able to speak
{68}
emphatically because together they had arrived at this conclusion that He was who He was?
S.McC. Yes, it is a tribute to their contemplation of the Person -- to their observation of Him -- what they had gathered up while others were disaffected in relation to the teaching. Here were ones that were wondrously affected, so that Peter says, "we have believed and known". Not 'we have known and believed', but "we have believed" -- the activity of faith which leads us into this knowledge -- "and known that thou art the holy one of God".
E.J.H. Would you say that in a general way the saints today line themselves up with Peter in regard to this very word?
S.McC. I would say, from practical observation, that in the body of the saints there is a great desire to protect the truth as to the Person of Christ, and it is preserved, we might say, in a living way in the assembly, over against the error embodied in dead creeds.
J.S.E. Confirming what you say as to 'the body of the saints', would not the fact that the apostles are not referred to as such in this narrative help us to see what is to be expected in the last days -- that the truth is held in the body of the saints affectionately by the Spirit. And that ministry must come on this line of holiness and affection in the understanding of Christ in the two ways you are suggesting?
S.McC. Well, I am sure that is so, and I think we should see the importance of it at this juncture, and then the salutary word the Lord gives over against the attractiveness of progressive knowledge in Peter. John says in verse 70, that "Jesus answered them". That is, the
{69}
Lord takes up Peter's "we" and it says, "Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil". Now this is a very humbling and searching matter, and it behoves us to be lowly and sober, and ready to be searched in the presence of the truth as the Lord is bringing it forward here. We have not only progressive belief in Peter, and in the twelve in this chapter, but progressive unbelief in those who go away into the drift of apostasy, the full result being seen in Judas.
P.H.H. In regard to the expression "believed and known", do you think that applies in general to the working of the truth amongst us? Here it is applied specifically to the Person of Christ, but would you think it also applies to the ministry of the truth, and the way it is taken on and finds place in the souls of the saints?
S.McC. I am sure it does -- and it shows the importance of subjection. Mr. Stoney stressed that the great basis of spiritual prosperity in our souls was in being subject to the truth, as it comes to us. That is a great matter. I was interested the other day in the word that God gave to Ezekiel. He says in @Ezekiel 3: 10, "Son of man, all my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears". Now we would have reversed that; we would have said, 'Hear with thine ears, and receive in thy heart', but God puts the 'receiving in thy heart' first, and then 'hear with thine ears', showing the importance of the activity of faith and the subjective bearing of faith.
A.W.G.T. It is a Berean feature, I suppose.
{70}
S.McC. It is. We are inclined to treat faith wholly in an objective way, whereas we are to see the subjective bearing of faith.
G.A.L. It says in @Acts 16: 14 of Lydia, "whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul".
S.McC. Very good, showing how the heart was the immediate subject of the operation to make way for all that was coming in through Paul's ministry -- a personal operation of the Lord. One has thought recently that we often speak of the Spirit as augmenting the service of Christ, but it is interesting to see how the Lord augments the service of the Spirit. The Spirit is the great power for understanding the truth -- for understanding spiritual and divine knowledge. That is a particular feature of His glory. He is the power for apprehension and for knowledge in us. But when we come to the Pauline side, the Lord is brought into it. Paul says to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2: 7). Not the Spirit, but the Lord will give thee understanding. And in @Acts 16, the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, "whose heart the *Lord* opened" -- not the Spirit, but the Lord -- "to attend to the things spoken by Paul".
J.S.E. Is that to keep us balanced in our minds as to the equality both of the Lord and the Spirit in an operational setting?
S.McC. Yes, exactly; and how closely they are related and linked in operations in the mediatorial economy, as in @2 Corinthians 3: 17, where it is difficult to discern where one service finishes and the other commences, and who it is that is referred to. "Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
{71}
F.C.H. You have the same feature in the early part of @Acts 16. After two references to the Spirit, it is "concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings".
S.McC. Yes. It is interesting to see how divine Persons are operating together in relation to one another in these matters.
E.J.B. Does the Father come into it too in @John 6: 45, "They shall be all taught of God. Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him"?
S.McC. There is a beautiful touch in this chapter in that way as to the Father -- as the Lord again says in verse 65, "And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father". We want to know the glory of this Person more in the economy, "the Father" -- God as known in this Person, how He is operating. The Father is God, the Spirit is God, and the Son is God -- let us never think anything different. God is One, involving three Persons, and yet there is the wondrous grace of the economy. "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 6) -- God coming in in that way in a system of affections to impress our hearts with what He is. God is love.
P.H.H. I suppose you would hesitate a little, would you, to apply the word Mediator, or mediatorial, to the Father. Christ is called the Mediator, and we can see that the Spirit acts mediatorially. Would you go further than that and apply the term mediatorial to the Father?
S.McC. The Father has come within our range in the mediatorial economy. The Lord Himself says in @John 5: 17, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work", the working
{72}
involving the mediatorial side, but the mediatorial position is set out in the Lord, and in the Spirit, the Father remaining in the position of Godhead.
A.Hn. In that connection, how far do you think @Colossians 1: 12 would go? There it says, "giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light".
S.McC. What have you in mind as to how far it would go?
A.Hn. Well, I was thinking of the question as to mediatorial operations of the Father.
S.McC. Well, it is one thing to see the Father operating, and what He is operating in relation to; but, rightly speaking, while He comes within our range in the mediatorial system, and in mediatorial operations, the Father is presented to us as God in the economy. "To us there is one God, the Father ... and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 6). So that the mediatorial side is rightly linked with the Lord Jesus, and with the Holy Spirit.
J.S.E. Do we not have to lay hold of this, that the supremacy marking the Father's place in the economy in no sense hinders His delight to serve the saints?
S.McC. No, it does not. We see how He is operating in this gospel, as we have already been referring to it, operating in affecting souls. But the mediatorial position is seen in the Lord pre-eminently, and the Spirit is acting in accord with that. We could not say the Spirit is the Mediator. Scripture says, "the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus" (@1 Timothy 2: 5).
{73}
C.H. Is that not linked up with the suggestion that the Lord has lordship in a sense in a dual way. That is, He had not only lordship as in Godhead, but He is made Lord officially?
S.McC. It is important that we should see the way it is referred to in @1 Corinthians 8: 6. It says, "yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him". Now while God is presented in the Father in the economy, we must not use that passage to eliminate the Lord and the Spirit from the thought of Godhead, because Their place in Godhead abstractly has always to be maintained. While They have come into a subordinate position; Their place in Godhead is always maintained in our minds abstractly, and so it says, "One God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him". Alluding to His official place, one Lord, He is the one who is made Lord. It does not mean to say that we cannot refer to the Spirit as Lord, or the Father as Lord, because James refers to the Father as Lord, but "one Lord, Jesus Christ" is an allusion to His official place in the economy.
J.S.E. And the Lord Jesus addresses the Father as Lord, does He not (@Matthew 11: 25)?
S.McC. Yes, exactly.
P.H.H. This scripture in @1 Corinthians 8 is not a full description of the economy, is it?
S.McC. Because the Spirit is not brought into it?
P.H.H. Yes. But is it Paul's full answer to the gods many, and lords many in the pagan world?
S.McC. Well, it is; and I think it is important to see that while the Spirit is not formally mentioned in @1 Corinthians 8,
{74}
He is involved in what is said. The fact that He is not formally mentioned does not mean to say that He is excluded; faith would understand His place in relation to the economy as stated.
W.M.B. In @Ephesians 4: 4 - 6 we have perhaps a somewhat similar statement, and each of the three Persons is mentioned, and again the Father is spoken of as supreme in the economy, would you say that?
S.McC. Yes, "One God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all". It is an allusion to the particular place of supremacy that the Father has in the economy; and to God, the Supreme Being, who is to be known and worshipped, in coming within our range as He has, in such an economy. His entering into that relation, has in mind to affect our hearts and souls through that relation, in regard of what He is in all His majesty and supremacy.
J.A.P. You are speaking of how we are affected through the relation of 'Father'?
S.McC. Yes, it is a relation that God has entered upon, a Name that He has taken, and the God who has entered into that relation must be greater than the relation He enters upon. We cannot limit Him to any relation that He enters upon, because He is God; He would not be God if we could.
J.S.E. Does the verse in @Ephesians 2: 18 compress in a few words what you are saying? "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". Are not the prepositions 'through' and 'by' in some sense mediatorial in each case?
{75}
S.McC. Well, it does, particularly setting out the mediatorial economy, that through Him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father.
A.W.G.T. I should like to ask whether, not-withstanding the fact that the Father is supreme in the economy, nevertheless certain things are predicated of Him that He does? He draws to Christ, and makes us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light, so in a certain sense could you say that He comes into the operational side?
S.McC. Oh yes. The Father is viewed as operating. The Father is the great supreme Governor of the universe. The Lord says, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth" (@Matthew 11: 25).
F.W.K. In @1 Corinthians 12: 6, we have "the same God who operates all things in all". Is that the same thought?
S.McC. Yes, that is God; it is God that is referred to. And it is interesting how that chapter is filled with the thought of the Spirit -- what the Spirit does. So that we are always to keep in mind the necessity for being sober, and guarded in referring to the economy, lest we should in any way attempt to put limits on divine Persons. They have come within our range, as They have, and our souls adore Them in the light of Their movements, and the positions that They have taken. But we cannot limit Them to positions that They have taken, while we are governed by the light of what They are in these positions.
J.S.E. Is that emphasised in this verse in chapter 6 as to the Son of man ascending up where He was before?
{76}
Does that not show that He goes up in the right of His own Person?
S.McC. Well, it does, and it is important that the glory of each Person should be preserved with us. One has heard of a statement only yesterday, which I think needs to be guarded, because I believe it is derogatory to the Person of Christ -- that Christ is not God to us. Christ is God to us. While it says in @1 Corinthians 8, "to us there is one God, the Father", that does not mean to eliminate from our minds that Christ is God to us. Who is He God to, if He is not God to us? He is not God to the Father, or God to the Spirit. When John says, "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5: 20) he is alluding to what He is to the saints.
E.J.H. Would you therefore support the words that are current amongst us, and have been for many years, that He never ceased to be what He was, on account of what He became?
S.McC. Well, exactly, that is the truth, as stated in that letter of Mr. Raven's on the person of Christ. ¦ We all do well to go over it carefully and read it. We should be helped as to the greatness of the Person -- as to the distinctiveness of His Deity, and the distinctiveness of His humanity. It came up in the conflict that raged over the matter of whether there was the union in Him of God and Man.
G.A.L. In @Daniel 7 the Son of man is identified with the Ancient of days, is he not?
¦ F.E.R., N.S., Volume 3, page 268
{77}
S.McC. He is -- a remarkable expression in Daniel, reminding us of the greatness of the Person. One would commend to the brethren the Scriptures in regard to this matter as to Christ's deity. We should be careful lest we make any remarks that would be derogatory to the greatness of His Person, as to who He is, for He is always God; He never ceases to be God.
A.Hn. I think you remarked elsewhere, very helpfully, that personally He is God and His condition is Man.
S.McC. Yes. I was repeating the words of Mr. Raven (*See letter referred to above*).
C.H. Referring to Mr. Raven again: in his lifetime brethren were saying that we could not worship the Lord Jesus because He was Man. The way he met that was by saying that He had lordship in his own right and therefore had a right to be worshipped.
S.McC. Well, that came up years ago and had to be met -- that we could not worship the Lord as Man. That results from a misapprehension as to His Person. He is the same wherever we view Him, unchanged and unchangeable in His Person.
A.P.B. Is it noteworthy that both Paul and Peter allude to the Lord Jesus as "our … God and Saviour" (@Titus 2: 13; @2 Peter 1: 1)?
S.McC. It is, and that is an answer to this remark that is gaining currency amongst the brethren, which is not right, that Scripture does not say the Son is God to us, because He is God to the saints.
W.S.S. So the passage in @1 Corinthians 12: 4 - 6 says, "there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; and
{78}
there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates". It is *God* operating, is it not?
S.McC. Showing the assertion of Deity in the Spirit. You see, while the economy is presented to us in the way in which it is in @1 Corinthians 8, that God is presented to us in the Father -- Deity is presented to us in the Father -- we must never forget the balance of the Scripture that fully asserts Deity in the Spirit and Deity in the Son.
W.S.S. I think it was Mr. Darby who pointed out the importance of what is stated in those verses in @1 Corinthians 12: the gifts of the Spirit, and the Lord over the services, but the same God operating, God operating whether in the Lord or the Spirit.
S.McC. That is it. So that we are to be reminded that, behind the economy, and behind the Trinity in Their operations in the economy, lies this great thought of the Being to be known and adored and worshipped -- God -- the beginning; and -- God -- the supreme end of all things.
W.S.S. Do you not think what you are now saying is being held, to use your earlier expression, in the body of the saints more than it has ever been held?
S.McC. Well, it is, but doubts have been sown in some minds as to whether Mr. Taylor ever countenanced the speaking to God in the light of the three Persons. It was one of his greatest joys in recent years to speak to God in that way, embracing the three Persons. I think it is remarkable, if one might refer to it, always keeping in mind the full value of the Scriptures, and the importance of our minds being garrisoned by the Scriptures in these matters, that in 1935, on July 9th, in London, we had that
{79}
unique address on the present position of the testimony. ¦ In that address Mr. Taylor alludes to God -- not the Father -- as the final terminus in the service. One month later, in Eastleigh, Hants, on August 9th, in a reading, the truth was fully gone into, and I think the brethren do well to read the ministry referred to, carefully and prayerfully, and see how the truth is set out according to the Scriptures in that address and in that reading. ¦
P.H.H. In relation to what was remarked about 'being', I was thinking of one of Mr Darby's footnotes to @Hebrews 1: 3: "Who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance". Footnote *c* says, 'Clearly "substance", "essential being", not "person". It is of God, not of the Father'. Now is it in your mind that the greatness of the Being of the one great eternal God is to permeate all that we are saying about divine Persons?
S.McC. Yes, always. Not that we can say much about it, but the blessed Spirit, the power for knowledge and apprehension, affords us in a holy and sober way a certain amount of latitude in thinking of God, so infinite in His majesty, in His Being as He is, yet coming within the range of creature mind and understanding, to affect our minds and hearts in regard to Himself. We are reminded in the Scriptures that as far back as we can go, "in the beginning" (@John 1: 1), God was there, the great Being to whom we are alluding, involving all three Persons. Their personality distinct, even there, we are never to forget that. One Being, but yet the personality of each as revealed and
¦ J.T., N.S., Volume 13, page 267
¦ J.T., N.S., Volume 68, page 94
{80}
distinguished in the economy is seen there. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God". The preposition 'with' in the Greek denoting communicative associations, signifying distinct personality in those conditions. What names or forms the relationships took we cannot say -- the form of God is not revealed, but it is important that we should see that one distinct and glorious divine Being in majesty is God -- the Deity -- yet three Persons, distinct in Their Personalities.
A.J.G. I suppose the expression "the eternal Spirit" (@Hebrews 9: 14) would help as to the separate Personality of the Spirit. In the economy He takes the name, or rather in the name of God in the economy, He is the Holy Spirit, because it has reference to man, but personally He is the eternal Spirit. Would that be right?
S.McC. Exactly. That helps in regard to what we have been saying as to distinct personality.
J.A.P. Would you say a word about "my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17) in regard to the way you are speaking now?
S.McC. Well, we are going ahead of our subject, but that passage, if we might just allude to it in passing, shows what we have been saying. It is what we have learned and been taught: that God, not the Father, is the ultimate in assembly service in the worship of God; it is God as God. He has entered into that wondrous relation conveyed in the name Father, so expressive of grace, that we might know Him in the majesty of His being as He is, as God.
J.A.P. And then you would include the Son and the Spirit in your thought of God?
{81}
S.McC. Yes. When we speak of God, as God, there is light in our minds as to all three Persons, because abstractly neither the Son nor the Spirit have left Deity.
A.J.G. Hence in that verse which was referred to, "through him [Christ] we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (@Ephesians 2: 18 ) while the access is to the Father, you are in the presence of the operations of the whole Godhead, are you not?
S.McC. That is it, and that is what we are to keep in our minds, and also that it is the same in eternal conditions. It says in @1 Corinthians 15: 28, "then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection". We are to be reminded of what lies behind all that, what is inscrutable to us, that we cannot enter upon, but reminding us of the majesty of the Being with whom we have to do, and who is to be all in all in that scene.
F.C.H. Are these operations connected with the Father in this chapter still proceeding?
S.McC. Well, they are, and I think if we are to have the knowledge of John's God, as we were referring to it, we need to see the way that John the evangelist presents God as "the Father". We need to know the way that John refers to the Person of the Father, so that we may be helped in worshipping God.
P.H.H. Do you think that the way the Lord Jesus refers to the Father in John, and how John the writer refers to the Father from the beginning of the gospel, is to build up our minds and affections in regard of that great Person, so that we might be set free to go to the length which is in mind in the gospel?
{82}
S.McC. Yes, I think so, because I think the great bearing of the knowledge of the Father is to help us to know God, that is, what He is in the fullest sense, in all His supremacy and majesty as the Being to be adored and worshipped.
P.H.H. And does that setting liberate us in love and restfulness, so that we might be free, so to speak, to explore the divine domain as far as it is made known to us?
S.McC. That is the point exactly, all bearing on the activities of the Father and the Son and the Spirit. We have thus an economy devised by divine love, in which divine affections are seen, so that we should know God according to what He is -- as it is said "God is love" (@1 John 4: 8) and that is how we come to know Him. The Trinity has always existed in Oneness, and the economy has been devised by divine love, in order that divine affections might be known, and it is in this way that we are brought to know God, that we have come to God, the Judge of all. That involves God in His supremacy.
F.C.H. Would you say a word as to verse 46, "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is of God, he has seen the Father"?
S.McC. Well, it alludes to what we were saying, that the Father has remained in the inscrutability of Deity. He has not come into a form such as we see in the Lord Jesus in manhood, but the Lord revealed the Father as He says Himself. We are dependent on the Lord as to our knowledge of the Father.
A.H.G. Referring back to the way the Lord is presented in the gospel of John, would you say that all He
{83}
is in His own Person is involved in the title "the Son of God"?
S.McC. Well, I would rather say in the title "the Son". "The Son of God" is what He is more as representative of God. "The Son" is the appellation that particularly alludes to His personal greatness and deity.
G.A.L. Does not chapter 5 show that the Son is both Son of God and Son of man?
S.McC. Well, exactly, so that the Person is in mind.
A.H.G. What would be the particular bearing of believing on the Son of God? That seems to be the great objective in this gospel, "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God" (@John 20: 31), and then your scripture in chapter 9 brings us to that point.
S.McC. Well, I think that is an important feature of the teaching, because in the Son of God the heart of God is brought near. In "the Word" we have the full unfolding of the mind of God; in "the Son of God" we have the heart of God brought near, because He expresses to us in a unique way divine love.
A.J.G. Does it also convey the thought of supreme dignity in manhood?
S.McC. It does. As representing God He has come in on God's side; as Son of man He has come in on man's side; but as Son of God He has come in on God's side, to make God known.
G.A.L. Does it not seem as though the title "the Christ" is the apostolic title for the Son of man? I mean, in @Ephesians 1, for instance, where all things are put under His feet, it is the Christ, is it not, and I was thinking of the
{84}
scripture just quoted, "That ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God", that it compasses both glories.
S.McC. Are you alluding to the fact that we do not get the Son of man in the epistles?
G.A.L. Yes.
S.McC. It is very interesting that the Son of man is so much mentioned in the gospels and is mentioned in the Acts, and we have a reference which bears on it in Hebrews, but generally the title is not employed in the epistles. I think "the Christ" represents, as you say, something on that line, that He is the answer to every human hope. Whether it be in man generally, or whether it be in Israel, in regard to the whole scope of prophecy; the Christ is the answer to every human hope in the gentile world and in Israel.
J.S.E. Is that perhaps why Stephen is the only human being who employs the term Son of man, and he does it at the closing down of a limited arena, and at the point of opening up an unlimited arena?
S.McC. Yes, exactly. You mean, in that sense, the Son of man is standing linked with the widest and most extended range of things in regard of divine operations?
J.S.E. I wondered if that was why the Spirit impelled Stephen to use that term at that juncture.
S.McC. Yes, I am sure it is, because it is a transitional point. The metropolis is being transferred to heaven; it had long been here in Jerusalem, but it is being transferred to heaven, and heaven becomes the great centre of the vast extended operations involving the gentile world where the assembly is to come peculiarly into view in Paul's ministry.
{85}
P.H.H. It is remarkable what you are saying about the term "the Christ", and what Mr. L. has raised. In the end of @Ephesians 1 the expression is used which belongs to the realm of the Son of man, does it not, "has put all things under his feet"? But I understand you to say that it is in the setting of the Christ. Is it as the Head of the assembly?
S.McC. Yes, the anointed man -- the Christ. Ephesians makes a good deal of "the Christ" -- what He is as anointed and filling out the official position. Everything is headed up in the Christ in the body of that first chapter. It says in regard to what God purposes in Himself, "for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ" (@Ephesians 1: 10). That involves the same thing as the all things being put under the Son of man.
P.H.H. So later, "he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead" (@Ephesians 1: 20). Then, He "has put all things under his feet" -- so that this great sphere where everything is subordinated to the Son of man is now to be viewed relative to Christ and the assembly, and the assembly shares with Him in it?
S.McC. That is it. So that John's ministry in the epistle makes the difference between the Son of God and the Christ, that Jesus is the Christ. In his epistle he does not bring in the Son of man, but alludes to the Christ -- which is more the official title, the One who has come in as the answer to every hope both in regard of the race and also in regard to Israel.
A.W.G.T. Do you want to go on to the next scripture?
S.McC. Well, we might refer to how the man in @John 9 comes to the knowledge of the Son of God. We are to see how knowledge comes to him. The Jews, I suppose,
{86}
would rule him out, indeed they did, "They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses". And then later down, verse 34, "They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us?" That is, they are occupied with the man in an external way. They do not see the mystery linked with the works of God in the man, and the knowledge that he has acquired in regard to this Person that had come into his view.
A.H.G. Would you say a word as to the word of Paul in Ephesians, "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God" (@Ephesians 4: 13)?
S.McC. Well, do you not think that that is a prime matter -- the knowledge of the Son of God? The fact that all the ministry is directed to that end shows what a prime matter it is; it is bound up with the full-grown man and the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ.
E.J.H. Is not the work remarkable in the man's soul, in that he had never seen the Lord with his natural sight. Yet according to the perfection of the work in him, all this has been built into his soul, so that he is ready for the communication of the title Son of God?
S.McC. Yes, so that we are helped to see the way he arrived at knowledge, the way he was taught through different things, and it is a good example for us as we think of it. He comes under the divine hand, and what progress he makes in knowledge, as this chapter shows, apart from human resources, we might say, apart from external means, he learns well. He reaches the Son of God in his knowledge, who is the centre of another world.
{87}
C.D.L. Referring to the matter of the Son involving His Personality, as you were mentioning just now, is it not striking that you have all this reference to the knowledge of the Son of God, but as to the Son, no one knows the Son?
S.McC. As to His Person, quite so. It is well to keep in mind the inscrutability of the Person of Christ, that as to His Person and His abstract place in relation to Deity we do not know. We know how the thought of revelation comes into what He is in manhood, as in @Matthew 16 and @Galatians 1, but that does not in any sense negate what the Lord says, that "no one knows the Son but the Father" (@Matthew 11: 27).
J.S.E. Does that not give some emphasis to the Father making use, if I may so say, of His supreme place in the economy to guard the personality of the One who has entered into a mediatorial set of circumstances?
S.McC. It does. You are impressed with how divine Persons and Their glory are guarded. There is also the allusion to the Spirit, in another relation, as to anything that might be said derogatory to Him, how that is guarded. We are reminded thus of the great thought of what is cherubic in the realm of revelation, that which guards the glory of divine Persons.
J.L.F. Would you say a word about the word in @Hebrews 1: 8, "As to the Son, Thy throne, O God, is to the age of the age"?
S.McC. Well, there is another allusion to the deity of the Son. It alludes to that Person in manhood. While "the Son" refers to His personal greatness, it is not a name or appellation that can be carried back to describe His
{88}
relations in pre-incarnate Deity. It is an appellation which bears on Him in manhood, but referring to His personal greatness in manhood.
F.C.H. In @Matthew 11 and @Luke 10 that statement by the Lord seems to be in the nature of a soliloquy, or a musing, does it not? He is not speaking to the Father, and He is not speaking to His own, is He? But is it not a musing or soliloquy in regard of His own Person, how great it is?
S.McC. Yes. You notice in Scripture that certain things are said in our hearing, at times, which are calculated to impress us with the realm that we are in. Although God has come so near, and divine Persons as distinguished in Their operations in the economy are so near us; the impression is always left on our minds as to what is beyond us.
{89}
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS (4)
S McCallum
@John 10: 1 - 15; @John 14: 1 - 20
S.McC. @John 10, in the portion of it that we have read, brings up the knowledge that is amongst the sheep of Christ in regard to Christ Himself, the Shepherd, and also brings out the thought of His knowledge of them. What the Lord says in verses 14 and 15 is very affecting, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". It would seem that the divine standard of knowledge is with the sheep of Christ according to that verse, which should affect us. Then in @John 14, the knowledge of divine Persons comes before us in that exalted setting. First the knowledge of the Father -- how important it is in this gospel that we should know the Father, and God as presented in the Father. Then the knowledge of the Holy Spirit, as the Lord says, the world does not see Him nor *know* Him, "but ye *know* him", alluding to the disciples, "for he abides with you, and shall be in you". And then His reference to the assembly day, the Spirit's day, and His own place in divine affections -- the perfect state of love that is contemplated in verse 20, "In that day ye shall *know* that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". A perfect state of love is contemplated, and the wondrous knowledge that is linked
{90}
with it. I thought we should consider briefly chapter 10, and then give the major part of the time to chapter 14.
Our place as the sheep of Christ is important -- what we are as marked out in the light of John's ministry in this way: the objects of divine attention, and the peculiar glory of Christ as the Shepherd, the good Shepherd, who lays down His life for the sheep. All this accentuates the holy activities of love, in the mediatorial economy into which God has come. We shall never understand the economy, if we do not understand and appreciate love. The measure of our spirituality can be taken account of by the measure in which we are formed in love. It is not much use talking about spirituality, if we are not formed in love, for the two go together. This chapter accentuates the links in holy love between the sheep and the Shepherd, and the service of holy love on the part of the Shepherd in laying down His life for the sheep.
E.J.H. Is it on that account that the sheep never go astray -- sheep of this kind cannot stray?
S.McC. Yes, that is because John's sheep know Christ. They do not know the voice of a stranger. A remarkable statement that, in regard to John's sheep -- the sheep of Christ; it says, "they know not the voice of strangers" (verse 5) but they know the Shepherd's voice.
A.Hn. Does that link up with what you were referring to this morning, as to the remarkable intuition there is amongst the body of the saints? It says in verse 4, "they know his voice;" and verse 8, "the sheep did not hear them;" and then what you have referred to in verses 14 and 15.
{91}
S.McC. Yes, exactly. How all this should affect our souls as to our links in holy spiritual affinity with Christ, as in the figure of the sheep! He Himself in this gospel is referred to as the Lamb of God -- a touching allusion to Christ in holy manhood here.
E.C.L. Does the reference to Mary in @John 20: 15, 16, illustrate what you are saying, "She, supposing that it was the gardener", did not know Him, but when He said, "Mary", she immediately says, "Rabboni"?
S.McC. Very good -- that exactly illustrates what we have here, and it is also seen in the man in @John 9. He says in verses 36 - 38, "who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage". A true sheep of Christ, he discerns whose voice it is, "he that speaks with thee is he", and he answers to it. The allusion in @John 10: 3 is important, "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out". There is an abstruse allusion to the Holy Spirit in this figure -- the porter; that is, that we are to be conscious that the Spirit will make way for Christ. He is not making way for the false shepherds, those that mount up elsewhere, thieves and robbers. It is remarkable that the Lord speaks in this way. It must have been the Pharisees and what He had to say to them in chapter 9, which drew out this plain speaking of the Lord as to those that mount up elsewhere being thieves and robbers, "but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter opens". No doubt an allusion to the holy scene
{92}
recorded in the synoptic gospels where the Spirit comes upon Him as He enters upon His public ministry.
T.J.G. Is there a link between the thought of the sheep, and the resolving of the question as to who Christ is? I am thinking of the reference to Solomon's porch later on in the chapter, and the Lord then speaking of the sheep as hearing His voice and so on.
S.McC. Well, that is the point -- they know the shepherd. In verses 23 and 24 it says, "Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon. The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say so to us openly". Think of the innuendo in that; think of what they were implying, that He was secretive about matters, the aspersion they cast upon Him and His ministry, "Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense?" He was not holding their soul in suspense -- someone else was doing that, but He had taught openly in their synagogues and their temple; but they are casting this aspersion on Him, "If thou art the Christ, say so to us openly". Peter and the others, in whom active faith was operative, discerned who He was -- the Holy One of God, the Christ.
W.S.S. You were speaking of spiritual affinity with Christ. Would that involve our having in our measure the same thoughts and feelings in regard to the sheep as He Himself has?
S.McC. Yes, it would; that is, leadership enters into this section. That is what is in mind in what the Lord says. As we think of what happened in chapter 9, what a wrong lead they would give the man -- they would lead him out of the truth altogether, operating as they were, taking the
{93}
place of knowing things, and seeking to lead the man and instruct him. The Lord no doubt has all that in mind when He speaks of the thieves and robbers in this chapter, and then refers to His own leadership, "he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out".
J.P.H. Would you say something as to verse 2, "he that enters in by the door", then later down, "I am the door"?
S.McC. Well, I think the reference in verse 2 is to the legal way in which the Lord came in. He did not come in in any clandestine way, He came in the right and legal way. He came in by the door, and the porter opened to Him, and that would be what is in mind in verse 2. Whereas in verse 9, "I am the door", is an allusion to what He was in Himself in manhood, in the great mediatorial position. There is only one way to God, and that is through Christ -- there is no other way.
C.H. The first reference stands connected with His entrance into the fold, but the second to His being a door in relation to the flock.
S.McC. That is important to notice as to the fold. There is no fold now; the idea of the fold is terminated. Divine Persons now take the place, if we might so say, of the fold, in that the hand of Christ, the Shepherd, and the hand of the Father are the confines in which the sheep are now held, and kept in the region of eternal life, and they shall never perish.
W.J.B. In referring to verse 3, "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice;" does that bring in the intimacy between the Lord and the sheep and also the
{94}
Spirit and the sheep? It seems as though the Spirit enables us to recognise the Lord's voice.
S.McC. That is right, and it is important that we should recognise His voice. This gospel makes a good deal of the voice of Christ. It is important that we should recognise His voice down *here*, because a sheep does not exactly allude to what we are in heaven, or in eternity. It alludes to what we are down here in a defenceless position externally, but in a well-defended position spiritually, as in the hand of Christ, the Shepherd, and in the hand of the Father.
E.J.H. The Lord delighted to call attention to the characteristics of the sheep, and on that account He acknowledges them with delight as divine property -- His own.
S.McC. Yes; that is, they are the subjects of the work of God, as is the blind man. It is really a carrying forward of what we have set out in principle in chapter 9: the subject of the works of God. Now we get it in a collective setting here, "there shall be one flock, one shepherd" -- the glory of the work of God in this setting.
P.H.H. Does 'the voice' raise with us some exercise as to the speaker, and the way that he is speaking? We have earlier the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the Son of God, and now the voice of the Shepherd. All the same Person, but not saying the same things in the same way.
S.McC. No, exactly; so the Shepherd's voice is important in this section, where Jewish opposition has been so strong, and would deflect a man -- the subject of the works of God as we have it in chapter 9. It is important that the Shepherd, the person who has such absolute care
{95}
for the sheep -- His voice should be known and that He should be followed.
P.H.H. Does the voice raise with us the exercise as to some living expression at the time? We might be quite clear in terms as to the Person of Christ and so on, but He is speaking in a different way at different times, and different matters are involved.
S.McC. That is one of the things that is particularly on one's mind and heart in this reading. The importance of the voice, and active love as it is seen in this chapter, because, while we may all be concerned to get the terms of the truth rightly, it is important that we should see that we have to do with living Persons. The Lord speaks in this gospel of the living Father; we have to do with living Persons and the matter of divine affections entering into our relations with Them.
A.J.G. The voice of the shepherd is to regulate the movements of all the flock, would you say? One flock, one shepherd, and one voice, you might say, for the whole flock?
S.McC. Very good. You mean that it stresses the thought of unity in regard of the saints -- one voice. I think it is good that we should see that, because in Corinthians Paul speaks of different voices. "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound" (@1 Corinthians 14: 10). But the great thing is the Shepherd's voice, the voice of this Person, for a divine Person is the Shepherd.
A.W.G.T. Does not that show itself in Paul's ministry? In @Acts 9: 4 (note *g*) and in chapters 22 and 26 the voice is referred to in both the genitive and the
{96}
accusative; that is it is not only the oral voice, but what is before the mind. Does that help at all?
S.McC. Well, it does. It is interesting, too, how @Acts 20 is full of the spirit of @John 10, is it not? The love side, the sheep side, the flock of God -- all that is entering into @Acts 20, is it not, in relation to Paul's ministry?
A.W.G.T. It is indeed.
A.H.G. And does the voice have a particular bearing in relation to a religious setting of things?
S.McC. Yes, the fold, leading them out of the fold. The fold represents an ordered religious system of things that the Lord has come into, and He calls His own sheep by name and leads them out. When He has put forth all His own, He goes before them, and the sheep follow Him. All this involves the death of Christ, and His burial and resurrection. It is all entering into this chapter in view of the sheep being in all the liberty, and the unity, of the one flock and the one Shepherd.
W.O.S. Would the Lord's remark in verses 14 and 15, "I … am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father", be calculated to move us in relation to affection as you were saying?
S.McC. It would. It is a remarkable reference that we have here, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". Think of the way in which the Father knows Christ, and the way in which He knows the Father. The Lord would not be alluding to what we might call the knowledge of Deity here so much; it is "am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". He is alluding to what is in the economy and
{97}
Their relations together -- He in manhood and sonship, and the Father in that glorious relation as Father to Christ.
T.B.C. Is the voice discerned in the ministry?
S.McC. Well, it may be; the voice of Christ enters into the ministry, and has a unifying effect on the saints -- it is one voice; not half a dozen voices, but one voice, which has in mind the one flock.
A.Hn. You referred to @Acts 20. I wonder if I might ask you to say a word as to the Spirit operating in view of shepherding? Paul there seems to have that in mind, "wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers" (verse 28) and immediately he goes on to speak of shepherding. Would the Spirit be operating like that today?
S.McC. Well, He is. The Lord has gone on high. He is now in heaven, functioning in heaven as Man, in relation to the wondrous administration that has been established and inaugurated there. The Spirit has come, and is here, and He is augmenting the shepherd service of Christ in the way that He sets on the care for the flock, as we have it in @Acts 20.
G.A.L. You could hardly have the flock, could you, apart from the Lord having gone into death, and having risen, and been glorified, and the Spirit being here. All that would be involved in the flock, would it not?
S.McC. It would. You could hardly have the one flock as we have it now, without the Spirit, because, as we have been taught, this is the point where John's ministry touches Paul's. Paul speaks of the body, John speaks of the flock.
W.S.S. Do we not see shepherd service outstandingly in Mr. Darby's service?
{98}
S.McC. Well certainly we do. We would do well to emulate such. One was affected recently, when over in Ireland, as one thought of that beloved servant and the way he denied himself. We talk about the servants and how they labour today, but we do not labour much compared with how they laboured in that day, and they did not have the comforts that we have. Mr. Darby denied himself, so that the true principle of Nazariteship was seen in him even externally, and how he laboured in relation to the poor of the flock.
W.S.S. He laboured to bring the flock together. In @Ezekiel 34 it speaks of a cloudy and dark day, in the chapter referring to the recovery of Israel to the mountains of Israel. I have often thought Mr. Darby's service was very much in principle bringing the flock to light in a cloudy and dark day, so to speak.
S.McC. I am sure there is something in that, because Mr. Darby's ministry is *in principle* apostolic for the days of recovery.
A.Hn. Would you say, by extension, the golden threads of that service have come right down to our day, as we can all say surely we have seen it in beloved Mr. Taylor?
S.McC. Well, certainly there are those that followed. Some of us were at Quemerford the other night, and thinking about F.E.R. in the room in Quemerford (not that we want to go into history, but surely it should affect us the way our leaders have gone before) how he stood up in the midst of conflict, with persons openly contesting the truth; but in love for the flock, for the sheep. Mr. Stoney and Mr. Raven laid down their lives, and Mr. Taylor who
{99}
followed. Shepherding involves leadership. It is an important thing that we should see that. Sometimes we speak of shepherding as if it did not involve leadership, but shepherding involves leadership -- the shepherd goes before the sheep.
W.S.S. Leading them into the best pastures?
S.McC. That is it -- the best; the best for the saints, for the sheep.
A.W.G.T. Is it not important that in Ephesians the gift of shepherding and teaching goes together, as if the Lord will not allow His sheep to be taught by anybody but by those that love them? How important that those that lead and have any moral influence at all amongst the saints, should lead, and that we should all be saying the same thing, so that the flock, the sheep, are not divergent in what may be said. They will not be divergent, as they are held in relation to the Shepherd's voice.
J.S.E. Does this allusion to "my sheep" bear on what you were saying about the body of the saints this morning? There is a peculiar touch of responsiveness, is there not, to the voice of the Shepherd, in that the word flock here is not diminutive, as it is in @Acts 20 and in Peter's epistle, where the word probably suggests what was in a place, do you think?
S.McC. It is important what you say, and it is a great help to any who have any part in serving the saints. Not that any of us can speak of much, because after all it is very little, but in any part that any may have in serving the saints, it is a great comfort to think of the flock, to think of the sheep who know Christ's voice. You have an
{100}
assurance that they will rally to the truth; the work of God in the saints will always rally to the truth.
M.P.S. Does the passage that has been referred to in @Ezekiel 34 show that princeliness is a feature of the Shepherd?
S.McC. Yes, it is. That is amplified in the scripture that was alluded to in @Ezekiel 34, "David a prince" (verse 24). Princeliness is needed -- those that can go before the sheep in affection for them, not to impress them with their ability to administer, or their ability to speak or to serve, but to impress the sheep with this great thought of divine affection -- the love that went all the way to Calvary, measuring the depths of Calvary's woe that the sheep might be secured.
F.C.H. There is something to enjoy in the statement "on this account the Father loves me". It is not just a statement of fact, is it, but that we should have some sense of His own enjoyment of the Father's love?
S.McC. Well, it is remarkable how knowledge comes in in that way. The Lord in @John 17: 26, in speaking to the Father, desires "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". That is the divine standard of love. Here it is the divine standard of knowledge. In @1 Corinthians 13: 12, in regard to the day to come, it says, "but then I shall know according as I also have been known". That is alluding to the divine standard of knowledge that we shall arrive at eventually, but it is delightful to think of this standard of knowledge here, that the sheep know Christ, "as the Father knows me and I know the Father".
{101}
P.H.H. What is involved in this thought of life? It says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly". There is first the voice, and then the suggestion of leading, and going out and finding pasture, and then He says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly".
S.McC. Do you not think it would stand over against the whole Jewish system, into which moral death had entered? The Lord has come to lead the sheep into life, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly". That is peculiar to the saints of this dispensation, the peculiar touch as to life, and the enjoyment of life that the saints have in the assembly abundantly, no doubt alluding to life in its fulness.
A.H.G. Would the knowledge of divine Persons that you have been stressing enter into this matter of life?
S.McC. It does, because life according to John's gospel -- that is, life as a matter of enjoyment -- lies in the knowledge of divine Persons. This is not life potentially; this is life as a sphere, a realm of enjoyment in the knowledge of divine Persons.
W.C. Later on He speaks of giving them life eternal; that is, in connection with preservation, is it not?
S.McC. Very good. The way that He speaks in @John 17 causes our attention to be focused on those that were given to Him out of this world; while He had been given authority over all flesh, He gives to them eternal life, as you say, "that as to all thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal" (@John 17: 2). Then the chapter begins to enlarge on those that have been given to Christ, indicating the peculiar way in which we come in for life --
{102}
such a distinctive heavenly way in this dispensation. But we need to see the importance of the love side in chapter 10, the sacrificial side, the laying down of the life. All this is important in the system of divine affections, because if the saints are to be cared for rightly, and to be served rightly, it can only be in the spirit of Christ, and in the grace of Christ as seen in this relation.
E.J.B. Is that the reason why the word for 'know' in verses 14 and 15 is objective knowledge; it can be taken account of by what it does?
S.McC. That is it. It is there objectively before us.
W.C. Will you say something about what the wolf means? You have it here, and Paul says grievous wolves would come in, not sparing the flock. Have we, if we seek to be shepherds, to have our eyes, as it were, on the enemy at the same time and his movements? The idea of the robber and the wolf, would be how the enemy would rob God, would it not really?
S.McC. A remarkable expression, is it not? In a gospel where the truth is so glorious, and especially in this chapter where He is speaking in accents so tender in regard of the sheep, and His love for them. Why should He use this expression "the wolf seizes them"? It is the ravaging side in relation to the flock, the violent side; a wolf has no conscience, it represents persons who have no conscience at all.
G.A.L. And does not the end of @Acts 5 indicate that about the time of our Lord there were such? Gamaliel refers to them.
S.McC. Yes, exactly; in the secession you mean that they led.
{103}
G.A.L. Yes, Theudas, for instance.
S.McC. Yes.
A.J.G. Have the activities of the wolf in view the scattering of the flock? He cannot hinder their being carried through eternally, but he would bring about present scattering, so as to discredit the testimony to God which unity affords?
S.McC. I am sure that is very important. The figures of speech employed here as to the alien influences that operate against the sheep are instructive. First, "a thief and a robber" (verse 1). How that speaks to us! It is a reference to persons in responsibility who are thinking about themselves, they are not thinking about God, or about Christ, or about the saints -- they are thinking about themselves. And then the wolf (verse 12) refers to the violent devouring element that seems to be bent on scattering the sheep "seizes them and scatters the sheep".
A.W.G.T. I wondered whether it had not rather a peculiar bearing on us here, since you referred to the historical side a few minutes ago. There was this kind of ravaging, and persons of this sort were used for a terrible attack a hundred years ago, and it centred in this city. Is that not something which should make us careful to lay hold of all the truth we have had brought before us, so that it may be in the body of the saints, as has been said, so that the enemy may not get in?
S.McC. Well, exactly. Think of what obtained there: there were the thief and the robber and the wolf -- the subtle specious, way the enemy wrought through Newton in systematised error to steal the affections of the saints; the clerical principle in Plymouth; the displacement of the
{104}
Spirit of God; the over-riding of the shepherd's influence -- all that speaks of the thief and the robber. And then what followed in the scattering of the sheep ought to help us to see the true character of Bethesda in all its terribleness.
P.H.H. Whereas I suppose, what happened in the next chapter (@John 11) with Lazarus and Mary and Martha would show the Lord's detailed care for them more inwardly -- it was not exactly an external attack -- to bring them over to the divine side whither the Lord was leading?
S.McC. That is it.
P.H.H. Love is prominent. "He whom thou lovest". Would that follow on your mentioning of love?
S.McC. It does, because it is not the flock that comes up in chapter 11, but the family of God figuratively speaking, in the family at Bethany. The flock represents what the saints are as the objects of Christ's love and care in that way. It does not stress so much the active side with them, or the side of personality. But in the family of God the side of personality is developed, individual personality. We do well to remember that, so that however much we have been merged through the baptism of the Spirit into the wonderful entity called the body of Christ, or merged together as the flock of Christ, we must never forget that on the side of family relationship, personality is developed. Each one in his own distinctiveness in his impression of God and Christ.
E.J.H. Is that borne out by the word "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus"?
S.McC. Yes, it is; that is, each one comes up for honourable reference, so that everyone of us has a part you see -- we cannot rule anybody out in @John 11. We might
{105}
attempt to rule Martha out, and the standard of knowledge she had. But the Lord is serving her, and He is bringing her in, so that they are all in their place in chapter 12, and all serving in relation to one another. It is not a question of what they are saying, it is what they *are* and what is being done.
T.J.G. And also in chapter 11 do we not see the triumph of shepherd love, in putting into the mouth of the enemy that the children of God should be gathered together in one, that were scattered abroad?
S.McC. Well, that is a rather remarkable word of Caiaphas, and is a word to keep in mind. It comes into John's gospel; it does not come into Matthew, or Mark or Luke. It is John that gives us that word, and we certainly should think of the children of God that are scattered abroad, and of how we can be a service to them in the true shepherd spirit of Christ.
C.H. Is it not often, too, a question of one dying for the nation when crises arise in localities?
S.McC. Well, it is, and in this matter of the saints coming to the knowledge of the truth, the shepherd goes before the sheep, the sheep are not going to lead the shepherd. It is the shepherd that goes before the sheep and leads them. Leadership is important in divine things. The brethren, of course, will understand I am not speaking of leadership officially, I am speaking of the principle of it. Leadership is leadership; democracy is not according to God; government by the people and for the people is not according to the divine mind. The divine thought is leadership, and leadership involves that there is the going
{106}
before, laying down our lives, serving the saints in the spirit and grace of Christ.
P.H.H. Is it remarkable that in the family setting in @John 11 this great thought of personality and individual lustre and glory should be alluded to?
S.McC. Well, it is indeed, because we might refer to it as a kind of transitional point. The Lord is about to enter upon the final setting of His teaching, from chapter 13 onward, in regard to the collective position and what divine Persons are to us in the collective position. But we get this wonderful view projected before our minds and hearts of the distinctiveness of the family of God. Each member, each individual one is mentioned, both together and severally, and what a help it would be to recognise that in our localities, do you not think?
P.H.H. Yes, indeed; and I wondered whether it did not proceed into the spiritual and eternal sphere. One reference to the saints would be, as you were saying, the body, or the assembly; but there is the other side in sonship, is there not, where every person stands you might say in his own glory?
S.McC. That is it, so eternity will be filled with the most wonderful persons, myriads of personalities, with distinctive impressions of Christ. We get great diversity, but unity in that diversity, in that it is a living state of things. Now in @John 14 we should see primarily this thought of the knowledge of the Father, and then the knowledge of the Spirit, and then the knowledge of Christ in the Father's affections, and we in His, and He in ours. This opens up a rich and refined realm of knowledge. @John 14 becomes more wonderful every time you read it, as to
{107}
what is projected on to our view by the Lord in His service.
A.H.G. Verse 1 says, "Let not your heart be troubled". Would that be the outcome of the unifying of which you have been speaking?
S.McC. That is it. It begins with that and it ends with that (verse 27). "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it fear". "Let not your heart be troubled" is the first verse and in between is this restful state contemplated in which the Lord serves in relation to the features of knowledge that are referred to.
C.H. Can you help us at this juncture as to the believing "also on me"? Is it now that they are to get further advance in the knowledge of this One who is leaving them?
S.McC. That is it. It contemplates the Lord as going away. Heretofore He had been with them and among them, so that there was no necessity for active faith in relation to Him. But now that He has gone to heaven, as this would contemplate, the necessity for faith comes in. He says, "ye believe on God, believe also on me". That is He is to become an object of faith to them. The Spirit is not quite in the same way an object of faith, because He is with us and in us.
A.H.G. Is it often perhaps because of the lack of this unity amongst the saints in love, indicated in verse 1, that we do not get helped as we should do in relation to divine Persons?
S.McC. Do you mean it is not hearts? It is "let not your *heart* be troubled".
A.H.G. Yes.
{108}
S.McC. That is a significant reference to the way they would be bound together in affection. @John 14 brings up the wonderful binding ties of affection between the disciples and Christ, so much so that it must have affected the Lord's heart, as He said to them in verse 18, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". Why did He use that word? He is describing the absolute desolation of their hearts at the thought of losing this One to whom, in love and affection, they had become so bound in companion-ship with Him here.
A.W.G.T. Could you say why the Father's house comes in just as this juncture?
S.McC. Well, I think the Lord is assuring their hearts, just as He would assure ours, that if He is going on before, He is not going on without us. We are on His heart and in His thoughts, and He has gone there before us to prepare a place for us. It brings out the singular glory of the assembly amongst the many families. The Father's house would open upon our view a great range of things in relation to the many families, and many abodes, all of infinite nearness to God in this happy state of love. But then there is a special place for the assembly, "for I go to prepare *you* a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be".
P.H.H. Is it significant that He says, "*my* Father's house"?
S.McC. It is, because it is alluding to His own relations with the Father, "in my Father's house". He does not say in *the* Father's house, it particularly alludes to His
{109}
own relations with the Father. Have you anything in mind in relation to it?
P.H.H. I thought perhaps it magnified the service of the Lord's sonship on our behalf: the Son of God, knowing the Father as His Father. Now He is proposing to serve the saints to this end, to prepare a special place with Him in His own presence, in His Father's house.
S.McC. That is it.
J.S.E. Is not this a peculiar touch of glory with which we should be more acquainted? The Lord does not refer as much to what He is going to do for them here on earth, as He does in the synoptic gospels, but here it is what He is going to do for them in another sphere altogether.
S.McC. He especially stresses in His reference to it the holy ties and links in love that will never be broken. If the sheep represent links with the Shepherd in holy love, then @John 14 brings them on to our view, if we might so say, in a greater way. Not in a more blessed way, for I suppose the love is the same, but in a more extended way.
N.K.M. Is this essentially future, or can it be touched and reached in the Spirit's power now?
S.McC. You mean the Father's house -- "my Father's house"?
N.K.M. Yes, and the place that the Lord has prepared?
S.McC. Well, it is especially alluding to what is future and what is linked with the day to come; but of course there is little that we cannot touch in the Spirit's power here. What we have to do with is more the house of God in its provisional aspect at the present time.
{110}
A.J.G. Would you say that in these words in this chapter the Lord is really introducing the Father to us, and in a sense making Him attractive?
S.McC. He is. He is introducing Him in a state of active love. I am sure that this matter of active love in this whole environment is important in relation to our knowledge of divine Persons. Do you not think so?
A.J.G. Yes, I do. I was thinking of the way He introduces "my Father's house" as though to impress them with the sense that the Father was the One who had the house, and ordered things there. Then later He says, "my Father will love him, and we will come to him", and so on.
S.McC. This chapter is remarkable in that way, for the manner in which divine Persons are brought so near to us. We are made to feel that we are not far from any one of Them. We are in the realm and environment of love, and the Lord, speaking reverently, is introducing the Father gradually. He says, "And ye know where I go, and ye know the way. Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father, and henceforth ye know him and have seen him" (verses 4 - 7). The Lord is stressing now His mediatorial position. The only way in which we can know the Father is in Christ, and by Christ, and through His service to us.
P.H.H. Does that provide somewhat the answer to Mr. M's question? The Lord does not say that He is the way to the Father's house, but the way to the Father. Is that what
{111}
fills out the present time, leaving the Father's house in its own eternal glory to the future?
S.McC. It is, that is beautiful. It says of the Spirit that He is the truth, and it says of Him, as in the believer in @Romans 8, that the Spirit is life, but it never says the Spirit is the way. The way is exclusive to Christ; "the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus" (@1 Timothy 2: 5).
G.A.L. There are remarkable depths as to the feelings of the blessed Lord opened up in this chapter, are there not? I was thinking of verse 10, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?" and again later on, "if ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father" (verse 28).
S.McC. You feel that affection is accentuated in this chapter in the way that the Lord propounds questions to the disciples. It is not that He is wanting to bring out their ignorance -- that is not the point at all. He is seeking to bring them into this active operative state of love, where divine Persons are known. He was in it Himself, how He lived in the Father, and how the Father was seen in Him. What a perfect state of love was there.
W.S.S. So you would say that if we are to come into it we must come into it in our affections?
S.McC. Well, we must, and it is important that we should know the Father as John presents Him. We have to note, as Mr. Darby pointed out in a letter¦ many years ago, the difference between Paul's presentation of the Father and John's presentation of the Father. In Paul it is linked invariably with our state and relationship, and our
¦ J.N.D., *Letters*, Volume 2, page 476
{112}
enjoyment of the relationship. John presents the Father as to what He is personally; His Person is presented to us in John's ministry, and we have all humbly to admit that when it comes to the Person of the Father we have a lot to learn.
A.P.B. Would you help us as to the difference between what the Lord enjoyed of the Father's company when He was here, and the thought of "going to the Father" as something additional to that?
S.McC. Well, I think it is wonderful that the Spirit helps us to see the glorious state of things in heaven, and that Man is there -- 'Oh the sight in heav'n is glorious! Man in righteousness is there' (`212:3). Man is there with *God* in that setting. It is a wonderful thing to think of it, and to take account of the glorious state of manhood in Christ in heaven, that He is there as Man with the Father.
A.P.B. I have wondered whether our present knowledge of the Father personally does not depend both on Christ having gone to the Father in the way you are speaking of it, and on the Spirit having come from with the Father.
S.McC. Well, it does; that is how we come into it. Think of the ten days preceding the Spirit coming from Christ. What a scene of holy converse! Not that we would conjecture -- far be the thought -- but what holy communication and communion must have obtained in the ten days after our Lord ascended, and before the Spirit descended! And then the Spirit coming and forming the assembly, and bringing into the bosom of the assembly all the refinement of the *knowledge* linked with that position,
{113}
and the wealth and the warmth of the *love* linked with that position in heaven where Christ is as Man with the Father.
C.W.O'L.M. Is that not involved in the statement "whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak" (@John 16: 13)?
S.McC. That is it; that would be what is in mind. He brings back a report of what is there, and how it affects our souls, the glory of the Spirit's presence -- the most wonderful thing on earth. As Mr. Taylor said recently, the Spirit's presence in the assembly -- the greatest Friend that we have here.
W.M.B. Would you give us some help about the difference between verse 11 and verse 20? Does it show the added knowledge that comes with the Spirit, the first being a question of faith?
S.McC. In verse 11 He says, "Believe *me* that I am in the Father and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the works¬ sake themselves". You notice that He is referring to the operating side, where the works are coming out. He says in verse 10, "the Father who abides in me, he does the works". It is linked with the works, but when we come to verse 20, it says, "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". It is more the inward side of love and affection; not that verse 11 does not involve love, but it is more the public operative side in relation to the works.
W.M.B. I wondered if the reference to "in that day" stressed the Spirit's day, the presence of the Comforter -- is that what you had in mind?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, because the last part of the verse, "and ye in me, and I in you", could not be apart from the Spirit. So that "in that day ye shall know that I
{114}
am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" is possible because of the Spirit's presence.
A.J.G. And in verse 11, "believe *me*", emphatic *me*, "that I am in the Father and the Father in me", does not that involve the truth as to the Person of Christ -- His part in Deity. Is not that all carried forward into verse 20, now that the Spirit has come, "ye shall know that I am in my Father". That involves the place of affection as you say, but the truth of verse 11 is all carried forward into that, is it not?
S.McC. It is. The blessedness of all that was here in holy manhood in Christ in sonship is all carried into the position on high. He laid down the condition, that is one thing that we have to keep in mind. He came into a condition which has been laid down, never to be resumed again, for He has taken His life in a new condition, but all the excellence of manhood that was there in the condition that was laid down, is carried forward into the position on high.
J.S.E. Is this chapter what we might call a chapter of credits, put to the body of the saints? The Lord refers to the term "ye" invariably, and yet one or two brothers bring up their questions, and the Lord takes advantage of them to put further credits to the body of the persons who were there with Him.
S.McC. Yes, just so. He is moving in relation to the disciples in such an affectionate and appealing way, recognising what they were as given to Him of the Father; and as the wonderful fruits of His own service with them. There is a wonderful tribute to the service of Christ in the twelve. I think it is coming out here in their questions,
{115}
while there was a measure of ignorance there with them. It is not to their discredit exactly; the Lord is bringing out more through it.
G.A.L. So that the Lord is coming to the climax of His great service in this chapter. He is bringing out the fulness of the christian position, as you say, in verse 20?
S.McC. He is. Life as we have it in @John 14 is the highest aspect of life in the gospel. He says, "yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live. In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". I understand that to be the acme of things in christianity.
J.S.E. And still bearing on the "ye".
S.McC. Still bearing on the "ye", the dignity of the christian company, that is set out in nucleus in the twelve.
P.H.H. Tell us something about this life. Did you say it is the highest aspect of it?
S.McC. Well, it is life in relation to our links with Christ in glory. It is not the appropriation of Christ down here; it is the appropriation of Christ up there. By the Spirit I am linked with Christ in glory and as maintained in holy contact in intimacy with Him, I am in life. Because He lives, I live.
G.A.L. So we are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. It is "in Christ Jesus", I was thinking.
S.McC. The position of them, you mean -- yes.
A.Hn. Does the enjoyment of that depend upon verses 15 and 21, he that loves me? I was wondering if you would say a word about that.
{116}
S.McC. Yes, I think it is important, but I should be glad if we could have a word on the Father and the making known of the Father before we touch on that. I think it is important that we should see the matter of the Father as John presents Him; and our knowledge of the Father, because the Father is a glorious Person in John's ministry. The Lord is too, and the Spirit, but the Lord is intensifying the thought of the Father in this section of John's gospel. He wants us to know the Father; He wants us to understand the Father.
H.F.R. Is that with a view to our becoming worshippers of the Father, according to His word in chapter 4?
S.McC. Well, it is, and with a view to our being worshippers of God. We shall never worship God rightly unless we are fully and firmly instructed in regard to the knowledge of the Father.
E.J.B. What is going to help us in developing in the knowledge of the Father?
S.McC. Coming under the hand of Christ and the Spirit, because after all the Spirit is here to help us in the way of power to apprehend the truth.
W.S.S. Do you not think that the Spirit would help us to see in John's gospel the deep desires of the Lord that we should know the Father? It is wonderful how the feelings of Christ seem to shine out in the desire that we should know the Father.
S.McC. Well, it is, because "*the* Father" implies sonship in relation to Christ, and sonship implies an active state of love. We have in chapter 13: 3, the Lord "knowing ... that he came out from God and was going to God". The
{117}
primary thought is God, and the final thought is God, but in between there is the marvellous dip in which the mediatorial economy is before us. God is seen in the Father in that relation to impress us with the love and grace of His heart; sonship too appearing in that relation to impress us with divine love. God is love, and this is the way that we come to know God in Himself; and He desires to be known in Himself in so far as we can know Him. So that the relation of Father, and the name "Father" directly bears upon our knowledge of God in this primary and final way.
F.C.H. Would you say a little as to the end of verse 28 in that connection, "if ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father, for my Father is greater than I"?
S.McC. Well, there is the grace of the economy, this wonderful system of divine affections devised by divine love that we should know God who is love. We are going to be with that God through all eternity, and we are going to be with Him as having learned Him, and having been taught in relation to Him, through this wonderful divine arrangement in the mediatorial economy, the Father the Son and the Spirit. The Lord is saying, "if ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father, for my Father is greater than I". That is, it is the opening up of the heavenly realm.
A.B. Would love for Christ bring in the Father's affections for that one? I was thinking particularly of verse 21, "but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father", and then again of the further thought in verse 23, "if anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him".
{118}
S.McC. I am not getting your thought; say something more, please.
A.B. I was asking whether such become known to the Father. Particularly, that is, those that love Christ, and keep His commandments, and keep His word, and whether such persons are particularly lovable to the Father?
S.McC. Well, they are; that is a great encouragement to our hearts, and especially to the younger brethren, to see how they come under divine attention as loving Christ. God delights to take account of the lovers of Christ in this way. We should finish with a word as to the Spirit. It says in verses 16 and 17, "And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you". I am sure it is important that we should more and more know the Spirit in the way in which the Lord is alluding to Him in this section. Because the only liberty we have, and the only joy we have in the realm of the knowledge of divine Persons is what is afforded us by this Person.
A.J.G. This is objective knowledge, is it -- "ye know him" referring to the Spirit? This chapter really gives us an objective presentation of the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, does it not?
S.McC. Very instructive.
P.H.H. If we can take account of the Spirit objectively, it certainly releases us to speak to Him.
S.McC. Yes, quite so, it does, and why should we not speak to Him? To say that we cannot speak to Him is an implication that He is not God.
{119}
THE KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE PERSONS AND THINGS (5)
S McCallum
@John 17: 1 - 26; @John 20: 17 - 31
S.McC. It is felt that these two passages that we have read should complete our enquiry in relation to the subject that has been before us in this gospel, as to the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things. The verses in @John 20 were read because they are involved in what the Lord says in chapter 17: 26, "And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". There are one or two references to the thought of the knowledge of divine Persons in this wonderful chapter, and it has been referred to as the greatest chapter in the apostolic section of the Scriptures. It is a chapter that is different from all the others. A certain uniqueness attaches to it, in that we are not exactly in the presence of ministry in this chapter, but in the presence of the speaking of one divine Person to Another. We are not in the presence exactly of the Lord teaching in ministry in this chapter, but we are privileged to be, as it were, in the presence of His speaking to the Father -- one divine Person speaking to Another. On the one hand it is in the light of His own equality with the Father, on the other as in the subject dependent place out of which He never took Himself, as having come into it. Even in this chapter, while His equality is asserted, He takes the place of receiving things from the Father. It is thought that we should see first what is referred to in "And
{120}
this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". The knowledge of God is linked with eternal life; and then towards the end of the chapter the knowledge of God is linked with the family side. Eternal life is not so much linked with the family side; eternal life is more linked with God and men. So that we should consider first what is referred to in this matter -- "this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". And then the wonderful expressed desires on the part of the Son to the Father as to unity. There are three great references to unity in this chapter. First in relation to the apostles themselves, the apostolic unity; then in relation to those that believed through their word; and then the thought of unity in glory linked with sonship. There are other things that may come in, but these are salient features that we should keep before us in what we are about to consider. The fact that we are in a priestly atmosphere here, in itself has its own word for us.
J.A.P. Why do you say that, a priestly atmosphere?
S.McC. The Son is speaking to the Father. We are in a priestly realm, our minds are impregnated through His utterances with the thought of holiness as He recognises what the Father has given to Him out of the world, and expresses His holy desire that they should be kept from the evil that is in the world. The Lord is priestly in His attitude here, and the whole chapter is filled with priestly utterances in so lofty and exalted a subject as the chapter contemplates.
P.H.H. Is the thought of eternal life somewhat selective here? It says first, "thou hast given him authority
{121}
over all flesh;" then, "as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal".
S.McC. Yes, it is; it is drawn attention to in regard to the position that the Lord has, as given authority over all flesh, which would look on to the millennial world and the millennial day. But our thoughts are particularly concentrated on the disciples, and on those that should believe on Him through their word, as particularly selected, marked out in relation to this great blessing, this wondrous blessing, though not as great as sonship. Eternal life is not as great as sonship, but it is a wondrous blessing, one of the greatest blessings that we possess. We have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, and eternal life is one of them.
J.E.B. Is it to be noted that the thought of giving occurs a great number of times in this chapter -- about seventeen times. It is a very precious thought in connection with the Father, is it not?
S.McC. Yes. I think it is very important, because we might say, reverently speaking, in a certain way that we are in the presence of divine love unhindered here. We have the flow of divine affections that the economy was especially devised to impress our minds with -- the giving being part of that -- it is the great expression of God in His nature. God is love, and the giving is a great expression of God in His nature in that way.
F.P.B. Does the only true God cover that?
S.McC. Yes. The Lord says, "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". It is remarkable how He refers to Himself in this way, "and Jesus Christ whom
{122}
thou hast sent". That kind of man, that order of man, would be particularly stressed -- eternal life linked with God and man in that way.
T.J.G. Does the emphasis being on *eternal* in that verse suggest that the knowledge of "the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" is not the acquisition of a mere point of knowledge, but an eternal matter that becomes an integral part of the believer?
S.McC. Yes, the word eternal, of course, in "eternal life" should be contrasted with a scene of death, wherein man's life has been shortened. We know that in the early chapters of Genesis great longevity marked man's life, but that has been shortened, and tremendous difficulties and pressures have come in through sin in relation to the shortening of man's life. Eternal life is the great answer to that, in the very scene where sin has brought in such disaster. Eternal life of course is referring to an out-of-the-world condition of things.
J.S.E. As you remarked earlier, eternal life is not as great as sonship?
S.McC. No, it is not. It is important that we should see that, wondrous as eternal life is, it is not on the same plane as sonship; sonship is the highest blessing for man. We do not reach anything higher than sonship in the way of blessing, and it is linked with the family thought, whereas eternal life is not -- it is God and men.
J.S.E. Yes. Why I asked my question was because you were emphasising eternal life coming into evidence and enjoyment where sin was, but sonship belongs to what is outside of that, does it not?
{123}
S.McC. Very good. Sonship is particularly heavenly, although eternal life as *we* have it is on the heavenly line too, in contrast to the millennial day, where it will be particularly seen in relation to the earth, and the earthly order of things. Eternal life as we have it in the assembly is on the heavenly line, but its bearing is on the condition of things here.
A.J.G. So has it specially in view our position here in testimony? I mean, has it in view that a heavenly colour and power are given to the position in testimony?
S.McC. Yes, exactly, so that there is a testimony in life in the saints through their enjoyment of it in the sphere of life, as it is contemplated in this great thought of eternal life. Eternal life underlies the whole position here. It underlies all the meetings, underlies the service of God. Properly speaking it is a land thought; it belongs to the land, but it underlies the whole position of testimony as you referred to it here.
N.K.M. Is it connected particularly with promise, and sonship with purpose?
S.McC. It is. Sonship was in the mind of God before the world was, but eternal life comes in after sin was introduced, and bears upon the introduction of sin in the world. It is on the line of promise to meet what has come in through sin, in the shortening of the span of life, the pressure of death upon our spirits; eternal life is God's great provision to meet that kind of thing.
E.J.H. Is lifting "up the eyes to heaven" connected with what you are speaking of as to the influence of heaven on the whole position?
{124}
S.McC. Yes. This whole chapter is to draw us into the environment of heaven, although we are still on earth. One of the things that is so affecting in this chapter is the way the Lord speaks, as if the geographical setting did not exist. He says, "and now I come to thee" -- a remarkable statement on His part as to His going to the Father. This whole section, from @John 13 to this chapter, is filled with the thought of His going to the Father, which of course involves the cross, and the grave and His rising again, and ascension. But the Lord speaks of it as if He would draw us into the immediate environment of it and into heaven in that way.
W.S.S. And there is the Lord's joy in going to the Father?
S.McC. Yes. He would draw us into His restfulness, His peace, His joy, in the position that He was in; we are left with all the richness of that legacy.
P.H.H. Is the contrasting thought of eternal life somewhat confirmed in the expression "the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"? The only true God?
S.McC. Yes, it would stand against what is false, do you think? It has a relative bearing on what would be around in regard to the multiplicity of gods, "there are gods many, and lords many" (@1 Corinthians 8: 5). So that we have an economical reference here in the statement, "this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". It is an economical reference; the divine arrangement is in mind, in the only true God, as seen in the Father, and Jesus Christ the sent One.
{125}
P.H.H. But if I understood your earlier remark, it does not really take us into any family relationship, such as is contemplated in "my Father and your Father".
S.McC. No, it does not; that is not the side of the truth that comes in in connection with eternal life, so that eternal life is presented in the gospel to men. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal" (@John 3: 16). The great thought is men, and the bringing of them into eternal life. As Mr. Darby says, 'The sense would thus be that He has loved men in view of eternal life, "so that" He has given' (see note *b*).
F.W.K. In the epistle to Titus eternal life is connected with the knowledge of the Saviour God, and becomes the subject of testimony?
S.McC. Yes, it does.
J.A.P. How do you connect what you are saying with "God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son" (@1 John 5: 11)?
S.McC. The thought in @1 John 5 is to draw our attention to the position of it, where it is positionally, and life in its entirety is positionally in the Son. The believer has it, of course. As John presents the truth, the saints have it; but in its entirety John presents it positionally in that exalted position; not in heaven exactly, but in the Son -- a wonderful reference to the dignity and glory of its position, so that it would involve divine affections. While eternal life does not involve the family side so much as God and men, yet it involves divine affections, so that the testimony to the eternal life came out in the Lord Jesus in His living relations with the Father.
{126}
W.McK. You remarked yesterday, in regard to chapter 14: 19 where the Lord Jesus says, "because I live ye also shall live", that that was the highest thought of life. Does that connect with what you are saying now?
S.McC. There we have the thought of life in an operative way. Eternal life is not exactly life in an operative way, but points to a sphere of life that is linked with the knowledge of divine Persons. In @John 14 the verse you allude to brings life before us and conveys, as you say, the highest presentation of life in John's gospel on the operative side -- I mean operative in the sense that it affects us. We live because He lives, but eternal life is another thought.
H.A.H. Are not family conditions on our side as brethren necessary for the enjoyment of it?
S.McC. Yes. It involves a sphere -- "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (@Psalm 133: 1). Then, as the psalm goes on, "there hath Jehovah commanded the blessing". That is, it is linked with these conditions, so that properly and rightly speaking, it is a blessing that is linked with the land, the heavenly side.
H.F.R. @John 12 has often been used as an illustration of it. It is a family setting there?
S.McC. Yes. We see how the pressure of death was lifted off their spirits as they were together in relation to one another, and in relation to Christ, so that movements in honouring Christ were unimpeded.
A.J.G. The family setting would give the heavenly out-of-the-world character to it, would it, but the basic
{127}
character of it is the knowledge of the true God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent?
S.McC. That is it. It involves an out-of-the-world condition and relationship and being. It involves a system of relationships, and that is what gives character to it in a heavenly way.
P.H.H. Does that mean that eternal life has a kind of dual application? On the one hand it will be known outwardly in the millennium, but at the present time it is known spiritually and more inwardly in the assembly?
S.McC. That is it. No family will know eternal life, and enjoy eternal life, as the assembly enjoys it. That is one of the things that shows us the importance of the Spirit as He is known in this dispensation. There are blessings which other families may touch in some measure, but with them it does not reach into the exquisiteness and blessedness of what is touched in the assembly, because eternal life in the assembly is enjoyed on the upward and heavenly line.
H.L.T. Would you say another word as to verses 2 and 3? In the one it is "life eternal", in the other "eternal life".
S.McC. I do not know that I can say much about it. The one is stressing the life with the adjective afterwards; other the adjective is before it. The one is stressing the thing itself, but the other is stressing the character of it, "this is *the* eternal life". We are to notice that. I think the Lord is focusing our thoughts on the uniqueness of eternal life as we are to enjoy it, so that He does not say, 'And *this is* eternal life', He says, "and this is *the* eternal life". I think it is particularly stressing it in relation to the family.
{128}
This chapter contemplates the uniqueness of eternal life as it is known in the assembly, which is *the* eternal life.
A.J.G. Has it not been said that the knowledge of the only true God delivers us from idolatry, and the knowledge of Jesus Christ, His sent one, delivers us from lawlessness? And can you not see, the more you think of that, how essential that is if we are to be maintained in testimony here in the presence of all that is corrupt, and on the other hand, if we are to be maintained in the service of God?
S.McC. I think that is very good. And it helps us as to the importance of eternal life as bearing on our public position in testimony, and as bearing on the inward position in the service of God. It is a living state of things that we have to do with, over against the dead state of things all around. The enjoyment of eternal life bears upon that. It is very striking that the first formal reference to the economy in this gospel is @John 3: 35, "the Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand". Then chapter 4 immediately brings in the living water, that is the Spirit, and eternal life, in view of two great prime matters in the dispensation: evangelical testimony, and the worship of God in an inward way. The Spirit and eternal life bear directly on these matters as to living conditions in them, and power in them, and the first feature of the administration of the economy brings that out.
W.S.S. And in regard of what you said about the service of God following eternal life, eternal life is brought in in @Psalm 133, and we have the service of God in the next psalm, have we not -- "Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless Jehovah" (@Psalm 134: 2)?
{129}
S.McC. Very good, and it is important that we should see the bearing of eternal life in relation to the service of God, because it preserves us from holding the truth merely in terms. It preserves us from mere theology in relation to the truth, because in the assembly we have a living state of things.
A.Hn. Does the food in chapter 6 afford substance in this great matter of life and the service of God?
S.McC. Yes, it does. It brings in what is to help us constitutionally, because we need help in our constitutions, and the food would bear upon that. It contemplates, on the negative side, the ending of one order of things, but on the positive side the opening up of another order of things, morally and spiritually outside of the world.
P.H.H. Why does the Lord immediately go on to the request for His being glorified? It seems perhaps somewhat abrupt, but He speaks of having glorified God on the earth, and "now glorify *me*, *thou* Father" and so on, leading on to what is inscrutable. What is the setting of that in relation to what we are saying?
S.McC. I think He is coming on to what is to impress our minds and hearts in a distinctive way in regard to the glory of divine Persons, and Their relations with one another. It would seem as if in this chapter the standard is set out in the relations of divine Persons with one another. The standard as to unity, the standard as to perfect love, is set out in the relations between the Father and the Son and the Spirit too, because the Father and the Son are one in the unity of the Spirit. That is what is to affect the saints, because it is the presence of the Spirit that makes things real with us, especially as to this matter of unity.
{130}
J.S.E. Is this abruptness, to which Mr. H. refers, to impress us with the fact that, having settled the matter of eternal life, the Lord refers to something greater, is that right?
S.McC. Our minds and our attention are drawn to divine greatness, and the holy unjealous relations between divine Persons in love. What a pattern is set out in holy references of Christ here, as to the Father's relations with Him and His relations with the Father! What a pattern is set out for us as to conditions among the saints! He says, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it; and now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". He was co-equal, co-eternal with the Father, and His rights in equality are asserted in this gospel. But the glory that was rightly His with the Father before the world was, He would not take it without asking the Father, showing the remarkable relations that are intended to affect us; the great object of the economy is to affect us by what appears in testimony in it.
A.J.G. So that really God meets all the conditions that have come in through sin, by coming into testimony Himself?
S.McC. That is it; and I think we need to see the economy from this viewpoint, that it is a divinely devised system of affections in which we are to know God. God is love -- that is His nature -- love; that is absolute. God is love, but in the realm of inscrutable Deity how could we know it? We could not, with creature mind and under-standing, enter there to know it, understand it and enjoy it.
{131}
But God has devised, divine love has devised, in the economy, a system of affections in the Father and the Son and the Spirit, in which we are to know God in that economy.
P.J.B. Was eternal life essential as far as we are concerned, if we were to have any understanding in relation to these wondrous relationships?
S.McC. I think eternal life is important as basic to our enjoyment of divine Persons, because christianity involves life, whether life operatively as has been referred to in @John 14, or whether life as viewed in the sphere of it, contemplated in what we are referring to as eternal life here.
F.R.H. It says in @1 John 4: 9, "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God", and the note (*c*) to that is interesting, "The idea of the love of God remains absolute: only it has been shown 'as respects us in this' etc.".
S.McC. Yes, we know it relatively. One of the supreme expressions of it is that Christ has laid down His life; that is one of the most wonderful expressions of divine love relatively.
H.A.H. Is it significant that in the other reference to what was before the world (verse 24) the Lord brings in the love between Himself and the Father, relative to His request that we should be with Him to behold His glory? I was thinking of the distinction between verses 5 and 24 -- the two references to what existed before the foundation of the world.
S.McC. Well, in verse 24, of course, we are brought into the beholding of the glory, but not in verse 5; we could never behold the glory that is contemplated there.
{132}
H.A.H. I was thinking of the significance of love being brought in in verse 24.
S.McC. Yes, "that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".
H.A.H. I thought it was very significant that such a love was brought in, in relation to such a request as to ourselves.
S.McC. Yes. Well, we are impressed with this matter of love as the chapter ends. The Lord is filling our minds with thoughts as to divine love, what is special to Himself, and what we come into. As the chapter proceeds He refers to the love "with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". That would be the thought of family love in relation to Christ in manhood -- sonship. "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" is another thought in regard to love.
I think we should be impressed with this matter of the Lord not taking Himself out of the dependent position into which He had come. There is a great lesson for us in it. Whilst He is speaking of what we cannot enter upon -- the glory of the form of God, which we know nothing about, except that unapproachable light is linked with it, and love is linked with it, and glory is linked with it -- we are to be impressed with how He would not take Himself out of the dependent place even here. The enemy tried to take Him out of it, but even here He does not say, as we have perhaps often noted, 'and now I glorify myself'. He says, "And now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, [that brings us back to what we have in @John 1: 1",the Word was with God"], with the glory which I had along with
{133}
thee before the world was". It is recorded through John the evangelist, that we might be impressed with it in some measure, although we cannot enter upon what is involved in it, yet it is brought into our thoughts in some way to impress us with the greatness of divine Persons.
H.F.R. Are the emphatic pronouns there, the personal pronouns, very important? In the earlier verse he says, "glorify thy Son", but now he says, "glorify *me*, *thou* Father".
S.McC. Yes, He has come back to what is personal. The first three verses are almost indirect in certain ways, but then as we go on from verse 4 the Lord speaks about Himself in His relations with the Father, and what enters into those relations, seen so wondrously in the economy.
A.B. And would this move us in worship to the Son, the sense that He has a personal glory, as along with the Father -- and co-equal with Him?
S.McC. Well, it does, and it helps us to see His equality with the Father, His place in Deity. It says in verse 3, "the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". The true God has reference to the Father. But then we have to bear in mind, even in thinking of that, that the Lord Jesus is said to be the true God too. Surely the statements do not conflict, and it is for faith, and for minds and hearts taught by the Spirit, to understand what is in mind. We are to be impressed with the fact that not only the Father is God, but the Lord Jesus, the Son, is God, and the Spirit is God. "He is the true God and eternal life" (@1 John 5: 20). So we are reminded of His Deity in verse 5.
A.J.G. Do you think that verse 5 throws its lustre back on verse 4 -- that such an One as is speaking in verse 5, has
{134}
been here in testimony as glorifying God -- glorifying the Father, not seeking His own glory, and He had completed the work? Is that to have an effect upon us as here in the position of testimony?
S.McC. Well, it is, I am sure, and it is very affecting to be in the presence of the Lord speaking to the Father in this way as to His having glorified Him on the earth -- "I have glorified *thee* on the earth" -- a wonderful reference. The earth, you see, refers to what is creational; the earth had been created by God, and He says, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth". But then He brings in the moral and spiritual universe in what He says following on that, "I have completed the work which thou gavest me". That is not creational exactly -- it alludes to the wonderful work linked with God coming into the mediatorial economy, in the way He has done, to liberate men that they might know Him in the blessedness of His Being, as He desired to be known, in so far as He can be known according as He has revealed Himself in Christ.
J.S.E. Is it to affect us that it is reserved to the Son, in what He says to the Father personally, to put the most glorious impress of the Father's supremacy upon the economy?
S.McC. Well, it is. I am sure we want to see the weight of the Lord's words in speaking in this way, and especially this matter as to testimony, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth". Why should the Lord say, "on the earth"? The creational side is in mind, and *we* have to do with what is created. We know what sin has done in the theatre that comes under our eye in created things -- how sin has come in and deranged what is linked with that
{135}
order of things viewed creationally here. But the Lord says, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth", and that is to bear upon us; the apprehension of it is to bear upon us as we touch, and have to do with, the creational side.
W.B.H. Is it in striking contrast to that word in Genesis, "and Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart" (@Genesis 6: 6)?
S.McC. That is it. So we have the true God in verse 3, and true manhood in Jesus Christ, and what a contrast to what came in by the first man, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth".
J.H. It says in @Psalm 65: 9 that "thou hast visited the earth, thou hast watered it; thou greatly enrichest it: the river of God is full of water".
S.McC. So it is an important thing that we should see the earth abstractly, and learn to think of it abstractly, and see what is in the divine mind in relation to it. What a touch the Lord gives to the creational side here, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth". The very place where idolatry had come in, where lawlessness had reared its head, the Lord said, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth".
W.S.S. Verse 4 would embrace the two great thoughts of creation and redemption, so much brought together in Scripture.
S.McC. Well, it does, and the "glorified *thee* on the earth" and the completing the work which thou gavest me involves redemption, and it involves the cross.
W.S.S. And it is the basis of all that is to be brought in for the glory of God.
S.McC. That is it.
{136}
A.Hn. Do you link this in your mind with what Paul says in @Philippians 2: 5 when he is referring to the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and inviting us to let it be in us?
S.McC. I think that is the bearing of it testimonially on us here. We are to be affected by what is seen in the Lord Jesus in this wonderful divine arrangement: how He glorified the Father, as He speaks of Him in this way, glorified God in the way in which He did it. We see the true relations between God and men in this Person in manhood in the economy.
E.J.H. And would you say that true manhood, as patterned after Christ, is seen in what the Lord Jesus says to Peter at the end of the gospel, "signifying by what death he should glorify God" (@John 21: 19)?
S.McC. It shows how the thought of glorifying God is to appear in the saints, even in the way they die.
Now the time is pretty well gone, and we should come on to the other features of our subject. We should look at the latter part of the chapter as to the making known of the name. It says earlier, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world" (verse 6). There is a manifestation of the name, which is linked with the whole testimonial position there at the beginning, but when we come to the end it is, "and I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". As we have been taught, the manifestation side bears on the testimonial position, but the making known is a deeper inward thought coming into this setting in a peculiar way, and coming into @John 20 in a peculiar way. "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known".
{137}
P.J.B. Is that the name He took in coming into the economy?
S.McC. I think it is the name of God that is involved in this. "I have made known unto them thy name" no doubt would bear on the way He had taught them in regard to the Father. He had come in the Father's name, and He says in verse 11, "I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we. When I was with them I kept them in thy name". He made known to them the Father in His service and ministry. But then He says, "and will make it known", which involves @John 20, as He says to Mary, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". That is, we have something further: the completing of this making known of the name.
W.S.S. There is a verse in @Psalm 48: 10 which seems to bear on this: "According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise".
S.McC. Well, that bears on what enters into the worship of God. Every family is formed according to the particular light in which God is made known to it, and so the assembly is formed according to the particular light that enters into our dispensation in regard to God.
J.S.E. When you spoke of "making known thy name", did you mean that the first allusion, "I have made known" was economical and the second was final?
S.McC. Well, "I *have* made known to them thy name" is historical. It is alluding to the service of Christ to the disciples, "I have made known to them thy name". But
{138}
then it says "and will make it known". That brings in @John 20, which is final; that is, it completes the knowledge of the Name.
P.H.H. Involved in the message to Mary, do you mean?
S.McC. Yes, exactly. "My Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
P.H.H. There is no sense in which the Lord makes known His name to us in assembly service now, is there?
S.McC. No. @John 20 is final. The matter is complete and final in that relation.
W.J.B. So that the reference in @Hebrews 2: 12 to "I will declare thy name to my brethren" -- that has been done, has it?
S.McC. It bears on what the Lord did on the morning of the resurrection, the first day of the week (@John 20) -- it bears upon that.
J.A.P. "My Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". They are the same Person, are They not? I mean They are spoken of as one, and yet would there be something in the name of God that is greater and wider?
S.McC. Well, we would like to understand what you have in mind in saying it is the same Person.
J.A.P. Well, it is His Father and His God; but as to 'His God', I suppose when you come to the Being of God you cannot be definitive in your mind, can you?
S.McC. I think I see what is in your mind -- that the Father is before us in @John 20, "my Father and your Father". How blessed that name is. But then there is the fuller name: God; whereas the Father particularly applies to that Person, God as seen and known in that Person as
{139}
revealed -- "My Father and your Father". But then, the name of Father does not cover the Three Persons. While God is *presented* in the economy in the Father, the *name* of Father does not cover the full thought of the Deity; the Deity is *presented* in the Father. But the name of God is the appellation which covers the complete thought of Deity, the expression that the Spirit of God uses to bring to our minds the thought of the Deity, because in God it is the Deity that is in mind. It is the Name and the appellation which covers the full thought of the Deity; not that we are saying that the full thought of Deity is not presented in the Father *personally* in the economy -- "to us there is one God, the Father"(@1 Corinthians 8: 6). Deity *is* presented in the Father in the economy, but then the name Father is a name of special relationship and in itself is limited; because the God who has come into that relationship must necessarily be greater than the relationship He has come into. "My God and your God" involves that Being, the Supreme Being, and is the Name involving all three Persons; Father, Son and Holy Spirit -- that covers the full thought as to the Deity.
J.A.P. So when you use the name "God" you do not limit it in any way, unless it is specifically referred to the Father. You have in mind that the Father is God, the Lord Jesus is God, and the Spirit is God.
S.McC. Exactly, because "God" when it is presented without qualification in the word, generally would involve God, the Supreme Being -- "in the beginning God" (@Genesis 1: 1) -- that is, the Supreme Being, the Being to be worshipped. What is necessary to make clear at this point is that what some are suggesting, that this thought of
{140}
worshipping God as God, involves a position beyond relationship, has never been suggested. It has never been in anyone's mind that worshipping God as God takes us outside of relationship. God has come into the relation of Father, that we might know Him in His nature -- what He is, because "Father" implies, sonship -- involves sonship in Christ. These are relations that are intended to help us as to the apprehension of the Being that has come within our range in the economy; that is referred to in that appellation "my God and your God".
J.A.P. I think that greatly helps.
W.M.B. Do you distinguish this at all from @Ephesians 1: 3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"? Would you distinguish the two in any way?
S.McC. Well, I would in the sense that there is a particular reference to the family side in @Ephesians 1, to the side of relationship. The family relationship is essential and we never go outside of it in having to do with God. The family relationship was designed, so that we should be in nearness to God. It is obvious that in "my Father and your Father" there is an intimacy that could not be in "my God and your God", because God is God, and never ceases to be any less than God -- infinite in power and in majesty. But the relationship is brought in that we might know Him in nearness, and we never go out of that relationship.
A.C.S.P. Are we to carry into this thought of God, as you are now speaking of it, the distinctive glories of each of the Persons as they have come out in the economy?
S.McC. Well, the Being that we are speaking of under that appellation "my God and your God" is the Being that is known in the economy in the Father and the Son and the
{141}
Spirit. They are distinguished for us in Their operations and actions in the economy. We have to keep that in mind, that it is in coming out and in Their operations and actings that They are distinguished for us. Whilst John says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God" (@John 1: 1) it is not that He is carrying that appellation back into Deity, but he is referring to the Person who was known in testimony as the Word, and to His eternal position in Deity, His eternal equality with the Father and with the Spirit too, "the Word was with God, and the Word was God".
P.H.H. Do you think it helps to understand that God coming out has expressed Himself in Father, Son, and Spirit, but in the return line which the Lord is suggesting here He just says, "and to my God and your God"? Does that give us liberty, therefore, just to speak to God Himself? If we go on and express the name "Father, Son, and Spirit", we are returning for a moment to the coming out side, are we, whereas is the whole thing gathered up in our liberty at the end to speak to God Himself?
S.McC. It is, but the approach is equal to the revelation, so that the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit would have its place in approach to Him.
P.H.H. I would not like to say that we may not refer to the Father, Son, and Spirit when we are speaking to God, but does not the Scripture encourage us at the end, at the highest point of the service, just to speak to God, without necessarily particularising each time by saying, 'Father, Son and Spirit'?
S.McC. We had it this morning. It does not necessarily mean that you always have to refer to each of the
{142}
Persons, because God is God. He is that Being, and we may refer to Each of the Persons as we know Them in the economy, but we may refer to God as God. The Lord Jesus says "my God". He is speaking as Man, and He is speaking in the mediatorial position. He says "my God and your God", but He says "my God" -- Christ's God. Think of the infinitude of that Being, that Christ refers to in manhood as His God, and surely we can allude to that; and then it says "your God". Well, "our God". What does that involve? Surely the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are involved in that. But then it is all a question of what may be in the person's mind as he speaks. The person may be alluding to God in His supremacy, a Supreme Being to be worshipped, without formally alluding to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. But then he may allude to the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, which is quite in keeping with the truth, because God is so spoken of in the Scriptures as Father, Son, and Spirit. In fact I would draw the brethren's attention to Mr Darby's Synopsis on @John 17,¦ and the way he speaks of 'communion with the Being thus known to the soul -- of communion with God Himself fully known as the Father and the Son'.
-- .H. Is that why we use the formula in Matthew in baptism, "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" -- to one Name?
S.McC. Yes, I think it is important that we should see this matter of relationship. We should not allow the enemy to suggest in any shape or form that we get out of the place of relationship -- that there is some position that we get
¦ J.N.D., *Synopsis*, Volume 3, page 388
{143}
into in the service of God, where we are beyond relationship. We never do. We are always in relationship in sonship, and we worship God in His supremacy and His majesty as in that relationship. God, "my God and your God", is the great Name that expresses the whole thought as to the Deity, involving all three Persons, involving that Being known in the economy in the three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
A.J.G. Does the fact that the Lord says to the overcomer in Philadelphia, that He will write upon him the name of His God, show that the overcomer can be seen as in the good of it, do you think?
S.McC. That is it. He has in mind to put these impressions upon him so that it is apropos of our time and day that so much should be referred to in this regard, fitting in with the closing phase of things. I am sure that, as we understand @John 20, "my Father and your Father", that is the relationship that God has entered upon that we might know Him in holy intimacy, in relation to Him in sonship, that we are prepared for "my God and your God". This brings into our minds the great thought of the Supreme Being who is the End, in all divine operations and in all that is in mind in the worship of Himself.
J.S.E. Is the allusion to "my God" in @John 20 the Lord's assertion of the matter as a matter by itself, made by Him who knows all that it means in fulness. But is the allusion to "my God" which has been referred to in @Revelation 3 to help us to see how attracted the Lord is to an overcomer, so that He Himself puts that impress upon such persons?
{144}
S.McC. Yes, so that it is important to see the bearing of the Lord's words in that particular setting, involving a phase of things in the particular assembly that they are addressed to -- Philadelphia.

THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD (1)
G R Cowell
@Psalm 2: 1 - 12; @Psalm 8: 4 - 6; @Psalm 22: 1 - 3, 22; @Psalm 24: 3, 8 - 10; @Psalm 40: 6 - 8; @Psalm 41: 13
G.R.C. The Psalms are suggested, with the desire that we may be helped in the praises of God. It is proposed to take up a book in each of the five readings, considering the salient features of each, particularly having in mind the doxology at the end of each book. We are not thinking of the Psalms as applied to Israel, but rather seeking the Spirit's help in giving an application to them, as bearing on the praises of the assembly. I think all would agree that this is justifiable, because the assembly was the primary thought with God: and while scriptures such as the Psalms have a special bearing upon Israel, the Spirit of God ever had the assembly before Him when inditing Scripture. The whole of Scripture, thus, was written for our learning. We can read the Psalms, therefore, in the light of Paul's ministry and the place the assembly has in association with, and as united to, Christ. As read in that way, they are calculated, one feels, to expand our thoughts as to the praises of God. It has been noted by others that the Psalms begin with the blessedness of the man, that is man according to God, and bring out the blessedness of God, ending with the last five Psalms which constitute the great Hallel (i.e. praise) to God. The last Psalm is an ascription of praise to God in the greatness of His Being, as signified in the names of Jah and El, so that the Psalms, especially
{146}
as viewed in christian light, lead up to a remarkable climax. God, as God, is praised in the greatness of His Being, by creatures who have become intelligent as to His nature and attributes, by the way in which He has come out in declaration and revelation. Such can render to Him a worthy note of praise.
I think the first book of Psalms particularly has in mind the purpose of God, and presents God to us in relation to His purpose. The purpose of God takes our minds back to a past eternity, and in its fulfilment leads our minds on to the eternity to come, and so we can understand the doxology at the end, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity! Amen, and Amen" (@Psalm 41: 13). But then, with that in mind, the book dwells much on Christ as the Man of God's purpose. When it speaks of His moral features, it often indicates that there will be others like Him. The first psalm, while applying primarily to Christ, has a more general application, for it refers to the assembly of the righteous. Similarly, the first part of @Psalm 24 says, "Who shall ascend into the mount of Jehovah? and who shall stand in his holy place?" And goes on to say, "This is the generation of them that seek unto him". So that where there are moral descriptions, while Christ is primarily in mind, it makes way for the generation of Jesus Christ. But when you come to the glories of the Christ in this book, they are unique to Him -- no one can share them with Him. The second psalm brings out basic glories upon which the whole divine plan, as one might say, rests. He is God's anointed -- God's Christ; He is God's Son, and He is also called the Son. It is a remarkable thing that at the opening
{147}
of the Psalms there should be such a full setting out of the glories of Christ. @Psalm 8 indicates that these glories are no longer limited to Israel, and so presents the Son of man in universal dominion. @Psalm 22 refers to His sufferings in order to secure the purpose of God. @Psalm 24 brings out, without equivocation, who He is in His Person. The Man who has gone in is none other than Jehovah of hosts. And then @Psalm 40, "In the volume of the book it is written of me", refers to the One in whom the purpose of God centres. I thought these points might engage us, particularly @Psalm 2, as being basic, and then @Psalm 22, where we might consider specially the declaration of God's name; and then @Psalm 40.
N.F.A. Does the first book link up definitely with Ephesians in the New Testament, would you say, as unfolding to us the glory of Christ?
G.R.C. There is a very definite link with Ephesians, and with Paul's and John's ministry generally. @Psalm 2 brings out two glorious features of Christ's manhood. The first thing is, "*I* have anointed my king". That is, God has His Christ; and if the purpose of God was ever to be carried through God must have His Christ. He must have the Man whom He could anoint, the Man capable of carrying all through for God. Then there is the relationship in which He stands as Man, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee". These two glories are greatly developed by both Paul and John. Paul commences his ministry by preaching in the synagogues, "Jesus that *he* is the Son of God" (@Acts 9: 20), and he quotes in @Acts 13: 33 from this very passage, "*Thou* art my Son". Following the preaching in @Acts 9, it says he confounded the Jews,
{148}
proving from the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. These are the great pillars of Paul's ministry, that Jesus is the Son of God, and that Jesus is the Christ. Paul's gospel centres in the Son of God, and his ministry of the assembly centres in the Christ. Ephesians is full of the glory of the Christ. Similarly they are the two great features of John's ministry. He writes that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. His emphasis is more on the Son of God.
W.J.S. Do you think we have been in danger of thinking of the Psalms too much on the individual line? Even in the first psalm the generation is suggested, the assembly of the righteous. And it is remarkable that at the end of Luke He can open up the Psalms, and afterwards they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God?
G.R.C. The final thing the Lord brings in is the Psalms. "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled" (@Luke 24: 44). And then He says, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer". He brings in that title, "the Christ".
A.T.G. Could you say a word as to your reference to verse 12, "Kiss the Son", and then the further reference to Paul's ministry as to the Son of God? The Lord says in the gospels that no one knows the Son, but Paul says that we are to arrive at the full knowledge of the Son of God.
G.R.C. It seems to me remarkable that so much is comprised prophetically in the second psalm. First, "*I* have anointed my king;" that is, God has His Christ. His Christ
{149}
is not only His King, but He is His Priest, for it says, "upon Zion, *the hill of my holiness*". Indeed, if God secures His King, He secures His Priest, His Prophet and His Preacher. All those are included in the idea of King according to God. "I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem" (@Ecclesiastes 1: 12). So that, in His Anointed, His Christ, He has the Man who can carry into effect everything that is in the mind of God. The last book of Psalms shows, among other things, that He is not only the Anointed but also the Ark of God's strength (@Psalm 132: 8). But the first book stresses that God has secured His Anointed, the Man who will carry everything through, and this involves finding a place -- indeed at the centre of the universe -- for Jehovah and the Ark of His strength. But the first thing is that God has secured His Christ. Then there is the relationship in which He stands, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee", and we are to arrive at the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man. We are to grow up to Him in all things who is the Head. But then behind all that is the truth of His Person, and the psalm ends with "Kiss the Son", a title which, while attaching to Him only in manhood, yet lays great stress on His Deity. Those who uttered these things in Old Testament times, as Peter says, did not understand the implication of what they were saying, but here is the word to the kings of the earth, "Kiss *the Son*;" and it seems to me that it is a remarkable allusion to His Deity. We need, of course, to see, to begin with, that even the fact that He is God's Anointed and God's Son implies Deity. Mr. Darby says that the Lord Jesus 'had taken a *place*, while never ceasing to be God, and which Godhead alone could fulfil
{150}
the conditions of, outside Godhead'. ¦ We have to take that into account. No one but a Person of the Godhead could ever be God's Christ. And so immediately Paul says, "of whom, as according to flesh, is the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen" (@Romans 9: 5). No less a Person could ever fill out the position of the Christ. Similarly, no one but a Person of the Godhead could fill out the relationship implied in the expression, "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee". But when the title "*the* Son" is used I think it involves His Deity.
W.S.S. Would you say that in @Psalm 2 God introduces a Man who, at the same time, is divine, by means of whom He is going to fill the universe with praise, as in the last psalm?
G.R.C. Exactly. Here is the Man who is going to do it. It brings out His *official* glory, the Christ; and His *personal* glory in manhood, the only-begotten Son. Then there is this reference to *the* Son, which involves *Deity*, I believe.
W.S.S. I think it is exceedingly beautiful. I am always very thankful when I hear the Psalms taken up. Mr. Darby said that there is more of the Spirit of Christ in the Psalms than any other part of Scripture. ¦ I suppose the praises which will ascend to God in their fulness, depend upon the apprehension of the way in which Christ is presented to us, particularly, perhaps, in @Psalm 2.
G.R.C. So that it is good to have Christ before us in the way He is presented. And let us keep in mind that this
¦ J.N.D., *Collected Writings*, Volume 17, page 19
¦ J.N.D. reference not found, but see J.T., N.S., Volume 93, page 491
{151}
word is about to go out to the kings of the earth, "Kiss the Son".
S.H. "I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said unto me". Do you understand that it is the Christ, the Anointed, that is speaking there, and would it confirm to us that He is the Alpha and Omega? The decree seems to be connected with His Deity.
G.R.C. It was Jehovah's decree, I suppose; but then the great mystery is that this Person Himself is no less than Jehovah, as we see in @Psalm 24. The question is raised, "Who is this King of glory?" Who is this glorious Man who has gone through and established the whole purpose of God? "Jehovah of hosts, he is the King of glory".
G.H.S.P. Would @Hebrews 1 and 2 confirm what you are saying: the glory of the Son in chapter 1, in the setting of the revelation of God? Then, in chapter 2, many sons being brought to glory? The response is to be equal to the revelation, because they are both in Christ. Those chapters are full of quotations from the Psalms.
G.R.C. Very good. Chapter 1 stresses His Deity, but in chapter 2 we are associated with Him. But very soon the kings of the earth are to hear this command, "Kiss the Son". No one will hold office in that day unless he acknowledges the royalty and Deity of this Person. The kissing of the hand is customary when a person receives office at the hands of a monarch, and the time is very near when no one will hold office in heaven, or on earth, unless he receives it from Him.
Rem. And it will be done, it will be done!
C.E.J. Does @Ephesians 1: 9, 10 confirm what you are saying as to the purpose of God, "which he purposed in
{152}
himself for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ"?
G.R.C. Very much so. In that day every office-holder in heaven and on earth will hold office only on condition that he kisses the Son. All things are to be headed up in the Christ, the Anointed.
W.S.S. How does this apply at the present time, because it must work out in the assembly in a fuller way, must it not? All must flow from the heart being attached to the Son?
G.R.C. I think so. The greatness of the Person of Christ is cherished in the affections of the assembly, for He is head over all things to the assembly, which is His body; He is that to us *now*. He does not appear to be that to men on earth at the moment; but to the assembly He is ever that. How we love Him in His glory, as He is presented in this psalm!
C.J.H.D. Does God's wisdom enter peculiarly into this matter, along with His purpose, for the word used in @Psalm 2: 6 for anointed, (according to note *f* ) is the same word that is used in @Proverbs 8: 23, where it is said that wisdom was set up from eternity, from the beginning of God's ways. Though this is said of Christ in manhood, the wisdom that purposed it goes back to the past eternity, does it not?
G.R.C. Very good. All things were created by Him and for Him, were they not? Everything was according to plan from the very outset, having in view that the Christ would fill all.
{153}
J.F.P. So that the kiss of allegiance makes way for the outshining of the glory of God in the world to come, in keeping with His purpose?
G.R.C. Quite so, and subjection to the Son at the present time makes way for the service of God in the assembly.
J.F.P. I am sure that is most important, the bearing of it on the service of God at the present time, and the outshining of God in testimony, too.
G.R.C. We should cherish the mystery of His will, to head up all things in the Christ, and have a sense of the imminence of it. But then that would all help in the present service of God. I think for that we need to move on to @Psalm 22. @Psalm 8 enforces the truth that the titles of @Psalm 2 are not limited to Israel. The Christ has universal dominion as the Son of man, and the assembly is linked with Him in it, as we see in @Ephesians 1: 22, 23, where @Psalm 8 is quoted. God has put all things under His feet and given Him to be Head over all things to the assembly which is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all. That is the downward aspect of His headship, as we might say. Adam is the type, and the woman associated with him. The light of God shines through the divinely-appointed Head to the whole creation. @Psalm 22 has in view what is upward. It is a question of what is flowing back to God, beginning in the assembly, as we should say, in verse 22, but becoming universal. "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah ... For the kingdom is Jehovah's" (verses 27, 28). I think we need to take account of the two aspects of Christ's headship: one from God downwards, as typified in Adam, and the other, gathering
{154}
up the response of the universe Godward, as typified in David and Solomon. These are the two great activities of Christ in headship -- to make available to the whole creation the outshining of the blessed God, and then to gather up the response of the universe to His God.
W.J.S. And we are coming into the gain of that at the present moment? The service begins to take shape in @Psalm 8, does it not?
G.R.C. Very good. "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established praise because of thine adversaries, to still the enemy and the avenger". It is a Gittith psalm, a psalm of pressure. The pressure lies in the fact that both the external and the internal enemies are there, as the note indicates. Both are present today, but in the midst of the pressure praise is perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings.
W.J.S. And the Lord quotes that, very near to the supreme moment of His suffering and pressure, does He not?
G.R.C. He does. He was approaching Gethsemane. The word is cognate with Gittith. To Him it meant pressure to the fullest measure. @Psalm 22 indicates the depths of pressure into which Jesus went.
E.C.L. Would you say a word as to the bearing of death on what is due to God? According to @Psalm 8 He was made a little lower than the angels, and @Hebrews 2: 9 adds "on account of the suffering of death". @Psalm 22 indicates what death meant to Him. Does the death of Christ stand between the two eternities, as it were?
{155}
G.R.C. That is very touching. We have spoken of "from eternity to eternity". You are thinking that the cross stands in between?
E.C.L. How much God is going to get out of the last enemy of mankind in that way.
G.R.C. Has it not brought out the marvellous devotedness of the Christ, the Son of God, that He should have gone into such depths for the sake of *His* God? Do we not need to remember that @Psalm 22 refers to the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His God? We know that they were necessary on our account, but they are viewed there as endured for the sake of His God, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" This glorious Man could say, "My God", in a way that no one else could ever say it. He said, "My God" as knowing God in the Absolute, and it was that very knowledge which meant such intense suffering for Him. He was going to face the sin question in the light of God known to Him in the Absolute.
E.C.L. Quite so. How much suffering it meant, in order that the glory of God might be maintained to the full. Yet praise could be secured only on that basis.
G.R.C. And so what is before Him is, "thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel". God is said to dwell in other circumstances. He dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen, nor is able to see. He also dwells among His people in grace in the wilderness (@2 Corinthians 6: 16). But there is something very touching about this, "Thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel". If He is to dwell with the creature, surely this is the most delightful setting -- to dwell amid the praises of the Israel of God. Because
{156}
of what He is -- God is love -- the desire to dwell with intelligent, responsive creatures was such that, though never ceasing to dwell in light unapproachable, He moved out into the realm of declaration and revelation. And so, in this psalm, so full of the Lord's sufferings, He says, "I will declare thy name" -- a most important matter connected with the purpose of God. The psalm contains these two great themes: the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His God, and coupled with it, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren".
W.McK. Are our minds to be impressed with the wonder and mystery of the incarnation, as that which is the basis of everything for God for time and eternity? @Psalm 2 brings in the incarnation, and then in @Psalm 22 He says, "I am a worm, and no man". How far He was prepared to go!
G.R.C. I think what you say about the incarnation is most important. "Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee" would refer to that; and thus God secured His Christ. God's Son is His Anointed.
W.J.S. Are you linking up @Psalm 22: 3, with verse 22? Does Israel suggest a princely setting, and the Lord Jesus, as prophetically speaking here, praises in the midst of a princely company?
G.R.C. I think so. We would have to link verse 3 with the Israel of God -- the assembly.
G.W.B. Is that why you asked for the title of @Psalm 22 to be read?
G.R.C. I think the title is a reference prophetically to the assembly, 'To the chief Musician, upon Aijeleth-Shahar', which means 'the hind of the morning'.
{157}
W.S.S. Were you going to say something more about the declaration of the name?
J.J.T. Was not the Lord in haste to make known that name "from the horns of the buffaloes"?
G.R.C. "From the horns of the buffaloes hast thou answered me. I will declare thy name". Do you not think that God Himself also, was waiting for this moment?
J.J.T. Does it link with "my God and your God"?
G.R.C. I think so, but I wonder whether we ought to begin with @Matthew 28: 19 in thinking of "I will declare thy name". I am enquiring, as in all things, for help; but Matthew is a gospel where the Lord Jesus quotes from this psalm, saying, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (@Matthew 27: 46), and the depth of His sufferings is stressed. Also it is the assembly gospel. The assembly in @Matthew 16 is the vessel of praise. The gates of hades cannot prevail against it. Hades is the place of silence (see @Isaiah 38: 18), but the assembly's praises can never be silenced, as the praises of Zion have been. Hades¬ gates can never succeed in causing assembly praise to cease.
A.B. Referring to Matthew's gospel, would there be a foundation in holiness established in the death of Christ, so that God could answer Christ from the horns of the buffaloes? God is glorified in Christ, and then God answers Him, bringing Him out of death.
G.R.C. I think so. Therefore I wonder whether "I will declare thy name unto my brethren" would refer, in the first instance, to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in @Matthew 28: 19. The Lord Jesus calls the disciples His brethren in @Matthew 28: 10.
{158}
W.S.S. I had that in mind in asking the question. I feel what you are saying to us is going to help us greatly in the setting of this psalm, where the purpose and counsels of God are being secured. You could not think of a partial declaration, could you?
G.R.C. No. And so one would not shut out @John 20: 17 at all, which brings out so fully our association with Christ. In fact @John 1: 18 goes further than @Psalm 22: 22 in a way, because there it is declaring *God*, not simply declaring His name. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". And the word, 'declare' there has greater force, I think, than the word in @Psalm 22. It is bringing out all that is to be known of God. But the Lord says here, "I will declare *thy name*", so I wondered whether we ought to make room for @Matthew 28: 19.
A.B. Does it involve an answer in praise to this wonderful declaration, involving all three Persons of the Godhead?
G.R.C. I think we ought to consider that. The Lord says, in spirit, "I will declare thy name", and at the end of Matthew He says, "baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". That is not God as dwelling in unapproachable light, but as having come out in this most remarkable way.
H.A.H. Does it link with the introduction of the psalm, "My God, my God"?
G.R.C. I think we ought to keep in our minds that it is the sufferings of Christ for His God, and the declaring of the name of His God. The Father is involved in the name, but it is the name of His God. In Matthew He says, "the
{159}
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".
E.A.E. Would it link with @Psalm 48: 10, "According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise"? That would be the declaration of the name as we now have it -- Father, Son and Holy Spirit -- so that the praise would flow accordingly?
G.R.C. I would think that, but am enquiring for help.
A.A.B. Would we carry in our minds, in the spirit of worship, the greatness of the mediatorial position the Lord Jesus has taken? I am thinking of @Psalm 22, and how He speaks in it, in the position of manhood -- the word "My God", involving the reality of His manhood.
G.R.C. It is the reality of His manhood, and yet He is the Man who is Jehovah's fellow, as the prophet says in connection with the sword awakening against Him. He was truly Man, a perfect Man, considering for His God, and going into the depths for His God, and yet they were depths that no one but a Person of the Godhead could ever have gone into. Is that so?
A.A.B. Yes. I would like to refer to @Psalm 2: 3 again, "Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us!" Is the bond between Jehovah and His Anointed seen in John's gospel?
G.R.C. You are thinking that Jehovah and His Anointed are really the Father and the Son? It is John who says, "he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life" (@John 3: 36); and again, that everyone who sees the Son and believes on Him should have life eternal.
{160}
H.A.H. Do you think the working *out* of what was in the heart of the Lord in @Psalm 22 is seen throughout the books of the Psalms?
G.R.C. I would. I think what Mr. L. said about the psalm standing between the two eternities is most interesting. Everything worked to this, and from this. The two things: Christ going into the depths for His God, which was necessary to bring out what His God is in His nature and moral attributes; and then the declaring the name of His God. The name of @Matthew 28: 19 is a name of love and grace, conveying the way God has come out in order to effect His purpose. The operations of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, throughout this period are operations of love and grace.
R.S.W. Is it in relation to moral questions in Matthew?
G.R.C. If it were not for the operations of the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, none of us would ever face the moral question. I do not think that name in itself involves the moral question; but if men were to come into the gain of God's purpose, the moral question had to be faced. Only the operations in grace of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, have ever succeeded in bringing persons to face the moral question.
S.H. You spoke of the blessedness of God earlier. Are you linking the declaring of the name with the blessedness of God made known to us?
G.R.C. I am. And I wonder whether we have apprehended sufficiently that *there is only one Declarer of God, and only one Declarer of God's Name*. What do you say to that?
{161}
S.H. We can see it according to Scripture.
G.R.C. Have we been too prone to search apostolic doctrine to understand the declaration of God? I can see that the apostles¬ doctrine is based on it and confirms it, but no apostle could say he declared God's name. Paul was a minister of the gospel to bring us into the gain of the declaration, and he was the minister of the assembly to bring about response to it, but he never says he was the declarer of God's name. Where must we go if we want to learn about God? Who must we go to?
M.H.T. Do you distinguish between the declaration of the name of God, and the proclamation of the name of Jehovah to Moses in @Exodus 34: 5 - 7? Jehovah's name is said to be proclaimed, "Jehovah, Jehovah God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty".
G.R.C. Jehovah was, and is, His name; but the disclosure of that name is not said to be a declaration. While He was known to Israel as Jehovah, He dwelt in thick darkness. That name implied His faithfulness, yet Moses did not see His face, only His back parts. So that God had not come out. As far as men were concerned, He dwelt in thick darkness, although in His own Being He dwells in light unapproachable. But now He *has* come out in the fullest possible way in which He can be known to the creature. And so the Lord has declared His name, according to Matthew, if what we are saying is right; but John goes further in saying, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him" (@John 1: 18).
{162}
This seems to me to go further than the declaring of the name. All that can be known of God has come out.
A.A.B. The pronoun "he" is emphatic. Does that support what you say as to there being only one Declarer?
G.R.C. Very good.
E.C.L. Is it also to be noted that it includes what is seen? "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared". Is it what has been set out personally, not only what has been spoken about of God in testimony?
G.R.C. I think so. So that while the name is the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; when you go to John's gospel the Lord brings out very clearly who the Father is, and what He does. He does this to some extent in Matthew, but not in so full a way as in John. He also brings out clearly the truth of His own Person in John, and also the Personality of the Holy Spirit, and the bearing of these truths upon each other. And then, as you say, He says, "He that has seen me has seen the Father" (@John 14: 9) and "If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father" (verse 7). The Father was dwelling in Him. John the baptist also saw the Spirit descending as a dove, and it abode upon Him. The fulness was there in Christ. Is that right?
E.C.L. Yes. It was different from a proclamation.
G.R.C. I wonder whether (I speak suggestively) we have paid enough attention to the fact that there is only one Declarer of God and of His name. It is what *He* has brought out that constitutes the declaration. Have we been inclined to search apostolic doctrine in order to get clear as to the Godhead, instead of giving due attention to what the
{163}
Lord Jesus Himself has said and expressed? Apostolic doctrine, of course, helps.
H.W. Would you look upon the whole of John's gospel as being, in a sense, the amplification of the name in @Matthew 28: 19? The whole of John brings before us the activities of each of the Divine Persons, and, whilst he does not refer to the formula of @Matthew 28, the truth is given to us in a living kind of way?
G.R.C. That is what I had in mind. As to our coming into the fulness of the christian's place in association and union with Christ, He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
H.W. John's gospel having come in so much later than Matthew's, the saints have this wonderful unfolding of the formula opened up in a living and spiritual kind of way.
G.R.C. Very good.
C.J.H.D. Is the 'hind of the morning' to be found spiritually in @John 20 where the Lord says, "Woman"? It says at the beginning of that chapter, "Mary … comes in early morn to the tomb". She came into the light of the morning in regard of the Man?
G.R.C. Just so. Clearly Mary had the features of the hind of the morning, and those are features the Lord looks for in His assembly. It shows that the truth of union, the truth of the assembly's relations with Christ, must underlie the spiritual energy and alacrity that is needed to enter on to the highest levels of praise to God, in keeping with the Lord's words, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17).
{164}
M.H.T. Do we see not only the agility of the hind in Mary of Magdala, but also in what is said of Naphtali, "A hind let loose; He giveth goodly words" (@Genesis 49: 21)? No more goodly words were ever entrusted to a messenger than those that the Lord entrusted to Mary.
G.R.C. Very good. In @Psalm 40 it says, "Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire: ears hast thou prepared me. Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not demanded; Then said I, Behold, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me -- To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight". Christ is the One in whom the purpose of God centres, so that in the roll of the book it is written of *Him*. This completes our contemplation, in this reading, of the glories of His Person, all having in view that He should become our Centre, and that there should be a resulting note of praise, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity! Amen, and Amen".
{165}
THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD (2)
G R Cowell
@Psalm 42: 1, 2; @Psalm 45: 1, 6 - 9; @Psalm 48: 1, 2, 8 - 10; @Psalm 68: 17, 18, 24, 32 - 35; @Psalm 69: 1, 2, 9; @Psalm 72: 18 - 20
G.R.C. It will be seen in the passages that we have read to what a large extent God, as such, is the theme of this second book. Not now so much as relative to His purpose, but as the One known to the saints in the way He has effectuated His purpose, both here in testimony and soon in the day of display. So the ascription of praise is, "Blessed be *Jehovah Elohim*, the God of Israel", that name Jehovah Elohim standing related particularly to His purpose as to man, "who alone doeth wondrous things!" It is a question of what He *does*. "And blessed be his glorious name for ever! and let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen, and Amen". The soul is looking on to the day of display, but blessing God as knowing Him already as the One who alone doeth wondrous things. That is, the soul understands what God has already effected in a testimonial way. The assembly is already here responsive to Christ in the light of what He is to her and she to Him, according to @Psalm 45; and responsive to God in the light of what she is as the city of God according to @Psalm 48. The assembly is already here and functioning. @Psalm 68 brings out the victorious service of Christ, as the One who has ascended, but what is it but that He also descended, according to @Psalm 69. He ascends in @Psalm 68, but He is the One who also descended in @Psalm 69 to bring all this
{166}
to pass. And so the book ends with this note of praise and worship to Jehovah Elohim, the God of Israel, "who alone doeth wondrous things!" in the appreciation of His glorious Name, not now simply as a declaration, but as understanding the operations of God, what He has effected. And then one might just add that the book begins with the soul panting after God. "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God". The Father has sought us in grace; the Son, too, the Lord Jesus, has sought us; and the Spirit has operated; but where a soul is divinely affected, it pants after *God*. Nothing will satisfy the soul of man as wrought upon by the Spirit, except God Himself. "When shall I come and appear before God?" This book shows how these pantings are satisfied, and therefore closes with "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended". Every longing is stilled, and met by the One who alone doeth wondrous things. He has so wrought that we know what it is to appear before God in the city of our God, the city of the great King. But I think the opening of the book confirms, from our side, what has been before us so much, that God is the ultimate. God is the ultimate in worship, but He is also the ultimate in the soul's longings. The soul who has not had the experience of appearing before God in holy splendour, suitable to Him in His majesty and greatness as God, has never tasted yet complete soul-satisfaction.
J.F.G. Would this be the outcome of understanding how God has moved according to His purpose and counsel, the soul coming into the gain of that?
G.R.C. That is what I thought. The first book indicates the purpose of God, and the Man of His purpose. But in
{167}
this book it is the God who effects His purpose, who alone doeth wondrous things. So that the assembly comes to light, we might say, in a substantial way in @Psalm 45 and @Psalm 48, firstly as the queen, standing in relation to Christ, and secondly as the city of the great King, standing related to God.
A.M. Does this psalm represent a state of soul pleasing to God over against the assumption of Korah?
G.R.C. It does. The sons of Korah figure much in this book. They refer to the saints as vessels of mercy. God has been pleased to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared for glory, us, whom He has also called. Sovereign mercy is the basis of our relations with God, as God. The sense of that in the soul underlies the experiences of this book.
G.W.B. Is your thought that these longings of the soul find their answer in the assembly?
G.R.C. Yes. "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?" Where can we appear before God, thoroughly in keeping with all that He is, but in the assembly?
W.S.S. Would @Psalm 43: 3, 4 help? "Send out thy light and thy truth: *they* shall lead me, *they* shall bring me to thy holy mount, and unto thy habitations. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto the God of the gladness of my joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God".
G.R.C. That is very beautiful.
W.McK. Does Romans work out the pantings of the soul after God, and do the doxologies indicate the way that the soul reaches God?
{168}
G.R.C. That is very good. God is the great theme of Romans, just as God is the great theme of Ephesians. Paul's ministry shows the way we may come and appear before God. Paul experienced it, perhaps, as no other man has done, and his doxologies indicate his appreciation of the God before whom he appeared.
J.F.P. I was thinking of the deep sense of mercy Paul had according to @1 Timothy 1: 13, and the satisfied longings of his soul rising up in the great ascription of praise and worship to God in verse 17.
G.R.C. 1 Timothy deals with the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God. As you say Paul says, "mercy was shewn me", and within a few verses he is saying, "to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages. Amen".
F.J.D. Would you say what is in mind in the living God?
G.R.C. I suppose it is in contrast to the deadness of idolatry and of judaism. It is a most attractive expression. Jesus is the Son of the living God -- we are called Sons of the living God (@Romans 9: 26), and the assembly is the assembly of the living God.
W.J.S. The Thessalonians turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.
A.B. Would the praise of God be enriched by experience with God? The psalmist says, "God my rock", then "God of my strength" and "the God of the gladness of my joy".
G.R.C. It would. The third book especially deals with the side of experience, as we may see in our next reading.
{169}
It enriches the response to God. There must be experience with God.
W.J.S. I believe the earliest reference to God in this way is in @Joshua 3: 10, "Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in your midst". It is in connection with the Ark going into the Jordan.
R.F.D. Would "from eternity to eternity" be a suggestion as to the living God -- the One that abides?
G.R.C. Yes. And does it not suggest living affections? The living God could only be satisfied with a world of life, a world of living response.
A.B. Does the indwelling of the Holy Spirit have any bearing on soul thirst after God? The Lord met it in @John 4, going on to the thought of "God is a Spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth".
G.R.C. That is very good. The thirst of the human soul can only be met in God Himself, and that is met in this dispensation, by the gift of the Holy Spirit.
W.C.P. Do you think there is a link with that in the welling forth in @Psalm 45? Does that suppose that the soul has the gain of the Spirit?
G.R.C. I think it does. It is a living touch. As to @Psalm 45, it is a great thing to take account of what is actually effected and existing here in the scene of testimony, and soon to be displayed. The God who alone doeth wondrous things has operated in such a manner that the assembly is here. The heading of the psalm is 'Upon Shoshannim', which means 'lilies'. It refers to the purity, chastity and fragrance, of those that form the assembly. It is a vessel composed of such.
{170}
W.J.S. In @John 4 there was a soul panting, and what a testimony she was able to render as having her thirst satisfied: "Come see a man".
G.R.C. I think the first element of satisfaction is to see that Man, the Man of @Psalm 45. "Is not he the Christ?" (@John 4: 29). We are then on the way to having every thirst of our souls met. In the first instance we need the Man, and we need to understand our relationship with the Man, through whom alone we can come and appear before God.
C.J.H.D. The Man really is the answer to that enquiry in Joshua. Joshua goes on to say, "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you" (@Joshua 3: 11). Is not that the proof of the living God being in the midst, and might it not be linked with @Ephesians 5: 14, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee"? Is the Christ, as apprehended according to @Psalm 45 in His glorious shining, the answer to the deadness around us?
G.R.C. Very good. The shining of the Christ is the true christian light, is it not?
J.J.T. Is one of the wondrous things that God does in @Psalm 45 that He anoints the Lord with the oil of gladness above His companions?
G.R.C. He is singled out because of who He is -- He is God: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever" but then He is singled out, too, in His perfect and glorious manhood, as anointed by God. "Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee". It shows how the Deity and manhood of Christ are blended in Scripture, and the need for flexibility of mind, in the power of the Spirit, to apprehend
{171}
the truth of His Person. On the one hand He is God, and, as Man enthroned, is saluted as God. Yet, immediately afterwards, He is referred to as the Man anointed by His God on account of moral qualifications.
E.C.L. Do you think we have to appreciate Christ as Man to understand the greatness of God? I was thinking of the way the Lord used the expression "My God". The more we appreciate the Man, the more wonderful His God must be; and His God is our God.
G.R.C. Quite so. Much depends upon our apprehension of *the Christ*, the Man of God's purpose. Christianity takes its name from that title, and christians themselves take their name from it. It has given character to christianity in its testimonial setting. The church's links with Him stand related to it, for the union of the church is with Christ. It shows the importance of understanding the official greatness of Christ -- *the Man*.
H.A.H. Would this be the normal way of having part in the service of God, from satisfied hearts welling forth with a good matter?
G.R.C. Yes, and the first thing is hearts satisfied and welling forth because of their occupation touching the King. The King here is Christ.
W.S.S. In that connection would you say a word on the last clause of the heading, 'A song of the Beloved'? The question would be as to Christ being the Beloved of our hearts, would it?
G.R.C. It is really the language of the assembly, is it not?
W.S.S. That is what I was thinking, but then it must be the language of each heart individually?
{172}
G.R.C. It must be. The King is also the Beloved in the Song of Songs. It is because *the King* is the Beloved that He has such sway over the people, and can hold them all for God.
W.S.S. I was thinking, too, that it brings us into communion with the Father in regard to the Son.
G.R.C. I am sure that is right. He says, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth! *I will put my Spirit upon him*" (@Isaiah 42: 1). That is the Christ, is it not? The Father's soul finds its delight in Him and our souls find their delight in Him. That gives us a 'lily' character. As the saints are marked by the character of lilies, the assembly as the chaste virgin comes into view, I think. Lilies suggest chastity.
W.H.K. Are you thinking of this psalm in connection with our service on the Lord's Day morning; the entrance into, and enjoyment of, union helping us to appear before God rightly, gloriously?
G.R.C. Exactly. It prepares for @Psalm 48.
A.B. Would it bring in the greatness of the assembly as the vessel in which the various glories of Christ are given expression to in praise?
G.R.C. The varied glories brought out here afford material for expansion in the power of the Spirit in our service of praise to Christ. What He is in His moral perfection; what He is in His military prowess; what He is as on the throne and as wielding the sceptre; what He is as anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions; and then what He is in the palace; in the inner place, are all features of glory which stimulate praise.
{173}
H.W.S. What is the thought of 'instruction' in connection with this?
G.R.C. Does it not afford instruction as to the response in praise of the assembly to Christ?
E.C.L. Do you think the way the new covenant is added in the Supper to the breaking of bread has some relation to the way God comes into His own through Christ, Christ having His own glory in connection with it?
G.R.C. Would you mind saying more as to the new covenant?
E.C.L. I thought the new covenant would mean that what God has set out to do will be established. Does not the assembly hold these thoughts for the time being, until the day of actuality? Christ's glory in that connection is held by faith in fulness, and satisfies the heart of the assembly?
G.R.C. So that from the standpoint of our relations with Christ, @Psalm 45 brings satisfaction to our longing souls and the Lord Jesus has what His heart is seeking in the assembly, even so far as to anticipate the time when the queen will stand on His right hand. Actually, I suppose, that is future but anticipated now, because, according to @Ephesians 1, He is head over all things to the assembly, which is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all. The Spirit is here that we might enter into this in our spirits now, and that there might be an answer to Christ commensurate with it.
E.C.L. I was thinking that. Sometimes the covenant is just slurred over, but it has been added to the breaking of bread for a reason?
{174}
G.R.C. Do you think it is important that in @1 Corinthians 11: 25 the Lord says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood", not adding there, "which is poured out for you"? Is He not anticipating that the assembly will have an appreciation of all that He has secured for God on the basis of His blood? The universe of bliss is secured on that basis.
A.T.G. Do you mean that there is something additional in the reference to the new covenant in the epistles to the Corinthians, as over against the references in the Old Testament?
G.R.C. I think the Lord is stressing His blood. I think in the Supper, He stresses "my body" and "my blood". As to His body, He says, "This is my body, which is *for you*" (@1 Corinthians 11: 24), because His body could not be said to have been given for any company except the assembly. But when He speaks of "my blood", I think He would count on the assembly having some understanding of the vast effects of His blood-shedding.
J.W.G. Is it a wider thought than "poured out for you" in @Luke 22: 20, involving the whole system of glory based on the redemptive work of Christ?
G.R.C. Quite so. We have to remember, of course, the scripture, that God purchased the assembly with the blood of His own (@Ephesians 20: 28). But it does seem to me that, according to @1 Corinthians 11, in referring to His blood in the Supper, the Lord counted on our intelligent affections apprehending the vast scope of things which has been affected by His blood. According to @Colossians 1: 19, 20, "in him all the fulness … was pleased to dwell, and by him
{175}
to reconcile all things to itself, having made peace by the blood of his cross".
A.W.P. Have you the tabernacle system in mind? The whole system was sprinkled with blood.
G.R.C. Yes, I think the Lord would count on us having some apprehension of the whole system of glory. The assembly has her own place in it. To give the psalm a present application, she is the queen.
G.H.S.P. The literal blood-shedding of Christ is, I think, only recorded in John's gospel. I thought that put it in a most exalted setting. It confirms what you were saying, that the references to the blood need to be elevated in our minds, and in the place that they may have in our service Godward.
G.R.C. So in @Ephesians 1: 6, 7 it is the blood of the Beloved, is it not? "He has taken us into favour in the Beloved: in whom we have redemption through his blood".
E.S. @Hebrews 9: 14 suggests that we worship the living God on the basis of it. "How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship the living God?"
G.R.C. We could have no access to God, as God, apart from the blood of the Christ.
W.S.S. I am very interested in what you have been saying about the cup and the covenant. It has been very much in one's mind of late that the Lord would carry our minds into the fulness of what has been secured. It is opened out to us in a wonderful way as we are together.
{176}
W.H.K. "This do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" (@1 Corinthians 11: 25). Would that widen our consideration of all the glories that belong to Christ?
G.R.C. Yes. We are calling Him to mind relative to the whole system of blessing, which rests upon the immutable foundation of His blood. And that greatly magnifies Him.
C.J.H.D. The celebration in heaven in @Revelation 5: 9, 10 is wonderful. "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and made them to our God kings and priests".
H.A.H. Yet the inward position as seen in the palace, is far greater to the heart of Christ than outward glory.
G.R.C. It is. Only very favoured people have access to the palace, but the queen, of course, has a right to be there in every way. She is all glorious within the royal apartments.
H.A.H. That would go beyond the teaching in first Corinthians?
G.R.C. It would. The Supper is really the doorway into the inward side of things, is it not? In the @Song of Songs 1: 4 the spouse says, "The king hath brought me into his chambers". So this song ends up with what is within the palace.
A.M. Would you say a word about the joy entering into the service? It is stressed here. What I notice is that it is the *Lord's* joy. It refers to the oil of gladness, and then "stringed instruments have made thee glad". The service begins with *our* joy, "The disciples rejoiced therefore"
{177}
(@John 20: 20), but our fullest joy is to sense His joy, is it not?
G.R.C. I am sure that is right. Verse 15 goes back to the joy of the saints, "With joy and gladness shall they be brought". But, as you say, the greatest joy we have is to take account of His joy, although the whole scene is one of gladness. He is anointed with the oil of gladness *above* His companions. They are all anointed with the oil of gladness; there is not a sad face there. Nehemiah indicates that it was not right even to appear before an earthly monarch with a sad face (@Nehemiah 2: 1, 2). No one appears before God, properly speaking, with a sad face. All appear before God as anointed with the oil of gladness, but then the Lord Jesus is supreme.
M.H.T. Is it striking that in this love psalm, as you might term it, attention is drawn, in the first place, to the beauty of Christ as the One who is fairer than the sons of men. Then, in the second place, to the beauty of the assembly, as dissociating herself from past history? "And the king will desire thy beauty". We have in one of our hymns, 'All fair art Thou, Lord Jesus, Th¬ assembly too all fair' (`487:4).
G.R.C. "The king will desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him;" and then it goes on further, "All glorious is the king's daughter within" -- within the royal apartments. What a fitting companion for the king!
C.J.H.D. Has she not known His right hand according to the @Song of Songs 2: 6 in another relation? It says there "his right hand doth embrace me". Does that not capacitate her to stand in queenly grace at His right hand, because there has been the intimacy of affection?
{178}
G.R.C. Yes, I am sure. And then as we are responsive to Christ in this marital way, does it not prepare us for the service of God? The psalms immediately introduce the city of God. @Psalm 46 is the city in a hostile setting, yet "God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved" (verse 5), and Emmanuel is known there, "Jehovah of hosts is with us" (verse 7). The assembly is now the vessel of administration in the scene of testimony, and the language of @Psalm 46 can therefore be applied to her as here as in adverse conditions. @Psalm 47 and 48 lead on to the greatness of God, and of the assembly as standing in relation to God.
D.S.H. You were speaking earlier of Christ as the King in @Psalm 45. Do you think there is a difference in @Psalm 48?
G.R.C. Yes. In @Psalm 48 God is the King. Christ has His part in that, of course, because He is God. But the presentation of God as King is a very great matter. It is not now Christ viewed as King, as the Man anointed of God, but God Himself as the King. And so @Psalm 47: 6 - 8 says, "Sing psalms of God, sing psalms; sing psalms unto our King, sing psalms! For God is the King of all the earth; sing psalms with understanding. God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness". And then the next psalm says, "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the hill of his holiness. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, *the city of the great King*". What a great thing it would be if we understood the assembly better as the city of the great King, God Himself being the great King.
{179}
C.J.H.D. Would you say a word as to the Father and our ministering to Him on the way, as it were, to the great climax of God?
G.R.C. Does not the appreciation of Christ as the Beloved turn our thoughts to the Father? He is our Beloved; but we think of the Father's delight in Him, and our hearts are led to the Father. We worship the Father, and enjoy our place in the Father's house, and the blessedness of being loved by the Father, with the love wherewith He loves the Son. Each side of the truth is incomparably great. How blessed is our place in the Father's house, "that where I am ye also may be" (@John 14: 3). But then the city of God is another side of the truth. It is not our place in the Father's house, but God's place, the place where He is praised. The Father's house is the inner side of things, but the service of praise is going on now in the time of testimony and will soon find full expression in the scene of display. But what is going on now in the time of testimony should be worthy of the great King.
A.B. Does that show the peculiar blessedness of God being among His people in hostile circumstances? There is a reference in @Psalm 46 to the sanctuary of the habitations of the Most High, and then it says (verse 5), "God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her at the dawn of the morning". God is among His people in the scene of the enemy's power.
G.R.C. Yes, so that these psalms are very much in line with Matthew's gospel; the King, that is Christ Himself, and what He has in the assembly; and then what the assembly is as the city of the great King. The Lord uses
{180}
that term in His teaching in @Matthew 5: 35. He was referring primarily to the earthly Jerusalem; and yet surely the assembly would not be absent from His mind, for the assembly is in view all through that gospel.
A.A.G. Is not the response to God, as such, carried on in the intimacy of the knowledge of the Father's love?
G.R.C. I think it is. The Father's house is privilege. The Lord says, "I go to prepare you a place" (@John 14: 2). The place of privilege and intimacy equips us for our part in the assembly as the great vessel of responsibility. I am not referring to what it is as a responsible vessel down here. I am viewing it abstractly in relation to Christ, as the vessel which is entrusted with responsibilities which no other vessel in the universe ever will be called upon to fulfil, and in the fulfilment of which there will be no breakdown. And, in that sense, she is the city of the great King, that is, of God Himself. And the city is an inclusive idea, because it says in the verse already referred to, "the city of God, the sanctuary of the habitations of the Most High". The city includes the sanctuary and the habitations.
E.C.L. Would the light of the city of God according to @Psalm 48 affect all the gatherings of the saints?
G.R.C. I think we touch it in the fullest way as we pass, in spirit, out of the scene of time and locality, in the power of the Holy Spirit. In our response to Christ we pass in spirit out of time and locality. We respond to Him in the light of the church complete; and similarly in regard to God. As the city of the great King, we are viewing the assembly in its full place and dignity according to the purpose of God.
{181}
E.C.L. Is not the city usually linked with administration?
G.R.C. It is, but we must also see that the city is an inclusive idea. It includes the sanctuary. It says, "in the city of our God, in the hill of his holiness", and His praise is connected with it. This is really the service of the sanctuary, but it is taking place in this vessel which is called the city of the great King. It implies that the administrative side has been attended to. There is fulfilled responsibility as to administration, and now it is a question of the praise of God -- "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be *praised* in the city of our God, in the hill of his holiness". And again, "We have thought, O God, of thy loving-kindness, in the midst of thy temple". We cannot dissociate the thought of the city and the temple and the sanctuary. The city is the over-all thought, which includes administration, and, as administration is carried out and fulfilled, God's praise is secured in this great vessel. But the whole matter is worthy of the great King.
H.A.H. Does @Psalm 48 present it in a military setting, as impregnable?
G.R.C. Quite so.
R.S.W. Does it afford satisfaction for divine affections? The term *new* Jerusalem is mentioned in Revelation.
G.R.C. Yes. The city goes into eternity, the holy city, new Jerusalem. It is the centre of light and influence eternally. Its eternal responsibility is, on the one hand, to maintain in integrity the praise due to God in His greatness. So that, in the presence of the whole universe, glory, honour and majesty are fully ascribed to Him, the
{182}
Great King. On the other hand, it is to diffuse the light of God, and thus influence the whole universe -- that is the administrative side. Of course, while evil is present, administration has to take on a military character, but in the eternal state evil will not be present. Nevertheless it is still the city, and still the city of the Great King, as I understand it, because the word in @Revelation 21: 5 is, "He that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new". The throne is still there, and the great King is sitting upon it, and the holy city, new Jerusalem, is His city, all through eternity, as I understand it.
A.W.P. Do you still connect government with it?
G.R.C. In the way of light and influence, yes. It is the great diffuser of divine light and influence to the universe. But then internally it is the great centre of praise, and fills out the praise of the universe to God. So "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God". I believe the assembly is the vessel which will have a leading part in the praises of the universe, as herself led by Christ, all through eternity. She is the city of the great King. She is in every way worthy of the great King, and enclosed in that city, as it were, is the temple, the sanctuary, and the garden. All that is connected with the great King is there.
D.S.H. Why do we get this reference to the loving kindness of God in verse 9?
G.R.C. Has not everything depended upon that? What have you in mind?
D.S.H. Well, I was wondering if the appreciation of that is a basic thing in connection with the praise of God. Perhaps we may tend to associate God's loving-kindness
{183}
more with our daily circumstances than with the highest and loftiest thoughts of it.
G.R.C. It seems to me the more we apprehend God, as God, in His greatness and majesty, the greater will be our appreciation of the mercy and loving-kindness that have fitted us to be in the presence of such a great and glorious God. We are vessels of mercy before prepared for glory.
W.J.S. He is the God that the sons of Korah appreciated.
G.R.C. Quite so.
G.W.B. Does the thought in the Psalms go as far as the tabernacle of God with men?
G.R.C. That would be another view of the same vessel. On the public side it is the holy city, new Jerusalem, and in that setting prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, showing that those two thoughts go together. What the assembly is to Christ bridally, and what she is to God city-wise are linked together. @Psalm 45 and @Psalm 48 go together in that respect. But the tabernacle of God is the inner life, the inward side of things, where we know the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in personal relations. There is the inward side all the time; but what we are thinking of now is the testimonial side in praise. God has now, and will have in the world to come, and will have in eternity, a vessel capable of ascribing the worship and honour due to Him as the great King.
W.J.S. The end of @Psalm 48 says, "For this God is our God for ever and ever". What a glorious consummation that is. And so it says, "According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth". There is a vessel that can fully praise God according to His name.
{184}
G.R.C. It is the God known to us by the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Yet the disclosure of this Name does not mean that other names, each of which express some attribute and glory of Deity, are discarded. "Thy name" would be the aggregated wealth of all.
W.McK. Would you say that, while the assembly is a creature vessel, there will be no possibility of breakdown in the praise of God?
G.R.C. That is just it. It has impressed me, that the assembly is the great vessel of fulfilled responsibility, all through eternity. There is no other creature vessel with such responsibilities allotted to it as the assembly. Yet she will never break down, because, as the assembly in Christ Jesus, she is united to Christ, and, in the support of His love, and the power of the Spirit, she will fulfil every responsibility allotted to her. All will be carried out without breakdown.
G.H.M. Would you say what is conveyed by @Revelation 21: 22, "I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb"?
G.R.C. It seems that there is such nearness to God Himself in that city that there is no need for a building. In an ordinary city of men you need a temple in which to approach God. In the earthly Jerusalem there is the temple. But the saints of this dispensation *are themselves the shrine of God*, for the Spirit of God dwells in them (@1 Corinthians 3: 16). So John sees no temple in the heavenly Jerusalem. God Himself *is* its temple, and the Lamb.
A.T.G. Why does it say, "thy right hand is full of righteousness" (@Psalm 48: 10)?
{185}
G.R.C. That is a great feature with God. The stability of the whole universe of bliss depends on righteousness.
A.T.G. Does it refer at all to the basis in the blood of Christ that we have had in mind before?
G.R.C. The foundation has been laid in the death of Christ and now 'God's righteousness with glory bright' (`88:4) is the basis of all His actings in grace. There would be no stability, no solid basis for the universe of bliss, apart from righteousness. His right hand is full of righteousness, and that is a great matter about which to praise God. The Son, in speaking to the Father in @John 17: 25 says, "Righteous Father". All His purpose of love is carried through in righteousness.
W.H.K. In the new heavens and the new earth righteousness dwells.
A.M. Does righteousness link up with the acts of Jehovah? I was thinking of what you were pressing, "who alone *doeth* wondrous things".
G.R.C. All His acts are righteous.
J.F.P. Would not the reference to the city as *new*, in @Revelation 21: 2 confirm what you have been saying as to its eternal character? It goes through the intensive administration of the thousand years, and is seen as perennially fresh at the end.
G.R.C. That is very beautiful -- "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", and the tabernacle of God. There is eternal freshness and fragrance.
I think we ought to pass on now to @Psalm 68. All that has engaged us has been brought to pass by the One who has ascended, and if He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth. @Psalm 68
{186}
gives the ascension, and @Psalm 69 His descent. @Psalm 69 is 'Upon Shoshannim', which is 'lilies', showing that, as we respond to Him according to @Psalm 45, which is upon lilies, so correspondingly, as true to Him, we shall bear reproach in the testimonial position. We are rejoicing, according to this book of psalms, in what God has already established testimonially. The assembly is really here. But then it involves a position of reproach. And the lily character manifests itself in fragrant response to the Lord according to @Psalm 45, and in sharing His reproach according to @Psalm 69, where it says, "The zeal of thy house hath devoured me, and the reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me". So that one would like to encourage one's own heart to be more ready for reproach, because it helps to develop the lily character with us. In the morning meeting we shall be more at home in the presence of the King, if we learn during the week to suffer with Him.
S.H. Are you thinking of the Song, "As the lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters" (@Song of Songs 2: 2)? But she is not allowed to stay in that position for long. She shares the glory of the banqueting house, and so on.
G.R.C. Very good. How could she be other than a lily among thorns in the scene where all the reproach is cast upon her Beloved? We need to be faithful to the Lord in the scene of reproach, where He is the song of the drunkards (@Psalm 69: 12). Our danger is too much respectability. It has been said, that the first elements of decline are ease and respectability. You cannot be in the
{187}
eyes of men a respectable person if you are following Christ.
W.H.K. And how could she be "Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant" (@Song of Songs 3: 6), if she did not share the sufferings?
G.R.C. Quite so.
W.McK. You have referred a good deal to Matthew's gospel. Is it to be noted that Matthew stresses eating in the Supper? I wondered if that would build up a constitution to take part in these reproaches that fell upon Christ?
G.R.C. I think it would. It would strengthen us for the will of God here would it not? It is the will of God that we should bear the reproach of Christ. But then it is greatly encouraging to have @Psalm 68 in our minds in all this -- the Lord has ascended; and all that we have spoken about, as having been secured by the God who alone doeth wondrous things, has been secured through the complete victory of Christ. He has dealt with every foe in every way, and has ascended up on high and led captivity captive, and received gifts in Man; and it is through the exercise of these gifts that the assembly has been brought to pass in a practical way here on earth. God is doing wondrous things still through the gifts from the ascended Man, so that the assembly should be here in all its features, functioning, both as the bride of Christ, and as the city of God.
C.J.H.D. I wondered if you would take us on to the matter of "the dwelling there of Jah Elohim" (verse 18), which is a very great title, and does it not link with the title Lord God in @Revelation 22: 5?
{188}
G.R.C. That is very interesting indeed. While our prepared place is in the Father's house, God's prepared place is in the assembly. Jah Elohim has a place, as we may say, worthy of Him. Is that so?
C.J.H.D. I was wondering whether Jeremiah's beautiful description of God does not fit in with what you have in mind. "Jehovah Elohim is truth; he is the living God, and the King of eternity" (@Jeremiah 10: 10).
W.J.S. Does not verse 18 show the way the sons of Korah came into things, "and even for the rebellious, for the dwelling there of Jah Elohim". Saul of Tarsus was such a one. The living God secured a man like Saul and brought him into the assembly setting.
G.R.C. I would like to make another suggestion in connection with this psalm. The word translated Lord is Adonai. 'The Adonai gives the word' (verse 11), and, 'The Adonai is among them' (verse 17). He is the One who has ascended on high, and He is operating for the dwelling of Jah Elohim. It says, 'Blessed be the Adonai' (verse 19), and in verse 22, 'the Adonai said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring them again from the depth of the sea', and then in verse 32, 'Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God; sing psalms of the Adonai'. It seems to be a title that attaches in a remarkable way to Christ. Of course, He is also Jehovah of hosts, as in @Psalm 24, but in this psalm He is referred to as Adonai, as also in @Psalm 110: 5, 'the Adonai at thy right hand'. I am wondering whether we have limited too much the idea of lordship in Christ to what He is as made Lord. My impression is that lordship in Christ, as seen in Ephesians, runs into the truth of His Person. It is true that "God has made him, this Jesus ...
{189}
both Lord and Christ" (@Acts 2: 36). But viewed from this standpoint, "Thou hast ascended on high" -- the view of lordship in Ephesians -- well, who could ascend up on high? No one less than the Adonai. Who else could be victorious like this and lead captivity captive?
B.G.H. Would verse 26 confirm that?
G.R.C. 'In the congregations bless ye God, the Adonai'. You are thinking of the word God inserted there? It is a remarkable expression. I have noticed lately that Mr. Darby links every reference to Adonai in this psalm with the Lord Jesus. ¦
W.H.K. Does the reference to ascension stand connected with what He is in His own Person?
G.R.C. That is what I am thinking. And my own impression is that lordship in Ephesians runs into the truth of His Person. "Be strong in Lord, and in the might of His strength" (@Ephesians 6: 10). It is the Adonai really, I would say, the One who ascended up on high, who ascended above all heavens.
W.J.S. What does that word convey to you?
G.R.C. I think it is a word that specially conveys lordship and rule. It is a name and title of God in the Old Testament. It is often used of God as such, but in this psalm it particularly relates to Christ. It refers to the position of authority that He has, not because He is made Lord, but because lordship is His in the right of His own Person. Adon is a word that means Lord or Master, but when applied to God, as it always is in its plural form (Adonai) in Scripture, it is a very strong expression
¦ J.N.D., *Notes and Comments*, Volume 3, page 153
{190}
emphasising the rights of God over His people. It is a kind of office or position, but which implies Deity in the One who holds it.
D.W.M. Is it rather remarkable that the Lord finally silenced the opposition in @Matthew 22 by quoting from @Psalm 110?
G.R.C. Yes. "Jehovah said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit at my right hand" (@Psalm 110: 1), and then the same Person is referred to in verse 5, 'the *Adonai* at thy right hand'.
H.W.S. In @Revelation 5: 5 you have "the lion which is of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, has overcome". Would that be a similar thought, implying His Deity?
G.R.C. It is remarkable how the deity of Christ is interwoven in Scripture with His manhood. They are put side by side repeatedly, as in the passage you quote.
S.E.W. The last presentation of Himself to the assembly in @Revelation 22: 16 is as the root of David, "the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star" and immediately it says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".
G.R.C. And I believe that is how this book of Psalms ends. The last psalm, @Psalm 72, is for Solomon, and Solomon is typical of Him who is the root and offspring of David.
W.McK. Is it your thought that the tendency has been to regard lordship in an official way, but, as you are speaking of it now, it would link our hearts up more definitely with His Person?
G.R.C. The Lord Jesus is Lord in the right of His own Person, as well as on account of what He has been made as Man. I think this title Adonai belongs to Him in the
{191}
greatness of the authority He now wields. He wields it not only as made Lord, as Peter says in @Acts 2 when he is referring to Jesus of Nazareth, whom they had crucified, but also as the One who has ascended up on high, and has led captivity captive. What authority He has! He has led captivity captive, and received gifts in Man.
R.W.S. Does not @Hebrews 1: 10 confirm that? "And, *Thou* in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens".
C.J.H.D. So according to @Psalm 45, worship is to be addressed to Him by the assembly. "He is thy Lord [Adon], and worship thou him".
G.R.C. Quite so.
H.A.H. The descent was the action of a divine Person and the ascent was the action of a divine Person? He came down from heaven. "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" (@John 6: 62).
G.R.C. All this enters into what is said here, "They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary". The psalm ends with a remarkable ascription of praise to God, ending up with "He it is that giveth strength and might unto the people. Blessed be God!" And that is what we need. He is the God who alone doeth wondrous things, and one of the things He does is to give strength and might to the people, so that we can stand in the presence of the greatness of God and ascribe to Him what is His due.
{192}
{193}
THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD (3)
G R Cowell
@Psalm 73: 1, 2, 17, 25, 26; @Psalm 77: 13, 19, 20; @Psalm 78: 65 - 72; @Psalm 84: 1 - 7; @Psalm 87: 1 - 7; @Psalm 89: 6, 8, 15, 19, 52
G.R.C. In considering the third book we should note, at the outset, that the doxology at the close is to God personally. It is not God relative to His purpose, nor to what He has done. The book ends with this simple yet moving outburst, "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore!" and it unfolds His ways with the saints in order that we might come to a profound appreciation of the blessedness of God *Himself*. Thus the doxology is addressed to God in a personal way, and the book unfolds His personal dealings with us, and His provision for us, so that we might come into the truth substantially and experimentally. The earlier books have dealt with His purpose, and the effectuation of it, but now it is a question of our being brought into the present gain of His purpose. The importance of this is apparent, because it is the will of God that those who will soon be actually in the place that He has purposed for them, should be there as having an experimental knowledge of Himself, and a profound appreciation of Himself. What we learn of God in this way will remain as substance in our souls, and enrich His praise throughout eternity.
The book, therefore, begins with the experiences of a soul, but as bearing on God's general dealings with Israel, "Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are of a pure
{194}
heart". Whatever appearances may seem, God is good and He has only good in view. And then Asaph recounts his experiences, "As for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped". But at the end of the psalm he can say, "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee". That is the great end God has in view in His dealings with us. He is going to fill heaven with people to whom He is everything. God is going to be all in all. We can therefore understand that His operations at the present time are to reach with us the end that the psalmist arrives at, "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none on earth I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever". God will fill heaven with people who have learned to use language like that.
The other psalms bring out in more detail the tenderness of God's dealings with His people, first in leading them like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. The book is not presenting Christ so much in what He effects for God, but rather as provided by God, in His tender consideration, *for us*. So He leads His people in the wilderness like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. In the next psalm He chose David, and took him from the sheepfolds and brought him to feed Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance in the land. How considerate of God to raise up such a Person as this -- first as typified in Moses and Aaron, and then in David. Then the experience with God which this book contemplates leads us greatly to value the house of God, so that His house becomes our home. It becomes the most precious place on earth to the believer, more precious than his own home. "A day in thy
{195}
courts is better than a thousand" (@Psalm 84: 10). And then His city becomes so precious to us that we speak of it, "Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God" (@Psalm 87: 3). This is not God speaking about the city exactly, but what *we* can say about it, through experience. And he ends @Psalm 87 with, "All my springs are in thee". So I think we can see in these psalms that God is bringing us into things practically and experimentally, in such a manner that when we come to the last psalm we can say, "Who in the heaven can be compared to Jehovah?" (@Psalm 89: 6). There is no one like Jehovah, this blessed God we have learned in such a personal and experimental way.
G.H.M. Does Romans give us the relations of God with men? Is that why it is so experimental?
G.R.C. Romans is a very experimental book. We arrive at sonship experimentally in chapter 8. We prove experimentally, as sons, the good and acceptable and perfect will of God in chapter 12, do we not?
S.H. In referring to God having to do with us personally, have you in mind that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are committed to us in such intimate exercises in view of arriving at what you have said?
G.R.C. I have. That brings up the consideration of this name Jehovah, does it not? "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore! Amen, and Amen".
S.H. You mean that the name Jehovah covers the three Persons that we know so intimately?
G.R.C. I would think that. The name Jehovah was the personal name of God, in so far as one could call a name personal in the Old Testament. In our day the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, implies
{196}
personal relations with the Father, and with the Son, and with the Holy Spirit. Every believer enters into these personal relations.
A.T.G. Is what you are saying about personal relations seen in Paul's word to the Philippians, "*my God* shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 4: 19)?
G.R.C. Yes. I think when Paul said "my God" his thoughts were not limited to one Person, as we speak. Earlier he says, "I have strength for all things in *him* that gives me power" (@Philippians 4: 13), without distinguishing a particular Person. There are other scriptures which are similarly undefined.
W.H.K. Mr. Darby points out that the name Jehovah is the personal name of the One who is spoken of as Elohim in @Genesis 1, which would confirm what you are saying.
G.R.C. It would. There are certain settings where the Jehovah of the Old Testament is clearly the Father of the New (see, for instance, Mr. Darby's note *g* in @2 Corinthians 6: 18). There are other settings where the Jehovah of the Old Testament is clearly the Christ of the New. Mr. Darby says elsewhere that 'it is to me as clear as the sun at noonday, that Christ was the Jehovah of the Old Testament'. ¦ In @Isaiah 6: 3 the seraphim says, "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts". The comment on that chapter in @John 12: 41 is, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory" -- that is, Christ's glory -- "and spoke of him". We can rightly say that the passage has an allusion to the Trinity in the thrice
¦ J.N.D., *Collected Writings*, Volume 9, page 298
{197}
repeated "Holy", but the Spirit of God has liberty to apply it particularly to Christ.
E.C.L. In @Exodus 3: 14, 15, God says to Moses, "I AM THAT I AM", and then, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: Jehovah, the God of your fathers … hath sent me unto you. This is my name for ever". The name Jehovah is added to the name, "I AM", which would be inclusive, would it not, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit as now made known? He is spoken of as Jehovah in His relations with Israel, but He is the I AM.
G.R.C. That is right.
B.G.H. With reference to God having personal dealings with His people, would @Psalm 81: 10 express His personal feelings and His desires for them? "I am Jehovah thy God, that brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it".
G.R.C. And verse 13, "Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, that Israel had walked in my ways!"
B.G.H. It seems to express the personal feelings of God in a very definite way. God is the Speaker in the greater part of it.
G.R.C. It is a Gittith psalm, a psalm of pressure, and the pressure is caused through the declension of the people. Yet God uses even that form of pressure, the feeling of the godly soul about the declension and stubbornness of the people, to enlarge the soul in the knowledge of Himself. The soul gets such a sense of God's yearnings for His people that he arrives at what is stated in verse 1, "Sing ye joyously unto God our strength, shout aloud unto the God of Jacob". He gets such an impression of God! There are three Gittith psalms, two in
{198}
this book, and one in the first book. In @Psalm 8 the pressure in the midst of which the babes and sucklings utter the perfected praise, is because of the adversaries. In @Psalm 81 the pressure is caused by the state of the people. In @Psalm 84 it is on account of the sufferings of the way, in maintaining divine principles (see @Psalm 84: 5, 6).
B.G.H. Would you be free to say a word as to the desires of the soul in relation to God, in view of the word in @Psalm 73: 26, "My flesh and my heart faileth: God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever". Does pressure promote desires towards God, or does it produce something substantial in the soul that already has such desires?
G.R.C. I think the two things react upon each other. God works in us by the Spirit so that we all have desires after Himself, but we would never pursue those desires to the divine end without discipline. So that, according to @Psalm 73: 14, "For all the day have I been plagued, and chastened every morning". That proves God's love to us. He is good to Israel. Israel suggests the saints viewed according to purpose, and He is good to us. He does not let us settle down like the wicked. He does not give us days of prosperity like the wicked. His ways with us are to encourage and develop those divine instincts and feelings, which the Spirit of God has wrought in our hearts towards Him, until they become completely dominant in us. So in the end he says, "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee". I think God's discipline has reached its end there.
G.H.S.P. Would it be right to say that God's personal dealings are restricted to man, that order of creation? Is
{199}
there something instructive in that, that "He does not indeed take hold of angels by the hand, but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham" (@Hebrews 2: 16)? Is it instructive that God's moral ways are with that order of being, capable of being affected feelingly by them?
G.R.C. It is very affecting to think of that. It would be confirmed, would it not, by the fact that the Son has come into manhood -- of course the Son is a title which applies only to Him in manhood, yet it is a title which brings home to us the greatness of the Person who came. And so it says in @Hebrews 5: 8, "Though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered". Is it not a remarkable thing that this can be said of Him?
G.H.S.P. I am sure it is. It is very affecting and throws, perhaps, fresh light on all God's ways with us. These have the definite end in view that He should be served in a feeling way by persons who have been brought to know Him through His moral dealings with them.
G.R.C. And so it is remarkable that the Lord Jesus does not enter into the great offices, of which we were speaking yesterday, until He has passed through things experimentally. He enters upon His great official positions, according to the purpose of God, as having Himself in manhood experienced all that God could be to a perfect Man. He learned all that obedience meant; an obedience which, in His case, meant *infinitely* more in suffering than that required of any other. That *He* should have been through such experiences is a remarkable thing. And I think that is what it means when it says, "having been perfected" (@Hebrews 5: 9). He is fully qualified for the offices He now holds in glorious manhood because He has been
{200}
through with God, every experience a perfect Man could go through in the scene of testing, and has effected the work of atonement.
W.McK. Philippians has been referred to as the epistle which gives us normal christian experience, and the Spirit indites chapter 2 in relation to the Lord Jesus?
G.R.C. You are thinking of the downward steps?
W.McK. Yes, and then the exaltation as a result.
G.R.C. It says in @Philippians 2: 8 that He became "obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross", and @Hebrews 5: 7 shows how He felt it -- "with strong crying and tears" -- a very real matter. Many of our disciplinary experiences are because of what we are by nature, whereas He was ever "sin apart". Yet nothing we shall ever go through could in any way compare with the depths of suffering that were His.
W.J.S. What had you in mind in reading verse 17? Is that the resource of the soul as going this way?
G.R.C. Yes, I thought so. However inexplicable the ways of God may seem, viewed in themselves; when we go into the sanctuaries of God, we see the reason for them. We do not understand the details of His ways, for it says in @Psalm 77: 19, "Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths are in the great waters; and thy footsteps are not known". There is much in the ways of God which we cannot, and shall not, understand down here. "How unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!" (@Romans 11: 33). But do you not think that, although we cannot explain them, in going into the sanctuaries of God we see the reason for them and can be entirely restful in God.
{201}
A.A.B. In @Hebrews 12: 11 the peaceful fruit of righteousness is assured to those who are exercised by the Father's discipline. Would you link the thought of being exercised with going into the sanctuaries of God?
G.R.C. I am sure that is true. It shows the need for exercise in passing through discipline, that we should be sufficiently exercised to go into the sanctuaries of God.
B.G.H. What is the distinction between the sanctuaries of God and the sanctuary?
G.R.C. I think the sanctuaries of God refer to the court and the holy place, as well as the holiest. The key to understanding why God orders things, which, in themselves we cannot understand, lies in the whole matter covered by the words "sanctuaries of God".
A.B. Does it suggest they are very near? Sanctuaries is in the plural. Is it that they are available for us and do we touch something of the character of it as among the saints? What a relief to be among His people, where God is. How establishing it is.
G.R.C. So as we come into the court, the altar faces us, the altar of burnt-offering. That is a key to much. All that God has established for His pleasure eternally rests upon the sufferings of Christ, and the solution of all moral issues. Then there is the laver. That also instructs us. Whether the priest approached the altar, or whether he went into the tent, he had to go by way of the laver. And then, as we move into the holy place, we learn that "we, being many, are one loaf, one body" (@1 Corinthians 10: 17), because the twelve loaves of shewbread are now replaced by one loaf, because the saints of this dispensation are reconciled to God in one body. I am referring, of course, to
{202}
the type, and not to the actual bread on the table at the Lord's supper. Much of God's discipline is to help us to fit into our place in the body. So that in the sanctuaries of God one thing after another is educative. As I look at the altar of burnt-offering, I can understand God dealing with me in the light of what Christ suffered to establish all for God. When I look at the laver, I can understand God dealing with me, in order that I should be ready to accept purification. And, as in the holy place, I can understand God dealing with me, because if He did not deal with me I should never fit into that one loaf, one body, I would never be prepared to let my will go. Then there is the light. God must deal with us, if the light of the lamps is to shine unhinderedly. Finally, in the Holiest of all, we see, in all its splendour, the glory -- the One who sits between the cherubim, and the glory of the Man in whose heart the whole will of God is enshrined. All is educative and we understand that God *must* deal with us; and so we become amenable to His discipline.
W.H.K. Would you say why many of these psalms are of Asaph?
G.R.C. These psalms indicate that Asaph was remarkably intelligent as to the ways of God, and if there is a link between him and the Asaph of @1 Chronicles 16: 7, would it not show what a bearing this has on the service of song? Those equipped to take up David's psalm, that is, typically, to voice the very praises of the Lord Himself in the assembly, were headed by Asaph.
G.H.S.P. Asaph's name, meaning gatherer, too, would show that he always had in mind what might be gathered up to enrich the service in all these ways?
{203}
G.R.C. That is very helpful, because these psalms are certainly a gathering up of that which would enrich the service in real substance. The earlier books give us light, but this book gives us substance.
H.W. So that this book would be analogous to Leviticus, where the service of God is taken up, drawing near to Him with offerings?
G.R.C. Quite so. It would give the substance for the offerings. Bringing offerings suggests what is substantial in the knowledge of God and of Christ, what has really been wrought out in the soul, because the offerer is identified with the offering. There can be no true offerings except in the measure in which we have had experience with God.
C.J.H.D. And do we have that experience with God in christianity in a more affectionately intimate way, than was possible in the time of the Old Testament? I was thinking of the title that God takes according to @Hebrews 12 in regard of discipline, as *the Father* of spirits. When Moses is under discipline himself, and forbidden to go into the land, he says, "Let Jehovah, *the God* of the spirits of all flesh" (@Numbers 27: 16). Would you say that the expression, Father of spirits, covers a very great deal in regard of the affectionate side of sonship in our discipline, as compared with men like Moses and Asaph?
G.R.C. I am glad you have referred to that, because while the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, on the one hand, implies equality of Persons, and, therefore, would lead our hearts out in worship to the Trinity; yet from another standpoint it gives the order of the economy. In this order the Father is dominant, the Son
{204}
and the Holy Spirit having taken positions relative to Him. And I think in the personal relations of which we are speaking, we have to keep that in mind. The doxology, "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore!" would include, for us, the full thought of the Trinity. Nevertheless, in connection with God's disciplinary ways the Father has a peculiar and distinctive place. According to @Hebrews 12: 9, He is the Father of spirits. In @Psalm 77: 20 it says, "Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron". It is like a father to take his children by the hand, when they are treading an unknown path. "Thy paths are in the great waters; and thy footsteps are not known" (verse 19). *We* do not know how to take the next step, but God comes in in a fatherly way and leads us by the hand. True, He does it by way of the Son, but the Father's affections are in it.
C.J.H.D. Yet discipline is not to be connected exclusively with the Father, for @1 Corinthians 11: 32 says that in certain circumstances we are disciplined of the *Lord*. While, in a primary way, in regard of our circumstances, the Father has to do with us, yet it says it is *God* who conducts Himself towards us as towards sons, does it not?
G.R.C. Quite so. And do you not think that the discipline of the Lord is more judicial? We are disciplined of the Lord that we might not be condemned with the world. The *Lord* comes in, He is jealous, and if we go on in a worldly way, He will deal with us. But is not the Father's discipline apart from that question altogether? The Father has our true soul welfare in view and provides all that a Father could provide for us, both in necessary chastening and testing, and also in the comfort and support
{205}
needed in going through it. He provides Christ, the true "Moses and Aaron", to take us by the hand, leading us in the most tender way, so that we might get the gain of the discipline.
E.S. Does @John 15: 1, confirm that, "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. As to every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it away"?
G.R.C. That is a different setting, but you have in mind that the purging is in order that the branch bearing fruit may bear *more* fruit? It is not judicial.
J.D. Would the partaking of His holiness be in mind? The beginning of @Psalm 73 speaks of the pure in heart, and in @Matthew 5: 8 the Lord says, "Blessed the pure in heart, for *they* shall see God".
G.R.C. That is the vital point. The discipline is needed to purify our hearts, so that nothing might hinder us seeing God. Later, in @Hebrews 12: 14, it refers to "holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord".
A.B. Would leading like a flock have in mind the saints being led in God's way, He being the guide, in a combination of tenderness and authority?
G.R.C. You are thinking of Moses and Aaron? Very good, and it suggests, does it not, that we do not know one footstep ahead. He is leading us in God's way, whose footsteps are not known, so that, without the hand of Moses and Aaron, we could not get along at all. It is a wonderful thing to be in a path of dependence, and yet a path where we are the objects of such tender care. And you will notice that we are not isolated in it. He leads His people like a flock. God has individual dealings with each one, but yet we are moving together.
{206}
E.C.L. Does the thought of confidence, which is to be restored from man to God, come into this thought of the Father's dealings? The Lord's ministry, from @John 13 onwards, is in order that the disciples might be at home in the Father's presence, having full confidence in Him, in order that they might move forward into the most precious thoughts of God.
G.R.C. The leading in @Psalm 77, which promotes confidence, would prepare us for the leading in @Psalm 78, which stands related to the greatest thoughts of God. It is a real test to be in a path where we do not know what the next step is to be, but where we are content, because such a glorious Person holds our hand, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. He is viewed in these psalms not as the Man of God's purpose, as in the first book, but as the One God has provided *for us*. He is leading His people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. And as we develop in the confidence which comes from that kind of leading, in the path of responsibility in the wilderness, we shall be amenable to the leading that is suggested in David. "He chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: From following the suckling-ewes, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands". It is skilfulness here, because he is leading them in relation to the service of God, in relation to His sanctuary like the heights, spoken of in verse 69.
B.G.H. Would you say the choosing of the tribe of Judah would imply the praises of God being secured?
{207}
G.R.C. I think so. We have to learn that the assembly is not simply a family setting. "He rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim" -- that is the family setting -- "But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved". This is the assembly in its dignity -- "He built his sanctuary like the heights", and only the true David can guide us skilfully in this setting.
A.A.B. As typified in Moses and Aaron, the Lord would be endeared to us as leading us out, and in David, as leading and bringing us in?
G.R.C. Quite so.
M.H.T. This follows the darkest moment, when God delivered His strength into captivity and His glory into the enemy's hand. 'Where sin o'er all seemed to prevail, Redemption's glory shed' (`235:4).
G.R.C. God brings in the best, at the very worst time. That is what we are proving in our own day.
M.H.T. And is it of interest that the third book *contemplates* a time of great suffering for the remnant in a future day, when the heathen will come into the inheritance of God, and God's people will be dispossessed. But it is in those circumstances of pressure that the service of song, to which you have referred, will be enriched. Ought that to be a great encouragement to us who form part of the assembly at the present time?
G.R.C. It should, indeed. All the circumstances are ordered of God to bring just the amount of pressure needed. Nothing more than is necessary is ever allowed by God. So that even in that darkest day for Israel, which lies in the future, there will be just the needed pressure to bring about the end God has in view, that Jehovah should be
{208}
everything to them. And God is working to the same end with us, for He will have us go into heaven as a people to whom He is everything.
G.H.S.P. Do you think we might link the doxology in Jude with this book? I am thinking of the dark days which that epistle depicts, the days of apostasy, and the way it finishes with, "But to him that is able to keep you without stumbling" (verse 24). Is there a veiled reference in that to being led by the hand? And then, "to set you with exultation blameless before his glory, to the only God our Saviour", and so on. Does it indicate that God secures full response in the very darkest day?
G.R.C. That doxology would seem to link up these two psalms. To keep us from stumbling might be like the hand of Moses and Aaron in the difficult path of the wilderness. Then to present us blameless before His glory might link with the sanctuary at the end of @Psalm 78.
C.J.H.D. Is there not comfort in the fact that our time of recovery has involved God doing things from *behind* the enemy, and not by means of a frontal attack? "He smote his adversaries in the hinder part". Does that not indicate that we have to accept the reproach of the smallness and meanness of things apparently outwardly, in the face of great religious movements around us?
G.R.C. Very good. So that the facade of christendom remains, but God has smitten them in the hinder part.
C.J.H.D. Exactly; the reproach is really behind them where they least expect it. But we must accept the public reproach. We shall never be anything publicly, ecclesiastically, in the eyes of the world.
{209}
B.G.H. Would you say a word as to the name Jehovah of hosts occurring in @Psalm 84?
G.R.C. I think in this psalm it is not so much to stress what is military, but rather to stress that, as we should say, He has filled His house with sons. It is the attractiveness of His house. Not only is Jehovah Himself attractive to the soul, but His house and all that surrounds Him becomes exceedingly attractive also. "My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for *the courts of Jehovah*; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God". Thus God's house becomes the home of the soul. "Yea, the sparrow hath found a house". Some of us are looking for a house to live in down here, but it is better to find this house.
S.E.W. Is not the latter part of verse 8 touching, "Hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah"?
G.R.C. Jacob was the one who first got light as to the house of God, and it was not at all attractive to him at first. But then the word comes, "Go up to Bethel, and dwell there" (@Genesis 35: 1). He was to find his home there. And I think the soul really finds its home in the house of God in @Psalm 84.
S.E.W. And God brought it to pass with Jacob.
G.R.C. He did. And so in this verse, "The sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself". I wonder whether we have found this in the house of God? It may be we are not prepared to accept the place of a sparrow. It links on with what Mr. D. has just been saying, the place of reproach. The Lord says, according to @Psalm 102: 6, 7, that He was as a "pelican of the wilderness ... like a sparrow alone upon the housetop".
{210}
J.C.T. Is it interesting that in Zechariah the name Jehovah of hosts is used a good many times? While it says, "Who hath despised the day of small things?" (@Zechariah 4: 10), it speaks of the greatness of what God is setting up.
G.R.C. Very good. It is well in a day of small things to remember that He is Jehovah of hosts. Things outwardly may seem small, but God will never be short of numbers; and as we become acquainted with His house, and learn to dwell there in our spirits, *we* are not short of numbers.
G.W.B. If the Spirit says "many sons" you may be sure there *are* many.
G.R.C. So that the title Jehovah of hosts, in this setting, would be linked with the many sons. The psalmist represents a person in whom the affections of sonship are formed in such a manner, that God's house is his home. He is nothing but a sparrow here -- an object of reproach, but he has found a house, the house of God. He is a swallow, too, always a stranger here, a bird of passage, but the swallow has found "a nest for herself, where she layeth her young, thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts" (@Psalm 84: 3).
E.C.L. Why is altars in the plural? In the court there was one altar.
G.R.C. I think the soul is brought to appreciate both altars so you have the expression, "Thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God". We ought to have an appreciation of both of the altars, and to use them both. I believe one links especially with "my King" and the other with "my God".
D.W.M. Would Samuel have learned a lot in his young days as being at home in the temple, in a time of
{211}
great weakness publicly? He develops afterwards as a leader of the people of God.
G.R.C. That is very good, because it shows that we cannot be too young to find our home in God's house.
W.McK. The younger son in @Luke 15 shows how readily that place is found. The reproach is not removed in the eyes of the elder son. He is still in reproach, but he is tasting what is inside in the house of God.
G.R.C. So that, from the divine side, our home is there from the outset, is it not? "Bring out the best robe and clothe him in it" (@Luke 15: 22). But the experiences of this book of Psalms are to make it truly home to us from our side. I do not believe it will become that, unless we accept the place of the sparrow and the swallow in this world.
E.C.L. "They will be constantly praising thee". Is that going on continually, and not only when the saints are together? It is an attitude of soul?
G.R.C. It shows how much this matter bears on our subject, the praises of God, because this kind of person will be *constantly* praising God.
E.M.W. Would you say a little more regarding your remark as to the two altars? You made a particular connection.
G.R.C. The altar of burnt-offering is a place of immense provision. "We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle" (@Hebrews 13: 10). We find abundance of food there. Then there is the privilege of prayer and supplication at both altars. I think at the altar of burnt-offering the character of prayer would be more in keeping with "my King", that is, with God as King of the ages, the blessed and only Ruler. Whereas at the golden
{212}
altar their character would be in keeping with "my God". Solomon prayed in the court. He prayed in the presence of the brazen altar.
S.H. Does the psalmist indicate the two altars where he refers to his prayer being set forth before God as incense, and the lifting up of his hands as the evening oblation? (@Psalm 141: 2).
G.R.C. The golden altar was the incense altar and connects with the immediate presence of God, and what is fragrant to Him; particularly, of course, in the Person of Christ. In @Revelation 5: 8 the incenses, however, are said to be the prayers of the saints. But the altar of burnt-offering is connected with the greatness and majesty of God. That is where, typically, He was glorified, according to all that He is in His nature and attributes. All that is due to Him as the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, was maintained at the altar of burnt-offering, viewed in its typical significance.
A.B. Would these things give character to our meetings for prayer?
G.R.C. I think so. The kind of prayer that links with the brazen altar is the prayer of @1 Timothy 2. That is linked with the King of the ages (@1 Timothy 1: 17). Paul says, "I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men; for kings and all that are in dignity". Solomon's outlook was outward at the altar of burnt-offering. But the altar of incense is inside and there you are thinking of God and His purpose, which centres in Christ.
C.J.H.D. Very fine. And are not our young people to be held in relation to all of this? We may marvel that the
{213}
Spirit of God should speak of the swallow laying her young in such a position. Is that not how they are to be held, that we are to indicate to them that we are birds of passage, that our destiny is a heavenly one, that we shall be gone overnight, as it were, and they are brought up in that atmosphere.
G.R.C. That is excellent. This certainly shows where we need to lay our young. We need to lay our young at God's altars. They are safe there. And what is so encouraging is that the nearer you bring young children to the altars nowadays, the happier they seem to be.
G.W.B. Has the brazen altar in mind the place of acceptance that has been secured for man in Christ.
G.R.C. It has. That truth enters into our prayers for men.
G.W.B. The golden altar relates to what is for God Himself from the priestly company?
G.R.C. I think so. Following this we get the kind of exercises that mark those who find their home in God's house. They are the persons of whom it says, "in whose heart are the highways". If we value the house of God we shall always have the highways in our hearts, the highways of divine principles, and, that being so, we shall find the valley of Baca. The maintenance of divine principles means that we are never out of the valley of weeping, but we make it a well-spring.
G.H.S.P. Is that why @Genesis 35, where Jacob has the word, "Go up to Bethel, and dwell there", is a chapter of almost unparalleled suffering and sorrow in the household setting? It includes the death of Rachel; but Jacob rises above it in the naming of his son, son of the right hand.
{214}
G.R.C. In that chapter the highways were truly in his heart.
In @Psalm 87 we move on to the appreciation of the city, but still on the experimental line. And so the word is, "Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God". It is a great thing when the saints can speak glorious things about the assembly, as the city of God. As we were saying yesterday, the city is an inclusive thought. It includes the habitation -- "the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb" (@Revelation 21: 22). His servants serve Him, so that priestly service proceeds in it, and the tree of life is there. All that is most precious to God is enclosed in the city. It is indeed a glorious vessel, the city of God. We ought to appreciate the assembly more and more. What a glorious vessel it is! "Glorious things are spoken of thee". Who is speaking? Let us all be speaking.
B.G.H. "All my springs are in thee".
G.R.C. Quite so. Just as in @Psalm 84 his home is in the house of God, so here all his springs are in the assembly, as the city. It is what the singers and the dancers say, showing how much it bears on the service of God; and if we answer to this, and all our springs are truly in the city of God, it will be evident that we were born there. "Of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her". How does it become evident that we were born there, that she is our mother city? It is because we are among the singers and the dancers who say, "All my springs are in thee".
N.F.A. Does the thought of the city have some place in regard of our service Godward? You mentioned it
{215}
yesterday in relation to praises, and you mentioned it again now.
G.R.C. According to @Psalm 48 it is the place where God is praised. "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the hill of his holiness". I think it is the assembly viewed as the great vessel of praise. It encloses everything that is most precious to God. On the other hand, of course, the city is the vessel of light, for the diffusion of light, the light of God. What do you say as to that?
N.F.A. I was wondering whether it should be referred to in the service of God?
G.R.C. I think it should, in the light of this psalm. "Glorious things are spoken of thee". I think God would appreciate it if we could speak some glorious things about His city, because it is very precious to Him.
J.L.W. @Revelation 21 and 22 are full of those glorious things.
G.R.C. They are. What a development there is in those chapters of the glorious things of the city.
D.W.M. Is that a justification of `221:1 'Jerusalem, the holy, Whose builder is her God'?
G.R.C. I think there is full justification for that hymn. This psalm confirms it.
W.McK. Is it in your mind that, along with the increased apprehension that the saints have of God, as He has been now presented to us in the ministry, there should also be an increased apprehension of the city of God as supplying an answer to all that has come out?
G.R.C. Yes. It is the only vessel in which the great King finds an adequate answer in praise. Everything about
{216}
the city is worthy of the great King -- all its appointments, as one might say.
J.W.G. Mr. Taylor has referred to the city as being solid, substantial. ¦
G.R.C. And that shows the importance of our coming into things substantially in our souls, according to this book of psalms. And so, in the final verses, we read, it really goes back in principle to what we began with, "Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee" (@Psalm 73: 25). But it is not simply personal now, it is a challenge to the universe. "Who in the heaven can be compared to Jehovah? who among the sons of the mighty shall be likened to Jehovah? … Jehovah, God of hosts, who is like unto thee, the strong Jah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee" (@Psalm 89: 6 - 8). What a wonderful thing to arrive at this real appreciation of God Himself. It would lead us on to the doxology, "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore! Amen, and Amen".
J.C.T. We arrive at this by way of the assembly?
G.R.C. Yes, by way of the house, and the city, both of which are the assembly.

THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD (4)
G R Cowell
@Psalm 90: 1, 2, 13 - 17; @Psalm 91: 1, 2; @Psalm 96: 7 - 10; @Psalm 102: 1 - 3, 10, 23 - 28; @Psalm 103: 1 - 5; @Psalm 104: 1, 2; @Psalm 105: 1 - 3; @Psalm 106: 1 - 5, 47, 48
G.R.C. The fourth book, I think, has in view days of recovery. In the exercises that mark days of recovery we learn God's faithfulness and unchangeableness. Whatever has happened amongst His people in the sphere of responsibility, He has never changed. So that an appreciation of God is wrought out in the souls of the saints in days of recovery, that has its own special features. The book furnishes guidance for our exercises in such days. First of all, @Psalm 90 shows that we have to go back to first principles; it is the prayer of Moses, the man of God. Since we are in the Psalms, it does not give his doctrine. But in going back to his doctrine, as typical of apostolic doctrine in our day, it is a great thing, also, to go back to his prayer and thus to his own view of God, "Lord, *thou* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God". This surely is the keynote to recovery. Then at the end of the psalm there is the prayer, "Return, Jehovah;" the covenant name, the name of relationship being used. That would be the earnest desire in days of recovery. We would return to God, but our prayer would be that He would return to us.
{218}
The next point of instruction for days of recovery is that we look on to the Lord's coming. We go back to first principles, on the one hand, and look on to the Lord's coming on the other. And so the psalms that follow anticipate the Lord's coming, and we need to do so in order to be maintained in buoyancy in days when, in spite of spiritual recovery, things can never return to their pristine beauty publicly. Not until the Lord comes will the public position be remedied. @Psalm 93, @Psalm 97 and @Psalm 99 begin, "Jehovah reigneth", and @Psalm 96 gives the language of souls that are in the hope, and present anticipation of the Lord's coming. "Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, give unto Jehovah glory and strength ... Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth!" We, in our spirits, anticipate His coming, and testimony is rendered from that standpoint.
H.W. Is there confirmation as to God's attitude in days of recovery, in the post-captivity prophets, particularly Zechariah. "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy ... I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it" (@Zechariah 1: 14 - 16).
G.R.C. Such prophetic testimony would encourage us to voice this prayer, "Return, Jehovah". While we look on to the Lord's actual coming, we count on Him coming to us at the present time. We call upon Him to return, counting on His faithfulness to come amongst His people now. Scriptures such as @John 14: 18, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", and @Matthew 18: 20, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name,
{219}
there am I in the midst of them", are peculiarly encouraging in the last days.
I suggested reading @Psalm 102, because it refers to the sufferings of Christ as enduring God's indignation and wrath on account of the unfaithfulness of the people, whose representative He had become, in wondrous grace. It is that character of His sufferings which would specially affect us as we look back on the unfaithfulness of God's people. And in connection with these sufferings, which culminated in His being cut off in the midst of His days, the unchangeableness of His Person is brought out, "But thou art the Same" (verse 27) -- a title of Deity most comforting in days of recovery. As the hymn says, "Thou art the Same", our one, unchanging God (`264:1). The appreciation of God as the Same, and of the Lord Jesus, being God, as the Same, leads on to the praises of the last psalms of the book. We have the praise of God in connection with His healing power in @Psalm 103; creation in @Psalm 104; His ways of grace in @Psalm 105; and His ways in government with His people in @Psalm 106. @Psalm 105 and 106 are reviews which belong to days of recovery -- reviews of God's ways in grace, on the one hand, and His ways in government on the other. They end with this prayer, "Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise" (@Psalm 106: 47). The one desire of the soul is that God would save His people, and gather them from among the nations; and for what purpose? To give thanks unto His holy name and *to triumph in His praise*! Then follows the doxology, "Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And let all
{220}
the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!" Nothing less is in mind than that *all* the people should be in it. All will be in it when the Lord comes, but meantime, however few may be actually available, we have nothing less than this in our minds and prayers, "Let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!"
S.H. Is much of what you have said gathered up in a concise way by the people as recovered in @Nehemiah 9: 5, 6. "Stand up, bless Jehovah your God from eternity to eternity. And let men bless the name of thy glory, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. Thou art the Same, thou alone, Jehovah"? And then you have references to creation, quickening and other things which involve the work of God in us.
G.R.C. That is very confirming. It shows how their thoughts were running in line with the fourth book of psalms.
S.E.W. Is it interesting, in @Nehemiah 9: 7, that it goes on to refer to Abraham, "Thou art the Same, Jehovah Elohim, who didst choose Abram and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees"? You were referring to first principles.
G.R.C. That helps us, because the name God in @Psalm 90: 2 (El), is first used in connection with Abraham. The name Lord in @Psalm 90: 1 is Adonai. Adonai is a divine title, suggesting the lordship and authority that is inherent in Deity. In many places (e.g. @Psalm 68: 17, 18; @Psalm 110: 5) it refers to the Lord Jesus; but, of course, sovereign rights and authority belong also to the Father, and the Spirit. In this psalm the title is applied to God, as such; and its suitability is evident. For when we are thinking of our
{221}
transgressions and failure we rightly think of the authority of the God, whose rights we have flouted and whose commandments we have disobeyed. Yet we turn to Him because, although we have forfeited every claim by our practical conduct, we know that Adonai has rights in mercy, as well as in authority, and therefore it is to Him that we cling. And so the prayer is, 'Adonai, *thou* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God'. Now the word "God" is 'El', and it is first used in connection with Abraham. It means 'the Mighty;' God viewed as the mighty, stable, eternal God: 'from eternity to eternity thou art El'. In days of recovery Israel needed to go back, not only to Moses, but to Abraham, the one to whom the promises were made by the mighty God. In our case we need to go back to God's purpose and grace given us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time.
E.M.W. Is it interesting that Abraham is the first to use that title 'Adonai'? In @Genesis 15: 2 we read, "And Abram said, Lord [Adonai] Jehovah, what wilt thou give me? seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus".
G.R.C. That is very interesting. God uses the name 'El' and Abraham uses the title 'Adonai'.
H.W.E. Does it also refer to God as the source of all blessing?
G.R.C. The name 'Adonai' conveys lordship and authority, whereas Jehovah is the One who is faithful to all His commitments, the One who is, who was, and who is to come. Abraham uses both names. 'Adonai' is important
{222}
there, because it says he believed Jehovah, and He reckoned it to him as righteousness. It was the obedience of faith. Disobedience is a denial of the rights and authority of God.
W.C.P. Is it interesting that almost every name of God used in the Old Testament appears in the Psalms? There are sixteen or seventeen different names, many of them in this fourth book.
G.R.C. I think an understanding of them would greatly enlarge our apprehension of God in His greatness, and thus promote our worship.
W.C.P. Are not the exercises connected with days of recovery enriching the saints universally in their appreciation of God, in every way in which He is presented to us in Scripture?
G.R.C. I think so; and the apprehension of the meaning of these names in no wise belittles the name now declared; the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the greatest Name of all. The more we enter into the fulness attaching to that Name, in which God Himself has come out to us, in order to be known to us in such personal relationships, the more we shall value the names in the Old Testament, each of which is expressive of some attribute of Deity, some feature of greatness proper to Him as God.
J.L.W. Does the first verse of @Psalm 103 help in that connection? "Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name". Would "his holy name" include these manifold glories?
G.R.C. "Bless *Jehovah*" would show that in the closing psalms of the book there is full restoration to the
{223}
sense of relationship, Jehovah being the name of relationship with Israel. Similarly, we are coming into the full blessedness of God's name of relationship in our day. Its meaning is being unfolded more and more to us, the meaning of the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and the blessedness of the economy of love and grace connected with it. I think you have in mind that as restored to the sense of relationship, our affections would embrace every feature of divine glory previously disclosed, so that His name becomes a great inclusive thought?
J.L.W. Yes, "All that is within me" it says. And our affections are fully engaged.
G.R.C. So that, as knowing God in the name of relationship, and as in the joy of our place in the divine economy of love, we can bless His holy name in every feature of that name, which has been disclosed from the beginning of time.
G.H.S.P. Is it interesting that, during the ministry within the knowledge of most of us, the outstanding features have been the truth as to the Person of the Son, and then the truth as to the Person of the Spirit, and then the truth as to God Himself, in these final days of recovery?
G.R.C. That seems to be the way the Spirit of God has been leading in our time. Prior to that the truth as to the Person of the Father had been stressed, I believe.
A.A.G. Would the way in which we know God now, have particular reference to His nature, whereas the varied names in the Old Testament relate more to the attributes of Deity?
{224}
G.R.C. I think that is right. In the Person of the Son there is now the full display of His nature, as well as His character or moral attributes. His moral attributes were not in full display in the Old Testament, that is, His mercy, kindness, grace and compassion; but now they are in *full* display. The Son is the effulgence of His glory, and the expression of His substance. But then in the Old Testament there are names which express the attributes of greatness, strength, stability, majesty and splendour that attach to God. The Spirit of God expects us to carry all those forward, because they all attach to the God who has come out to us in such an intimate, and, we may say, loving way, according to His nature.
A.A.G. So that the knowledge of God in His nature would make these varied attributes of greatness, majesty, stability, and so on, extremely attractive, would it not?
G.R.C. It would.
W.H.K. "And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us". Would that not include all that has shone out of God? All is to be reflected in the saints.
G.R.C. That is very beautiful.
A.A.B. Would the way John writes the book of Revelation, after the departure from Paul, and his allusion to the Lord's coming in the first chapter, and to the Spirit and the bride saying "Come" in the last, link with the thought of "Return, Jehovah"?
G.R.C. I think the first verse of @Psalm 90 bears on John's ministry, "*thou* hast been *our* dwelling-place". There is the thought of *His* dwelling-place among His people, and in that connection there has been unfaithfulness, but it does not alter the fact that He is *our*
{225}
dwelling-place. He has never changed, and I believe John particularly brings out the unchangeableness of the God who has been so fully declared. So that John's ministry is for days of recovery.
A.A.B. "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him" (@1 John 4: 16).
G.R.C. Quite so. So that while God is *our* dwelling place, our desire is to provide, at the close of the dispensation, conditions down here suited to *His* dwelling-place. As we return to Him, and prove the resource we have in Him, we find strength to take up the position of responsibility and to say, "Return, Jehovah ... Satisfy us early with thy loving-kindness; that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days". And then, "Let thy work appear unto thy servants". We yearn to see something substantial down here in the way of recovery, so that while the church in responsibility can never be recovered, yet we desire that features proper to the assembly, which is the house of God, and the city of God, might come into evidence.
S.H. Would you say that Moses¬ song in @Deuteronomy 32, much of which is judicial, and where this very word is used as to Jehovah repenting in favour of His servants, shows how God will come in in regard to His people? It says, "Shout for joy, ye nations, with his people, For he avengeth the blood of his servants, And rendereth vengeance to his enemies, And maketh atonement for his land, for his people" (verse 43).
G.R.C. Quite so. So @Psalm 90 ends, "let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us" -- a wonderful thought, that there should be seen in the saints an answer to the revelation of God; and then His work appearing and the
{226}
work of *our* hands established. There is something concrete thus in the way of recovery.
The next psalm more definitely goes back to Abraham, the one to whom the immutable promises of God were made. "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty". 'El Elyon', the Most High God, and 'El Shaddai', the Almighty God, were titles disclosed to Abraham, and I believe they are of great encouragement in a day of recovery. "Most High" is used in Daniel in connection with the political scene. God ordered the whole political scene in the Babylonish and Persian empires, in view of what was outwardly but a small remnant, but was marked vitally by all the features of the original. And that is what God has done in these last days. He has ordered, and is ordering, political matters, with a view to an expression of features proper to the whole assembly, though seen, it may be, in but a few. And then there is the shadow of the Almighty. What a comfort that is in days of recovery -- what cannot God do?
J.D. Does Paul have this in mind in @Acts 20: 32, "I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace", and then in Timothy, speaking to him as the man of God, he says, "God who preserves all things in life" (@1 Timothy 6: 13).
G.R.C. The man of God particularly comes into view in days of recovery; and life is also a great feature. The test is not simply outward order, but life.
W.H.K. Paul refers to "the blessed and only Ruler … the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship" (@1 Timothy 6: 15). That would link with the "Most High"
{227}
G.R.C. I would think so. As in the secret place of the Most High, we can be restful in political matters, and the shadow of the Almighty keeps us restful in spiritual matters, because what cannot God do in a spiritual way? The title 'Almighty' is introduced in connection with quickening the dead.
H.W.S. @Luke 2 refers to the arrangement of the political sphere, and in @Luke 1: 32 it says, "*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest".
G.R.C. It is very interesting that Luke presents the Lord Jesus as the 'Son of the Most High' (@Luke 1: 32 footnote *b*). The Most High is supreme in every sphere, and the beginning of Luke stresses that.
A.T.G. @Luke 6: 35 says, "Ye shall be sons of the Highest". It is the same word, is it not?
G.R.C. Yes. It is those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and under the shadow of the Almighty, who can manifest the character of "sons of the Highest". They are maintained in peace and moral elevation whatever is going on around. They are in spirit above the scene of political agitation, they know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men; and, on the other hand, they are not unduly disturbed by, although they feel keenly, what is going on in the profession, because they know the Almighty. They trust in Him to let His work appear to His servants, and to bring about results, even in days of greatest weakness, on the principle of life out of death.
P.S.L. Is the secret place illustrated by the hill country in @Luke 1?
G.R.C. The hill country was a place of elevation, above the level of things here. It is a question of "Let *thy*
{228}
work appear unto thy servants". God is working in spite of everything, and by whatever means He chooses. But then there is *our* work, the work of *our* hands, and we are to have *holy* hands. "Establish thou it". As to all the works that are done in Christ's name, the question is, are they of such a character that God can establish them?
R.H.S. Does @2 Corinthians 6: 16 - 18 help as to the Almighty? It brings in the thought of dwelling, "I will dwell among them", and then the matter of separation.
G.R.C. And is not separation especially vital in days of recovery?
R.H.S. I thought so.
G.R.C. In that connection God says, "I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".
R.H. Daniel says, "Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his. And it is he that changeth times and seasons" (@Daniel 2: 20, 21).
G.R.C. That links with the Most High, a title which occurs much in Daniel -- "the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men" (@Daniel 4: 17). Everything is according to His will, and in view of His testimony that is the thing to see. It is very encouraging that God enters in a peculiar way into the political scene in days of recovery, with a view to what is outwardly so weak being preserved and protected and going forward, in order that the dispensation should finish as it began, not in numbers, but in features. Thus, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" (@Revelation 22: 17).
{229}
C.J.H.D. I am wondering whether there is not great confirmation in the last book of the Old Testament, which accords so well with Luke. There is the statement of such majesty, "I am a great King … and my name is terrible among the nations" (@Malachi 1: 14). Then, in view of our returning and service, it says, "ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not" (@Malachi 3: 18). Then there is the last reference to Moses, so beautiful in regard of the second giving of the law in grace at Horeb. I was wondering whether @Psalm 90 was not written on Horeb, not Sinai.
G.R.C. Malachi is most interesting. "From the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation" (@Malachi 1: 11), and in principle God has brought that about. It looks on to the millennium, but in principle God has brought it about in these last days.
C.J.H.D. And then the unchangeableness of God: "I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed" (@Malachi 3: 6).
G.H.S.P. The reference to the latter glory of this house being greater than the former (@Haggai 2: 9), would confirm, do you think, what you said at the beginning about something special entering into the days of recovery? Do you think our enjoyment of that is dependent upon our maintaining the principles of separation?
G.R.C. I do, because what is not based upon holiness and separation to God will not stand. While souls are saved in God's sovereignty, and we are thankful for that,
{230}
yet it is a question of "the work of our hands, establish thou it". The test of a thing is how far God establishes it in its results. The popular revivals of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have left no permanent results in testimony according to God. Souls have been saved and we thank God for that, and some may have been brought into the path of separation, but from the movements themselves there has been nothing that God could establish. We need to understand that. "Let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us; and ... the work of our hands, establish thou it". Establishment comes not by using Egyptian methods, but by the beauty of Jehovah our God being upon us. It is a great thing to be on lines in which God will establish the work of our hands.
H.W. That all emphasises, does it not, the importance of John's ministry, not setting up anything outward, but bringing in living and holy conditions. The Lord says in His prayer, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name" (@John 17: 11).
G.R.C. Very good.
R.F.D. Do you think that, as we are engaged with the truth relating to recovery, the Holy Spirit would engage us with *all* the truth, not just one section of it. Popular evangelism limits itself to one aspect.
G.R.C. I am sure that is right. Every feature of the truth of the assembly should be in expression in these last days. But then we need to see that for anything in the way of public display we have to wait for the Lord's coming. It is not for us to have in mind public display now, because of the humiliating failure of the profession, in which we have part. As far as public display is concerned, we have
{231}
to await the Lord's coming. But there is the anticipation of it. It is a great theme of testimony that the Lord is about to come, and it keeps us in buoyancy. But then according to @Psalm 101, He comes to us now: "I will sing of loving-kindness and judgment: unto thee, Jehovah, will I sing psalms. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. When wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart. I will set no thing of Belial before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me" (verses 1 - 3). Does that not set out the secret exercises which provide conditions for the Lord to come to us now? "When wilt thou come unto me?" The Lord is coming publicly shortly, but He comes to us now as there are conditions.
E.C.L. You would expect the Lord to come to us, in some sense, at every gathering, not only at the Supper, would you not? I wonder whether we have had this sufficiently in mind on all occasions of gathering. If the Lord comes He will give a distinct impression of Himself, suited to the occasion, will He not?
G.R.C. One has thought that the Lord's word, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (@John 14: 18) has a wide bearing. He comes in a peculiar way at the Supper, but we count on Him to enter into every occasion, do we not? On an occasion like this, what emptiness there would be if the Lord were not here. Hence our exercise at all times is that there might be conditions of righteousness, holiness and dependence, so as to secure His presence. As regards the individual, He says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will
{232}
love him and will manifest myself to him" (@John 14: 21). Then, "If anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him" (@John 14: 23).
C.E.J. Would @Genesis 17 and 18 allude to dwelling in the secret place of the Most High, and abiding under the shadow of the Almighty? In chapter 17 was not Abraham invited to abide under the shadow of the Almighty; and in chapter 18 he is dwelling in his house, as it were, with the heavenly visitors.
G.R.C. Very good. So that the word in @Genesis 17: 1 is, "I am the Almighty God: walk before my face, and be perfect". And God was going to express the proof of His almightiness, was He not, in the bringing in of Isaac? We can count on God proving His almightiness in bringing in what is spiritual amongst the saints today. But then as you say, in chapter 18, in the restfulness of that knowledge, Abraham was able to provide conditions for Jehovah to come to him.
F.L.R. Would you say why three psalms are merged together in @1 Chronicles 16, where the ark is brought into the tent which David spread for it? I was wondering whether the tent would indicate a provisional idea, because David's day was a day of recovery. The ark had been in other hands, and the three Psalms, @Psalm 96, @Psalm 105 and @Psalm 106, are blended together in the first psalm delivered to Asaph.
G.R.C. That is very interesting. Does it not show how, under the Lord's hand in the service of song, contributions are blended? It says, "On that day David delivered first this psalm to give thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and
{233}
his brethren" (@1 Chronicles 16: 7). It came, as it were, from David, and yet it was a blend of contributions.
D.S.H. Would you say some more about the blend of contributions?
G.R.C. Is it not instructive as to the service of song? David said, "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee" (@Psalm 22: 22), and he did so on the day that the ark was brought up. *He* delivered the psalm, but it was a blend of contributions, and it was voiced through Asaph and his brethren.
D.S.H. Should not we have great liberty in merging with one another in assembly service?
G.R.C. I am sure we should, as under the headship of Christ.
And then as the book proceeds, @Psalm 102 would help us as to feelings proper to the closing days. The Lord Himself has entered into intense sufferings resulting from God's governmental indignation and wrath against a faithless people, of whom He was, in wondrous grace, the representative. He entered into these in Gethsemane. While these sufferings do not, in themselves, go so far as atoning sufferings, yet they lead up to and merge into the sufferings of atonement. We need in our spirits to understand, in so far as this is possible, God's feelings about what has taken place in christendom and the breakdown in which we have part. We need to enter into them as recognising how much the Lord has suffered because of man's (i.e. Israel's) unfaithfulness in the place of responsibility in which God set him; on account of which He was cut off in the midst of His days. But the psalm goes on, "Thou art the Same;" the blessed Person
{234}
who, in grace, took all upon Himself, is saluted by God in this way.
W.J.S. You quoted this psalm yesterday, "I am become like the pelican of the wilderness … and am like a sparrow alone upon the house-top". How he felt the conditions, the spotless, perfect, holy Man, surrounded by so much that was dishonouring to God; how it pressed upon His spirit!
G.R.C. Yes, and feeling, too, the state of the nation of Israel and how right it was that indignation and wrath should fall upon it, and therefore upon Him as its representative, through boundless grace. Wrath came upon Him. He took it upon Himself as that nation's Shepherd. It would affect our outlook on church history, I believe, to contemplate these sufferings. God, as God, cannot overlook what has happened. If His grace is the same at the end of the dispensation, as it was at the beginning, the righteous basis lies in these sufferings of the Christ, which go deeper than the smiting of Israel's Shepherd, though linked with it, namely the sufferings of atonement itself. But what a comfort in these last days, to know that the Man who was cut off in the midst of His days is *the Same* -- the unchanging God. He is unchanging in grace and faithfulness, in spite of our unfaithfulness.
H.A.H. Would all His ways with us as shown in @Psalm 105 and 106 be in view of all the people saying "Amen"?
G.R.C. That is what is in mind, and I believe that should be ever before us in days of recovery. We should have nothing less in mind than that *all* the people should say "Amen". We may say, We shall never achieve it. True,
{235}
*we* shall not achieve it, but it is going to be achieved. All the people *are going to say*, "Amen", at the coming of the Lord. And the coming of the Lord is our hope in this book. His coming is imminent, and we already anticipate it in our spirits; in fact, He already comes to us. And when the Lord actually comes, *all* the people *will* say, "Amen". Not one will be absent, all will be in the matter, so that we are not cast down at all. But meantime our earnest prayer and desire is that they might say it *now*. All the saints are in our hearts; we yearn that all might be available, and our continual prayer should be, according to @Psalm 106: 47, "Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us". This is not a limited "us" -- it includes all who belong to the Lord Jesus. "Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations" -- we long for *all* to be saved, and *all* to be gathered -- "to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise".
G.H.S.P. Does this bear on the ministry which we have had as to forgiveness, and our attitude towards each other if assembly sorrows occur? I think you used the expression 'healing power' in your opening remarks.
G.R.C. That is very interesting. @Psalm 103 is an ascription of praise to God in connection with His healing power; "Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name!" It implies that we are healed inwardly; otherwise all that is within us is not available. We would love to see all the saints healed inwardly, so that all that is within them is available for God, as under the control of the Spirit. "Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities" -- these are assembly iniquities, as well as
{236}
personal ones. God is ready to forgive us in respect of our part in all the sins of the dispensation, if we are repentant. "Who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from the pit, who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thine old age with good things". We are living in the 'old age' as it were, of the dispensation, but He "satisfieth thine old age with good things; thy youth is renewed like the eagle's". So that the dispensation ends with full youthful energy in the power of the Spirit, through the healing faithfulness of God, in spite of all the sins of the dispensation. And all is due to the fact that He is "the Same". He is all that He ever was to the church.
C.J.H.D. So that the two sides that you refer to, God never overlooking matters, and yet coming out in the most wonderful grace, are brought together very closely in the last chapter of the Old Testament. The day is going to burn like an oven, and things are going to be dealt with, and yet the Sun of righteousness is going to arise to them that fear God's name, with healing in His wings.
G.R.C. Very good.
G.H.S.P. You referred in a previous reading to some of Paul's doxologies, and yesterday to Jude's doxology. Might this book link with Peter's doxology, "the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little while, himself shall make perfect" (@1 Peter 5: 10)? Recovery would be connected with the God of all grace?
G.R.C. I think it would.
J.D. Why is "Hallelujah" used at the end of this book?
{237}
G.R.C. This book introduces the word "Hallelujah", because in days of recovery we become specially jubilant as we prove God in His faithfulness. It leads to a state of exuberance in Nehemiah, where the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off. And so the word "Hallelujah" begins to appear. It appears at the ends of @Psalm 104, 105, and 106. In @Psalm 103 we magnify God for His healing grace, and in @Psalm 104 for His works in creation -- the truth of creation having a great place in New Testament teaching, and having special importance in this day of evolutionary theories. @Psalm 105 rehearses His gracious acts to His people, and @Psalm 106 the failures of the people and God's governmental dealings with them. Rehearsal belongs especially to the end of the dispensation, and adds to the wealth of praise that goes up at the end. It says, "And let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!"
J.P. Do you think Aquila and Priscilla are set out as wonderful examples of @Psalm 103 -- "satisfieth thine old age" -- see note *a* as to 'adornment'. I believe Priscilla means 'old age' and Aquila 'the eagle' -- youth.
G.R.C. That is very interesting.
M.H.T. Is it striking that Hebrews begins with a quotation from @Psalm 102 in connection with the title "the Same" (@Hebrews 1: 12) and ends with the reference to "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come" (@Hebrews 13: 8). The first reference being an assertion of His Deity, and the second a beautiful allusion to His humanity.
G.R.C. Very good.
{238}
{239}
THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD (5)
G R Cowell
@Psalm 107: 1 - 9; @Psalm 110: 1 - 4; @Psalm 132: 1 - 9, 13 - 18; @Psalm 133: 1 - 3; @Psalm 134: 1 - 3; @Psalm 146: 1, 7 - 10; @Psalm 147: 1, 2, 12 - 15; @Psalm 149: 5, 6; @Psalm 150: 1 - 6
G.R.C. We come now to the fifth book, the great culmination; a book which, read in the light of christianity, leads us into the expansiveness of the thoughts of God and the fulness of God Himself. Certain psalms in the book prove that it was compiled in the order in which we have it, after the captivity. This shows that, in days of recovery, God intends that we should enter into the expanse of His thoughts in purpose, in the power of the Holy Spirit, with a view to our being filled to all the fulness of God. The book links thus with Ephesians.
@Psalm 107 shows how God delivers souls out of all kinds of circumstances, in order to bring them into the gain of His purpose. In the first section, it is the redeemed, which includes us all. In the second it is those in captivity because of sin and failures. In the third it is fools -- those who have come into difficulties through sheer folly (and who of us has not). And in the fourth, those that go down to the sea in ships, who come to their wits¬ end, and then God brings them into blessing. This introductory psalm shows that, in whatever circumstances they may be found, God secures the objects of His purpose, to bring them into the great realm of praise.
{240}
@Psalm 110 presents the greatness of Christ in His present position at the right hand of God, and as the priest after the order of Melchisedec. Then the three Songs of degrees we have read refer to the Ark being brought into its place, a great service performed by God's Anointed -- and the results that flow from it. As a place is secured in the affections of the saints for Jehovah, and the Ark of His strength, we enter into the whole scope and expanse of God's purpose -- the breadth and length and depth and height to which Paul refers (@Ephesians 3: 18). This leads on to the culmination, the great 'Hallel' of the last five psalms, which lead up in @Psalm 150, to a crescendo of praise to God Himself in the greatness of His Being.
W.J.S. There is no heading to @Psalm 107. It brings before the soul what Jehovah has done -- "redeemed", "gathered", "led", "satisfied", "filled" -- all His operations in days of recovery.
G.R.C. What a mighty operation redemption is; how it magnifies Jehovah, and every believer comes into that. Then what a mighty operation was the breaking of the gates of bronze and cutting asunder the bars of iron -- we have proved it in our day. Who would have thought in the Middle Ages that any power could have overthrown the power of Rome? God used, in the main, one man, showing what He can do. He has not only operated spiritually, in raising up men like Martin Luther, and later Mr. Darby; but He has entered into the political sphere at the same time. He has set up systems of government in the Western World that have, in the main, been favourable to the testimony to this day, even as were the Persian dynasties of old.
{241}
C.J.H.D. @Zechariah 1: 11, 20, 21 speak of a time when all the earth was at rest, and of God using the four craftsmen to keep in control all that would oppose Him.
G.R.C. God used the chariots also. He used the craftsmen on constructive lines, and the chariots and horses in @Zechariah 6 on governmental lines. He says that the black horses had quieted His spirit in the north country. The literal application is that He sent forth Persia to deal with Babylon, and to break the gates of bronze.
C.J.H.D. In chapter 2: 1 - 4 a young man is introduced to Jerusalem, which can be measured, and is going to be "inhabited as towns without walls".
N.F.A. "He led them forth by a right way, that they might go to a city of habitation" (@Psalm 107: 7). Is the great end in view that souls should be brought to the assembly?
G.R.C. Quite so, and that is what is in mind typically in @Zechariah 2: 4, "Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein". It is remarkable that such a truth should be put before a young man, to encourage him in view of what was outwardly a day of smallness. "For who hath despised the day of small things?" it says later (@Zechariah 4: 10).
E.C.L. Do you think it is well to encourage young people to have an outline of church history, so that the thoughts of God might be enlarged and developed? I was thinking of the last verse of @Psalm 107, "Whoso is wise, let him observe these things, and let them understand the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah".
G.R.C. That is important, and links with the idea of rehearsal in @Psalm 105 and 106. It is a great thing to know
{242}
how to rehearse God's ways in grace and in government, do you not think?
E.C.L. I feel it is important to take account of the way God has wrought all down the centuries to bring us to where we are now.
G.R.C. And Zechariah would be a great encouragement to young men. He was a young man with plenty of questions, and God takes account of such an one. He says to the angel, "Run, speak to this young man" (@Zechariah 2: 4). Think of God saying that to an angel, because He saw a young man who was interested. Later Zechariah asks many questions, and there is always someone available to answer, although sometimes he has to wait for an answer, and sometimes he is challenged, as when the angel says, "Knowest thou not what these are?" (@Zechariah 4: 5), and he says, "No, my lord". He does not mind admitting that he does not know. A young man, in a day of recovery, should be full of questions, and if he is, God will see to it that he sees visions. Zechariah saw visions, and young men ought to see visions, in the sense in which I am speaking. They should have insight as to what God is doing spiritually, and in the sphere of government, at the present time. I am applying the idea of vision to insight into what God is doing, and that is what young men need. It will energise them, so that they get to work and fully commit themselves to what is on hand. That was the effect on Zechariah. First he had questions, then God gave him visions, and then he prophesied for the rest of the book. And if young men had their questions, and received answers and spiritual visions, we should hear them in the
{243}
meeting for ministry. They would prophesy to the end of their days.
A.B. Would he be greatly encouraged with the width of what is committed to him in contrast to Haggai, who is given a brief word for the moment? I was thinking of the great scope of his prophecy.
G.R.C. There is a great range in the book. His vision in chapter 3 is in view of the day of recovery. Joshua the high priest is really representative of the people, and it shows how God would take off the filthy garments, and put on the festival robes. It is what God is doing for His people at the present time. The filthy garments are those stained with all the sins of christendom, and God, in His grace, would relieve us of the burden of them, and put on us the festival robes. And then the next vision is the lampstand with seven lamps on it, which means that nothing has failed from the divine side, the Spirit is still here, and the full light of God is still available in the Spirit.
C.J.H.D. And the prophecy has a wonderful climax in regard of the name of Jehovah. It says at the end, "in that day shall there be one Jehovah, and his name one" (@Zechariah 14: 9). Does that look on to the final heading up of things in the glory of the Mediator, as He will appear to the universe -- God Himself will be there -- "one Jehovah, and his name one"?
G.R.C. That is very fine. That is, no doubt, the culmination, and it is like the culmination of the Psalms, is it not? There is one Jehovah, every idol is displaced. He is known to us as the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There is "one Jehovah, and his name one".
{244}
A.W.P. Does Stephen represent, in christianity, an example of what you are saying? He was able to recount the movements of the testimony in Israel over a long period. Then he comes to the point where *he* sees a vision -- the heavens opened and the glory of God and Jesus standing -- and speaks of it in such prophetic power that those who hear are cut to the heart.
G.R.C. Stephen is a very great example of what we are saying. He was a young man, and he was full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. He was like one of the sons of oil which Zechariah sees: "These are the two sons of oil" (@Zechariah 4: 14); although they represent a company rather than individuals. There is the lampstand and the seven lamps, and then there are the two sons of oil, which involves exercise on the part of the saints to be in the matter, it seems to me. Stephen was one who was in the matter, he was full of the Holy Spirit.
H.A.H. Would that link on with @Psalm 110, the dew of the Lord's youth, literally 'young men' (see note *f*)?
G.R.C. That is good. I am glad you have moved us on to @Psalm 110. I think that is a pivotal point in the psalm, because verse 2 no doubt is future and we are wanting to apply the psalm to the present. I think we can give a present application to verse 3, "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in holy splendour: from the womb of the morning shall come to thee the dew of thy youth", or the 'dew of thy young men'. The Lord has such available, the service is carried through by them.
G.W.B. Would you apply the first half of the last verse to the present time also? I was thinking of what the Lord receives at the Supper.
{245}
G.R.C. So that, while the Melchisedec view of Christ does not emphasise His portion, as does the view of the king in @Psalm 45, yet there is just this touch that He drinks of the brook in the way. How precious that must be to Him as having the service of God in mind.
G.W.B. Do you think it is on the way to His rule in Zion, His public glory?
G.R.C. Quite so, and I was thinking of it now as on the way to the service of God. "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power". One would apply this verse to the way the saints become willing and available as the Lord comes amongst us, and secures complete sway in affection over us, so that it becomes the day of His power. It is not only "the day of his espousals ... the day of the gladness of his heart" (@Song of Songs 3: 11), but it becomes the day of His power, and we become available to Him in the service of God in holy splendour.
G.H.S.P. You have in mind, I judge, that as the Lord is refreshed and we find our part with Him, it really sets in motion the whole of the spiritual side of the service of God?
G.R.C. Exactly. Verse 3 thus becomes operative, the people willing in the day of His power in holy splendour. What a setting this is! Then it says, "from the womb of the morning" -- no doubt an allusion to the death of Christ -- "from the womb of the morning shall come to thee the dew of thy youth" or 'thy young men'. We sing sometimes, 'Lord, around Thee are thy brethren' (`283:1). The Lord has those available for the service of God.
J.L.W. Would you link it with @John 20?
{246}
G.R.C. I would. I think @John 20 in a particular way presents the tomb of Christ, as the "womb of the morning". And Mary of Magdala is the hind of the morning, representing the assembly; and the Lord says, "Go to my brethren" -- they are like the young men, "the dew of thy youth".
W.McK. Does the primary thought of God, namely sonship, underlie the service? I am thinking of the word, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4: 23). That is, he is to be set free from every power that would hold him. As regards Paul's ministry, did he not begin there?
G.R.C. He did. I am sure sonship is basic in christianity. God says, "Let my son go, that he may serve me", but where was His son to serve? He was to serve in the tabernacle, which is a type of the assembly. He was to serve later in the house that Solomon built, another type of the assembly. So that the sons of God serve in the assembly, not exactly in the family setting, although that underlies it, but the assembly is the *sphere* of service.
W.McK. And is that the view you are taking of the results of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, that out of it comes everything for God?
G.R.C. Yes, everything for God, whether we are viewed as His brethren, or as His body and His bride, or as the sons of God.
M.H.T. Is what you are suggesting also to be illustrated in a well-known incident in David's history, when the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines, to fetch their king a flask of water from his native well? That action stimulated David to pour it out as a drink-offering to Jehovah? (@2 Samuel 23: 13 - 17).
{247}
G.R.C. That is good. The water was for David's refreshment, but he did not drink it himself. As you say, it stimulated him in the service of Jehovah.
N.F.A. Would you say a little more about sons not serving in the family, but in the assembly?
G.R.C. I think that is how Scripture presents it. The family is not exactly a service unit. @Luke 15 does not involve the service of God; it is the father's joy in the son and the music and dancing and merriment. The joy and the intimacies of family life underlie assembly service, but assembly service proceeds under the headship of Christ, in holy splendour. In all its parts it is worthy of God in His greatness. Even though we are addressing the Father, the manner, and the deportment of the saints and the whole setting of the service, as under the eye of heavenly intelligences, is worthy of the great King.
N.F.A. The family side of things would give us liberty?
G.R.C. Quite so. The family is like divine home life. But the assembly is the great official vessel, as we might say, of service; and divine sovereignty enters into its composition, each having his divinely ordered place. As sons, we are all firstborn, there is no distinction, but in the assembly each has his own place and fits into his own position, and we are dependent upon Christ as Head to give impulse and direction to the whole service, as king Solomon did in the type.
A.M. Would you say why the priesthood of Aaron is superseded by what is greater according to @Hebrews 5?
G.R.C. Does not the Melchisedec type bring out the greatness of the Person who is priest? He is a priest after
{248}
that order. The psalm begins, "Jehovah said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit at my right hand". No one else has ever been invited to do that. Whilst it refers to the Lord in manhood, of course, yet no one other than a Divine Person could occupy such a position. Then in verse 5 it refers to Him as "the Lord [Adonai] at thy right hand". That title refers to the lordship and authority that is His, *in the right of His own Person*. The testimonial position is that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ; but we have to recognise that lordship is also His by personal right.
C.J.H.D. @Hebrews 7: 4 says, "Consider how great this personage was", but we can say of Christ, Consider how great His person is, can we not?
G.R.C. Yes, and that is what this psalm would bring home to us. According to Hebrews, He set Himself down at the right hand of the greatness on high.
G.W.B. Others are not associated with Him in this setting.
G.R.C. No one could be associated with Him in this setting. We must remember, too, that the name Melchisedec means King of righteousness. God never dissociates the idea of king and priest. It says in @Hebrews 7: 2 that he was "first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace". King of Salem links with Jerusalem, the place of peace. There is a strong assembly link in that way. He is King of righteousness, and Jerusalem is the city of righteousness. He is the King of peace, and Jerusalem means the place of peace. And then, being King of righteousness and King of peace, He is the Priest of the Most High God, there is nothing to hinder Him in priestly service.
{249}
J.C.T. Is it your thought that, as our affections receive a fresh impression of the greatness of Christ, we are brought into living conditions in which the service proceeds? He says in the Song, "Before I was aware, My soul set me upon the chariots of my willing people" (@Song of Songs 6: 12). That would prepare the way for the upward movement you have in mind?
G.R.C. I do believe that an appreciation of the greatness of the person of Christ greatly helps us to be willing in the day of His *power*, in holy splendour. Nothing gives us such a sense of the holy splendour of our own place before God as an impression of the unspeakable greatness of Christ.
W.H.K. Would it be out of place to refer to @Psalm 96: 8, 9 -- it was read this morning but not touched upon -- "Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; bring an oblation and come into his courts; Worship Jehovah in holy splendour"?
G.R.C. I would say that there you have the willing people.
I think now we ought to move on to the Songs of degrees, because it is a question there of arriving at the full expanse of the thoughts of God in purpose, which centre in the Ark. I believe this is the only time the Ark is mentioned in the Psalms, although it is implied in such expressions as, "He sitteth between the cherubim" (@Psalm 99: 1). But we see in @Psalm 132 the relation between God's Anointed of @Psalm 2, and the Ark. One of the great services of God's Anointed is to bring the Ark into its place in the affections of the saints, and, if the Ark is in its
{250}
place, we can look out on the breadth and length and depth and height of the whole sphere of God's purpose.
H.A.H. Is there a distinction between this psalm and @Psalm 48? In @Psalm 48 the nations, and what is outward, are in view, but here it seems to be what is inward?
G.R.C. I think the second book of Psalms has the testimonial position in mind, both now and in the day of display, but I believe this book has in mind the saints arriving in their spirits, in the power of the Holy Spirit, at the full expanse of God's purpose.
J.L.W. Are you thinking of the expression "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" (@Ephesians 3: 17)? Is that the Ark in its right place?
G.R.C. That is what I understand. I believe the prayer in @Ephesians 3 brings in both the Ark and God's Anointed. When the apostle prays "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts", I think he has in mind that the saints should, in their affections, apprehend Christ as the Centre of the divine system, typified by the Ark. But when he says, "to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" (verse 19), he would include in his thoughts the active love of the Christ -- king Solomon and his activities being the type. The Ark typifies Christ in the greatness of His Person, as the centre of the system -- a *fixed* position. But Solomon is the *active* view of Christ -- God's Anointed, whose love surpasses knowledge. His love moves in all directions, towards God, towards the assembly, towards every family, and God would put the Ark in its place, and every family in its place relative to it.
A.A.B. Would you be free to say a word as to the distinction between David bringing the Ark into the tent he
{251}
had prepared, and the final thought of Solomon bringing the Ark into the most holy place?
G.R.C. I think David bringing it up would link more with Colossians. The outward surroundings were not yet present in all their magnificence, and so what was stressed in David's day was the greatness of the Ark itself. The Colossian position, which is our actual position down here, as under the headship of Christ in localities, is a blessed one. Although we are not yet actually in surroundings of infinite glory, we have the Ark; and in such circumstances the greatness of the Ark specially engages our attention. I suppose there is no greater presentation of Christ than in @Colossians 1. But I think Solomon links with Ephesians; he brings the Ark, typically, into its own eternal setting, a most glorious setting, and I think that is the idea of @Ephesians 3. So that the Ark is not, in itself, so prominent as under David, because the whole setting is so glorious.
A.A.B. And that runs on to the thought of the glory of God filling the house of Jehovah?
G.R.C. Quite so. For the full thought, we have to link David and Solomon together, and I think that is in mind in @Psalm 132. David never had less than the full thought before him, because he desired to build Jehovah a house, but God said, "thy seed ... shall build me a house" (@1 Chronicles 17: 11, 12). "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength" (@Psalm 132: 8) would include the occasion when he brought it up and put it under curtains. But the house was really in view and, therefore, in @2 Chronicles 6: 41, Solomon actually quotes this, with slight enlargement, when he brings the Ark in. He says, "And now, arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place, thou
{252}
and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, Jehovah Elohim, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in thy goodness". You will notice he adds the word "Elohim", which suggests the whole scene of glory as standing related to God in His supremacy and majesty -- "Elohim".
E.C.L. Would that be the suggestion in worshipping at His footstool? Is that not an acknowledgement of all that God is? While we know Him, yet we acknowledge that there is much beyond what we may be permitted to know. The sense of this promotes worship.
G.R.C. That is very beautiful. Whilst the Lord says, "We worship what we know" (@John 4: 22), we always do it in the sense that there is that which is infinitely beyond us.
D.S.H. Why is it that in verse 9 there is the desire that the priests should be rightly clothed, and for the saints to shout for joy? And then in verse 16, "I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy".
G.R.C. It links somewhat with @Ephesians 3: 20, does it not? "But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think". The answer was more than was asked for, and God alone can clothe us aright, and make us great and strong in such a realm of glory as this. David said, "in thy hand it is to make all great and strong" (@1 Chronicles 29: 12).
A.W.P. Would you say more as to the distinction between the Ark and Solomon as types?
G.R.C. While activity characterises the Ark earlier -- it goes before the people in @Numbers 10 to find a resting place -- its final setting suggests a fixed position. It typifies Christ as the Centre, the One who gives character to the
{253}
whole realm of glory, and the One to whom God is fully committed. If the Ark is there, God is there, for He sits between the cherubim. And so it is, "Arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place, *thou and the ark of thy strength*". God comes in with the Ark -- a wonderful thought. In @Psalm 2 it is Jehovah and His Anointed; but in @Psalm 132, the link is between Jehovah and the Ark of His strength. These are great thoughts in Scripture -- God and His Anointed, and God and the Ark of His strength. It is through the outshining, and the operations in grace, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that God secures all that He had in mind in purpose. He has, in the Son, His Anointed, and that same Person is the Ark of His strength, the Centre of the whole realm of glory. The Father names the families, but the end in view in it all is that God in all His greatness and supremacy is enshrined in the universe of bliss in relation to the Ark of His strength.
G.H.S.P. Does the love, which is peculiarly linked with the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, ensure conditions in which the greatness of God, as God, can be taken account of? Many of us would like some further help on the matter of God, as God, involving wider glories than God known in the Father. Does the Father's realm ensure the atmosphere of love in which the glories of God, which we have been enjoying in the Psalms, find expression?
G.R.C. That is what I thought. God was made known under the name "Jehovah" to Israel. It was, for them, a name of relationship, and the value of that name, as of every Old Testament name, remains. But for the fulfilment of what God had in mind, it required operations of grace,
{254}
and relationships of love, which involve the incarnation, and the declaration of the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. It is by way of these operations of grace and love and tenderness, which characterise the activities of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and the intimate relations into which they introduce us, that God, as God, gives effect to His great and eternal purpose to be the Centre of the universe, in relation to the One who is the Ark of His strength.
W.J.S. Does the glory of the Ark suggest a Divine Person in manhood? There was a moment, as the scripture suggests, when everything hung upon a creature, the anointed cherub. He fell, and there was breakdown. Then everything hung upon the creature man in the garden, and he broke down. But is the glory of the incarnation that God has effected all His thoughts and purpose in One in whom there could be no breakdown or failure? One great impression which will remain in my soul from these readings is the glory of the incarnation.
G.R.C. That is very fine. The lid of the Ark was the mercy-seat. Apart from the mercy-seat, the Ark would be alone, but through the mercy-seat it stands related to the whole universe of bliss. The cherubim overshadow it -- the rights of God are fully maintained. The Ark is a remarkable type. One has come in, upon whom God can wholly depend, and the universe, as held in relation to Him, becomes the scene of God's rest.
W.McK. Would Solomon, the more active type of Christ, indicate the Lord's personal part as Man in the service of God?
{255}
G.R.C. I think so. David says, as typical of the Lord, "in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee" (@Psalm 22: 22). So that David and Solomon represent the more active side of things. The love of the Christ surpasses knowledge, because of who He is in His Person, but it is an active love, and one of the greatest services He performs is to bring the ark into its place (see @2 Chronicles 5: 7 - 10).
S.H. Would you help us as to the expression, "to him be glory in the assembly *in Christ Jesus*"? (@Ephesians 3: 21). Does what you are saying connect with that great thought, a creature vessel employed eternally in response to God, but sustained in Christ Jesus?
G.R.C. No doubt it relates to the special status of the assembly.
F.G.S. Would you say that in @1 Corinthians 15 we see the Ark arising and scattering the enemies, according to @Numbers 10, and in @Ephesians 3 the Ark returning to its rest amongst the myriads, so to speak?
G.R.C. Quite so. We are engaged now with the Ark entering into its final rest, and the great fact that God is linked with the Ark. One would like to understand better the two great thoughts, Jehovah and His Anointed, and Jehovah and the Ark of His strength. They bring before us the One by whom, and in whom, God's purpose is effected.
S.E.W. Is that the thought in @Psalm 132: 13, 14?
G.R.C. Quite so. "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it". The anointing in its kingly character, as bringing to pass the mind and will of God, is seen in @Psalm 132, and in its priestly character, as the
{256}
fragrant oil, in @Psalm 133. The ark is in its place and the whole system is fragrant. God's king is also His priest and the anointing pervades the whole system -- "Like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments".
A.A.B. 'By the Spirit all pervading' (`14:5) -- is that the thought?
G.R.C. Quite so. And then it is like the dew of Hermon. Hermon is a mountain in Lebanon, three times as high as Zion, and the dew fell upon the mountains of Zion. The dew of Hermon may refer to what comes down from the Man who has ascended above all heavens. He has gone higher than we can go.
C.J.H.D. So it is the anticipation of heaven before we get there. I was wondering whether we could link the fifth book of Psalms with the end of the fifth book of Moses, and link both with Ephesians, remembering the words of Mr. Taylor in 1935, 'What would heaven be without the saints in it!' Moses saw the tribes in the land before they were actually there.
G.R.C. Very good.
A.W.P. I would like to enquire as to the significance of Zion, especially in the Songs of degrees. Does the idea of His mercy link with it?
G.R.C. I would think it refers to the accomplishment of all God's purpose on the basis of sovereign mercy.
And now we ought to proceed to the close of the book, and particularly the last psalm.
W.T.E. Would you say why the Songs of degrees are intertwined in the fifth book of psalms? They seem to give
{257}
a spiritual touch, ending up with *blessing* in each verse of @Psalm 134; while in @Psalm 150 it is *praise* in every verse. I thought blessing was a higher form of worship than praise.
G.R.C. Is not blessing that which rises from the soul? "Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name!" (@Psalm 103: 1). Whereas praise is that which is expressed, and which enters into testimony, because the high praises of God now, and in the world to come, and, I suppose, even in eternity, will be a great testimony to the whole universe. Is that so?
W.T.E. Yes. I thought that the Songs of degrees bring out a priestly atmosphere, known only to the saints in an ascending way, until we get to the thought of praising Jehovah.
G.H.S.P. Could we have your thoughts on this crescendo in the last psalm?
G.R.C. The last five are "Hallelujah" psalms, and they begin as it were at the bottom, showing the scope of praise to God, for in @Psalm 146: 7, 8 it says, "Jehovah looseth the prisoners; Jehovah openeth the eyes of the blind". In @Psalm 147 it is what He does for the assembly, "Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth the outcasts of Israel" (verse 2) -- another touch as to days of recovery. Then in verses 13 - 15, "He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates", which would link very much with Nehemiah. "He hath blessed thy children within thee; He maketh peace in thy borders; He satisfieth thee with the finest of the wheat. He sendeth forth his oracles to the earth". @Psalm 148 is occupied with creation, beginning with the angels, and shows that we need to take account of creation and of God as Creator, both as to this creation and new creation. The
{258}
idea of creation enters much into the praise of God. It is referred to in Romans, Corinthians, Colossians, Ephesians, 1 and 2 Peter and Revelation, as well as in the gospels. @Psalm 150 is the great climax of praise. Mr. Darby has pointed out that the name of relationship (Jehovah) does not occur in it; but that the names used -- Jah and El -- refer to God in His self-existence and essence. Jah occurs in each of the last five psalms. "Hallelujah" means 'Praise ye Jah'. It is one of the most remarkable names of God, the name which most nearly conveys absoluteness. "Jehovah" is more His continuous existence, the One who is, and who was and who is to come, the One who has had to do with time in order to effect His purpose. By this name He was especially known to Israel, but the knowledge of Him thus was to lead them to "Jah", the essential Object of praise, and to the praise of 'El' that is, God in the greatness of His Being, in His sanctuary.
As in the gain of the full declaration of God, those who belong to the assembly are qualified, in a way that Israel never will be, to praise God thus. I know we have to be careful in such statements, for we cannot *apprehend* God in His essence, nor can we approach Him where He dwells in unapproachable light. Nevertheless, the way He has come out in declaration gives us some insight, some penetration, into the blessedness of what He is in His essential Being. The Lord Jesus, the Son, is "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance" (@Hebrews 1: 3) or 'essential being' (see note *c*). Mr. Taylor wrote in 1943, 'Scripture gives no definite line between what is revealed and what is not revealed. That is to say, what is revealed is not detached from the
{259}
inscrutable'¦ @Psalm 150 shows that the ultimate in praise is not the name of relationship, but the praise of God in His self-existence (Jah) and in His essence (El -- the Mighty), in His sanctuary. His sanctuary is, of course, the assembly, for the assembly is the shrine where God dwells. Yet to be in the sanctuary truly, involves being in the nearest place in which the creature can be to God, as God, a place where there is scope for the power of spiritual penetration. I do not want to suggest that we can penetrate the absolute -- I trust the brethren will not misunderstand me -- nevertheless, the One who dwells in light unapproachable has come out to us. The more we know of Him in the way He has been revealed, the more penetration we shall have into the blessedness of His Being. One link between what He is as revealed, and what He is in His essential Being is love. "God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him" (@1 John 4: 16). The God we know and worship cannot be compassed by a creed, nor by any human terms; He is infinitely beyond us. Yet, in the power of the christian revelation we are set down in that most favoured, most holy place, to praise Him in His sanctuary. We praise Him, too, in the firmament of His power, as being ourselves the subjects of that power. We are in the firmament, which refers to the expanse, or heaven, through His power, for He has "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2: 6). We praise Him in His mighty acts, and according to the abundance of His greatness.
¦ J.T., *Letters*, Volume 2, page 311
{260}
G.H.S.P. Does it help to see that the service of praise is cumulative? None of the earlier touches of love are left behind; all are carried forward, are they not? I was thinking of what has been said, that the brethren of Christ; the assembly as united to Christ; and the sons associated with Him in the Father's presence; are all to be carried forward in our minds, as it were, as we take on this final thought. The very knowledge that there *remains* something outside creature knowledge can only promote a spirit of worship.
G.R.C. I believe that if we entered in fulness -- and the Spirit would help us -- into our relationships with Christ as His brethren, and as His bride, and into our place in sonship with the Father, we would have no difficulty about worshipping this blessed God, this great self-existent One. The One of whom it says the Lord Jesus is the expression of His 'essential Being'. We are *in the presence* of such an One, though He is infinitely beyond our finite apprehension.
G.H.S.P. Yes, "filled even to all the fulness of God" (@Ephesians 3: 19).
G.R.C. Then every kind of instrument is brought in. First it is *where* we praise Him -- in the sanctuary, in the firmament of His power, in His mighty acts; then *according to* the abundance of His greatness. Then *how* we praise -- with every kind of instrument; and then finally, "Let everything that hath breath praise Jah. Hallelujah!"
F.J.D. Is that the glorious, eternal answer to @Genesis 2: 7, God breathing into Man's nostrils the breath of life and "Man became a living soul"?
{261}
G.R.C. That is very fine. "Let everything that hath breath;" everything that breathes, everything in which there is any life from God at all, is called upon to praise Him.
A.W.R. Does the doxology in @1 Timothy 6: 15, 16 help as to the character of praise to God in His essence to which you refer. "The King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen".
G.R.C. I think so. It is one of the most profound of the doxologies. Are we saying what is right, Mr. W.?
H.W. I am going with it thoroughly, and enjoying it.
F.L.R. Is it good to see that the trumpet is used in @Psalm 150? It is used previously in redemption's claims, clearly uttered in the journeying of the camps, and as an alarm in the night, and now used again in the day of gladness when God comes in to His own?
G.R.C. Very good.

GOD DWELLING
G R Cowell
@1 Timothy 6: 14 - 16; @Isaiah 57: 15; @Exodus 25: 8, 9; @Psalm 132: 14; @Revelation 21: 3
Each passage we have read refers to God dwelling. According to the first passage He dwells in unapproachable light; it says of Him, "who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen". Paul's heart is moved in worship to the God who dwells, in the self-sufficiency and greatness of His essential Being, in unapproachable light, entirely beyond the vision of the creature. It is remarkable that a worshipper should give expression to this, and I suppose only a worshipper could do so. Paul himself is the outstanding example of a worshipper in the New Testament. As he touches one truth after another, even while writing the epistles, he breaks out in worship, showing what a constitutional worshipper he was. In Romans he has only to mention God as Creator, "the incorruptible God", as he calls Him, when his heart is moved to worship, and he says, "who is blessed for ever. Amen" (@Romans 1: 23, 25). And so later in that epistle, as he touches one important truth after another, he gives expression to a doxology. It is such a man as that who gives us this statement as to God, "dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see". How did Paul know about this? It does not say
{264}
here that God is dwelling in thick darkness. That was so in Old Testament times, as far as *men* were concerned; but God in His absoluteness dwells in *light*, although it is unapproachable. It magnifies God in our minds and thoughts, to know that He dwells in light, although it is entirely beyond us. What a marvellous thing it is that the God who dwells there, and ever will dwell there, should move out from that seclusion where no one has seen, nor could see, Him! He is there in His own self-sufficiency and self-existence. Why should He move out from that seclusion, where He is beyond the knowledge of the creature in every way? I believe the answer lies in what has been revealed as to the nature of God, that God is love, and that He desired to be known and to be loved responsively by intelligent creatures. Indeed, He desired to dwell among such -- that is marvellous -- and the creature upon whom His heart was set, according to eternal purpose, was man. We do not read that God ever dwelt, or will dwell, with angels. He dwells in unapproachable light, but when it speaks of His dwelling in other ways, as in the scriptures we have read, it speaks of Him dwelling with men. It is a marvellous thing that God has come out from the seclusion, where He dwells in His own self-sufficiency, having in mind to dwell with men, because man is an order of being capable of taking in, and responding intelligently to, the disclosures of Himself that He had in mind to make; responding affectionately and in praise. And so, from the outset of God's creational activities, wisdom's delights were with the sons of men.
I suppose we might think of God moving out from His place of seclusion, in the first instance, to act in creation.
{265}
We are told that all things were made by and for the Son and that He upholds all things by the word of His power. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands" (@Psalm 19: 1). The immortal, invisible, incorruptible God began to express Himself in the creation, 'Planned with wondrous skill' (`118:2). He manifested His eternal power and divinity, and made known to the man He had made, His perfect goodness and beneficence, in surrounding him with every tree that was pleasant to the eyes and good for food, and by putting the tree of life in the midst of the garden, showing that His mind for man was life. He made Himself known thus as the blessed God, and that is why Paul, when he speaks of Him in Romans as the Creator, says, "Who is blessed for ever. Amen" (@Romans 1: 25). Do we worship God, dear brethren, sufficiently as Creator? Paul says men have "changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles" (@Romans 1: 23). He also says, that they "honoured and served the creature more than him who had created it, who is blessed for ever". God has proved in creation that He is blessed for ever, and in framing the creation with wondrous skill He had in mind from the very outset the bringing in of Christ as the Centre -- "all things have been created by him and for him" (@Colossians 1: 16). If we do not understand that, we do not understand the purpose of the creation. Further, it says that He is before all. And so in @Romans 9: 5, when Paul says "of whom, [i.e. of Israel] as according to flesh, is the Christ", he immediately adds in a spirit of worship, "who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen". Are you a worshipper of
{266}
Christ? No mere man, no one, indeed, but a Person of the Godhead, could be the Christ. In the incarnation God was bringing in the Person who is to be the Centre of the vast creation, the One by whom and for whom all things were made. The coming in of Christ has laid the basis for God to dwell eternally with men.
To proceed to our second scripture, Isaiah says, "For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, and whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones". What a touching passage this is! God could speak in this way because Christ was coming in. If He could dwell in past dispensations with those who were of a contrite and humble spirit, it was because Christ was to come and accomplish the work of redemption. Their faith looked on to Christ. From Abel onwards -- indeed, from Adam onwards, faith ever looked on to Christ. God was going to set Him forth a mercy-seat. He could never be the Centre of the vast creation, sin having come in, unless He was a mercy-seat. God has now set forth Christ Jesus a mercy-seat, through faith in His blood, and the value of His work has its effect backwards, as well as forwards. As it says in @Romans 3: 25, 26, "For the shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus". It is a wonderful thing that, although God had in mind to dwell with men, the fulfilment of it awaited redemption. There is no suggestion
{267}
of God dwelling with man in innocence. I do not think man in innocence could have provided suitable conditions for this high and lofty One to dwell. Man in innocence had not power, or capacity, to take in His thoughts and to be responsive to Him. It is on the basis of redemption that He says, "I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit". How wonderful that this glorious God is prepared to dwell with each one of us here! And the condition is that we should be of a contrite and humble spirit. He dwells with none else. In @John 14: 23, in the light of the full christian revelation, the Lord says, "If anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". This is how God dwells with an individual in our dispensation. A man of a humble and contrite spirit would be a man who loves Jesus, and keeps His word. He has no confidence in himself, he has learned to judge himself, but he loves Jesus, and keeps His word. And of such an one the Lord Jesus says, "my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".
The God who dwells in unapproachable light has now been fully declared. He was made known in a partial way to His people of old. Moses, it says, could see His back parts, when he saw His glory, but we are privileged, as it were, to see Him face to face in Jesus. We behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face. God has moved out in such a manner that a Person of the Godhead has come into manhood, and He is the image of the invisible God. The God whom no man hath seen, nor is able to see, has come into full expression. It says of the Lord Jesus, the
{268}
Son, that He is "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance", or 'essential being' (@Hebrews 1: 3, see footnote *c*). It does not mean that a creature could compass all that has been expressed, but it does mean that everything that men, empowered by the Holy Spirit, can apprehend as to God is now in full expression. I am certain that more has been expressed than we shall ever take in, or could take in, for God has come out so completely in the Son. Nevertheless, what a vast range there is that we *can* take in by the Spirit. A Person of the Godhead has come into manhood, and He is the image of the invisible God. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit has come to take up His abode with us, and to dwell in us, giving us power to take in what has been expressed, in so far as it is possible for the creature to do so. What favoured persons we are! The coming out of God from the seclusion of unapproachable light involves the declaration of His name, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and in @John 14: 23 the Lord Jesus shows how the gain of that is available for one man. Earlier He says of the Holy Spirit, "He abides with you, and shall be *in* you" (@John 14: 17). He is referring to the company there, of course. The declaration of God was in view of dwelling, first of all on the part of the Spirit -- "He abides with you, and shall be *in* you". Then He says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him" -- the Father and the Son -- "and make our abode with him". The Spirit is already there, as we may say, but the Father and the Son will also come to him and make Their abode with him. That is a most amazing statement, and the only explanation of it is love. If anyone love me -- that is,
{269}
the responsive love which God is seeking -- "if anyone love me, he will keep my word". If we love, we shall provide suitable conditions for God to dwell. If the God who dwells in unapproachable light is to dwell among men it must be on His own terms, in accordance with His holiness. To lay the basis for it Jesus has been into death. In coming out to dwell with men God surrenders nothing of what is due to Himself in His nature and His attributes. But "if any one love me, he will keep my word;" he will provide the conditions and my Father will love him, and *we* will come to him and make our abode with him. How much is available, beloved brethren, to one who is of a contrite and humble spirit in the present day. Such a person will love the Lord Jesus and keep His word, and come in for the infinite blessing, not only of the Spirit dwelling in him, but of the Father and the Son coming to him and making Their abode with him. All that comes about because God is love, and He comes to such a person for His own satisfaction. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit find satisfaction in abiding with one such person. I would say again, that it is because God is love that He has come out in declaration and revelation; love so looks for response, so requires an answer, that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit will come down, as it were, to one person for Their own satisfaction.
But in @Exodus 25 Jehovah speaks of a corporate dwelling-place. He appeals to those whose hearts prompt them. I need not say that those who are of a contrite and humble spirit will be amongst these willing-hearted ones. And He says, "They shall make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shall shew thee,
{270}
the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the utensils thereof, even so shall ye make it". What a call this is for responsive love on our part! God would have, we may say, a corporate or collective dwelling. He will come down to abide with one person, but that is not the full thought of God. He has a pattern before Him, and that pattern involves the tabernacle, which is typical of the assembly. It involves the saints set together as one body in Christ, and *members one of another*, according to @Romans 12. Set together as one body *in relation to the Holy Spirit*, according to @1 Corinthians 12. Set together as Christ's body *in relation to Christ as head*, according to @Colossians 1. And with *the Christ enshrined in their hearts*, according to @Ephesians 3. That is the pattern, and if we are to know God dwelling, things must be according to the pattern. Alas, the dwelling of God is very little known in christendom. Where there is a humble and contrite spirit God will dwell with that man; but the dwelling of God in a collective way is very little known, if at all, in christendom. Yet to know the dwelling of God in a collective way is far greater than anything we could enjoy as individuals. It is worth going in for. Paul has given us the pattern. The pattern is clearly laid down in Scripture. The tabernacle itself is typical of the pattern -- but Paul's ministry helps us to understand the typical teaching, and if you follow the epistles -- Romans, Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians -- you find the pattern. Let us go in for these things, dear brethren. The blessed God has come out from the seclusion where He dwells in unapproachable light, desiring to dwell with men; not with angels, but with men. He has come out in a way calculated to touch and win our
{271}
affections. We have been reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, in order that there might be willing-heartedness. In fact He has put us in the place of sons: He said, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4: 23). We have sung: 'But, our God, how great Thy yearning To have sons who love' (`118:3). God sent forth His Son that we might receive sonship; God is seeking sons who love. He has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts and the answer of love in sonship is seen in the willing-hearted. "Let my son go, that he may serve me". How are we going to serve? This was the first great act of service -- the willing-hearted bring all the material for God's dwelling-place. We bring ourselves, we hold ourselves available, and all that we have for the dwelling-place of God. We are prepared to be governed by the pattern. It costs something to accept the truth of Romans, Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians. It means parting company with ourselves; it means judging our old man and having done with him. But it is well worth while: what great compensation even for us! For as we are prepared to fit together and form this habitation of God -- "a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them" -- we experience the blessedness of God dwelling among His people, here and now. God dwells with us in the most intimate conditions. We know the Father's love and glory, we know the love of the Christ which surpasseth knowledge, we know the love and service of the Spirit. How well worth while to provide conditions where the Spirit can be completely free, where the Lord Jesus has His place amongst us, and where the Father's love and glory shine upon us. Let them "make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them". But what lies
{272}
behind the whole matter is that God is love. It is God coming out to seek an answer, which only men as secured in the place of sonship can give. No other order of being could give God the response which He is seeking. It is amongst *men* that He would dwell, not waiting until the eternal state, but dwelling with us here in these mixed conditions, provided we are prepared to be governed by the pattern. May the Lord encourage our hearts in this.
I pass on now to @Psalm 132, where it says as to Zion, "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it" (verse 14). This psalm is typical of that which is wider in scope than God's present dwelling. It is something we can enter into now in our spirits, but it really takes in the full purpose of God, brought to pass typically under Solomon, when he said, "And now, arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place, thou and the ark of thy strength" (@2 Chronicles 6: 41). God is moving on to the fulfilment of His purpose. His Christ will bring all to pass -- He has been anointed to that end. The time is shortly coming when Jehovah and the Ark of His strength will be the centre of a universe of bliss. Every family secured from every dispensation will find their centre in God and the Ark of His strength -- every circle gathered round Him. And that is God's rest for ever. There He will dwell, for He has desired it. Nothing less was in His mind in coming out from the seclusion of His dwelling in unapproachable light, He had in mind, in purpose, a universe of bliss where every family would find its centre in Himself and the Ark of His strength. Then God's delight will be complete, His glory will be fully displayed, the purpose for which He has come out from the seclusion of unapproachable light will
{273}
be fully brought to pass. This is also the hope before our hearts, beloved brethren. We are assured of its all coming to pass, for all is established in Christ, and the Spirit is here that we might enter into it now in our spirits. If we are prepared, in our mixed conditions and outward feebleness down here, to provide tabernacle conditions according to Exodus, we shall, as we come together, prove the presence of God, and the Holy Spirit will lead us, in our spirits, into the realm of God's completed purpose. God calls the things that be not, as being; His completed purpose is present to Him, and the Spirit of God can make it present to us. And that is the purport of the apostle's prayer in @Ephesians 3, that God's completed purpose might be a present reality to the saints now, that they might be in it in power by the Spirit. You may say, 'How could it be?' The answer is, "But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all that we ask or think ... to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages" (@Ephesians 3: 20, 21). The praises that God is receiving depend, at the present time, on our being carried in our spirits, in the power of the Holy Spirit, into the present enjoyment of the full scope of the purpose of God, so that we arrive at finality with God. That was the idea, typically, in the feasts of old. The feast of tabernacles was the great climax, typifying the time when heaven and earth will be filled with families, the harvest of every dispensation gathered in. The feasts imply that we are to arrive at it *now*, not simply for our own satisfaction, but that God might get adequate praise. And He is able to do more than we ask or think. How feebly we yet understand what the presence of God means! If only we would make way for
{274}
Him, if only we would provide conditions for Him! God is love, and He wants to be with us and to let us know in full measure the love that is in His heart, and to draw out in full measure response from our hearts. If only we provided conditions for Him to be with us unreservedly, what unspeakable blessing we should enjoy in our spirits. He is able to do far exceedingly above all that we ask or think; He is able to make all great and strong.
I trust what I am saying will stimulate our hearts to go in for these things. We can never reach, in our spirits, the purpose of God in its completeness, if we are not prepared to face the exercise of providing the suitable dwelling conditions required down here; first individually, as being of a humble and contrite spirit; and then collectively in our localities, as set together body-wise and assembly-wise. We shall never touch the great abstract realities that subsist in the mind of God, unless there is a concrete answer to His mind down here, so that He can be with us in power. It is worth going in for, dear brethren. We have no idea yet, I am sure, of what we can be led into as we give God His place, so that God is really among us of a truth.
I pass on now to the final scripture in Revelation. "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them". I read this to bring home to us the unique place the assembly has in connection with God dwelling. While, in one sense, the whole universe of bliss becomes the dwelling-place of God, there is one vessel which is called "the tabernacle of God". There is one company who know His immediate presence. I believe it is called the tabernacle of God to stress the intimacy, the intimate affections, that are known inside. John has an
{275}
external view here; but his ministry in his gospel and elsewhere gives us an idea of what is inside, what the inner life of the tabernacle of God is. The unspeakable nearness in which the creature is to God, as forming part of His tabernacle. It is the most blissful place the creature will ever know. God Himself is there. You say, the God who dwells in unapproachable light? Yes, God Himself. Not *as* dwelling in unapproachable light; nevertheless God Himself is there. The Father is there; His love and glory fill the tabernacle. The Son is there; the glory of God shines in Him, the Father's love is expressed in Him, His love supports the whole system -- the love of the Christ. The Spirit is there, all-pervading, permeating inwardly, filling in completeness every soul, every mind, every heart. We cannot find words to express the nearness to God of those who form this tabernacle. They truly dwell in God, and God in them. We are to touch it in our spirits now as understanding John's ministry. God has come out from that secluded dwelling in unapproachable light that He might have a full answer, an answer in the whole universe, but, in a particular way, an answer in this vessel, which is called His tabernacle. In this God finds the satisfaction that He has sought; He dwells with men in the most intimate relations.
<blockquote>¬Twas Thy thought in revelation, <br>To present to men <br>Secrets of Thine own affections, <br>Theirs to win. (`118:4) </blockquote>
{276}
And that is what marks those who dwell in this tabernacle; they know the secrets of God's affections and their affections are won. They dwell in God through all eternity, and God dwells in them. Other families know His presence, because He is in this tabernacle, but they do not know it in the same direct way as those who form the tabernacle. What a marvellous thing that grace has called us to form part of this vessel, which is called, in its eternal setting, the tabernacle of God! Attention is drawn to it; a loud voice out of heaven says, "Behold!" evidently because it is a matter of the utmost importance. "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men". Marvellous thing! God has achieved His end in coming out! May the Lord help us with regard to it, for His name's sake.

{277}
THAT THEY MAY BE ONE
G R Cowell
@John 17: 4 - 6, 11 (last clause), 16 - 26.
I have in mind, dear brethren, to refer to the Lord's threefold request with regard to the unity of His own. First, "that they may be one as we", then, "that they also may be one in us", and then, "that they may be one, as we are one ... that they may be perfected into one".
It is important to keep in mind that the Lord is praying in view of His departure out of this world to the Father, that is, that these requests were to be fulfilled after He had departed out of this world to the Father. We are also told in chapter 13 that He came out from God, and was going to God. That wonderful mission was about to be completed; and it is touching, and most instructive, to take account of the Lord's requests at that time. What He requested was essential if the purpose of His mission, in coming out from God, and going to God, was to be achieved. That is, if the God from whom He came out, and to whom He has gone back, were to receive the responsive worship and praise which He came to secure.
We need to keep in mind the present position of the Lord Jesus. He is now with the Father. In @John 14: 1 He says, "ye believe on God, believe also on me". That has reference to the Lord's present position. He is now an object of faith to us as having departed out of this world to the Father. I feel, dear brethren, that we need help by the Spirit to grasp that, and to be maintained in faith in Christ
{278}
as and where He is. He speaks of glory in a threefold way. In verse 5 He says, "now glorify *me*, *thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". He does not speak of that glory as given; it is a glory which was ever His. In *that* glory He is reinstated; glorified along with the Father, with the glory which He had along with Him before the world was. I am not suggesting that we can behold that glory. But the Lord says this in the presence of His disciples, and it comes down to us to affect our souls, that the Lord Jesus is no longer in the scene of His humiliation. But, while retaining manhood, He is glorified along with the Father, with the glory which He had along with Him before the world was; emphasising, among other things, how important it is to have the *Deity* of Christ *ever* in our thoughts. Now, as I said, while retaining manhood, He is glorified along with the Father, with the glory which He had along with Him before the world was. Think of that glory! a glory, I suppose, that was there before any creature came into existence; and yet, perfect in the place and condition into which He had come, He requests to be thus glorified on the ground that His mission was completed. "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it". He had come out from God and had completed the work; He thus anticipates His death. We need to hold that in our souls. It is the present position of the Lord Jesus. But then, in verse 22, He speaks again of glory, "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them". There are glories given, given to Him as Man, which He shares with us. Then, in verse 24, there is a glory given which He calls "my glory"
{279}
-- "that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me" -- for which we are to be with Him in order to behold it, but which we are never said to share.
All this is to be in our minds as to the present time, as to where Jesus is, glorified along with the Father with the glory which He had along with Him before the world was; having also glory given to Him as Man which He shares with us, and having also glory given to Him which we are to behold but cannot share. Many glories are, I think, included in the expression "my glory" (verse 24). I believe it includes His glory as the Centre of the divine system. He is the Image of the invisible God; the Mediator of God and men; the effulgence of God's glory and the expression of His substance; and the One in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily. These are glories which we behold, but which none can share; they relate to what He is from God towards man. What a glorious Person He is! Then on the return side, on the line of the response from man Godward, He is Minister of the holy places. No one can share that glory. But how wonderful to be with Him where He is and thus, in the greatest nearness, to behold His glory -- so varied! How wonderful, too, that the assembly should so derive from Him as to be His fulness, "the fulness of him who fills all in all" (@Ephesians 1: 23). You say, it means that the assembly is the fulness of a Man. It does, indeed; nevertheless no one less than God can fill all in all. That Man is the One in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.
If we understand that the assembly is His fulness, it will give us an incentive to take account of the unities to which I have referred. I believe, in this connection, the
{280}
Spirit of God would encourage us to find our resource in spiritual matters in the Father, more than we have done. In chapter 14 the Lord first brings Himself very definitely before us as the Object. "Ye believe on God, believe also on me;" "I am the way, and the truth, and the life". Then in chapter 16 He brings the Spirit before us in His activities in glorifying Him. But then He brings the Father before us, and He says, "whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you" (verse 23), referring to the spiritual realm of things. The Father delights to bestow wealth upon the saints, if they are ready for it. Prayers of this kind are on the level of the apostle's prayer in @Ephesians 3. Do we often hear such prayers? If we do not ask, we shall get nothing; if we ask we shall get exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think.
So the Lord asks -- not that our asking can be on the level of His. The word translated "demand" in this chapter, as the note (*a*) in chapter 14 indicates, is a familiar request on the part of an equal. The Lord was speaking thus to His Father. The word used as to our asking, is the word which we would normally speak of as prayer. Nevertheless, the Lord is surely giving a lead in asking; and, before making these specific requests as to unity, we get an indication of the Lord's outlook on the saints. I do not think we can pray on the high level unless we have a right outlook on the saints. So far as the Lord's words in this chapter are concerned, we would not know that those for whom He was praying had had any sinful history, or sinful origin. Why could the Lord speak of them, and regard them abstractly, in this way -- as apart from what they were as after the flesh? The basis for it is set out in verse 4: "I have
{281}
glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it". Within a few hours of uttering this prayer the Lord was crowned with thorns, robed with a purple robe, scourged, crucified. He was hanged upon a cross; they pierced His hands and His feet, a soldier with a spear pierced His side and forthwith came thereout blood and water. That is involved in this expression, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it". What it cost the Lord, dear brethren, that He might have the right to look upon the saints according to Divine purpose, apart from their sinful history altogether, and give us the right to do it! What a real thing it is that Jesus ended His path of testimony here upon the cross for us! Oh, the reality of it! It should touch our hearts and teach us to have a right outlook on the brethren.
He says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine" (verse 6). That was their origin, they belonged to the Father, and He gave them to the Son. Later He says, "they are thine" (verse 9). That is because His work is regarded as completed. "They were thine" in purpose; "they are thine" because His work is done, redemption is accomplished. This is the only gospel which mentions the blood and the water. He says, "they are thine, and all that is mine is thine, and all that is thine mine". Think of the community of ownership of the Father and the Son -- no separate property! "All that is mine is thine, and all that is thine mine". The Father delights to hear the saints spoken of like this, because they belong to Him; they were His and He gave them to the Son, and they *are* His. It is with this
{282}
outlook on the saints that we can pray aright for them, and unless we carry all the saints in our affections we shall never arrive at divine thoughts. "That ye may be fully able to apprehend *with all the saints* ..." (@Ephesians 3: 18). Do not think, dear brethren, that, if we leave the saints out of our thoughts and prayers, we shall apprehend the thoughts of God. We have to carry them along with us in our affections, "with all the saints". What an example the Lord is to us thus!
So He goes on to His specific requests, and the first is, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we". This, of course, especially relates to the twelve. There were eleven only here; but the number was made up by one who had assembled with them all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them. How wonderful these pronouns are -- "one as we", "one in us". I believe the first relates to *unity in the Divine nature*, seen in all its perfection in the Father and the Son. But we have been made partakers of the divine nature, as Peter says; we are born of God. In chapter 1 the writer speaks of those who have the right to be called children of God -- those who were born of God. So the word is, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me". It is a question of being kept in the name of the Holy Father, so that *we are true to our family status*. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God" (@1 John 3: 1). That word 'children' is not diminutive; however much we grow in spiritual stature we are still *children of God*. It is a dignified term, and it implies that we *partake of the divine nature*, and it has in
{283}
view testimony; and, applying to the twelve, what a remarkable thing it was! This dispensation has been founded by twelve men, in whom this prayer was answered. They were "one as we". None of them had a selfish end in view; none of them drew disciples after themselves. The number 'twelve' goes down through Scripture as representing unity in administration, and *testimony in the oneness of the divine nature*. Those twelve men had seen the way the Father and the Son moved in testimony; so that, having received the Spirit, and looking back, John could say, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth" (@John 1: 14). He also refers to the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father. What oneness they took account of, and how they appreciated what they had seen! "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ" (@1 John 1: 3). I believe *the basic idea of oneness lies in the Divine nature. The christian has not two natures*. We have the flesh in us, but we need to regard it as a foreign element, for we have been made partakers of the divine nature and we need to identify ourselves with that. We have been born of God, we are children of God. Let us seek grace to be kept in the name of the Holy Father, that is, in the consciousness of our true family status, so that our activities may *flow* from the divine nature, and that we may be one in all administrative matters. How we can thank God that this dispensation was founded through the instrumentality of twelve men who were free from every selfish motive, one in the divine nature in what they did; so that their names appear in the foundation of the heavenly city. What we owe to them!
{284}
Alas, how many who came after have led away disciples after themselves; and how this can happen even in our localities! But, if kept in the name of the Holy Father, divine love will be our only motive, and thus there will be unity in administration, in the oneness that love affords.
As regards the second unity, the Lord says, "I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word; that they may be all one". The first applies to us by extension, for we all have to take up administrative matters; but this *specifically* brings us in. "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us". The basis of this unity lies in the gift of the Spirit. The three unities run on together, and I do not wish to separate them, but the Lord distinguishes them. This request has been answered. Whatever may be the outward state of things, it is still true that there is one body and one Spirit. Thank God, we have been brought back to the light of the one body, and we are being more and more helped as to the one Spirit, with a view to keeping the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. For that purpose we need all lowliness, meekness and long-suffering, forbearing one another in love. Are these features present in our localities? Are we using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace?
The unity of the Spirit exists, for "there *is* one body and one Spirit" (@Ephesians 4: 4). We are to *keep* it. The compensation for keeping it is immense, because the Lord goes on to say, "as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee" -- what a vista of affection opens up! "that they also may be *one in us*". Can you think of anything more blessed than
{285}
that? Oneness must precede the blessed consciousness of being "in us" -- "that they also may be *one* in us". "As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee". What close affections, what intimacy! and now we are to be brought into the most intimate relations with the Son and the Father, "that they also may be one in us". How marvellous these pronouns, "we" and "us" are, involving equality of the Persons, though distinction of relationship and activity. "One in us" -- could anything be more blessed to the creature than this? But we cannot know our place of blessing and privilege in the Son, and in the Father, *unless we are one*. We cannot circumvent this matter. If we are out at elbows with our brethren, not keeping the unity of the Spirit, we forfeit the blessing. "That they also may be one in us". I do not know whether we have taken enough account, dear brethren, of the "us". It indicates that the Son never ceases to be an Object. Even when the Father is the main Object, the Son has an objective place; He is never lost sight of amongst the brethren. We are apt to lose sight of Him in certain phases of the service. The Lord says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me;" and also, "ye see me; because I live ye also shall live" (@John 14: 6, 19). I believe that once the Lord has come to us, and we see Him, we should keep our eyes upon Him right through the service. Even when the Father, as He should be, is the Object of our worship and praise, the Son is still an Object, although we are not addressing Him; "that they also may be one in us". "I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" (@John 14: 20). In @1 John 2: 24 it says, "*ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father" -- that is the way of it. How wonderful this
{286}
blessing is, and think of the testimony which flows out! If the saints are in the good of this, surely, in some little way, there will be fresh experiences of the world being turned upside down! "That the world may believe that thou hast sent me". It is from this unity that testimony, in the true sense, flows. If we know what it is to be "one in us", as the Lord says, how can there be other than a ceaseless flow of praise, and a powerful testimony flowing out to men from the very joy that is our portion! Can you conceive of joy like this, that we should be one in the Son and in the Father? All this flows from the gift of the Spirit. The Lord had said, in view of the Comforter coming, "It is profitable for you that I go away" (@John 16: 7). It is because of the presence of the Spirit, that we are one, and not only one, but one in the Son and in the Father; and thus we know *God* in a practical and experimental way. We know Him as being ourselves one in the Son and in the Father, by the power of the Holy Spirit. The whole Godhead is involved in the matter. It is thus we know God, and it is this God whom we worship. As we experience being one in the Son and in the Father in the power of the Spirit, we can say, "this is that God"! From eternity and to eternity He is God; and now that He is declared, it is our privilege to dwell in Him and He in us.
But then the Lord goes on to speak of a third aspect of unity. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one" (verse 22). We are coming now to glory. The fulness of this is future, but it is to be known at the present time. "Whom he has justified, these also he has glorified" (@Romans 8: 30). This, again, is the result of the Spirit given, but it is the glorious side of
{287}
the matter. The Spirit is the Spirit of sonship, and I believe it is not only the glory of sonship, but that we enter in our spirits into the glory conferred upon us *assemblywise* as His wife, His counter-part; the glory that we share with Him as a *result of union*. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them". We are coming into a setting of glory, and glory is unifying in a most practical way. "*We* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit" (@2 Corinthians 3: 18). So the unity, or oneness, here brings in the idea of the vessel, the assembly. The word is not used, but the substance is here, for the Lord goes on to say, "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one; *I in them and thou in me*". Now you come to *the Divine abode*. "One in us" is our abode. "*Thou* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations" (@Psalm 90: 1). But what about the Divine abode, what about a place for God? Where is that? In the assembly. "I in them and thou in me". The Son in the saints, and the Father in the Son -- or, to use the Old Testament language, "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength" (@Psalm 132: 8). The ark enshrined -- "I in them" -- but where the ark is, God is. "I in them and thou in me". That is, *the assembly is the Divine abode*. The Spirit is already there. It is by the Spirit that the assembly is formed, and now the Son is there and the Father is there -- God is there, the fulness of God. This involves being filled to all the fulness of God. "I in them and thou in me" -- what fulness! The Spirit filling the vessel, and the presence of the Son and the Father known. "I in them and thou in me".
{288}
Then the Lord goes on to what is distinctively future: "that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me". How it will be proved to the world that we are loved even as Christ is loved! Because the assembly will be seen publicly as the dwelling-place of God. Persons dwell where their affections rest. The assembly is the Divine abode and, so far as I know, no other vessel is. God dwelt in the midst of Israel, in that which was a figure of the assembly, but the assembly is the Divine abode. How could God come and dwell with us if we were not loved even as Christ is loved? And the world will know it, and what glory will shine out of the vessel in that day as we are perfected into one! "I in them and thou in me". What a glorious display in that coming day, "I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me"!
All this is leading up to the Lord's final request, "Father, as to those whom thou has given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me". Dear brethren, unless these three aspects of oneness are known practically amongst us, we shall never know in our spirits what it is to be with Jesus where He is. As I said before, we cannot circumvent this matter. If we allow the flesh in our relations with one another, we forfeit all this blessedness. Let us be more on our knees in prayer as to oneness, that we may be preserved in oneness in the divine nature: in oneness in the unity of the Spirit, in the Father and the Son; and in oneness assemblywise in such a manner as to experience, "I in them and thou in me". If this oneness is
{289}
brought to pass we shall, with clear undimmed vision, behold His glory which the Father has given Him. We shall see Him as the One in whom the Father's glory shines, and see Him as the image of the invisible God, the effulgence of God's glory and the expression of His substance. Our blessing depends upon our having a clear vision of that glorious Person. Mr. Darby's hymns stress it --
<blockquote>There Christ, the centre of the throng, <br>Shall in His glory shine, <br>(that is not the glory He shares with us) <br>But not an eye those hosts among <br>But sees His glory Thine. (`178:4)</blockquote>
We behold His glory, and in beholding His glory that is given to Him, as the Centre and Light-bearer of the whole scene, we behold the glory of the Father, we behold the effulgence of the glory of God. We see, as far as the creature can, the expression of God's substance; and in the light of all that, what can we do but worship! It is a wonderful thing, dear brethren, if this prayer in any way finds a practical answer in us, and if it is to do so let us bow our knees to the Father. That is the way it will be brought to pass. It is a remarkable thing that the greatest truths have come out in the way of prayer: @John 17 and @Ephesians 3 contain *the greatest truths*. This indicates, no doubt, that our entry into these things practically must stand related to prayer. If we know more of what it is to bow our knees in prayer, and also pray on this line in our prayer-meetings, we can expect marvellous surprises (if I may put it that way) in the morning meeting -- marvellous
{290}
disclosures of glory through the bringing to pass of the oneness, in a practical way, of which we are speaking.
May the Lord help us to carry in our spirits in prayer that which, in this last hour of His life here, the Lord was carrying in His Spirit -- for His name's sake!
*Croydon, June 1955*.
{291}
FAITHFULNESS TO GOD AND HIS THRONE (1)
P Lyon
@Esther 1: 1 - 22; @Esther 2: 1 - 23
P.L. We are reminded by Paul that "every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (@2 Timothy 3: 16); further, that "these things … have been written for our admonition" (@1 Corinthians 10: 11). Thus the object of our looking into this portion of the Scriptures is to enquire as to what we may cull, in spiritual understanding, from a book in which things are divinely veiled. God's name is not even mentioned, but it is a book which must have a moral and spiritual bearing upon divine operations, leading on to the opening up of the truth, as we shall hope to see later in relation to the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
Esther's name means 'star', and she moves in her orbit as a light set in the heavenly firmament, whereas Vashti is as a wandering star, as exercising her own will. Seeing that the Spirit of God is not engaged with the record of heathen festivals, this great feast of king Ahasuerus must have a present, moral bearing. As God is pleased to acquaint us with the details of all this feasting, this first chapter might furnish a typical setting forth of His majesty as the King supreme, somewhat in the sense of the doxology to the King of the ages in @1 Timothy 1: 17. Then in 2 Timothy we are in the presence of public failure in the assembly, which may be prefigured by the insubjection of
{292}
Vashti, involving the surrender of the light of the assembly's part and place in the counsels of God as the divinely destined consort of Christ in the coming age of glory, according to @Ephesians 1: 21, 22, and the testimony proper to this. Through her insubjection, Vashti introduces a discordant note into this festal scene, and the majesty of the throne requires her removal from her royal estate. This is judicially depicted for us as to the professing church in the book of Revelation. The inviolability of the throne is thus established in the presence of all that has arisen in defiance of it.
What then is the divine answer in our day to such a challenge? How stimulating it is to faith to consider that in a broken day such as the second epistle to Timothy portrays, the stability of divine purpose is presented -- a great stay to heartbroken, assembly-men like Paul and Timothy. We read in @2 Timothy 1: 9 - 11, "God; who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time, but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings, to which *I* have been appointed a herald and apostle and teacher of the nations". This makes clear that God has no intention of giving up a testimony to the glory set forth typically in the book of Esther. While that book bears dispensationally on the suffering history of the remnant just prior to the coming age of millennial display, one is concerned about its moral bearing upon us. It must have a voice from the Lord for us in our day. We are
{293}
favoured to have our part in the great assembly revival of these last days, and features of moral worth proper to it are prophetically set out in Mordecai and Esther. The designation "the Jew", so frequently applied by the Holy Spirit to Mordecai, is suggestive of genuineness, as in the expression, "a Jew who is so inwardly" found in @Romans 2: 29. Further in Mordecai's relations with his orphaned cousin, parental care shines, a precious feature marking assembly recovery, and one which is to be continually maintained in all our gatherings. He is also characterised by unswerving defence of the throne, and this, as well as the other features mentioned, may be traced in 2 Timothy. We see, too, the place given to the Holy Spirit as typified by Hegai, to whom, as keeper of the women, Esther was confided. Our concern is surely, that all these features which have entered into the recovery shall be maintained in freshness and power to the end.
J.P. The word, "Vashti refused to come" gives us an insight as to the character of that which has departed from the truth.
P.L. Yes, it was an affront to the throne, and introduced into this vast kingdom an element of lawless-ness which would, if unchecked, finally disintegrate all. Memucan, one of the seven counsellors, suggestive of Paul, pointed out that the issue at stake extended far beyond the immediate matter on hand; chapter 1: 16 - 20.
J.P. So the setting aside of Paul, which is all around us today, is a most serious matter.
P.L. Yes; Paul writes, "All who are in Asia … have turned away from me" (@2 Timothy 1: 15). As feeling that, the question for us is, can we now furnish the antidote, and in
{294}
spiritual power?
K.A.W. Would @Esther 1: 6 suggest the right state and conditions necessary for the king's satisfaction? I was linking it in my mind with @2 Timothy 2: 19 - 22.
P.L. The white hangings may, in this sense, typify the purity of those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart. That is how we find a way back into the light in which the Ephesian assembly was set up. At the end of the Ephesian epistle Paul salutes all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Then the green curtains speak of freshness in life here, as responding to the rain and the sun, while the blue would bear on heavenly light, according to the suggestion that we get in @Exodus 24: 10. Further, the couches suggest conditions of rest -- a great matter when moral questions have been resolved, whether bearing on the universal, or the local position. The pavement represents the sure ground on which our feet can travel, and God's feet can rest. But in this setting the pavement is not of sapphire, as in @Exodus 24: 10, but of red and white marble, and alabaster, and black marble, indicating that moral questions are not left in the indefinite hues of uncertainty. But everything is reduced to a divine issue in clarity, so that all can be named in its own outstanding colour, furnishing its distinctive glory to God.
L.B.G. The stability of the throne occupied by Ahasuerus would remind us that "the firm foundation of God stands" (@2 Timothy 2: 19)?
P.L. Yes, that is, God is going on with His testimony for the satisfaction of His love; that is the way it affects us now. In chapter 6 Mordecai is brought forth in testimony, as we might say, and taken round the city as the man
{295}
whom the king delights to honour. In chapters 8, 9 and 10 he is set up in public glory in relation to the throne, the last chapter particularly bearing on a coming day. The Holy Spirit in 2 Timothy makes much of the testimony of our Lord, as our rallying point in days of difficulty, and also of moral and spiritual qualities essential to our continuance therein. The ground is thus being held testimonially in view of the day when Christ will come forth in public glory.
R.H.P. Is not Esther coming forward in ability to rule? I understand that the word for queen here is not that for the wife of a king, but the word for a female ruler.
P.L. Exactly; so that wifely relations with the king are not pronounced in the book of Esther. It does not give us the Ephesian view of union with Christ. Ahasuerus, a heathen potentate, is abstractly used by the Spirit to set out the idea of the majesty of God's throne, but not as a type of Christ in relation to union, according to @Ephesians 5: 31, 32. We do, however, get a suggestion of the assembly's place in glory according to @Ephesians 1: 22, 23, when she will be manifested as Christ's consort, and the truth of union must underlie this in regard to Christ and the assembly.
J.P. You have in mind that what comes before us in @Esther 1 bears on the end of @Ephesians 1, and not on @Ephesians 5.
P.L. Quite so. Further, this scene being set in Shushan, it is evident that the service of God is not pronouncedly in view. The book of Esther bears on the testimony here, as seen in the epistles to the Corinthians, and those to Timothy.
{296}
H.J.M. In the first eight verses of @Esther 1, is there anything akin to @1 Corinthians 1: 4 - 9, where Paul addresses the Corinthians in relation to the glory of the fellowship -- "the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" -- before any moral questions are raised?
P.L. Yes, in the sense of the Ephesian outlook of the writer of the epistle. It is in the light of the stability of divine purpose in Ephesians, that he can greet the Corinthians thus, in measure abstractly, but with some warrant to do so by the presence of "the approved" (@1 Corinthians 11: 19), Chloe, Stephanas and others, who furnished concretely moral and spiritual features of assembly character.
H.J.M. I wondered if the "mother of pearl" (see note *a* to verse 6) would in those conditions suggest certain assembly elements.
P.L. Yes, Matthew-wise. Luke, in emphasising the feminine element in his writings, would give us the grace of the hangings in their refinement, beauty and diversity, which the assembly will furnish in the coming age, and did at Ephesus, and should do so in character amongst those available for it now. There is a flexibility in curtains, reminding us of the flaxen measuring line used by the man in Ezekiel. Whereas the thought of stability attaches to the pavement, "the firm foundation of God stands", where our feet can tread firmly in relation to what has been worked out at the cross. As to what the pavement represents, we are governed by "the Lord's commandment" in Paul's authoritative teaching, as we have it in @1 Corinthians 14: 37. It is also suggested in @Ezekiel 43: 12, "the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round
{297}
about is most holy", but the curtains suggest rather the thought of adornment and refinement which Paul seeks to promote in 2 Corinthians.
C.P.H. May we come into this grace, as subject in our spirits? "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2: 7).
P.L. Yes, indeed. We must notice the sevens, representing the Spirit's power undiminished: "seven days", "seven chamberlains", seven wise men, "princes of Persia and Media", and later "the seven maidens" (chapter 2: 9). We do not find in this book the numeral eight, which would link with what is eternal in character. "Seven" bears on what is complete here in divine ways and operations in the Spirit, and looks on dispensationally to the millennial day.
R.H.P. Are you thinking of "the seven Spirits which are before his throne" (@Revelation 1: 4)?
P.L. Yes, all this fits into Revelation and these "sevens" suggest a system in the Spirit, operative to secure the pleasure and will of the throne, in days when that throne has been assailed by the very vessel set up here responsibly and testimonially to defend it.
L.F. Why is there the magnificent display of one hundred and eighty days? Is it in contrast to the seven days?
P.L. We might liken the feast of the one hundred and eighty days to the anticipation of the thousand years of display; but the seven days¬ feast seems to be the climax. The Spirit speaks of days, because He is speaking to us as to sustained sequence and continuance, in a cumulative way. We have the thought of days in the book of Daniel. It
{298}
is a precious thought to faith, for faith's history is linked up with days.
J.G.H. In @Psalm 45: 9 we read, "Upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir".
P.L. Yes, and in that psalm there is reference later to the inner apartments, but we do not have the latter thought in @Esther 1, where the prominent idea is that the king has as his consort the queen, and she is reigning with him as in @Psalm 45: 9. The idea is also seen in @Nehemiah 2: 6: "The queen also sitting by him". We must bear in mind that this book comes in between the original exodus from Babylon, recorded at the beginning of the book of Ezra, and Ezra's coming up with others out of Babylon (@Ezra 7). This latter movement takes on a fuller character, and leads to the opening up of Ezra's richest ministry, as we have it in @Nehemiah 8. It is important to see where this book stands historically. There had been a return to Jerusalem, and building had commenced, but the people had been discouraged. But God had come in for them through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, and then through the reigning king, Darius, who was the father of this Ahasuerus of the book of Esther. We must have the maintenance of conditions, such as are brought about through the devotion of Mordecai and Esther in this book, to make way for the revival of the truth under Ezra's ministry, and all that makes room for it in the exercises and activities of Nehemiah.
J.P. I was struck with the suddenness with which Mordecai and Esther are brought to light according to chapter 2: 5 - 7.
P.L. Yes, the suddenness bearing on divine
{299}
sovereignty, as in the case of Elijah, who appears without any previous recorded history; @1 Kings 17: 1. The assembly revival of the past one hundred and fifty years has been entirely a matter of divine intervention. As having distinctively Christ and the assembly in mind, it is not merely the extension of any recovery which had previously taken place from Luther onwards, much as we thank God for this. But it takes on all the features of heavenly light, and looks on to the coming glory of the holy city, to the manifestation in display of all that is now being maintained in testimony here. By way of analogy we might almost say that the Lord saw Esther in the disciples anticipatively -- that is, the assembly in the ways of God. Like the true Mordecai, He took over His own, so soon to be orphaned, and said to them, "I will not leave you orphans" (@John 14: 18). He threw, as it were, His wings over them, and called them "Children" (@John 13: 33). Does not that set forth the parental care seen in figure in Mordecai?
L.F. Does the recovery to the full glory of the Ephesian position come by way of faithfulness in the public position?
P.L. That is the point, 2 Timothy opening the door to the full assembly position as set forth in Paul's ministry, from the foundation in 1 Corinthians, Jesus Christ, to the great Ephesian top-stone.
L.B.G. Would this, taking place historically, just when it does, stimulate persons to make a move to Jerusalem from these captive conditions, as in the case of those who went up with Ezra, and later with Nehemiah?
P.L. Surely, all the exercises set out in this book
{300}
would but stimulate a fresh and spiritual movement up to Jerusalem, such as Ezra led. According to the setting of the book of Esther, there is no question but that in his plot Haman had the objective of destroying all the saints whose hearts were exercised in regard of Jerusalem, as well as all the Jews scattered everywhere through the empire. Of course, Satan's objective in seeking to destroy all the Jews was, as in Herod's day (@Matthew 2) to destroy Christ as coming according to prophecy (@Micah 5), where it is clear that the Lord was to be born in Bethlehem. God's thought in the return from captivity was the preparation of a people to receive Christ. Now all these adverse movements that affect the saints in a general way, bear supremely on the assembly as the object of satanic hatred, as here in the place of Christ, to perpetuate Him in testimony.
L.F. Would not the consideration of this book stimulate us to be constantly on the alert as to what God is doing at any given time? The fact that the name of God is not mentioned in the book reminds one of Mr. Darby's saying that God ways are behind the scenes; but He moves all the scenes which He is behind. ¦
P.L. Surely. There is a seemliness and a timeliness about faith's actions in this book, which confuses faith's foes. God has His people according to His own time, we may say reverently. "There is … a time to every purpose" says Solomon (@Ecclesiastes 3: 1).
W.B.H. In pointing out that the book of Esther comes in between the early part of the book of Ezra, and Ezra's going up to Jerusalem have you in mind that what we have
¦ J.N.D., *Synopsis*, Volume 5, page 374
{301}
in the book of Esther brings before us a collateral line, rather than an historically sequential one?
P.L. Yes, and while it is a collateral line, there is also an historical sequence. The Napoleonic movement, which was aimed at the domination of Europe and its outgoings, may be viewed as an attempt on the part of the enemy to forestall in violence the universal operations of the Spirit in this era of great assembly revival.
C.P.H. Would you say more as to the gospels in connection with these books?
P.L. Atmospherically we find something akin to John's gospel in these early chapters, the books of Revelation, and 1 and 2 Timothy having also some bearing in relation to them. The book of Esther, culminating in the exaltation of Mordecai, looks on to the coming age when the assembly as the heavenly city will serve to make Christ glorious, as Esther uses her queenly influence to promote the greatness of Mordecai. There are in the post-captivity books three great lines in the recovery. There is what is administrative, bearing on Matthew's gospel as seen largely in the book of Nehemiah. Then there is the prophetic line in Zechariah and Haggai, who encouraged the builders to go on with their work, which we might link up with the prophetic word as seen in Mark's gospel. There is also the priestly Ezra, whom we might connect with Luke's line of spiritual teaching. John has been called the backbone of Scripture, especially of the gospels. We have spiritual features in the book of Esther, which might correspond with John. We see how Mordecai took on, parentally, his cousin, as the Lord in such perfection acted towards His disciples as seen in @John 13: 33 - 35. There is
{302}
what we might call a 'John' background in the book of Esther to those post-captivity books, which we have linked with the three synoptic gospels.
W.B.H. In the book of Revelation, as in Esther, is not the central issue the throne, continuing right through to the eternal state in chapter 21?
P .L. Yes, and the divine rights are fully secured in an evil day. John's ministry brings us back to Paul's. We need the Esther features to bring us back into the operative setting of Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra and Nehemiah.
D.C.W. What is the moral bearing on us now in localities of Vashti's action, and the king making this decree, after conferring with his wise men who knew law and judgment, and then the edict going out through his realm and extending to households?
P.L. It bears on the headship of God as we have it in @1 Corinthians 11, where we have also the token, and other features of subjection in the woman -- the man, of course, holding Christ as Head, but Christ securing all for God in headship. So it is important to see that Memucan, typical of Paul, saw the bearing of all this. Insubjection in womanhood (commencing with the fall, where all was thrown into dislocation) becomes a menace of the enemy to the assembly. So Paul commences the first epistle to the Corinthians by mentioning a subject sister, Chloe, and her household. We might say that Memucan has light from God. He is the last mentioned of the seven counsellors; and he has the word to meet the situation. Paul comes in last after the twelve. They do not give us the Corinthian position in relation to the defence of the throne testimonially. It is Paul who brings forward the divine
{303}
rights vested in the Lord in the time of His absence and maintained here by the blessed Spirit in subject persons and companies. And then as you point out, the matter extends now to the households, for that is the sphere where Satan is, indirectly, constantly attacking the assembly. While there is to be subjection there, on the part of the wife to the husband, and of the children to the parents, the head of the house is to rule according to the language of his people. His rule is to be intelligent and intelligible, sympathetic and loving. He speaks to God in his own house, and to his wife and family he speaks of God. What a support that affords in localities to the assembly! What bastions of military defence are households divinely regulated!
D.C.W. In view of the lawless act of the queen getting abroad, the edict is to have its searching effect in every home. Is what is basic to assembly life in a locality to be secured on this line?
P.L. Yes; the very emphasis in ministry on the token in @1 Corinthians 11 -- though a symbol -- and the tests in regard to it, indicate the urgency of this primary matter of subjection, Christ Himself coming into the matter. Indeed, as @1 Corinthians 15 shows, He will be subject for ever as Man, but in chapter 11, the order is God, Christ, the man, the woman -- wonderful links in the divine chain.
H.J.M. Would we see it positively in Esther in chapter 2: 20 -- and in the mention of the seven chamberlains who served in the presence of king Ahasuerus, and then these seven counsellors who saw the king's face?
P.L. Yes, the seven chamberlains would suggest authority from the throne acting under commission in
{304}
regard of divine rights, as asserted in Paul's epistles to Corinth. While the seven counsellors who see his face might represent rather the Ephesian setting.
H.J.M. One was thinking of Paul's gospel, and the great matter of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and then the unsearchable riches of the Christ. When a crisis is to be met, it is not met merely by persons who know things by rote and in the letter of the ministry, but by those who are near to the king, and who see the king's face.
P.L. Yes, the seven chamberlains who serve in the presence of the king represent the ministry as presented in apostolic power in relation to the assertion of divine rights. Paul has others with him in it, but it is Pauline ministry. And then there are the seven counsellors who are in the confidence of the king, and who do not need to ask to see him, because they have such liberty with him. That seems to connect with @2 Corinthians 3: 18, "*We* all, looking on the glory of the Lord ... are transformed according to the same image". While that is not in Ephesians, still the Ephesian line lies behind it, so that the Corinthian testimonial position is filled out and adorned with Ephesian grace and glory.
R.C.R. Would the great lack in the profession around be traceable to this matter of insubjection? Subjection is to mark us, first of all in relation to God, then to Christ and the assembly, and also to parents?
P.L. Exactly. The refusal of queen Vashti really meant that she flouted the seven chamberlains, because she was rebellious to the throne. We get that sometimes amongst us, alas! Assembly judgments are opposed in rebellion
{305}
because the heart is rebellious against God Himself.
J.P. Sometimes in localities, things settled long ago are brought up again by one or two who persist in bringing them forward, and making them the subject of household conversation, perpetuating something which God has settled long ago.
P.L. As if what the Supreme Court, so to speak, has settled is to be reviewed, in the assumption in self-esteem to have the faculty of reinvestigating the whole matter. Vashti, no doubt, would have a great many excuses, but rank rebellion is what she represents. The test discovered that all her fairness and beauty was not being made to contribute to the king's glory, but to her own in a self-centred way. The Corinthians had great gifts put upon them in the Spirit, but they used that glory to establish a circle round themselves, at the expense of God, of Christ and of the Spirit. God had made the Corinthian saints great in the provision of heaven's bounty, to the one end that they might make Him great in testimony. In Vashti's case the test arose, and no doubt laid bare a long history of insubjection. She failed the king in relation to the object for which he had taken her up, the display of his own glory. If the gospel of the glory has reached us, it is that we might be really glorious in that system of glory which centres round God Himself.
Ques. What is the importance of this account in chapter 2 of the custody of Hegai? Can we view Hegai as typical of the Spirit?
P.L. Yes, there is no one else in charge of the matter. The Spirit's glorious mission is now coming into view. What an increasing place He has had in the revival down
{306}
to this day! Mr. Darby called attention early to what was due to Him in writing his tract 'The Notion of a Clergyman, Dispensationally the Sin against the Holy Ghost', exposing this sorrowful matter, which has marked christendom in resorting to the clerical element, since the second century. The moment the line of recovery is taken, Hegai comes into view. He stands related to what is subjective. He has the custody of the women. What a mission the blessed Spirit possesses! Right through this book emphasis is laid on inwardness, for which Esther stands pre-eminently; and Mordecai, while later rising to a type of Christ, up to chapter 6 represents the Spirit of Christ.
L.F. Esther required nothing but what Hegai appointed.
P.L. What better! @1 Corinthians 2 touches on what has been put into the hands of the Spirit, but that chapter begins with the cross, involving the removal of Vashti and all she stands for, forever from God's eye, according to the rights of the throne. But our concern is to see that she is kept out by the moral features of Christ in the saints -- a constant assembly battle.
Ques. The genealogy of Mordecai the Jew, shows that he was a Benjaminite.
P.L. Yes, Kish was evidently a man carried away in the captivity in relation to Jeconiah (that is Jehoiachin). He was therefore of the basket of good figs (@Jeremiah 24: 1 - 10) representing those who heeded the prophetic word through Jeremiah, that they should not go to Egypt, but accept the government of God. Jeconiah was thirty years in prison and then the king of Babylon lifted up his head and set him
{307}
at his table. It all bears upon the respect by the authorities for the saints, as humbly accepting the public breakdown of the assembly, and its governmental consequences. Jeconiah's captivity is morally distinct from that of Zedekiah who broke the bond with Nebuchadnezzar and refused Jeremiah's ministry -- a terrible thing. The expression "carried away" implies submission. It is for us humbly to bow to the shame of the public position and own our part in it, for we cannot leave the "great house" (@2 Timothy 2: 20). The matter is set out precisely here, as to Mordecai's link with Jeconiah's captivity, for to lose the sense of shame of the public position is to lose the sense of the Spirit's part in this glorious assembly revival.
{308}
{309}
FAITHFULNESS TO GOD AND HIS THRONE (2)
P Lyon
@Esther 3: 1 - 15; @Esther 4: 1 - 17
P.L. In our first reading, time did not allow us to complete the consideration of the first two chapters. It will therefore be necessary, before touching upon chapters 3 and 4, to review the challenge to the majesty of the throne which was presented in Vashti's insubjection, and the wisdom in which it was immediately met by the proposal to remove her, and give her royal estate to another, better than she. Further, we should take full account of the parental care of Mordecai and the ministrations of Hegai, so that we may understand how Esther is qualified to fill that position. As we proceed, we may be helped to see that her promotion is in view of her exercising her queenly influence to meet two distinct characters of the enemy's attack upon the throne, the one aggressively bold, and quickly overthrown, and the other insidiously corrupting in its malign influence. The former relating to the end of chapter 2, and the latter, embodied in Haman, being found in the chapters that follow.
All this gives us to see the importance of making full way amongst us, on the one hand, for the Spirit's formative work in the sphere under His hand, as typified in Hegai's custody of the women, and, on the other, for the vigilant parental care set out in Mordecai. This is so fully exemplified in Paul at Ephesus, as rehearsed by him in @Acts 20 in addressing the Ephesian elders. This is a daily
{310}
matter in love's toil, all to the end that assembly features should be promoted amongst the saints, that will result in their being able to move together unitedly, in Esther character, in the defence of the throne. The spirit of Christ, coming into expression in such persons as Mordecai represents, in his constancy and care, is always in concert with the present speaking of the Holy Spirit in His ministry to promote with us, as of the assembly, the queenly features and influence as set forth in Esther. The reference to her seven maids, and to "the best place of the house of the women", emphasises femininity as developed in the Spirit's power, and in the tenderness of His overtures. Ministerial power and skill also enter into the matter, as for instance, in @2 Corinthians 11: 2, where Paul writes, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".
We know the issue of all this love and care. Esther has the royal crown set upon her head, and the king makes a great feast, Esther's feast; but as soon as she is elevated to the throne, she is called into service. It was "in those days" that the rebellion broke out on the part of the two chamberlains (chapter 2: 21). As every fresh ray of heavenly light as to the assembly takes substantial form in the saints (which is God's blest answer to the Vashti element of insubjection to the throne) Satan is incited to a fresh attack. We have in verse 20 a further reference to Mordecai's relations with Esther. How parental they had been, and Esther appreciates them still; she does what he tells her "like as when she was brought up with him". Now they are to the end that her queenly influence should be cast rightly into the scales in an issue that sought to
{311}
overthrow the throne in a violent attack. We are not now to view the throne as in chapter 1 (where it comes before us abstractly, in the light of divine purpose) nor as in the end of the book, where the throne is viewed millennially, with Mordecai in great power. Esther there is supporting him and Ahasuerus resting complacently in it all. But in the section of the book which we are now considering, we have what is morally greater than any glory of the coming age. We have a portrayal of the subjective work of God in the saints assembly-wise that recognises, in the current testimonial sphere, the divine rights vested in the throne, and holds true to them, even when the public representation of the authority of the throne sways, as coming under a darkening influence. The glory of the coming age will pass, while what Esther typifies here -- spiritual formation in the saints of the assembly -- will outlive the millennial display of glory. It will go into eternity in its own identity (as the holy city and the bride) in which it will have been manifested in the world to come.
There is immediate action in relation to this attack on the throne by the two chamberlains. The matter is reported, investigated, found out, and finalised. In such plots against the throne at the present time, it is urgent, when they are detected, to look diligently into matters, so that, if true, they may be proved by facts and disposed of in the moral judgment and action of the saints assembly-wise, as in the light of the cross. These two men were "hanged on a tree", reminding us of Peter's reference to the Lord's sufferings on the tree (@1 Peter 2: 24).
D.C.W. Does the word come in, "tell it to the
{312}
assembly" (@Matthew 18: 17)? Mordecai informs Esther, and Esther presents the matter to the king in Mordecai's name, so that it goes through right channels. Does that suggest the way that matters are to come to the assembly?
P.L. Yes, this matter of the rebellion of the chamberlains was patent; and generally speaking, in cases of public evil, the conscience of the saints is carried. There was, according to the record in @Esther 2, no element active to retard this judgment being executed. So the enemy having been defeated in regard to a public case of evil, so to speak, as exposed in @1 Corinthians 5, falls back on what we might call his stratagems depicted in Colossians and Ephesians. His ruses are more dangerous than his public violence, and cannot be always exposed and met in a day. So the following chapters in the book of Esther portray Haman, the cultured man according to the flesh, the deadly weapon of Satan in the christian profession, by whom, through philosophy or ritualism, the foe would rob the saints of their very life. In @Colossians 3: 4, Christ is our life. According to the later chapters of Esther, the saints have to fight for their lives, and so do we. "Your life is hid with the Christ in God", the apostle writes (@Colossians 3: 3), but to know anything of that experimentally, we have to enter into conflict with the enemy in his subtle attempts to defraud us. "Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize" (@Colossians 2: 18). Then according to @Ephesians 6: 12, "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies". While it is to Colossians, and especially Ephesians, that we turn to learn the source
{313}
and character of the opposition now to be faced, it is in the setting of 2 Corinthians that the conflict actually goes on, with a local setting of administration. For in this part of the book of Esther, Mordecai is habitually "sitting in the gate". As tracing Paul's militant movements in 2 Corinthians we may discern many Colossian and Ephesian touches, indicating that his carefully calculated military strategy was directed and coloured by the high levels of the truth developed later in those epistles.
As already remarked, in these chapters now before us we are viewing matters as in the current testimonial realm, in which the throne appears to sway from time to time, as coming under darkening influences. The custody of the throne, its preservation in purity and stability, are, from this point of view, a holy trust in the hands of the saints as found in the way of assembly recovery. Thus the defence of the throne is a service to all the saints everywhere, just as was the service of Mordecai and Esther to all the Jews throughout the vast empire of this king.
J.P. What an encouragement that is to every local company, no matter how small, as seeking to hold the ground in view of the blessing of all believers everywhere!
P.L. Exactly; it is a peculiar mission for all of us who have, in days of public assembly captivity, the light of which @Esther 1 bespeaks. Though we can look for no return to first love with the assembly here as a whole, yet for those who are favoured with the light of the assembly, to make Christ's name great here in the defence of God's rights as vested in Him, is a current, burning, night-and-day matter. It depends on subjective formation in the saints as set out in Esther, fostered by Mordecai. The spirit of
{314}
Christ in the saints, for which Mordecai stands, labours for that universally; but it is not until chapter 8 that Mordecai has access to the king. He is, indeed, not allowed to go even into the king's gate as clothed in garments of sackcloth. All therefore hangs upon Esther -- the working out subjectively of assembly features in every locality -- if Satan is to be defeated in his underground tactics. What he is aiming at is to deflect from the maintenance of divine rights those to whom authority has been committed. He seeks to cause the throne to be set for the destruction of the Jews, who according to the post-captivity books, represent the element of genuineness among the people of God as seen in @Romans 2: 29. It is thus that the foe would, by his strategy, overwhelm the testimony and those bound up with it. His ultimate objective is to prevent, if possible, the incoming of Christ by the divinely appointed way. How vain was the attempt that was repeated in the command of Herod to destroy all the boys of Bethlehem from two years and under.
The tenderly nurtured Esther has now come to the hour for which she was destined, and toward which all the lavish care of Hegai, and the continued care of Mordecai had been directed to prepare her. Would she rise to it, as answering to Mordecai's spiritual leadership?
W.B.H. Does the link with John's gospel, which you had in your mind, come into this part of the book especially? I am thinking of what you have said as to the throne being preserved by what *Esther* does. It now seems to be without the support of chamberlains and counsellors, who figured so prominently in the first chapter. It is now a question of what *Esther* does and how *she* acts. Have you
{315}
in mind that the Lord leaves the saints, according to John's gospel, in the scene of conflict trusting them, because of what they are substantially as the fruit of his own ministry?
P.L. Yes, bringing us also to John's epistles, where there are many antichrists abroad, and there is need of a priestly state with the saints to prove the spirits whether they are of God (@1 John 4: 1). Esther, in chapter 5 and onwards, represents a state of matured holy love that can fill out the position, not now being dependent upon parental care, as in her youth. John delights that his children are found walking in the truth; but then he salutes the elect lady and her sister with great respect. They are as Esthers in their localities, stars in the dark night of threatening apostasy.
W.B.H. Whilst, quite rightly, we turn to Matthew in relation to ecclesiastical order and administration, does John's ministry develop a state of spirituality among the saints which holds things for God?
P.L. And it is that, which in family feelings and unity, has turned the scales in recent and many previous conflicts. It has been particularly evident of late that the feelings of the saints, as of the family of God, and also as of the body of Christ, have come into play as meeting the plausible, but determined effort of the destroyer of God's people, and the divider of them, prefigured in Haman, whose spirit as an Agagite might pass muster in religious orthodoxy with unspiritual people.
J.P. In the recent history of the testimony, in what way has this element come to light, because, as you say, there has been conflict in relation to it?
{316}
P.L. The opposition to the truth has taken on an Agagite character. I am referring to Haman's ancestor, Agag, king of the Amalekites, as to whom Jehovah had sworn that He would have war with Amalek from generation to generation. Agag came gaily before Samuel (@1 Samuel 15: 32) saying something sounding to uncircumcised ears as if it were Scripture: "Surely the bitterness of death is passed". Or as some might say, 'Let bygones be bygones, as long as you can let me live; I will never be a trouble again!' But remember the oath of God! He is determined to deal with Amalek root and branch. He has done it in the cross, and He looks to the saints to do it now in spiritual judgment and power. Militant skill lies in spiritual strategy, so as to force the foe (by way of inward formation in the saints as after Christ) into the open, which is the last thing he desires. John records that Judas went out and it was night (@John 13: 30). His exit was hastened by the service of the Lord in feet washing, and further in relation to a state of love among the saints, of which John was the expression as found in the bosom of Jesus and leaning on his breast.
R.H.P. Is the Lord in @John 8 a pattern for us in meeting the opposition of the Jews, which the Lord exposes with supreme skill, telling them that their origin is of the devil?
P.L. Exactly; that lowly, heavenly Warrior in @John 8 lays bare, as you say, the Haman element that was in such opposition to Him.
M.R. He says to them that if they were Abraham's children they would do the works of their father.
P.L. That lays bare the difference. To apply it in a
{317}
simple way to current history in the testimony, many so-called brethren, who have left the path, would assert, so to speak, "Abraham is our father" (@John 8: 39). They assume to trace their origin to Mr. Darby and his ministry, but the Lord would raise the challenge with them: Are you doing the works of your father? It is a question of present correspondence in spirit and power with the assembly revival from the beginning: is it being maintained at the high level which was set forth in the leaders of that day?
D.C.W. Is not Mordecai's attitude very important? "Mordecai bowed not" to Haman, "nor did him reverence". Is that Mordecai element one which we need with us and in us, so that a stand is taken against this insidious influence?
P.L. Exactly. The issue is joined, as you say, and Mordecai is taking the field now aggressively, because he has the support of Esther. We might say that Paul had to wait for Esther to come to light in the Corinthians. He could lay bare the plot of the chamberlains, and there was enough conscience at Corinth and more, to come into line with his judgment, and deal with the offender according to @1 Corinthians 5. But ere he could enter upon military operations against the entrenched foe in relation to a much deeper issue (as in the latter part of the second epistle) he must have the saints with him assembly-wise. Therefore it is a question of waiting for spiritual formation to be developed in the saints through his ministry. We have but two or three verses at the end of @Esther 2 dealing with the overthrow of the plot of the two chamberlains, culminating in their being hanged, but what a history of spiritual skill unfolds in the subsequent chapters in relation to the
{318}
Haman issue! The spirit of Christ in Mordecai, allied spiritually to a subjective state seen in Esther, is set for the common maintenance of the throne; not now Matthew-wise as meeting an open attack in a locality, but John-wise in calculated strategy to expose and overthrow the satanic scheme aimed at the destruction of every Jew, throughout the empire.
W.B.H. You are linking the dealing with the chamberlains with @1 Corinthians 5, where it is a question of a clear, straight-cut matter of evil that can be readily dealt with, almost regardless of the state of the saints. But this matter between the Jews and Haman is a matter that must be worked out in the spiritual state of the saints: is that in your mind?
P.L. Yes, and it involves readiness to lay down one's life for the brethren, as Esther comes to it later: "If I perish, I perish".
L.F. Is it significant that the word used for, 'enemy' in connection with Haman has reference to what is within?
P.L. Yes, note *p* to @Psalm 8: 2 helps as to the different words used. "From among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" (@Acts 20: 30); that is what we have here.
H.J.M. Does Esther stress the importance of the development of assembly features amongst the saints in virginity and purification?
P.L. Quite so, also response to parental care, and unreserved committal to the blessed Spirit. Her military prowess in heaven's skill is now coming into view. It is to be noted that the spouse in the Song of Songs, when described at length by her great Lover, is generally seen
{319}
expressing some militant features. She is not yet united to him, so the full Ephesian conflict is scarcely in mind, but Paul's warfare in 2 Corinthians brings in what is to some extent Colossian and Ephesian in character (see @2 Corinthians 10: 5; @2 Corinthians 11: 31; @2 Corinthians 12: 1 - 4, etc.).
W.B.H. So, while in 1 Corinthians the apostle has to deal with gross evil and so on, in the second epistle does he go behind such public matters in dealing with the false apostles, deceitful workers, and all that had been seeking to corrupt the virginity and chastity of the saints who were "espoused … a chaste virgin to Christ"?
P.L. Yes, it is a question of chastity, which the enemy seeks to corrupt in his dark designs, through a rival to Christ. It may be in hero-worship, or in some dominant Diotrephes, or reigning king at Corinth, naturally amiable, walking softly like Agag. Surely, someone would say, his overtures of friendliness should be embraced! -- but if so, alas, to the undermining in the saints of that for which Christ gave Himself to secure in them.
D.C.W. Did Mordecai have a thorough judgment of that kind of man, and was it thus that he was able to resist that influence?
P.L. Quite so; evidently the war with Amalek from first to last according to the divine fiat (@Exodus 17: 16) was written indelibly in his mind and heart.
R.C.R. Does this conflict require that the saints generally should become clear? It speaks in @Esther 4: 4 of her maids and her chamberlains coming into the matter; all the brethren are to be in it. You were referring earlier to Paul's skill and patience, waiting to gain the saints at Corinth in the second epistle, before he brings the issue to
{320}
a head.
P.L. That was a skilful move, because he recognised from the first that the immediate case of wickedness (@1 Corinthians 5) though urgently calling for assembly judgment, was not so serious as the divided state among the saints, which gave birth to that flagrant delinquency. So that when open wickedness breaks out among us, the saints are not only repudiating it, but they are feeling the divided state among them that gave birth to it.
R.C.R. From the beginning of the epistle it is the state of division among them that appears to have weighed most with Paul. There was the overt matter that had to be dealt with first, but it was the underlying state that he was primarily concerned about.
P.L. Yes, it was the fact that there were divisions among them that was reported to Paul by the house of Chloe, suggesting that the Esther element was there among them, and Paul's concern was its development.
R.C.R. Undivided affection for Christ would bring about undivided conditions among the brethren.
P.L. Yes, indeed. There is no bond more wondrous, or binding, more strong yet tender, than consecration of heart to Christ and to the assembly.
C.K. Does Paul seek to develop that faithfulness to Christ, and love for Him, by getting the Corinthians to judge this evil together?
P.L. Yes, but the public case of evil in @1 Corinthians 5 (this brazen attack on the throne by the two chamberlains) was dealt with, only to be followed by a far deeper issue, involving that Mordecai should go forth into the city with a loud and bitter cry, clothed in sackcloth, and that Esther
{321}
should be ready to lay down her life. She did not take her life in her hand when she reported to the king in Mordecai's name the plot of the two chamberlains. But it is a question of not counting one's life dear, as Paul said in @Acts 20: 24, when we are engaged in conflict which, while in its immediate setting is Corinthian, in its final issue reaches to what is Ephesian in character. For the conflict of @Ephesians 6 is to hold the ground here for the coming Heir, in the presence of the great hierarchy of evil. It was the incoming of Christ as Heir that Satan was really seeking to prevent in his scheme, through Haman, to exterminate the Jews. What a call there is for priestly detection and discernment of the moral springs of a movement to which some saints, through the very amiability of the flesh unjudged, or through family loyalty, insensible to fleshly features (refined and cultured though these may be) lend themselves. A movement deadly, subtle and sinister, which cannot be nailed down on the spot, as in the case of the chamberlains. The letters of our brother Mr. Taylor witness far less to conflict as to rebel chamberlains (although how pronounced is he as to them) than to the great battle in regard to Haman, into which, with a loud and bitter cry, Mordecai is calling Esther. Would you say that?
J.P. Yes, some of us were just speaking of that, and of the stress that Mr. Taylor laid on the assembly, and what he suffered in order that the assembly might have her place in the minds and affections of the saints. And that is the great bulwark against the attack of the enemy.
P.L. He told me that, as a young man, he had asked God as to what should be the line of his ministry, and the
{322}
answer came, Christ and the assembly! We can say thankfully that he was true to his trust.
L.F. When the initial attack of Amalek was met, Moses built an altar and called it "Jehovah-nissi" (@Exodus 17: 15) -- 'Jehovah, my banner'. Where Christ is brought in, the banner becomes a rallying point.
P.L. Quite so. We are now, of course, in deeper battles than those that belong to the wilderness position, which bear on Satan acting on the flesh in us individually, as having typically received the Spirit. But we must gather up the earlier Amalek battles, and the spoil of them, in our souls if we are going to embark on this crucial conflict with Haman. I do not think there is any further allusion to Amalek after this, suggesting that this is the last issue, and we are engaged in it all over the world. Which man is going to dominate, Mordecai (Christ) or Haman? For Mordecai does not come into power and rise to a type of Christ until Haman is hanged; and Esther has an increasing part in the matter, as ready to lay down her life for her brethren.
R.C.R. Is this like David taking the stronghold of Zion, which corresponds with @2 Corinthians 10: 5, "overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God"? Paul then speaks of being in bodily presence weak, and refers to the kind of things which those who oppose would make much of in disparagement of him, as setting great store on human appearance and human ability. This is not an obvious kind of battle, is it, but subtle opposition to Christ -- Christ and the assembly, to prevent, if possible, Christ getting His own proper place in what Zion represents?
{323}
P.L. Yes, and I think that Mordecai's sackcloth bears upon circumcision -- the complete refusal to recognise the flesh.
R.C.R. As in Colossians.
P.L. Yes, the battle against Haman really involves Colossian issue. We have passed on from the uprising of the chamberlains, prefiguring the case in @1 Corinthians 5, into 2 Corinthians, where, as we have noticed, the conflict takes on Colossian and Ephesian features. The issue now is whether the throne will be swayed by what Haman represents -- the influence through great men, and behind all this the god of this world, or whether there is an element among the saints that will bring Mordecai already into testimony as in @Esther 6. This makes way eventually for him, as prefiguring Christ as Heir, to take over all in glory in chapters 9 and 10. I think, when in chapter 6 Mordecai is led in royal apparel on the king's horse round the city at the command of the king, by Haman, the unwilling agent of the king's pleasure, we enter Colossian territory, with all the glories of Christ in mind, according to the divine pleasure.
R.C.R. So Colossians begins with that great reference to Christ, He the great Leader encouraging us to follow Him into this realm.
P.L. Quite so.
J.G.H. In @Colossians 2: 11 it speaks of the "putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ".
P.L. Yes, the whole incubus of it.
D.C.W. So it is the mind that is the danger in Colossians, "vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh" (@Colossians 2: 18).
{324}
P.L. Quite so. The most subtle form of the enemy's attacks is by nice persons -- the cultured christian gentleman. It is through Agag who can walk softly, and use well-sounding expressions, that Satan aims at the domination of the saints, with a view to their extermination in regard to all that is vitally theirs.
R.C.R. Circumcision cuts at the root of all that, however nice I may be.
P.L. Yes, Esther did not like the look of a man in sackcloth; she might think it was not according to court manners. She sought other clothes for Mordecai, but he would have none of it. The man of God has his own wardrobe, and sackcloth plays a large part in it. Paul reminded the Ephesian elders of how he had appeared among them with tears.
L.B.G. Prayer is not mentioned here; will you say something as to it?
P.L. I think that is understandable, because God's name is not mentioned in the book. "Lo-ammi" (@Hosea 1: 9) is, so to speak, written over the people. Of course, prayer is ever our resource against the foe. But while the word is not found here, I think Esther's waiting attitude in the court before the king, and her touching the top of the sceptre, when the king extends it to her, depicts prayer; then later her supplications to the king are mentioned.
J.C. There is much emphasis given to fasting.
P.L. Yes, indeed, and how the loud and bitter cry reminds us of what Paul went through, and Epaphras too, but supremely of the Lord's own last and wondrous cry on the cross, expressing such depth of feeling, as tasting the bitterness of divine judgment in the removal of the man
{325}
whom Haman represents. What priestly feelings of abhorrence of the features marking that man are in activity with Paul in writing to the Colossians, and priestly yearnings to save the brethren at all costs from a foe undiscerned by them. They have to be stirred up to fight for their lives, as were the Jews throughout the empire later in the book. Many have no conception of the battles that go on.
H.A.W. Would you say that this loud and bitter cry issued from a heart free from self-consideration, that was considering for God, and realised how God would be affected?
P.L. Quite so; and Mordecai was thinking of the saints, too; for Haman had been falsely accusing the saints in the king's ear. It is a warning to us not to play into the hands of the enemy with disparaging remarks about the brethren; he is their accuser before God day and night (@Revelation 12: 10), but God will never listen to him, the more urgent then that we should never do so.
W.B.H. What is the significance of this mourning and sackcloth being a public matter? It would seem as if the Jews thus disclosed their identity.
P.L. Well, Satan would carry on the conflict underground, if he could. The time comes when the saints must force him into the open by coming into the open themselves. That cry was to reverberate throughout Shushan; while many might hear it, it was really intended for the Jews who were there. It is to those available in the testimony that the loud and bitter cry comes; they are to hear it and act on it.
H.J.M. What does the added matter of the ashes
{326}
represent for us?
P.L. Ashes indicate complete consumption by fire, whatever the material be. The saints are formidable in relation to ashes, as was manifested in the sign in Egypt, when the ashes thrown toward heaven resulted in boils breaking out on man and beast. We can take no place in relation to heaven except as we answer to the ashes. In @Genesis 18 Abraham speaks of himself as being but dust and ashes; he could not take account of his place in relation to the stars of heaven, except on the ground of being ashes.
H.J.M. And in the spiritual setting it would involve an answer in us to the ashes of the sin offering.
H.S.D. Does it fit in with what Paul was bringing to bear upon the saints at Corinth in the second epistle -- the thought of dying together and living together (@2 Corinthians 7: 3); the state of the saints is met in that chapter; so that as death worked in the saints, life was in view?
P.L. Yes indeed. So Esther takes the field on the third day. No one was ever defeated who so did. No one ever won a spiritual victory who did otherwise. Nehemiah on arriving at Jerusalem, stayed there three days, without apparently doing a thing, and his enemies were terrorised. They were grieved that a man had come to seek the welfare of Jerusalem; he was a three-day man. Such was Paul, and the evil spirit at Ephesus had to admit, "Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with" (@Acts 19: 15). The third day is the great resurrection day of divine triumph involving, for the saints, divine power in testimony. Let us take the field in the light of that, and there will be only one result. The timeliness and seemliness of spiritual
{327}
movements are what the Spirit of God emphasises in the book of Esther.
{328}
{329}
FAITHFULNESS TO GOD AND HIS THRONE (3)
P Lyon
@Esther 5: 1 - 5; @Esther 6: 11, 12; @Esther 7: 1 - 10
P.L. From the end of chapter 4 to chapter 6 we see the features set out in Esther personally, which carry the conflict to a divine issue. Not immediately as in the rebellion of the two chamberlains, but gradually, in wisdom and patience, involving for us that in such matters we draw upon Christ as Head. As seeking to learn the application of this section to our own day, we may trace these features in Paul in the latter part of @Acts 20. Esther now shines, firstly, in her readiness to accept death, saying, "If I perish, I perish". Secondly, in fasting; thirdly, in putting on royal apparel; fourthly in the waiting attitude of a suppliant before the throne; and fifthly, in her two banquets. Esther takes the initiative, and acquires growing power over the throne. All this is to teach us that the throne (representing the power of God for the maintenance of His rights) does not take things in hand independently of what Esther represents. God's power is reserved for those who act. There is a tendency for some to say in a crisis: 'We are waiting for God to come in'. The manifestation of the power of God on our behalf in the battles of the testimony is conditional upon the subjective state assembly-wise for which Esther stands. As to Mordecai, it is to be noted that, except in the matter of his glorification at the hand of Ahasuerus through Haman (chapter 6) he is not in evidence now. Though earlier, in
{330}
chapter 4, as a spiritual leader, he could call upon her to die, as did Paul in regard to Timothy.
As tracing in Paul at Ephesus these features which shine out typically in Esther, we should keep in mind that Ephesian features are to be developed in the saints while engaged in a conflict that is necessarily in a Corinthian setting. A universal issue may arise, but though our struggle be against the universal lords of this darkness, the crisis may find expression in a locality, between those standing for the truth assembly-wise (represented by Esther), and elements opposed to the truth (who, through lack of self-judgment, are not free of earthly characteristics).
Chapter 4: 16 of Esther puts us in mind of Paul in @Acts 20 calling to him at Miletus the elders of the assembly at Ephesus. The Holy Spirit is still here in unimpaired power, in the presence of all the conditions that have sorrowfully arisen in the professing church.
What a model Paul furnishes us in this militant setting, both as he brings himself before us as a model in @Acts 20 and in 2 Corinthians. How ready he is to perish! "But I make no account of my life as dear to myself" (@Acts 20: 24). How the spirit of fasting characterised him: "In fastings often" (@2 Corinthians 11: 27). Then this royal apparel, seen pre-eminently in the King coming into His capital as meek and lowly -- "meek and lowly in heart" (@Matthew 11: 29). Paul entered into conflict as thus arrayed: "But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ ... For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh. For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of
{331}
strongholds; overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ" (@2 Corinthians 10: 1 - 5). He is seen thus also according to @Acts 20: 19 "with all lowliness". Then what prayer marked Paul as he committed them to God, and as he knelt down and prayed with them all (@Acts 20: 36). How he emphasised, too, the importance of maintaining the supply of food and drink, typified in Esther's banquets. What rich ministries he introduces in the early part of 2 Corinthians -- the ministry of the new covenant, and the ministry of reconciliation, waiting all the time for the up-building of assembly features in the Corinthians, which would furnish suited conditions for the exposure of the Haman element, which was operating in a hidden way among them.
Esther is to prove her mettle now, as typifying the church militant according to Matthew. Let us understand the war in which we are engaged, and not be diverted by personalities, through whom the enemy would throw dust in our eyes. Let us keep the issues clear. Once Esther had come to the point, "If I perish, I perish", she had no question about the issues; and so Paul. We cannot read Paul's commission to the Ephesian elders in @Acts 20 without seeing the issues that Paul stood for. How discerning he was: "For *I* know this, that there will come in amongst you after my departure grievous wolves, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" (verses 29, 30). He had his eye on the destructive Agagite element moving surreptitiously in deep-seated hostility to God as depicted in the book of
{332}
Esther. But do not let us hold up the banquets because we may be grappling with an Agagite element. We may say that we are looking to the Lord to help, indeed we should do so, but these are called Esther's banquets. Nothing is more urgent than keeping up the supply of spiritual food and drink in its divine richness, the best, amidst the conflicts. Mr. Darby breaks out into beautiful hymns touching upon divine counsel while grappling on the battlefield with this Amalekite element. Let us go on with the best, dear brethren; let us have Ephesian ministry. Wine is what is emphasised in relation to the second banquet, and it is in @Ephesians 5: 18, we read: "Be not drunk with wine ... but be filled with the Spirit". Let us not be held up in regard to divine bounty by the necessity of asserting divine rights in the displacement among the saints of the rival to Christ (for many antichrists have gone forth). The whole issue of the battle is that Christ might have His place supreme amongst the saints: "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" (@Ephesians 3: 17). Paul laboured and fought that he might place the Ephesian assembly in the affections of Christ, and place Christ as supreme in the hearts of the saints.
H.J.M. What you have suggested as to the banquets is of great importance, and we should understand that the troubles which assembly conflicts may bring upon us are not on the menu at the banquets. There are sorrows which have to be faced, but they are not to be the food of the saints, are they?
P.L. Quite so. Through the first banquet, Haman is segregated, and brought into the presence of the throne, and, subsequent to the glorification of Mordecai in chapter
{333}
6, he is, by way of the second banquet, finally dealt with by the throne. Nothing isolates evil and lays it bare like a liberal table among the saints, such as Esther's banquets portray.
C.P.H. Is not the Supper given to us in the Corinthian epistle as in the very scene of the conflict, so that we would learn to select the royal apparel?
P.L. Yes. As the Lord was about to go on into the conflict of Gethsemane and the cross He, as Pattern for us, set up the Lord's supper.
H.J.M. In regard to Esther's waiting before the throne for the sceptre to be extended to her, and the trepidation she felt in regard to her approach, does it stand in relation to the governmental ways of God, and the acceptance of the will of God, whichever way it may operate -- whether the sceptre is going to be withheld, or stretched out in our favour?
P.L. Yes; as the time comes, she waits. The issue must come. It is on the divine calendar, so to speak, and we feel our way. According to external appearances, the first banquet did not reach an issue, but Esther waits on, with the proposal of a second one. What is necessary is the exaltation of Mordecai in the meantime, in order that the saints, typified in Esther, subjectively and collectively -- can lay bare the real source of the opposition in the enemy working, perhaps through the most amiable element on hand.
J.P. I should like to be a little clearer as to the difference between the summary dealings with the two chamberlains, and what eventually transpires in this conflict, linked, as you suggested, with headship.
{334}
P.L. The latter may be a long extended matter, depending upon growth among the saints, and an increasing appreciation of headship. Of course, we are merely culling certain features for our instruction from this veiled book, bearing dispensationally on the remnant's history as against antichrist, indicating the way the Lord will come in for them. But all this has been written for our learning; it must mean something for us. There must be an answer in the New Testament to what is here, and we are seeking to discern how it bears on the present conflicts of the testimony.
J.P. There is a point here when Esther becomes fully available for what is on hand.
P.L. Yes. All starts with Esther's readiness to die: "If I perish, I perish". It is not, 'If *you* perish, *I* will go forward'. There is an understanding with God about the matter. Mordecai, as a leader, is giving a very good example, and makes perfectly clear, as Paul did, that this great heritage shall not be won or held, short of laying down one's life, and the acceptance of this principle in those whom he served and led. The real delay in these matters lies in the reluctance to die. But to lay down one's life for the brethren, one must know the issue, and at first this was where Esther lacked. Perhaps, she was not at that moment, so to speak, keeping up with the ministry. She may have been inclined to settle down to her queenly estate.
J.P. So that in the end of chapter 4 Mordecai says, "Imagine not in thy heart that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews" and so forth. That is what you have in your mind when you say that Esther did
{335}
not see the issue.
P.L. Yes, what Mordecai says to Esther here would check any tendency with us, when a crisis arises in our locality, to say in our hearts, 'How can I save my life? By going to another meeting, so that I do not have to face this issue?' Never. Esther gains control of the situation during these chapters -- as does anyone who is ready to die, who is putting on the royal apparel, moving in all humility, concerned to get an audience in relation to the throne in a waiting attitude, and desirous (in the very midst of the enemy's efforts) to ensure a rich supply of food and drink, the second banquet being described as a banquet of wine. Let the brethren have the best, when things seem outwardly at their worst.
C.P.H. Could we say that the enemy having failed in a frontal attack, is now attacking on the flank, and we need to have a sense of what has necessitated the cross, so that we might be ready to perish, having faced the issue already in our own hearts?
P.L. Yes, Satan would seek to use dominating personalities, like Diotrephes, who would claim relation with the truth, but only as affording a cover to the foe in his deadly designs that God shall be deprived of His present joy and portion in His people. I think the banquet of wine, viewed abstractly, might for us have a bearing on the service of God -- wine which cheers God and man. But the attack of the enemy is to be met by the church militant, operating for God in the locality, according to @Matthew 18. Though there be but two or three available, the prerogative to bind or loose, originally committed to the assembly, is still to be exercised, while humbly accepting the broken
{336}
day in which our lot is cast.
W.B.H. So that it is not met exactly by the authority of his apostleship, but by his personality; the saints are to be formed according to that?
P.L. Yes, and according to the model which he personally furnished of lowly serving love. It was upon "the neck of *Paul*" that the Ephesian elders fell, not exactly on his neck as an apostle.
H.S.D. In getting the Corinthian saints to move in the same way as himself, that is militantly, Paul beseeches them by "the meekness and gentleness of the Christ" (@2 Corinthians 10: 1). The same character of conflict seems to be in view, against "every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God" (@2 Corinthians 10: 5).
P.L. Exactly.
J.G.C. Is the matter of royal apparel very important? Esther wears her own royal apparel, it is hers. But Haman is aspiring to wear the king's apparel and ride his horse.
P.L. Quite, and as in that royal apparel, Esther has the golden sceptre extended to her. We have to look past what Ahasuerus was as a heathen potentate, and see that abstractly he still represents the throne, which would always have regard to a lowly and suppliant spirit, set forth in Esther in her royal apparel.
D.C.W. Does Matthew, chapters 16 - 18, underlie this: "Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18)?
P.L. That is just what it is.
R.C.R. There are the two banquets of Esther, and in between them the glory of Christ comes in.
P.L. We need to keep that forward; it is God who sees to that. Although His name is not mentioned, it is He who
{337}
causes the king to be sleepless that night, and the chronicles to be looked into. How often does a heart-searching time in assembly exercises, as in a veiled way depicted in the king's sleepless night, help to remind us of the Lord's great service to the throne, in defending it to death. Our forgetfulness of this is now remedied by the exaltation of Mordecai. We may by way of illustration view the chronicles which were read to the king as the Scriptures. The records which the Holy Scriptures afford of the Lord's exploits in the defence of the throne, even to the death of the cross, God may use in a crisis of this sort, as those, also, of men of God who have in a crisis defended the throne to death. The features set forth in Esther's approach to the king, and the provision of the banquet, with the proposal of the second one, warrant, so to speak, God's intervention through the king, as the result of his sleepless night and his perusal of the chronicles, stirring him up to the belated action of giving Mordecai his due. How long has the Lord at times had to wait for this, but when in a crisis this is done in ministry that exalts Him to which the saints answer, the whole tide of battle is turned. In the record here Haman returns from the exaltation of Mordecai convinced that his sun is set, and this, his wife Zeresh but confirms. This is the beginning of a series of movements from the throne which leads on to the full exaltation of Mordecai as in chapter 10, indicating that Christ's exaltation among the saints is the alone assurance of present and final victory. How establishing it is to intersperse in conflict these celebrations of the exploits of our Lord, the great Warrior in the defence of the throne! How the Lord's sufferings furnish occasion for
{338}
this! The book of Revelation, which gives such place to the throne, and the judgment of all that is foreign to it, as well as the vindication of all that is true to it, commences with such an ascription of praise in the first chapter to Christ as the great Warrior of God. "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen" (@Revelation 1: 5, 6). We might also view the reading of the chronicles before the king as bearing on ministry that has gone before as to the glory of Christ, and the saints coming into it. The Lord might bring up previous conflicts to reassert His glory as going into death for the defence of the throne, and His exaltation by God, in answer to His devotion.
J.P. You made a remark earlier as to the tendency that might be with us in a crisis to leave things to the Lord, saying that the Lord will come in for us in His own time, and deal with the matter, but, as you were suggesting, that is not exactly indicated in this part of Esther?
P.L. Not as regards the church militant according to Matthew, nor according to @Ephesians 6: 12, where Paul speaks of "*Our* struggle".
S.T. How is Mordecai viewed here, and in the earlier chapters, in relation to his uncompromising attitude towards Haman?
P.L. He comes before us in that setting as a type of a man of God. He would not bow to the Agagite, but when he is led round the city as the man whom the king delights to honour, from thenceforward he is a type of Christ. While Mordecai does not appear when Esther is active, as under his influence, before matters can proceed to finality
{339}
at the second banquet, he must be brought forward in glory as typifying the exaltation of Christ, in answer to His defence of the throne, involving before God the removal of the Agagite. The understanding of that but stimulates us to see to his practical removal from our midst, as in Esther's holy mission this is reached assembly-wise. Any priestly counsel afforded in a general way should be calculated to direct the saints to divine Persons and principles, and promote stimulation to action where necessary. We can see how Paul, according to @Acts 20, lays out the broad lines to be followed in the conflict, involving the manifestation of the features of Christ, beginning with readiness to lay down one's life; as John says, "*he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives" (@1 John 3: 16). We are to take our lives in our hands all the time, and we may have to wait. Esther waited in the court, and she waited between the two banquets, but not in vain. The waiting time only gives occasion for the exaltation of Christ, His glory filling out the interval. In such a crisis we must go forward. Let us have the banquets; nothing will expose Haman like it; let us have the exaltation of Christ. We shall never be able to detect and lay bare the evil at its roots, and name this wicked Haman, short of devotion to the death, the royal apparel, the support of the throne, the ministry as to the glory of Christ, and the two banquets surrounding it, however few the saints may be in a locality. Do not let us give up the banquets because there may be certain issues in a locality -- the more reason for the best food supply. It is well-nourished saints who alone can meet Amalek. The manna was brought into that section in Exodus in which we have
{340}
the record of Amalek's first attack on God's people.
R.C.R. And the smitten rock, too.
P.L. Yes, indeed, resulting in the flowing water.
R.C.R. So that the Spirit comes in to help each one of the saints to come into the conflict.
P.L. Exactly. A good many saints have no idea of the conflict; through being themselves taken up with personalities. For the flesh in us leans to the flesh in Agag, or in his descendant Haman, who can point to apparently fine results; ten sons, a multitude of children -- or, as we might say in our day, great revivalistic results, in self-aggrandisement. The object of Satan behind all that, being to deprive divine Persons of Their rights and Their place among the saints.
L.F. It says of the woman of worth in @Proverbs 31, "Strength and dignity are her clothing … She openeth her mouth with wisdom" (verses 25, 26). Do we not see working out with Esther the great element of wisdom as entering into assembly matters?
P.L. Yes, there is a mystery about Esther's movements. A mere observer might say, 'You had one banquet, and nothing came of it: why have another?' But the fact is that in this fight it is a 'war of inches', as men speak. It is not a full frontal attack, as that of the chamberlains, to be dealt with on the spot. It is said in @Acts 28: 13, that Paul and those with him came by a circuitous course to Rhegium which may have a moral suggestion.
C.P.H. Would not the spirit that marked Esther help us in taking up matters in care, considering how they affect God, so that the battle might be turned to the gate?
P.L. Exactly.
{341}
W.B.H. Is the conflict always only finally resolved in the state of the saints? It is not so much executive action, requiring certain persons to be dealt with, but behind all that there is the enemy's secret inroad upon the affections of the saints. He can only be dislodged when the assembly has gathered sufficient power and initiative to deal with it, to bring the matter out frontally. In 2 Corinthians the real conflict lies beneath the surface; in relation to the state of the saints, which gave rise to the delinquencies which had to be dealt with executively, as set out in the case of the chamberlains. But Haman comes before us as a secret enemy, does he not?
P.L. That is so.
W.B.H. And he is not finally named before the throne as an enemy until what represents the assembly subjectively has developed sufficient initiative and power through the banquets.
P.L. Yes, the banquets are needed to build up the constitution for a fight to the death, for with such an enemy it is a question of cold steel as men say. We have to keep in mind that, while the wicked man in @1 Corinthians 5 was recovered, the enemies of Paul, as far as we know from the end of the second epistle, were not. Theirs was studied opposition to what is heavenly in Paul, referring to his presence in the body as weak, and his speech naught (@2 Corinthians 10: 10). God's government may lie over such persons, and while, as in the recognition of God's mercy we could not say that recovery is impossible in any case, we have to remember the "if" that Paul introduces in @2 Timothy 2: 25, "*If* God *perhaps may sometime* give them repentance to acknowledgment of the truth".
{342}
E.S.T. On our side we would always look and pray for recovery.
E.G.E. In the teaching of the first epistle to the Corinthians, the truth of headship in chapter 11, and the Supper, and the prophetic ministry, build up the saints in this way.
P.L. Yes, let us remember that if the particular thrust may be in a locality, the issue at stake is universal in character. That may be one of the reasons why, when addressing the Ephesian elders at Miletus, Paul alludes to the Holy Spirit as having appointed them, and this emphasises their trust to defend the throne vigilantly in their locality from every attack.
L.F. The power of the enemy starts to decline from the moment Christ is exalted; then that makes way for the second banquet, does it not?
P.L. That is what one has in mind. As the saints make everything of Christ, as Paul does in his second epistle to the Corinthians, the enemy begins to fall without being directly attacked. There is an element of mystery in the conflict, till at last the whole position is exposed, as has come about recently in places. This scripture puts upon us the responsibility to act. Ahasuerus, as representing the throne abstractly, is moved by the one who besieges the throne, as we might say, with prayer. God loves that. The prophetic word comes to us to "give him no rest … till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth" (@Isaiah 62: 7).
J.P. We have to remember your remark that we are culling spiritual suggestions from this book. Even if God is not mentioned, nor prayer, yet prayer is here.
P.L. That is right. Now we must make up our mind
{343}
that our locality is going to be part of the battleground. While we are not looking round for difficulties, we know that the enemy will not fail to attack. If we have cause to thank God for additions in our midst, we regard them from this point of view as fresh recruits for the conflict.
J.P. There is an inclination with us to put the idea of peace (most desirable and right in its own place) over against any idea of conflict, forgetting, perhaps, that conflict is the order of the day.
P.L. Yes, in view of peace, for later in this book Mordecai is speaking peace to all his seed. Thus the door is open for Ezra, a skilled and priestly scribe in the law of God, to open up in his ministry a vast spiritual domain to be explored and possessed in relation to the truth. How blest thus, to gather in the fruits of conflict in times of peace. Conflict is not an object in itself, but a necessity which divine rights demand, but it is conflict in patience. "The tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus" is brought in in @Revelation 1: 9. That patience still continues, for much that comes before us in that book has yet to take place, and Jesus is waiting still, teaching us that we cannot hasten these issues. On the other hand we must not delay them through reluctance to die. God may test out the position, so that spiritual substance assembly-wise may gather strength to be able to deal with such an issue in our localities. Esther must now come forward without Mordecai's public help, though, no doubt, she was supported by his secret intercession, for he is now rising to a type of Christ.
D.C.W. Is it instructive that later, when Haman is dead, Esther follows the matter up and an edict is sent out
{344}
to every locality, so that all the Jews are brought into the battle?
P.L. Yes, one part of the battle line is part of the whole. Let ground be given to the foe in any place on earth where the saints are gathered in the light of the assembly, and the whole battle line is imperilled. It puts a trust on the saints locally to which perhaps they have never risen, though they may have answered to the first epistle to the Corinthians in relation to the commandment of the Lord, and the claims of the fellowship in the setting of the assembly in the wilderness.
F.R.H. Mordecai says to Esther, "for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there arise relief and deliverance to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall perish".
P.L. Yes, have we not seen this work out in the case of persons who, having their own reputation to save, adopt a neutral attitude in a crisis, leaving to others the inestimable favour of defending the position to death?
M.R. Do we not see that worked out in @Matthew 16, when Peter, with beautiful words, would have turned the Lord from His purpose to die, and the Lord discerns who is behind that; He says to Peter, "Get away behind me, Satan" (@Matthew 16: 23)?
P.L. Yes, the Lord named him as the adversary, for one's motives are what one is, however fair the appearance may be.
W.B.H. In Mr. Stoney's time was not the movement of the so-called evangelists rather a cloak for a good deal of worldliness? He met it by insisting on the heavenly calling of the assembly as united to Christ. He saw that
{345}
that was really what the enemy was attacking, and that if the saints were really established in that, he would not get a foothold through moral delinquency.
P.L. You meet the attack by providing against it in ministry among the saints.
R.C.R. Haman's activities are not on the surface against the king, nor against the throne, but Esther says to the king in chapter 7: 4, "But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the adversary could not compensate the *king's damage*". What would you say as to that? Do not all these matters affect the king through the saints?
P.L. Quite so. Then as to the gallows, what has been devised for another by my malice becomes my lot. We see Haman's gallows going up for Mordecai, but when God turns the tables, they are turned indeed and who can reverse them?
J.G.C. Will you say more about the fasting which preceded the banquets?
P.L. It is a question of starving the flesh at every turn, and this would free us from hobbies, and the life in which we may once have been engaged, but affording us the privilege of giving them up for the Lord and the testimony. The war is on! Oh, that the saints might awaken to it! Self-complacency builds up the Haman element. It is met by ministry from leaders prepared to lay down their lives, after the pattern of Christ Himself, as was Paul and such leaders whom God has raised up in our day. The saints are well worth dying for. Dying is the end of everything which men call life here, but willingly embraced by devoted hearts in the hour of crisis, in the realisation that the
{346}
present moment affords an opportunity to die. When Mr. Wigram was consulted by a sister as to moving to another place, because she claimed that she must have better air in which to live, he replied: 'I find that any place is good enough to die in'. Difficulties in a local meeting give opportunity for dying, as carrying the sorrow of them, and thus love steps into the breach to meet them.
K.A.W. We can understand how Esther would be occupied during these three days; there would not be anything allowed with her to feed the flesh.
P.L. No indeed, and then she comes forth in the royal apparel -- not borrowed, but her own, ready to hand. "Bind on humility", says Peter (@1 Peter 5: 5). You will always move the throne in that spirit. "The high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity … I dwell ... with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit" (@Isaiah 57: 15).
C.P.H. Was the conflict that Paul had for the saints in Colosse in order that they might cross over to take up their inheritance?
P.L. Yes, we need to be clear about this matter, the fight is in relation to what is heavenly. Christian proprieties on earth, Satan will not challenge. Surrender he must to some extent his place in heaven, if the saints take heavenly ground. As Esther acquires strength, Haman begins to fall. It is a solemn and remarkable matter. While we cannot entirely dispossess Satan from heaven, his influence thence in evil must be weakened by the saints taking heavenly territory. When finally they are there, Satan will be cast out of it, and if they are already there in spiritual consciousness, Satan has to give ground in his baneful influence over the people of God here. Persons
{347}
may enquire, what are you doing for other christians? Well, if in any measure one is causing Satan to give ground in the heavenlies in relation to his wicked strategy against the saints on earth, one could not be doing christians generally a greater service.
H.J.M. And when the disciples, returning from certain victories in the course of their service, and, filled with joy, related them to the Lord, He answers, "Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" (@Luke 10: 20). He says that just after saying, "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven".
P.L. Yes, because Satan was having to give ground on earth in that the demons were subdued at the word of the disciples; but what Satan particularly objects to is having to give ground in heaven, because it is the seat of his operations for evil here.
H.D.B. Would you elaborate your earlier remark that we cannot do without Esther?
P.L. It is not here Esther the queen in a coming day of glory, as suggested later in the book, but Esther in the conflict, carrying our thoughts to the church militant in Matthew's gospel. We cannot do without what she stands for, involving a spiritual state in the saints. We have seen her first as a product of care on the part of Mordecai, and as under the custody of Hegai (typical of the blessed Spirit), seeking nothing outside of him, presentable thus through his service, and thus suited to be elevated to the throne -- for we are not promotable without being presentable. But now Esther shines in a fresh lustre for which the activities of the enemy do but furnish the dark
{348}
background.
H.D.B. Esther had already faced death.
P.L. Yes, and as remarked earlier, in the Song of Songs, the beloved never describes his spouse in detail without referring to her militant character. Christ loves us as in heaven in relation to purpose, but now He loves us as here, maintaining what is heavenly here amidst the attacks of the foe.
D.C.W. It is to be noted that Esther can answer the king's question, "Who is he, and where is he that has filled his heart to do so?" She knows.
P.L. And she comes out at the appointed time. The timeliness and seemliness that mark the spiritual element in this book are to be noted.
H.J.M. And we have the sense that God has control in all His ways, however veiled, and He is acting in favour of the saints. It is very noticeable how everything is timed by heaven in regard to all that arises.
P.L. The assembly moves in relation to heaven's clock, we may say. The prophetic clock has stopped in God's ways, but there is, so to speak, another clock in relation to the assembly, and it is of great importance for us to know the assembly time. One may say that he does not follow the ministry; perhaps his watch has stopped, or he has failed to set his watch daily by the assembly time. What christendom has in externals is imitative of right thoughts. We should be concerned to have, in spiritual vitality, that of which they are the imitation. For instance the true answer to the church spire should be seen in character amongst us, the saints in their public testimony pointing to heaven; whilst the church clock is to regulate
{349}
our watches. Many a man has missed the train because he did not have his watch regulated by the church clock; and how many thus have missed the movements of the testimony.
R.C.R. What the Spirit is saying to the assemblies at any given time comes through the ministry, and we are to be in line with it.
P.L. Exactly.
L.G. It is to be noted that after his exaltation, Mordecai goes back to the king's gate again.
P.L. That is a beautiful touch. The Lord has been exalted on high, and now He is with us in the testimony here. "Behold, *I* am with you all the days" (@Matthew 28: 20). Patterned thus after Christ, is a man of God, who, in all weathers and seasons, stands by the testimony in his locality. He may have been away serving the saints, and may have been honoured in his service, but on his return he resumes his seat in the king's gate, and without any self-advertisement he quietly returns to occupy it, as in mind never having left it.
J.P. What an example of that we have in the great apostles; how they returned to the king's gate!
P.L. You are thinking of Paul and Barnabas returning to Antioch. What makes the locality important to you is that it is the king's gate. The battle has to be turned to the gate; things must be worked out administratively in regard to the Lord's rights, and the rights of God in the locality. God reserves to us our seat in the king's gate, if we are in the spirit of hastening back to it in continual vigilance.
H.J.M. Previously you have made a very sober and yet encouraging remark, that we are morally no greater
{350}
anywhere than we are in our locality.
P.L. That is so. Timothy was taken up by Paul on local credentials, and the local brethren can assess moral worth, discovered in spiritual stamina in all weathers. For the local setting involves winters as well as summers, and it is in winter that a tree puts on wood, and it is in the locality that the spiritual fibre of the saints develops.
{351}
FAITHFULNESS TO GOD AND HIS THRONE (4)
P Lyon
@Esther 8: 1 - 12, 15 - 17; @Esther 9: 1 - 16, 20 - 23, 29 - 32; @Esther 10: 1 - 3
P.L. As following up what has already been remarked as to the link between the facing of the Haman issue, and Paul's militant operations according to 2 Corinthians, we see in @Esther 8 and 9 the importance of dealing with the aftermath. For when the conflict is publicly over, the enemy would re-attack underground. We have alluded to Paul's reference to his being caught up as far as the third heaven in @2 Corinthians 12: 2. We might have thought that he would have introduced it into the Ephesian epistle, where the saints are viewed according to divine purpose, seated in the heavenlies in Christ. But it is in 2 Corinthians that it is brought forward, bringing into relief the spiritual stature of Paul, which qualified him for leadership as against his rivals, and assured victory with him. How often, in the later chapters of that epistle, he directs the attention of the saints to "the Christ", so that they might be dominated by that glorious Person, the true Mordecai, as against the wicked Agagite domination, working out in the extermination of everything spiritually genuine among the people of God. This is set forth in the idea of "a Jew ... inwardly" (@Romans 2: 29). Then in @2 Corinthians 13: 2 he writes, "I have declared beforehand, and I say beforehand as present the second time, and now absent, to those that
{352}
have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare". So, in the book of Esther, although Haman has been hanged on the gallows prepared for Mordecai, his ten sons remain to be dealt with. They would be telling all, no doubt, how badly their father had been treated; they might even point to a technical flaw in the way things were done, all to becloud the urgent necessity of his removal. It is again Esther's matter. It is a question of the assembly, in spiritual formation, drawing on the power of the throne, through prayer afresh, the sceptre coming in again in chapter 8: 4. How often a resurgence of the past issue occurs when a fresh difficulty arises, showing that persons have never gained the profit of the past issue, through having been in divergence with their brethren over it, both locally and generally, and therefore rendering themselves unable to see the present issue. As a result, they bring forward the past issue to becloud the present. It may be that they wish to get someone's case unnecessarily re-investigated. They think that now their opportunity has come, adding to the very difficulties on hand, instead of throwing their full weight into the battle, in the experience of having gone through the previous battle with the Lord, and the brethren. Hence the urgency of a spiritual ministry as seen in 2 Corinthians, that will, along with its positive features, assure the hanging of these ten sons. In other words, that will result in the final disposal, in the minds of the saints, of all trace that would furnish the enemy power to revive in underground movements, grievances and murmurings, in what we might call, the Haman case.
With all this in mind, Paul writes in @2 Corinthians 12: 19 - 21,
{353}
"We speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up. For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that *I* be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest there might be strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances" and so on. It is by way of this great ministry, bearing upon the glory of Christ, in His ascendancy alone, which can displace the dreadful relics of Haman influence, imbibed so easily, but retained, alas, so long, unless such a ministry is furnished.
Esther represents assembly state that is set now for the promotion of Mordecai. There are three references to his glorification: firstly, his being taken through the city as "the man whom the king delights to honour". This would answer to Christ's glorification morally, Corinthian-wise as in the Lord's supper. Secondly (chapter 8: 15) his going out from the king's presence with a great crown of gold -- corresponding to Colossians -- His glory personally. Finally, his greatness in the last verse of the book, as second only to king Ahasuerus, would typify His official glory in Ephesians. So that we are in a rich realm here, in relation to the positive ministry of Christ, to assure, as with Paul in 2 Corinthians, the extermination spiritually of the man who would have exterminated everything for God here. That is what is behind every conflict that arises; a long look-out is needed to see the enemy's objective. One of his names is 'the destroyer' (@Revelation 9: 11, see footnote *d*) as seeking to destroy every trace of God and Christ here.
We are to enter in faith into battle in the sobriety of that long look-out, and in the determination that the foe shall be met in divine power, as winning over the throne to
{354}
the support of the testimony. I think the way the king has to be gradually won over, sets out, in a veiled way, the fact that God will not give His power easily to His warring saints in a broken day such as ours, and such as the book of Esther suggests. There have to be the features seen in Esther in chapter 5, that bring the throne over to our side, so to speak. Ahasuerus takes a hand increasingly now in matters in the power universal that is his, to give effect to the very desires of Esther.
J.P. Every true assembly person would desire the exaltation of Christ, but one feels too, that the brethren would support your remark that it is the hanging of Haman's sons that is really needed. The difficulties in so many localities are continued because of the failure to hang Haman's sons.
P.L. There are persons who would suggest, 'Just leave one of them! Do not be so extreme! The ten have been killed; the decision has been reached, and I submit!' But that does not go far enough; after the ten sons are dead, they must be hanged. What a public sight of shame! In it the real plans of the foe through Haman are laid bare. That is what was demonstrated at the cross as in @Colossians 2: 15, "having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a show of them publicly, leading them in triumph by it". We see the triumph of God at the cross in dealing with everything at its root, and exposing it publicly. That has been done supremely by God, and eternally in result, but that feature is to be maintained by us as the crown of every assembly conflict.
D.C.W. Who is to do the hanging now?
P.L. One's hands are full with the hanging of these ten
{355}
sons in one's own mind and soul in self-judgment. Each is to do it, as stimulated by ministry, according to 2 Corinthians in regard to the exaltation of Christ as supreme, now to dominate all, making room for headship in Colossians.
L.F. You would say then that in regard to the conflicts locally, one of the sources of weakness can be just that spirit of accepting an assembly judgment, instead of really making it my own in self-judgment -- that is the hanging of Haman's sons in my own real inward exercises.
P.L. Exactly.
E.G.E. In @2 Corinthians 11: 2 Paul says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ". Would that be the setting out of the positive side of the truth?
P.L. Quite so, having in view the development of the Esther feelings and state. She has the ascendancy now without any assumption. She is often referred to as the queen, yet she preserves her lowly attitude, and, as preserving it, she has the ear of the king in relation to the people she loves, who are *her* people. What we owe to assembly prayers to God in relation to the preservation of the saints in the presence of the destroyer, who shall say?
H.J.M. Following upon the issues of 1 Corinthians being settled, it is apparent in the first chapter of 2 Corinthians that there was still an undercurrent. For some were saying that Paul's word was yea and nay; but he meets it by alluding to the preaching of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, among them. He says, "He ... did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for
{356}
glory to God by us" (@2 Corinthians 1: 19, 20). Then he speaks of their being established in Christ, and so on; that was to secure the saints. I wondered if it was a little like taking the ring from Haman, and giving it to Mordecai in relation to the ministry.
P.L. In a beautiful spirit, Paul meets their charge that he was prevaricating, when actually it was their state that made him hesitant about coming to Corinth. His resort is to Christ as the Yea and the Amen. The enemy would set on disparaging remarks as to a divinely raised-up leader, in the magnifying of imagined or actual weaknesses, in order to discredit the truth, in relation to which he has led the saints to victory. We see this illustrated in Gideon, and might well turn aside for a moment to refer to the opening of @Judges 8. The men of Ephraim disputed with him sharply, so to speak, but in the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, Gideon answers them in terms of fruitfulness: "What have I done now in comparison with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?" (@Judges 8: 2). His soul has been steeped in the thought of a yield for God. He was working in the wine-press at the start; he knew its true purpose, although for the moment he used it to thresh wheat, and he is seeking, as was Paul at Corinth, to bring in all the brethren responsively, as distinct from the opposers. We have to take warning from the subsequent movements of Gideon, which bring him into contrast with Paul. For in accepting honour from the saints, as expressed in their earrings, he opened the door to an aftermath of the conflict, which works out devastatingly in his son Abimelech in the next chapter (though God meets it in the trees of Jotham's
{357}
parable). We can see that if there is not a consolidation of the position, and a unification of the saints in the truth, the door is left open through lack of vigilance (as with Gideon at the end) for the resurgence of the opposition from a fresh angle. I am only alluding to all that to show the urgency of getting the ground cleared. I trust we shall see in Ezra this afternoon, the great vindication of queen Esther in regard to all these matters, in the positive fruits and spoils of victory, in fresh openings up of the truth, which, after all, is the divine objective in all conflict. Let us never go into conflict for conflict's sake; let us always bear in mind that the issue of conflict, in its fullest extent, is the Ephesian ministry.
C.P.H. Would the letters of Mr. Taylor enlighten us as to past phases of the conflict, so that, in paying heed thereto, we might now be able to keep step with our brethren in the conflict?
P.L. I am sure that is so, and that takes us on to the end of the book of Esther, where the devotion of Mordecai and Esther is to be perpetuated in the minds of succeeding generations, through the establishment, on the calendar of the Jews, of the feast of Purim. In other words, we do not enjoy the blessings of recovered truth without appreciation and continual thanksgiving to God, in relation to those who have so waged battle to assure it.
J.P. We would like further help as to the king being won over by Esther, and reaching a point where he says to queen Esther, "The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the fortress, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? And what is thy petition? and it shall be
{358}
granted thee; and what is thy request further? and it shall be done" (chapter 9: 12).
P.L. The king's enquiry as to what has been done in the rest of the king's provinces is a very searching challenge. We may feel that we are getting on a little in our locality, but what about the testimony universally? Do we have assembly ears? How are the brethren getting on in America, in New Zealand, or any other universal setting? Esther did not answer that enquiry. I have no doubt she knew the answer, because the assembly does know; the assembly has ears. But the king's challenge is searching in regard for instance of our meetings for prayer. While not insensible to immediate local needs, we are there in priestly power to voice assembly needs universal, and that involves a general knowledge of current war news, so to speak, that is to say, what is transpiring in the conflicts for the testimony universally. Later, Nehemiah calls upon all those engaged in the rebuilding of the wall to support one peculiarly assailed position. It is in prayer that we afford this succour to our hard-pressed brethren elsewhere.
D.C.W. In regard to the matter of extermination, of which you have spoken, had you in mind that as matters may arise in a place, things should be thoroughly followed up at the time, and not allowed to lapse?
P.L. Well, this spiritual ministry and the exaltation of Mordecai is collateral with the hanging of the ten sons, and the Jews fighting for their lives. For Mordecai is not yet given universal glory until the last chapter, though we have suggestions from chapter 6 onwards which speak to us of a continual presentation of Christ in diverse features
{359}
of His glory. We have referred to three of them. We might say of the first, in chapter 6, that the leading round the city of the man whom the king delights to honour indicates the way in which the Lord gets His place with us morally, as in the Lord's supper, according to Corinthians. Secondly, in Colossians, the way He gets His place with us personally. It says as to Mordecai in chapter 8: 15, He "went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a mantle of byssus and purple". That suggests to our minds, "Christ is everything, and in all". "And the city of Shushan shouted and was glad" -- are they not to do that according to @Colossians 3: 16, "teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God"? Then according to @Ephesians 1, it is a question of what Christ is made officially, answering to what Ahasuerus makes Mordecai in chapter 10, which speaks of "the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him". So firstly we have his exaltation in regard to Christ's place with us morally; secondly, His place with us personally in relation to who He is; thirdly, His place officially in relation to all things -- that is, the universe of bliss.
F.E. Those three features, which you have presented to us as to Christ, as ministered to the saints, would no doubt greatly help to carry them body-wise in any conflict. Would that be the reason why there is no opposition to Esther's petitions?
P.L. I think so. Mr. Darby writes, after a time of conflict, 'now, let us get along with Christ'. I am sure that, after the foe's defeat, the ground has to be consolidated,
{360}
for the enemy will counter-attack, and the consolidation and unification of the saints lies in the ministry of the exaltation of Christ.
J.P. So it is when Mordecai is first exalted, as sitting upon the king's horse and acclaimed, that he becomes a type of Christ? Previous to that he prefigures the spirit of Christ?
P.L. Yes, as seen in a good lead, telling Esther that she must die. What other lead spiritually could you give the brethren in a crisis? You die to see it through. Asking counsel in spiritual quarters may help, but Mordecai's word is 'die', which is the solution alone to every question.
J.G.C. In dealing with matters of the aftermath, are these letters in Esther and Mordecai's name not important?
P.L. Yes; the writing bears on permanency; and the feast of Purim is established in wonderful wisdom. As prefiguring Christ, what a man Mordecai is in unifying the saints. In Shushan, where the trouble arose, there is double battle, and double feasting universally as a result. There was one day's fighting in the provinces, and two days¬ in Shushan. Consequently, at the time of the conflict, the day of rest in Shushan did not coincide with the day of rest in the provinces. So to preserve and promote the unification of the saints universally, two days of resting and feasting were established in the feast of Purim, so that the saints universally might, in a united way, commemorate the devotion of persons who saved them from extermination through Haman's dark designs.
H.J.M. What had you in mind about all these various letters? Is it not in persons that the writing takes place, and
{361}
then the sealing comes in?
P.L. Yes, indeed; the apostle Paul alludes to the Corinthians as Christ's epistle, "known and read of all men" (@2 Corinthians 3: 2, 3). It is the idea of things being secured subjectively and permanently, as in that chapter. God is the subject, Christ the writer, the ink the blessed Spirit, and the writing material the fleshy-tabled hearts of the saints.
H.J.M. And in Revelation, the great book of conflicts, we get, "I will write" (@Revelation 3: 12). There are several other allusions to writing in that book. It involves what stands in living impressions in the saints. And what would you say about the sealing?
P.L. It represents divine authority. It means that things are not going to die. I think that the recent book reviewing the conflicts of the testimony is a reminder to us to keep the feast of Purim. Further, as has been remarked, the letters of our brother Mr. Taylor are calculated to contribute to the perpetuation of the feast, so that it is always present to our minds; because we ourselves are the calendar in which the feasts are inscribed. We shall find all these thoughts of feasting and joy developed in Nehemiah, in relation to the feast of tabernacles. It awaits the sequential unfolding of the truth as found in @Nehemiah 8.
C.P.H. Is it a feature of the moment that the little ones are coming vitally into the testimony? It says in chapter 8: 11, "that might assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey".
P.L. Yes, the little ones are a special object, too, of Satan's attack. Later Nehemiah exhorts the wall-builders to fight for their brethren, their sons and their daughters, their wives and their houses (@Nehemiah 4: 14).
{362}
W.B.H. The reversal of Ahasuerus¬ decree, as requested by Esther in chapter 8: 5, was not just an annulment, but put the onus on the Jews to take the initiative against all that would cause them hurt.
P.L. Yes, what a day it is when the throne is moved to action! We may wonder at Ahasuerus¬ tardiness at the beginning, but we may read into it God's determination that He will have full warrant morally in the features set out in Esther, for what He will do manifestly in support of His saints in the conflict. It is to the humble Galileans that the Lord says, "Behold, *I* am with you all the days, until the completion of the age" (@Matthew 28: 20).
A.G.W. The Jews were to gather themselves together in every city and stand for their life (chapter 8: 11).
P.L. Yes, 'gather together' is a fine expression, as indicating the unifying power of Mordecai's ascendancy. The thought of gathering together finds development in relation to Ezra's ministry, as we hope to see this afternoon: "All the people gathered together as one man … and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses" (@Nehemiah 8: 1). As the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities, "no man could withstand them; for the fear of them had fallen upon all the peoples. And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors and officers of the king, helped the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them. For Mordecai was great in the king's house … for the man Mordecai became continually greater" (@Esther 9: 2 - 4). We might say that he now prefigures Christ as Son over God's house, and judgment begins at the house of God.
J.G.H. How would you regard the matter of the
{363}
reviewing of an assembly judgment; what basis would we look for in doing that?
P.L. Well, one cannot lay down any formula. If there has been unconstitutional practice, or worse, an assembly trespass, a sin-offering should be brought to the door of the tabernacle, according to @Leviticus 4: 13 - 21. But then the enemy in imitation, has taken that thought, and at times has made it a weapon in the hands of murmurers who, so to speak, would like Haman's case to be reviewed, because it is *their* case, in the sense that they have not yet hanged his sons. I have to recognise that what everyone of these ten sons represents is in me. It is remarkable that each of their names is given in chapter 9: 7 - 10, indicating that I have to name them severally in myself, in order to have part in the hanging of them collectively.
J.P. What has been said as to the difficulty of tracking this thing down is very real. It is sometimes met in the most decisive way in ministry, and if each one takes to oneself the edge of the ministry that is brought to bear upon the matter, it would be settled. But, practically speaking, we find it raising its head again, indicating that there is refusal to accept the edge of the word given by the Lord to settle the matter.
P.L. Because what is represented in the hanging of the ten sons goes against human sentiments, but it is a divine and spiritual necessity. The scaffold was a very high one. It refers, typically, to the cross, where men intended to remove Christ for ever, but in it God has, in Christ, removed man in judgment.
W.B.H. Does not Paul confirm that in @2 Corinthians 13: 3 - 5, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me"
{364}
-- that is to say, his ministry was challenged -- "examine *your own selves* if ye be in the faith; prove your own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates?"
P.L. That is very important, because insistence in whisperings as to re-investigation of past assembly judgments is often allied with indifference to present spiritual ministry.
W.B.H. It is really the ministry which the enemy is attacking all the time, is it not? As you said earlier, the great issue is the Ephesian position, and the enemy is constantly trying to divert the saints from the truth of that, by bringing up past matters in an attempt to discredit any who have legitimate authority in the truth.
P.L. He would seek to prevent us from arriving at what @Esther 10 sets forth in a spiritual way, and if we do not reach that, we shall not get to the unfolding of the truth, and all the exercises attendant on it in relation to Ezra and Nehemiah. We shall not discern the intent of divine Persons in their activities in this great assembly revival. To be professedly in it, and to miss the gist and marrow of it, would be sorrowful beyond words.
L.F. Is it important for us in our day to get hold of what God has before Him, as you have mentioned in relation to chapter 10? God has before Him the matter of heading up all things in the Christ, has He not? And all the conflict has to be viewed in the light of that.
P.L. That gives us a priestly approach to battle. The horse-gate, that is, the militant gate, is repaired by the priests according to @Nehemiah 3: 28. Sometimes, success in conflict is jeopardised by lack of a priestly state,
{365}
demeanour and action. Phinehas in @Numbers 25, is an example of a warrior-priest.
H.S.D. A very subtle form of attack is that which does not openly oppose an assembly judgment, but expresses dissatisfaction as to the way in which it was carried out. Can you say more as to that?
P.L. It is an old device of the enemy. We are publicly in crippled conditions, and no one comes out of assembly conflicts with medals. Is it not so, that we all feel humbled and chastened, because there is always something that might have been done better? Let us suppose, by way of illustration, that a house has caught fire, and some ornaments have been broken in the battle to extinguish it. If the owner afterwards makes claims for damages, he beclouds the whole issue, by magnifying a detail incidental to the accomplishment of the rescue.
R.G. It says, "they laid not their hand on the prey".
P.L. Yes, three times that is said; there is the reversal of every natural feature in these Jews; they are not seeking anything for themselves in the conflict. They stand for genuineness in spiritual inwardness that would repudiate the thought of a reputation for self, but would seek that all the glory should be God's. We have in chapter 10 a glorious climax, already anticipated in the saints in the light of @Ephesians 1, where Christ is seen as set over all things, and His consort is beside Him; but the relation of Mordecai to Esther is not that of Christ to the assembly. That is why, it may be, that Esther is not mentioned in the last chapter.
W.B.H. Up to this point, Mordecai's advancement seems to have depended upon Esther.
{366}
P.L. Yes, but now no longer; and yet we love the thought that He who has secured everything for us will have, in the day of His appearing, a yield from those who delight to contribute to His glory, whether now or in *that* day.
G.J.D. What is the significance of the tribute upon the land and the isles of the sea?
P.L. It impresses one with the extensiveness of the dominion under the king's hand, far beyond the bounds of Israel, the universe of bliss, no doubt, is in mind. The tribute suggests what we have in the doxologies, such as the one in @1 Timothy 1: 17. "Now to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages. Amen". Then we have the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, looking on to Christ as the Sun and Centre of the universe of bliss. It is his greatness to which the king advanced him. In this setting the glory is God's supremely. The city that magnifies Christ in the coming age is God's city.
D.C.W. Does the emphasis on the matter of Purim, as confirmed by the decree of Esther, and written in the book, precede Christ in figure having this exalted place?
P.L. Yes, that is important. Whilst the display of Christ's glory is God's answer to His conquest through suffering, and the Lord's supper must be the basis of all our calling to mind; the feast of Purim, in its application to us, brings to our minds the devotion of those who have taken character from Him, as laying down their lives for the brethren. As we keep the feast of Purim, by recalling the devotion of such as Paul, Priscilla and Aquila, and sufferers for the testimony in our day, our souls become
{367}
imbued with the greatness and glory of Christ, for whom such faithful warriors of His lived and died, to make Him great in the hearts of the saints. One is reminded of the men just come from Babylon in @Zechariah 6: 14 who, having been engaged in crowning Joshua the high priest, who is typical of Christ, are themselves to have crowns in the temple. I believe Mr. Darby, and other leaders since his day, who, as refusing to accept honours in the religious world, have consistently laboured to crown Christ before the assembly, are now crowned, so to speak, in the temple, in the confidence and appreciation of the spiritual. The diligent pursuit of their ministry is bound up with this.
Finally, we have this last reference to writing, in chapter 10: 2: "are they not written in the book of the chronicles?" The whole subject of writing in the book of Esther is one that we could well look into. These simple suggestions, culled from a book which, in divine inspiration, is purposely veiled, may stimulate us to look further into it as we have opportunity. We might write across the book of Esther: "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing" (@Proverbs 25: 2). The very obscure character of such a book but invites closer investigation in diligence and spirituality.
R.C.R. The last verse does not refer to Esther, but to Mordecai, his brethren, his people, and his seed, suggesting three testimonial features in which the saints are viewed.
P.L. What a fine climax this is! "For Mordecai the Jew was second to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews". Where is Christ great? Not in the cathedrals of the
{368}
world, but among those who stand vitally related to Him, and who already furnish Him testimonially with a sphere for the expression of His greatness. Later we shall find that Nehemiah has one hundred and fifty Jews at his table. Indeed, I think we shall discover many threads of the book of Esther gathered up in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah which we have in mind to consider this afternoon.
L.F. As reviewing this tenth chapter, would we see that the practical activities, flowing from true subjective state, result in the exaltation of Christ and the welfare of His people?
P.L. Yes. Mordecai is "accepted of the multitude of his brethren". Let us see to it that we do not elect ourselves out of such a company. Then he is "seeking the welfare of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed". Peace according to God is the divine objective to which all true conflict for the truth is directed.
A.G.W. "For Mordecai the Jew was second to king Ahasuerus".
P.L. He is typical of Christ as the great Operator for God, in the day of His glory and power as in @Ephesians 1. The Christ is the One who does things for God. The rights of the throne in the world to come will be exercised by the exalted Man, the Christ of God.
{369}
FAITHFULNESS TO GOD AND HIS THRONE (5)
P Lyon
@Ezra 7: 6 - 16; @Nehemiah 8: 1 - 18
P.L. The purport of alluding to these scriptures now, is to trace how faithfulness to God and His throne, as seen in the book of Esther, paves the way for spiritual revival in relation to God's supreme interest on earth -- Jerusalem (for us the assembly) -- where His testimony is to be enshrined and His service assured. In this connection one has in mind the great liberation of spiritual ministry which has followed conflicts for the testimony. Paul, as engaged in grappling with the powers of darkness in the Roman prison, commends his ministry to Timothy. He says, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2: 7), and in chapter 3: 10, "But *thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct …" He goes on to speak of the great value of the Scriptures. All bears on the devoted zeal in men of God who, in reproach, have stood in the breach in conflict, leading us to victory in view of free entry into the truth. There is no thought that we should settle down self-complacently; but we are to give ourselves with zest to the spiritual investigation of the truth temple-wise. It is for us to participate in the recovery to the assembly of that which belongs to it, lost over many centuries through the faithlessness of the assembly publicly. We are also to prove that the latter glory of the house, in moral features, is even greater than the former, according to @Haggai 2: 9.
{370}
While the apostolic days in their glory are not to be repeated, there is an excellency of grace which 2 Timothy suggests in Paul's intimacy with Timothy, and the constant allusions to what is "in Christ Jesus". It all indicates that there is an intervention of divine Persons, peculiar to the last days, in the way They put their hand to assembly recovery, with results worthy of the love that so acts. At the same time, as to outward conditions, we are kept humble in the sense that it is "the day of small things" (@Zechariah 4: 10).
There are in these two books of Ezra and Nehemiah threads that link on with the book of Esther. For instance, one hundred and fifty Jews does Nehemiah take to his table every day, as if he took his cue from Mordecai the *Jew* (indicating reality) with whose history he would, no doubt, be acquainted. It was in Shushan, the very place where Mordecai and Esther had stood for God, that Nehemiah is found at the opening of his book. There is a link, also, between the much writing in the book of Esther, and the thought of "Ezra … the scribe". When saints are scattered geographically, written ministry is of great importance, and this is emphasised in a broken day in Paul's request for the books, and especially the parchments (@2 Timothy 4: 13). Then, again, the spirit of laying down one's life, which shone in Mordecai and Esther, is continued in Nehemiah. When his enemies sought to intimidate him, he replied, "Should such a man as I flee?" (chapter 6: 11). It is as if the feast of Purim, in its moral implication, is being celebrated in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah; because the consolidation of the position is evidenced in the extent to which the spoils of the victories gathered, are bound up
{371}
with the liberation of heavenly ministry. It is this which makes way for the celebration of the feast of tabernacles, according to @Nehemiah 8, bringing us into the realm of the service of God in its higher elevations, in relation to which we are being greatly helped by the Holy Spirit. The service of God is not developed typically in the book of Nehemiah, but it is provided for, we might say, in the personnel, Ezra himself being a teaching priest, and Nehemiah contributing priestly garments.
The consideration of all this indicates that we may view the book of Esther as preparing the ground with us in moral history, so that we take full advantage of the assembly revival, as appreciating in our measure the supreme intent of divine Persons in furnishing it. The closing of our ranks militantly in the testimony of our Lord is stimulated by Nehemiah, and developing us in priestly state, intelligence and enquiry into the truth in view of the service of God, is promoted by Ezra's ministry.
J.P. As thinking of apostolic days, we have often wondered at the word that the latter glory of the house shall be greater than the former. There seems to be a peculiar glory attaching to recovery; and whilst that word in Haggai would have primary application to the millennial day, it bears fully on us now, does it not?
P.L. Yes, indeed; and we can trace in the post-captivity books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi some beautiful features of grace, that are not found even in the glory of the reigns of David and Solomon. The ark, at one time symbol of the divine presence in power, as at Jericho, had now under divine government been lost. The humble recognition of this by
{372}
the returning remnant thus calling the more for that *inward* and spiritual power accompanying the faith which is in Christ Jesus as in 2 Timothy.
R.C.R. So does what we get in Esther pave the way on the one hand for a greater flow of ministry, and on the other, for a greater interest in the truth on the part of the brethren generally?
P.L. Yes; you are now exploiting the spiritual territory for which you have been in conflict, and you look on the truth as part of your inheritance, not as an optional matter for non-combatants. It is your life, and you are going to enjoy it and pursue it now with your brethren. Ezra has to do with the son of the king Ahasuerus of the book of Esther. In @Ezra 7: 14, 15, we again have allusion to the seven counsellors of the king, who may figuratively be likened to "the seven Spirits which are before his throne" (@Revelation 1: 4). Not only are these seven counsellors to be viewed in militant character, as meeting an attack on the throne according to @Esther 1, but also as standing in relation to the throne in support of the truth. For they have part in the sending of Ezra to Jerusalem, and are associated with the king in freely offering silver and gold "to the God of Israel, whose habitation is at Jerusalem".
D.C.W. Would you say a little more as to the link in @Nehemiah 1: 1 with the book of Esther in relation to Shushan the fortress?
P.L. We come up through the militant exercises of the book of Esther, and find in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah that the objective is nothing short of Jerusalem. The very feature of conflict carried forward to the book of Nehemiah converges on the defence by the builders of the
{373}
wall of Jerusalem. We may regard the spiritual exercises in the book of Esther as the background to this great revival developed in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. As to Ezra personally, it is to be noted that his genealogy is established right back to Aaron. Every christian who has the Spirit can, or should, trace his genealogy to Christ; he has no other. Further, the Spirit's comment as to Ezra is that he had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it and to teach in Israel the statutes and ordinances. It indicates that it is now a question of grappling, not with Haman, but with the truth, which opens a fresh chapter of even greater spiritual testing.
H.J.M. "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth" (@2 Timothy 2: 15).
P.L. Exactly. Ezra's going to Jerusalem is spontaneous: "this Ezra *went up* from Babylon" (@Ezra 7: 6), and then in verse 9: "the project of *going up* from Babylon was determined on". There was a going *out* in Esther's day in relation to the foe, now there is a going *up*, with Jerusalem as the objective, and elevation always tests the inward strength of our spiritual constitution. The element of spiritual inwardness and genuineness, set out in the Jews of the book of Esther, lays the basis of spiritual constitution for the Ezra-Nehemiah revival. As already remarked, what a place Nehemiah gives to the Jews at his table -- "there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews" (@Nehemiah 5: 17). They were never absent, it would seem; fine weather, poor weather, the Jews are there at the prayer-meeting, reading-meeting, all the meetings, so to speak.
{374}
H.J.M. Some of us feel, as we are getting older, that we have lost much through lack of devotion and diligence in relation to the truth. Would there be a word here for the younger men in the prime of their lives, to give themselves wholly to these things?
P.L. Is it not so that there is scarcely one in Scripture, taken up pronouncedly by God with whom He did not start young? Joseph, seventeen years of age, David a lad among the sheep-folds, and so on.
H.J.M. One has been struck by that.
P.L. We see in Ezra no human forcefulness, but a priestly spirit of grace and dignity, promoting among the saints the element of enquiry temple-wise, with body feelings, as we would now say. Apparently he was in Jerusalem for thirteen years, before he was brought forward in the opening up of the truth according to @Nehemiah 8. Many moral questions had to be taken up by Nehemiah (for which, indeed, God sent him to Jerusalem) involving the repair of the wall and the gates and so on, before the people could be unified in relation to the truth. Ezra did not push himself forward, but during this period of seclusion with God, he would be looking into the law of God and, in priestly discernment, learning to apply it to the exigencies of his day. He was content to wait till the then existing difficulties had, under God, been in a measure resolved through the spiritual leadership and influence found with Nehemiah. Ezra now goes forward in the simplicity of spirituality. Nehemiah humbly makes way for him, according him the leading place in the first choir (@Nehemiah 12: 36). Nehemiah himself, the governor, recognised that administration was not an end in itself, but was to be
{375}
maintained authoritatively, that the saints might be secured in entire submission to the truth in relation to God's service and testimony. We all of us want to be developing in true spiritual perspective and balance in the truth, appreciating it as one great entity, as illustrated in the tabernacle so varied in its component parts, yet, according to the divine pattern, one complete whole, constituting God's habitation in the wilderness.
H.S.D. When you speak of the throne as in support of the truth (according to the suggestion in @Ezra 7: 14, 15) you have in mind the principle of authority working here among the saints in view of making way for the truth?
P.L. Yes, it is now a question of divine authority in Paul's ministry being recognised submissively by the saints. The expression "the Lord stood with me" (@2 Timothy 4: 17) surely bears also on the Lord's determination to stand by Paul's distinctive ministry as to Christ and the assembly until the end, Paul being viewed as the architect of the assembly: so to speak. We are favoured to have part in the divine recovery to this at the end of the dispensation, and submission of the saints thus to what is distinctively Pauline has drawn forth the Lord's manifest support amidst much felt weakness on the responsible side.
J.P. Are we to link the support of the truth in regard of Ezra with what we have in Luke's gospel?
P.L. Yes; the matter of genealogy that Luke traces, in regard of Christ, is to God Himself. Our spiritual genealogy stands related to our being born of God. It is a question of spiritual generation coming in to support the truth, as seen in the expression "the Jews" found in these books.
{376}
W.B.H. The service of God being now in view, would the support given by the throne to Ezra's going up to Jerusalem be reminiscent of David's rule in Jerusalem in view of God's service?
P.L. That is the point. David was placed by God on the throne in Jerusalem, to administer in relation to the blessing of Israel, but supremely and ultimately in view of the service of God, in which David had so large a part.
R.C.R. Is the truth to be sought out for its own sake, first of all, not primarily with a view to giving it out? According to @Ezra 7: 14, he is sent by the king and his seven counsellors "to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem;" so that the assembly is largely in mind in regard of the truth.
P.L. Yes. It is called "the pillar and base of the truth" (@1 Timothy 3: 15). As you suggest, we do not primarily look up scriptures in view of serving others, necessary in its place as it is; we read them as seeking food and light, and further we sit among our brethren temple-wise, as enquiring into the truth. Then what we may receive as together thus, should give assembly character to our levitical service in general, as directed by the true Eleazar, the prince of the princes of the Levites.
It is as coming to Jerusalem that Nehemiah disconcerted the enemies of God's people. "It grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel" (@Nehemiah 2: 10). Nehemiah's operations in Jerusalem are prefaced by his sojourning three days there. How his relations with God concerning the holy city would deepen and strengthen in this three-day period, according to the moral import in the Scriptures of
{377}
the numeral three, which so often bears on resurrection power in testimony. He thus develops in spiritual stamina in relation to God's chief interest -- Jerusalem -- to deal with all that might obstruct its realisation by the saints available, however difficult the day. Having sorrowfully surveyed the ruined condition of Jerusalem, he calls upon his brethren to rise up and repair the walls. The inveterate hostility of the foe now finds expression in a form yet more subtle because of its imitative character, Nehemiah's enemies assuming to have a portion and a right in Jerusalem (@Nehemiah 2: 20) which claim he strenuously refutes. It was among the returning captives, not the ones still remaining in Babylon, that this sorrowful situation had come about, because they had not followed up God's sovereign intervention in their favour. It is true that the original conditions of ruin had been allowed in divine government upon the nation, Nebuchadnezzar being the instrument of it under God's hand many years before. But while "Lo-ammi" (@Hosea 1: 9) was still written over the nation publicly, it was for faith to discern that there had been a divine intervention in grace on behalf of the returning captives. The apathy which allowed such a sorrowful situation to continue unchallenged, testified to spiritual weakness with those who had returned. Nehemiah was peculiarly raised up as a man of God to stir up the saints out of this inertness; and what a spiritual leader he became in so doing. The faith and courage in which he saw to the completion of matters long outstanding, paved the way for Ezra's more spiritual service of opening up the truth. The assembly revival must fail in its divine intent if it stops short of the establishment of the saints in the
{378}
Spirit's power in the full range and varied features of the Pauline ministry as to Christ and the assembly. This covers the ground from the foundation laid in his assembly work at Corinth, to the top-stone of it in the Ephesian epistle.
R.C.R. Does this emphasise the need of resolving difficulties that may be amongst us, so as to be quite free to be fully occupied with these things?
P.L. Surely. According to @Haggai 1: 2, the people had become discouraged through difficulties, and were saying, "The time is not come ... that Jehovah's house should be built". But Haggai brings home to them, in his prophecy, that their discouragement found its roots in their settling down in their wainscoted houses, preferring them to God's house. Having waned in their interest in it, they were made to cease building by external force, until Haggai and Zechariah stirred them to action, both by the prophetic word, and by example, and that without any immediate royal permission. Now Ezra goes up to Jerusalem. The expression "this Ezra" (chapter 7: 6) laying emphasis on his personality, as one divinely commissioned in spiritual authority in relation to the truth. Ezra is accredited according to the stability of the throne; "Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, an accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens, and so forth" (@Ezra 7: 12). So that the throne's intervention in appreciation of the moral worth and ministry of Ezra, can be likened in a veiled way to the Lord's continued support of what is peculiarly Pauline in character. Without this the mind of God as to the assembly, whether as related to God's service, or His testimony, cannot be reached and worked out. The sovereignty of God in the raising up of a
{379}
distinctive vessel in regard of ministry is always bound up with the moral worth in such a one that will spiritually accredit the truth. Hence the word in @2 Timothy 3: 10, "But *thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance" and so on.
R.C.R. Is that to guide us in our following up of written ministry, so that we discern the line of spiritually accredited, authoritative ministry?
P.L. Yes, and it is important to recognise that the divine authority as to it abides, although the vessel, who was raised up to give expression to it, may depart. So we have in @Hebrews 11: 4, in relation to Abel, "having died, he yet speaks".
R.C.R. Yes, and we can say of the Lord's servant, now no longer with us, that his voice still speaks in the ministry, and the young ones, and all of us, should thoroughly follow it up.
P.L. Quite so. Artaxerxes writes, "I have given orders", these standing in relation to the respect in which Ezra is to be held. It suggests that the authority of the throne will not permit of an optional spirit, which would select from ministry what suits it, at the expense of the truth as a whole, ever searching in character, but so blest as humbly appropriated and maintained. But may we not view as a spiritual suggestion the king's expression "and so forth" as entering into his salutation to Ezra the priest, "an accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens" (verse 12)? However formal might have been the use of the words "and so forth" by other letter writers (as in @Ezra 4: 10, 11, 17) the Spirit's record of the expression
{380}
in relation to such a one as Ezra opens the door to spiritual enquiry as to it.
H.J.M. Does that bring forward the matter of the communion of the Spirit? Ezra has the law of God, he has directed his heart to it, to do it, and to teach it. But in the "so forth" is there a suggestion of the communion of the Spirit, involving that Ezra is to be trusted in his application of the truth, and that he gives a spiritual touch and import in relation to it, as he brings it forward?
P.L. Whilst only touching such an expression very lightly, it might, as taken up here by the Spirit of God, bear on the manner, tenor, and spirit of things found with Ezra himself. It reminds us, in a way, of the book of Deuteronomy, which is not the formal law as given in Exodus, as from God to Moses. Deuteronomy brings forward a law, which Moses enunciates. That law was to furnish spiritual manners, and promote spiritual features proper to the inheritance, which the book of Deuteronomy has particularly in mind, leading on to the service of God.
H.J.M. In that regard one has been very interested in the number of times the hiatus occurs in the Old Testament. It is as though there is something more than what lies in the letter of that which is expressed, and provides for the communion of the Spirit in spiritual meditation over what is suggested.
P.L. Yes, indeed. The hiatus invites the spiritual soliloquy of John, expressed in his "I suppose" in the last verse of his gospel. It defeats theological reasoning, and opens the door to spiritual reflection, not only as to what is said, but as to what is omitted. It is to be noted that in several instances where the hiatus occurs, the Spirit is
{381}
looking on to Christ.
We should now pass on to the book of Nehemiah. We saw previously that in the book of Esther the Jews were gathered together against their enemies in relation to the matter of Haman. Now, as stirred up by Nehemiah, they are rallied in view of the positive features of construction, and the conflict necessary to defend this (chapter 2: 18 and 4: 20). When we come to the matter of the truth, and the interest prevailing as to it, we are told that "*all* the people gathered together as one man to the open place that was before the water-gate" (chapter 8: 1). This illustrates the spiritual progress that marks the saints in that spontaneous interest in the truth, which is a precious feature pertaining to these last days. It leads on to the unity in song, under the direction of Ezra and Nehemiah, at the dedication of the wall (chapter 12). "The open place that was before the water-gate" suggests the Spirit as recognised in liberty. Anything less than "the open place that was before the water-gate" is a parochial and limited sphere, restricted within the human limitations of orthodoxy. The people spoke to "Ezra the scribe". There is respect for spiritual leadership as set forth in him; and "the book of the law of Moses" suggests that they were intent upon looking into the truth as one great whole.
H.J.M. Why does it say, "he read in it ... in presence of the men and the women, and those that could understand" (verse 3)?
P.L. It is good to see the sisters brought into these things, and the young ones get impressions too. "The seventh month" speaks to us of the crown of Israel's agricultural year, the time of in-gathering. "Thou crownest
{382}
the year with thy goodness, and thy paths drop fatness" (@Psalm 65: 11). We are privileged, in these last days, to have part in this crowning period. The Spirit is in-gathering the best in tillage and vintage, as promoted by all the varied seasons, to assure the service of God in its perennial freshness, variety and substance, as set out here in relation to the feast of tabernacles.
D.C.W. You were referring to the people looking into the truth as one great whole; are we to follow Paul's word to Timothy, "Have an outline of sound words" (@2 Timothy 1: 13)?
P.L. That is very important, because the enemy will attack us if our minds are not bulwarked with the truth, forced into them in sequential teaching in the school of Tyrannus, by divinely selected vessels ministering in the Spirit's power. To use an illustration, an architect has an arduous course of training to the end that his mind may be imbued with the idea of construction, so that he can view abstractly what is to be built, and regulate all his operations concretely according to the plans. What an urgent feature this is, if we are to proceed constructively assembly-wise!
L.F. Is one distinctive feature of authoritative ministry that it brings forward the truth as a whole? Has not the breakdown in christendom come about through trying to divide the truth up?
P.L. Yes, the theological mind seeks to pigeon-hole divine things, so to speak, and thus loses all. But a spiritual conception of the truth preserves it in the mind as one entity, each of its component parts standing in relation to the whole according to the divine plan. It is stimulating to
{383}
take account of the sustained interest in the truth on the part of the people; they continued from the morning until mid-day, and still desired more. The inheritance, for which they have fought, they are now exploring.
There is instruction for us in the high stage of wood, made for the purpose, on which Ezra stood. Wood has a great place in the book of Nehemiah. We have timber mentioned in chapter 2. The king had given Nehemiah a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's park (see note *d* to chapter 2: 8), which was evidently close to Jerusalem. In the preservation of that park, with its potential timber, God, no doubt, had in mind the rebuilding of the wall, for which much timber would be required, and it is remarkable that a Jew was put in charge of it. No doubt there would be some saplings in that park upon which Asaph would keep his eye in view of their ultimate use in the rebuilding of the wall. Asaph is a type of the blessed Spirit, and how watchful He is as to potential material for the building of the wall of separation. We would surely, in the spirit of Nehemiah, desire to claim the young ones among us -- not yet in Jerusalem, but in the environment of the assembly -- that they might be serviceable for the strengthening of the wall in relation to Jerusalem, and as furnishing support for rule -- because Nehemiah requests timber also for the gates of the governor's house. Wood, in Scripture, generally speaks of manhood according to God. We might say, perhaps, that the wood in the park under Asaph is a view of the saints in Romans, in view of the Corinthian wall-building, according to the first epistle. In 2 Corinthians we may see what answers to the high stage of wood. In chapter 1 of that epistle Paul alludes to his
{384}
preaching of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and associates Silvanus and Timotheus with him. They are presenting another order of man. It is not a theological pulpit of human domination, but it suggests the spiritual elevation connected with the anointing, according to the word, "and has anointed us" (@2 Corinthians 1: 21). It is a provisional structure, made for the purpose, but it is made of material that bespeaks another Man, and those who characteristically stand on that high stage of wood are preserved in their ministry. Finally, in the book of Nehemiah, we get allusion to wood for burning; the wood-offering is mentioned in the last verse of the book. So we have wood potentially in the park, wood constructively in the acceptance of assembly obligations, and wood in the burning, in the sacrifices of love, to assure the service of God. The sweet savour of the offerings could not go up to God, without the consumption of the wood, laid in order, on which the sacrifices are placed. In each of these instances in Nehemiah, wood bears on the order of man which is essential to assembly recovery. We cannot have the truth vitally, apart from being formed after Christ, in the order of man in which alone it can be maintained and set forth.
F.R.H. So that in Haggai's prophetic ministry, he says, "Go up to the mountain and bring wood" (@Haggai 1: 8).
P.L. Exactly. Now Ezra opens the book in the sight of all the people, and they are engaged with the truth worshipfully. It says that they stood up; they are all attention. "He that has an ear, let him hear" (@Revelation 2: 7). The beneficiaries of a will, when called together to hear its contents, are all ears. The sense of our participation in
{385}
divine thoughts should stimulate us in relation to this faculty of hearing, crowned, as it is here, with the spirit of worship. It is to be noted that in verse 8 it says, "And they read in the law of God distinctly out of the book, and gave the sense". Ezra's leadership has made way for others to come into the matter. Leadership in authority in the truth is calculated to promote mutuality in spiritual consolidation. On the other hand, we are not to be governed by democratic feelings, lowering everything to one level.
J.G.H. So it says that Ezra was above all the people (verse 5).
P.L. Yes, while the gathering together on the first day called forth soul feelings, on the second day, when the chief fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Ezra, rein is given in the teaching and atmosphere prevailing, to what pertains to spiritual understanding. Their diligent investigation of the truth results in a fresh discovery, relating to the feast of tabernacles, the climax of all the feasts. The revival would fall short of its objective, if it did not reach the divine climax, whether in the testimony militantly, or whether in the service of God. Hence we should be ready for fresh discoveries of what may have remained hidden hitherto.
R.C.R. They came to gain wisdom. We want to understand these great things that are coming out in our day.
P.L. Yes, indeed. What diligence and patience marked the early gold prospectors on this continent, and, speaking humanly, what success crowned their strenuous efforts! Should we not be marked by the noble Berean spirit that habitually delves and digs in regard of the truth, and never
{386}
without a spiritual yield, when we are dependent alone on the blessed Spirit. Spiritual conditions among the saints furnish that atmosphere of holy enquiry in which the truth is drawn out, and beaten out amongst the saints temple-wise, as they are sustained in body feelings.
J.P. I believe that is the way the saints have been brought into this very understanding of things. The ministry as to the hill of God, bearing on the mid-week reading, and the stimulation afforded as to temple enquiry, has helped us much over the past fifteen years.
P.L. Exactly. So on this second day they find written in the law that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month, and immediately they act upon it. Going forth to the mount involves spiritual energy, and they bring down branches of these various trees, suggestive of the spiritual variety found among the brethren. It is to be noted that the mention of the wild olive-branches is made between that of the olive-branches and myrtle-branches. We may, perhaps, regard Eutychus in @Acts 20, as illustrating the thought of the wild olive-branch. How calculated to weaken will (of which the wilderness speaks) is the merging with brethren who evidence the fruit of divine cultivation! The young are to be greatly encouraged to merge with those who are marked by spiritual maturity. The trend with the young, at times, is to gravitate to youthful company. That is sometimes evident after the close of a meeting, when spiritual impressions might well be followed up among those whose maturity and capacity, in relation to the things of God, enable them not only to receive spiritual thoughts, but to diffuse them. The youthful Jacob's affinity with his
{387}
grandfather Abraham, as to divine things tended, no doubt, to leave an indelible mark upon him. We are told in @Hebrews 11: 9 that Abraham dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. It would appear that Jacob would have been no more than fifteen years of age when his grandfather died. The feast of tabernacles bore upon the fact that the children of Israel had sojourned in their tents, as set closely together in divine ordering round the tabernacle in the wilderness. Hence the keeping of the feast was calculated to promote intimacy in regard to spiritual things.
D.C.W. In relation to these booths, they begin by making them, everyone upon the roof of his house.
P.L. Yes, that is where you begin, is it not? A spiritual man knows well how to entertain his visitors "upon the roof", in nearness to heaven, in the light of Ephesian ministry. He would recoil from the thought of taking them into the cellar, so to speak, to gossip there about the brethren. "In their courts" would bear more on what is public and testimonial, as set out in the epistle to the Romans. Then there is the thought of "the courts of the house of God". When the time comes to go on to the reading, we do not find it far. In one sense, it is the continuation and filling out of the conversation on the roof; though the distinctive character of our gathering together in temple enquiry must be preserved in our minds and hearts.
D.C.W. What you say is very helpful; indeed all that you have been bringing before us in these meetings is to promote with us a continual desire after what is spiritual.
P.L. And the question is, have we come to the house
{388}
of God from our roofs -- the place of communion with God? It was on the house-top that Peter received the heavenly vision (@Acts 10). We come also from our courts, the testimonial sphere, where the rights of God are maintained. If we come from those two settings, we shall come contributively. Then how attractive is "the open space of the water-gate". It suggests that the Spirit is given a free hand and a free way. Further, there is "the open space of the gate of Ephraim". Let us ever maintain an expectant attitude in relation to the recovery of missing brethren; for Ephraim represents the ten tribes, carried away in captivity.
H.J.M. Ephraim is brought forward so blessedly in the prophet Hosea, in relation to the greatness of God in recovery, is it not? And the meaning of Ephraim's name is 'double fruitfulness' (@Genesis 41: 52, note *c*).
P.L. Yes, indeed. We might say, who of us would be here today but for the gate of Ephraim, so that we keep that gate open, in our spirit and demeanour, and availability to all the saints.
R.C.R. What helps those from without, as coming along, is the great gladness found amongst the saints.
P.L. Yes; as the feast of tabernacles is kept by us, they will find an atmosphere prevailing that is always encouraging to enquiring souls. They will be impressed with the love and unity marking the brethren, and with the fact that the divine objective, whether in relation to God's service, or His testimony, is governing them. The Spirit's reference at the end of verse 17 to the glorious days of Israel under Joshua is very stimulating for us. Whilst we cannot publicly return to the pristine days of the assembly
{389}
in apostolic times, we can humbly prove, in the present operations of divine Persons in this great assembly revival, the blessed character of what was originally set up by God here, as abiding here unimpaired in the Spirit's power.
What a spiritual climax is reached according to the last verse of @Nehemiah 8! "Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they observed the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance". While "seven" is suggestive of completion in the Spirit, "the eighth day" is brought in as a heavenly crown to the seven. The numeral "eight" in Scripture bears upon the gathering up of what has preceded in the "seven" and goes through to eternity. But the "eighth day" must be kept distinct in our minds from the bearing of "the first day of the week", conveying the thought of an entirely new beginning, introducing an order of things which has no end.
J.G.C. Is not every company, and every saint, responsible to read? I was thinking of the injunction to Timothy (@1 Timothy 4: 13), and also to the saints in Colosse to cause the epistle to be read to all the brethren, and also the epistle written to the saints at Laodicea (@Colossians 4: 16).
P.L. That is very good.

FEMININE DEVOTION TO THE THRONE
P Lyon
@1 Samuel 2: 6 - 10; @Proverbs 31: 1 - 10; @2 Kings 11: 1 - 4
I had in mind to dwell on royalty, seen supremely in Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords; then further, on the defence of the throne subjectively, as seen in the feminine characters before us in the scriptures read. We surely cannot but be impressed by this feminine devotion to the throne, which shines in the three scriptures before us. The throne involves all that God is doing in His rights here on earth testimonially, ere He manifestly establishes His claim to the whole scene, when "the kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ" (@Revelation 11: 15) shall have come. Before the Heir to the universe appears in glory, God's rights are cherished in relation to Christ, the One who secured them at such a cost at Calvary, and who, as Son over God's house, now maintains them for God here in the assembly. We can trace this feminine support of the throne throughout Scripture, depicting what is worked out subjectively in the saints at the present time. Light alone will not preserve the rights of the throne inviolate in our souls; it is a question of anointing the King, and that continually. In other words, it is a heart matter, bringing us to own the unchallengeable domination of the Lord Jesus in our minds and hearts.
You will remember how God spoke to Satan in relation to the seed of the woman, testifying to his doom. Her suffering in pregnancy and travail would be great, but
{392}
the results would be worth all the suffering, and far more. She had undermined the throne in disobedience to divine command, and had let in the foe with disastrous consequences. How precious, that the very one who had so failed, and had brought in the disaster through self-gratification, should, through maternal travail in suffering, have part in bringing in the only One who could deal with the fruits of the disaster, and reveal God as above all the evil which had come in. We are in the testimonial setting here in all the scriptures before us, because the throne does not bear upon the service of God, as does the sanctuary, but on the rights of the King, the Heir of the universe, so soon to be displayed without challenge. Whose rights are now to be maintained in the presence of every challenge. In the support of these alone can the service of God be assured.
Adam was evidently affected by what he heard. Before he listened to God's words, addressed directly to himself as to the discipline which would be his portion in toil, he was attentive to the divine announcement to the serpent, as to the seed of the woman. Not a word of complaint does he utter as to his richly merited discipline (which in God's goodness was divinely calculated to render him safer outside the garden in self-judgment, than within it in innocence). But he lays hold of the precious light afforded as to the incoming of Christ, and immediately salutes his wife as "the mother of all living" (@Genesis 3: 20). We should not have known that Adam had faith, but for this utterance. A disciplined person, exercised by divine chastening, regards the saints with respect. Rest assured, that a fault-finding saint among the brethren
{393}
betrays a refusal of discipline. But how blest it is to observe that God reserves to Himself the right to speak directly to the subjects of His grace about the discipline His love sees necessary. He does not tell it to the enemy. "And to Adam he said ..." (@Genesis 3: 17).
Being what we are, in our fallen condition, we must be secured afresh in the formative work of His grace, as Paul could say, "By God's grace I am what I am" (@1 Corinthians 15: 10). Discipline, in constant toil and suffering, is in the divine curriculum, for it belongs to the way of the bringing in of Christ, the Seed of the woman. So that Adam, as now subject, would feel that it was all worth while, and he addresses his wife with respect: he calls her "Eve", because she is the mother of all living. What an outlook he now has! We know how the discipline of a son, according to Hebrews, places him at large in the divine domain. "But ye have come to mount Zion" (@Hebrews 12: 22) says the writer to the Hebrews, after speaking of the Father's chastening. What a galaxy of glories is there unfolded to our view, all for our spiritual understanding and enjoyment. But if we are to be in the joy that centres in Christ in that realm, we must be in accord with God's mind, set forth in Christ in His death, and accept death as the order of the day. As submitting to his discipline from God, Adam becomes a contributor, and saints all down the ages have had the gain of his brief but pungent utterance, as well as of the sorrowful warning resulting from his exposure. For what are we ourselves, other than Satan's easy prey, if we exercise our wills in disobedience to the divine will?
This utterance on Adam's lips, so condensed and full of holy interest, invites spiritual investigation. What does
{394}
it convey? That the channel of the disaster shall, in grace, as divinely renewed, become the means of bringing in Christ, as God's answer so blest to the disaster, and infinitely more. It is thus that Eve comes before us as the mother of all living. One loves to think of that husband and wife, committed to the common path of suffering, for their own preservation in a scene of evil, pausing amid the toils of the way to salute one another in the grace of redemption. Let us see to this matter of mutual respect, lest the material affairs of the household dominate the situation. Important as they are in their place, they are but transitional and provisional. What abides is the spiritual relation between husband and wife as "fellow-heirs of the grace of life" (@1 Peter 3: 7). We may say that these two became such, Adam leading the way now. He once surrendered his headship to listen to his wife in relation to an evil course. Now he asserts his place, not as lord to his wife, but as head to her, and he salutes her in relation to God's thoughts about her, to which he had paid full attention. It is urgent that we hear in such manner so as not to forget what reaches our ears: "he that has ears to hear, let him hear" (@Matthew 11: 15). Adam had earlier, through his wife, lent his ear to the foe instead of to God; now he listens to God in regard of his wife, and he keeps things on a high level. They are going to have their sorrows in divine government, their first son a murderer, the second a martyr; but they are going to reach Seth, representing an established order of things, for his name means 'appointed'. "For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel" (@Genesis 4: 25). Eve regards Seth as in the divinely appointed way of the bringing in of the King -- not
{395}
that the kingly thought is developed here, but what is in view is the glorious triumph of Christ over the enemy, crushing the serpent's head, as laying bare all his schemes.
Feminine devotion to the throne is a blest theme throughout the Scriptures. It is seen pre-eminently in Mary the mother of Jesus. How often, in those early chapters of Matthew, we read of "the little child and his mother"! (@Matthew 2: 13). Herod, usurper of David's throne, has no other thought than to destroy that little Child; but the divinely destined Occupant of Jerusalem's throne, and of that of the universe, is the meek and lowly One, the Man after God's own heart, the King. In the meantime, Mary is favoured with the maternal care of the little Child. In so doing she portrays the character of the testimony in difficult times, the foe taking advantage of the weakness of the situation, with murderous schemes. For the dragon, according to @Revelation 12, is waiting destructively for the Man-child to be born. He hates Christ, for in Him the serpent has met his doom; although not finally manifested in divine judgment, it is with God a settled matter; but Satan is assured of it, and knows that his time is short. Hence his deadly opposition to the domination of Christ as the one Man for God in the hearts of the saints. Therein lies the incessant battle, bound up with the conflicts of the testimony.
Now in regard to Hannah, she lived in a day when conditions in Israel were very weak. Eli, the high priest, is heavy and insensible as to what is due to God. What is to happen? Shall Hannah retire from the field irresponsibly? She is but a weak woman; her husband is marked by lethargy -- a most depressing element -- and with it, hand in
{396}
hand, goes self-complacency. "Am not I better to thee than ten sons?" (@1 Samuel 1: 8) he asks! *He* thought so, and advertised it to his own exposure, little knowing that down the ages this utterance of his would furnish warning to the saints, whilst Hannah and her son, Samuel, have furnished stimulation and buoyancy to the whole generation of faith that has come after them.
You remember how she is misunderstood. Humbly she tells her story. Her circumstances of sterility have helped her. Things which apparently are most against us, are actually most in our favour. To quarrel with our discipline is to question the wisdom of God, who has sent it. Our own folly at times may have brought us into it, but it is no less the ordering of God for that, for God triumphs over our failures, to bring about, in His government through them, the fruits of the grace He is determined to establish with us.
We shall find, when we come to Hannah's song, that it issues in the introduction of the King. He is to be brought in by Samuel. It is a man that Hannah desired from Jehovah. She will have her own suffering part in bringing him in, and he is to be furnished in the locality. Travail is largely a local matter. The locality is given; it is Ramah, meaning 'heights', suggestive of an elevated level. An assembly atmosphere in elevation is very productive and stimulating in relation to spiritual travail over the bringing in, in character, of that one blessed Man, who is the only Man for God. That is the issue, dear brethren. In God's ways persons are brought down. "Jehovah killeth", Hannah says. He employs drastic methods, but grace fully warrants them with us in the
{397}
results obtained. We would, of course, prefer a milder form of discipline. Killing means death; death is the order of the day. But then He "maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up". He is also, through grace, the God of resurrection and thus blest as such. It is God all through; she is on the divine line, as in the secret of God, and she surveys divine activities, as actuated by divine love for God's people, so unworthy of it, and so often insensible to it. Her travail prophetically was along the line of the cross. What would her words mean in divine teaching to us, short of "the word of the cross"? (@1 Corinthians 1: 18). Having referred to the killing and making alive, she goes on, "Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich". We are in the 'making' period, dear brethren. Disciples have to be *made*, according to @Matthew 28: 19. Faith sees God in all this processing, and praises Him in it. It appears as if Hannah cannot say a word, without bringing Jehovah into it. How blest and abiding is such a service! It is a beautiful quota of praise to the psalter of the saints. Hannah is fully in it, as faith loves to be when things are on the ebb-tide of human break-up, especially in what claims God's name, as depicted in the decrepitude of Eli and the wickedness of his sons. In spite of it all, Hannah is buoyant -- 'Higher and higher yet' (`427:5). It is prophecy that is going to bring this about, as set forth in Samuel and others. "The spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus" (@Revelation 19: 10). It is not a matter of looking into what this nation and that one are going to do. We are not insensible to what is transpiring among the nations, but we know that the prophetic ministry has in mind the delineation of the Heir of the whole scene. The solemn judgments of God, made
{398}
known in the book of Revelation, are to make room for the assembly as it appears at the end of the book. Why is that? Because the assembly is the alone vessel that can make room for Christ. It is at the close of the book of Revelation that we read, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come" (@Revelation 22: 17).
We have a touching scene as Samuel comes before us in chapter 3. His relations with God, dear young people, began early; yours cannot be too early! He was, as we might say, in a weak meeting, but yet not God-abandoned and therefore to be respected, and the best made of the weakest conditions. That is a good apprenticeship for a prophet of God, who is going to make known the mind of God for all Israel. Later, we find that no word of Samuel's fell to the ground and we also get his mission to anoint David. It is true that he was commissioned to anoint Saul first, but only to make room to bring in David, as to whom God said to Samuel, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he!" (@1 Samuel 16: 12). Blest mission, anticipated by his mother in her prayers, for she was in the divine secret that God would furnish a Man after His own heart, and every man must make way for Him! The pleasure of God, the service of God, and the blessing of His people, would all be secured in that blessed Man, prefigured in David, but standing out in His own eternal lustre as David's greater Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. So Hannah closes her prayer by saying, "Jehovah ... will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed". Someone might protest, 'You are before your time, Hannah!' But she is not before the times in heaven's records; she has an understanding of the times, and knows what Israel ought to
{399}
do. Long before David was anointed, and finally made king in Hebron and later at Jerusalem, she anticipated the divine end, in the confidence that divine power and love would bring it about in the man of God's own selection. David was taken from the sheepfolds, and set in Zion in God's sovereign choice, as moved by love divine for His poor faithless people, and moved still more in view of the satisfaction of His own love, which alone He would assure in the man after His own heart, particularly in His service so rich and blest. In what spiritual feeling did David lead in furnishing spiritual contributions to the psalter, and in the giving of his own property to provide for the building of the house! He had been divinely enriched that he might minister to God in that service of praise, in which God accumulates wealth for Himself, in answer to the dispensing of His infinite grace to the unworthy objects of it.
In @Proverbs 31 we see set forth in king Lemuel the extension of the thought of royalty in Christ. We now have figuratively before us rule in the house of God. How deeply concerned is the mother of king Lemuel, as to the way in which he should conduct himself! She has been the wife of David, who is no longer on the scene. Is she going to retire as a queen-mother? Is the assembly to retire from her maternal concern? Lemuel's mother alludes to her womb, and to her maternal vows! How poignant is her language! Her concern is as to how the son of her vows is going to act, as in the place of rule for God! What a wealth of instruction the preceding chapters of Proverbs afford in divine wisdom as to behaviour in God's house! Is Lemuel to view all that objectively, or is he going to be the
{400}
embodiment of it, as the fruit of maternal teaching? I admit that teaching in the house of God is not a woman's part, nor does the assembly teach; but how much there is to learn from "our mother" (@Galatians 4: 26)! In Paul, the Galatians could take account of one who, as profiting by the teaching of that mother, was marked by grace and liberty. He could say, "I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20). As rich in love's wealth, he would allure them from their poverty-stricken condition, interspersing his ministry with rich allusions to sonship, new creation and the Israel of God. Not that he could develop such themes in writing to them, because legality makes for babyhood, and we must have manhood in maturity to enable us to enter into the fulness of divine thoughts. They had really been claiming Hagar as their mother, and had learnt thus Ishmael's manners, with all the mocking and rivalry of Christ that marked him. Legality puts one on a pedestal, whilst grace brings us into the dust, making Christ everything to us, and man nothing -- happy solution to all our difficulties! There is no solution, save in the ascendancy of Christ in the view of the saints and in the resulting formation in their hearts, expressed characteristically in their spirits and reflected in their ways and thoughts. The unchallenged ascendancy of Christ will be the solution to every difficulty in the coming age, and surely it is so morally now!
What help the mother of king Lemuel can afford him! With what deep feeling does she address him: "O son ... O son"! In the previous chapter, Solomon, under the name of Agur, gives an account of how he grappled, in company
{401}
with Ithiel and Ucal, with problems too wonderful for him. He speaks, among other matters, of the four things, little, and exceeding wise; and of four "comely in going" (@Proverbs 30: 29). But whilst his observations are valuable, perhaps we may say that he does not get very far in the solution of these problems as speaking to Ithiel and Ucal, suggestive of the personnel of the assembly. But now in chapter 31, what help he is getting, for our mother helps us as no-one else can help us, in a devotion that has no restricted hours of labour, because the love that has so laboured from the outset will continue on the same lines. Dear young people, do you respect the assembly? Do you rise up and call her blessed? She is depicted here as speaking warningly, nurturingly and encouragingly. She is all that a mother should be in so comprehensive a way. The assembly is our mother. Surely no one seeking to serve the Lord, in administration, or in ministry of the word, would think of by-passing the assembly. Lemuel, now that he is in the position of kingship, has never needed his mother more. What has marked the kingly element among us in leadership in the assembly, is great respect for our mother. The letters of our brother, Mr. Taylor, now with the Lord, witness to a Lemuel's instruction by his mother. He would not depart from the motherly spirit of the grace of the dispensation, nor from the law of the house into which he had been instructed by his mother (verse 5).
We have here, in @Proverbs 31: 1 - 9, a variety of exercises that must be faced, if strength and intelligence for rule is to be maintained without any deterioration. Such exercises involve self-restraint and a readiness to surrender what might in some quarters be regarded as indispensable;
{402}
but it is the mother who is, under God, indispensable -- in other words the assembly from that point of view -- and as under her influence, no surrender is a hardship. Rule for God must have the assembly behind it, and whatever service is rendered to the Lord is to be toned and coloured by the influence of the mother of us all, and thus suited to the dignity of those served, as belonging to the vessel which is the supreme object of the heart of Christ, His assembly.
Then in @Proverbs 31: 10 the question is raised, "Who can find a woman of worth?" Paul is seen in his kingliness among the Ephesian elders in @Acts 20, and then the mystery is introduced. Kingliness among the saints individually, in sonship liberty, will furnish a heavenly influence to draw them into the glorious divine secret now made known -- the Head in heaven and the body here. So, while as yet the mystery could not be made known in @Proverbs 31, having established kingliness as under maternal influence at the beginning of that chapter, the Spirit is free to go right forward with the enquiry, "Who can find a woman of worth?" She has to be found, and we each one have to find her in oneself; for we shall not find the assembly elsewhere, till we find it in ourselves. That is to say, the assembly is not an idea; it is Christ substantially in the saints. However conscious one may be of feebleness, these desires *are* with us that are set forth -- the woman of worth in such fulness.
Passing on to @2 Kings 11, what a scene we find there! The murderess Athaliah is outwardly dominating the situation. She has sought to destroy all the seed royal -- hidden persons, like Chloe and Stephanas of the approved
{403}
at Corinth, who stand for the Lord's rights in the presence of all that would challenge them -- bedridden sisters, it may be, in the locality, stedfast for what is due to the Lord in the assembly, not parleying in unholy compromise, not swerving an inch in regard of the rights of the throne, even in a day when the murderess is active to destroy all the seed royal. How Paul loved to salute them at Rome. He furnishes a list of trusted defenders of the throne, content to be hidden. But in @2 Kings 11: 2 there is but one who is preserved from Athaliah's murderous activities, and it is through the maternal nurture of Jehosheba that he is hidden and preserved until the time of his showing in royal dignity. What a field is open to the sisters! How large a part they have in hiding the seed royal, in nurturing the young in the rights of Christ, not pushing them forward to become Athaliah's prey! Jehosheba is the daughter of a king, and the wife of a priest -- a spiritual combination, found in a woman with motherly features in a dark day, maintaining the royal rights, as only a king's daughter can do, in the holiness that characterises one of the priestly family. It is under such maternal influence that the seed royal is nurtured in secret until the time of display. Then the climax is reached, and the seed royal appears -- those obscure persons, as Stephanas and Chloe at Corinth, whose names are given us because they are attached to the throne in its stability, as bound up with the blessed Man alone worthy to occupy that throne. He is already enthroned, through grace, in our hearts, soon to be known in His kingship universally. He is now on His Father's throne, and it is for us to maintain His rights here in the presence of the devastating Athaliah spirit that would
{404}
destroy everything subjective with the saints as bearing on the Lord's rights.
It is this feminine defence of the throne that one would commend to you, dear brethren. Manpower is urgent indeed, and we have to own to the shortage of it. We have been considering Mordecai as an overcomer, maintaining unflinchingly the rights of the throne. He would stimulate each one of us in relation to masculine defence of divine rights in this scene, reaching its climax in the appearance of Him who comes forth with his followers to deal in overwhelming judgment with all who are found combining against the throne. But then if God makes known, through the prophet, that "the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son" (@Isaiah 7: 14), Him who is to be the great Deliverer, in conditions outwardly so small, rest assured that nothing but subjective formation, after Christ, can be trusted to maintain His rights in the ever-succeeding crises of the testimony. A true mother travails to propagate the features of the one who is the ideal of her heart; and in our localities it is a matter of travail that Christ might be formed in the saints. That is essential to the ground being held. It is the maternal influence and teaching that alone assures the kingliness in which rule for God is exercised, and that in a day dark and difficult, giving faith and spirituality an opportunity, never to recur, to be embraced in fervent love as of the divine nature. May the Lord bless the word!

YOUTH IN THE TESTIMONY
G R Cowell
@Exodus 24: 4 - 8; @Matthew 21: 12 - 16; @1 John 2: 14 - 17; @Revelation 21: 7
I wish to speak a word especially to the youths. When I speak of the youths I refer to young men and young women because, in christianity, both men and women are called upon to take up priestly, levitical and military service. From that standpoint we have to regard the idea of the male as suggesting the energy God looks for in all of us, in accepting these responsibilities. The early chapters of Numbers show that we are all called into service. There is no exemption from military service in the divine system. Neither is there any exemption from levitical service. From a month old and upward, all the Levites were numbered for it; and we are all priests, by birth, there is no age limit as regards priesthood. What a priestly boy Samuel was, lying in the temple of Jehovah where the ark of God was!
God has called us to the very greatest things. He would give us tonight a sense of the greatness of the dignity conferred upon us to be called of God. The greatest calling which the creature has ever known is ours; greater than any angelic calling, greater than the calling of Solomon and David, or any one in the Old Testament. If we understand this we shall see that our career here is to do the will of God, and everything else is incidental. He
{406}
will care for you as to other matters if you seek first His kingdom.
God's kingdom is set out in the early chapters of Numbers. They are kingdom chapters. In @Numbers 23: 21 it says, "the shout of a king is in his midst". The kingdom is an ordered system where everybody is placed in a military, levitical and priestly setting, around God's habitation. God has called you for that, and that is your real business on earth. I wonder if every boy and girl here realises what his business on earth is? Your business is to fulfil the obligations, which are also immense privileges, which God has laid upon you by His calling. That is your business. You say, I have my living to get. God knows that, He will help you in that, and, in helping you in it, He will order for you so that you have the job which will help you in the best way in relation to His interests. It may not be the job *you* would have chosen, but you will find, as time goes on, that God has ordered your path and given you the kind of occupation in your life here, which will best fit in with those spiritual obligations which are your real business in life.
The Lord Jesus is the great model. At twelve years old He said, "did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?" (@Luke 2: 49). Twelve years is a very important age. The Lord has shown that it is an age at which we can make it manifest that we understand what our business in life is. It is a very good age for committal, because at that age you have not begun to let your own will work about your career. Committal at that age means that you have accepted God's career for you, before you are called upon to decide what your ordinary occupation
{407}
should be, and that is a very great advantage. Think of a boy or girl of twelve coming to it that his business in life is to do the will of God. If that is accepted you will find that God will help you in a remarkable way, although it may not be in the way that you expect.
John says "all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father" (@1 John 2: 16). The natural man plans his career in relation to those three things, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. And the word is "the world is passing, and its lust". You have to measure time against eternity. You are surrounded by an attractive world, which offers you many opportunities to gratify the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. You may say, I am going to give myself up to these things. I will be a respectable citizen, I will not offend the moral code of the United States, but at the same time I am going to make the finest earthly career I can. I would like to have everything around me, and about me, which will gratify the pride of life, so that my school friends will say, I wish I were like him. See how well he has done, see what a fine home he has! If that is your objective it is a very poor thing. It is an objective which will never satisfy your heart. Even if you achieve your ambitions, God may say to you, "Fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee" (@Luke 12: 20). All that you have lived for, and lived in, is left behind for someone else. Death is a fact which we are very slow to face. So we have to measure time against eternity. "The world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity" (@1 John 2: 17).
{408}
Nearly two thousand years ago, there was a great emperor reigning, Caesar Augustus, and there was a king, Herod the tetrarch, and there were other notabilities. They were filling the public eye. They all had their ambitions, and away in a small town near Jerusalem, a Babe was born, and He was wrapped in swaddling clothes and placed in a manger. He was far beneath the notice of Caesar Augustus, far beneath the notice of the other notables! What did His birth matter to them? We have the privilege of looking back. Where is Caesar Augustus? What remains of his works? He is only a name. His glory and his works are forgotten. What about the Babe laid in Bethlehem's manger, who came to do the will of God? He abides for eternity, in His glorious manhood!
Wherever you go in the commercial world today, whether Japan, or elsewhere, everyone who writes a commercial letter admits the greatness of Christ. They have to date their letter, the year of our Lord. Even if they do not believe in Him they have to date their letters from the date of His birth. That is God's overruling hand. He is determined that men, even if not in their hearts, should have to recognise tacitly that Christ is the greatest Man who ever lived. What would Caesar have thought, if you had told him that in a remote town in his empire, a Babe was lying in a manger (there being no room for Him in the inn) and that in years to come the whole commercial world would be dating their letters from the date of His birth?
Later there was an emperor Nero. What is left of him but a bad name and a record of evil works? At that time a despised man, Paul, the offscouring of all things, was using Caesar's roads. God had made Caesar build them for
{409}
Paul and the evangelists. Caesar was used as an instrument to help the gospel forward. The Romans who made the roads, and Caesar and his works are forgotten, but Paul's work remains. "He that does the will of God abides for eternity". Paul's gospel is preached still to the uttermost parts of the earth. The assembly, which he was used to establish, is still here, and we are privileged to come into it.
Now I want to encourage you with the fact that God needs the young people. The testimony requires them. Young people are always in the forefront of the testimony, just as in war-time the young men are sent into the front line. Therefore, if the testimony is to prosper, we must have young men and women committed to the will of God. It is the young who are under men's eyes, it is the young they are looking at and noticing. And so the past dispensation began with priestly activity on the part of youths in @Exodus 24. Moses built an altar with twelve pillars, but it says, "the youths of the children of Israel ... offered up burnt-offerings, and sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offering of bullocks". Think of the honour God puts upon youth, that the great priestly service, before the tabernacle was made, was inaugurated by the youths of the children of Israel. God loves to see young people functioning in a priestly way. You may say, How can young brothers and sisters have bullocks? Do they not belong to the old and mature? But the youths had them! So we would encourage young men and women to take up priestly service whether privately, or in the case of the young men, publicly and vocally in the assembly, because God will help you. What will impress strangers coming to
{410}
the meeting, is the sight of young men moving in spiritual energy. They take account of the old men, but they are especially impressed with the young. The enemy has no answer to it. He can say of old men, Their life is nearly over, they turn to these things in their dotage. But when young people are seen to be wholly in the truth, offering up bullocks, what can the enemy say? He cannot say christianity is a worn out theology then. He has to admit it is a living matter, that Christ still makes an appeal to the young, more powerful than that of any other leader that has ever lived; that He appeals to and holds the affections of youth. And so if you young men take up priestly service, God will help you to bring bullocks. You will be surprised at what you are able to do. He will help you even beyond your normal measure in the service of God.
And then if we turn to the present dispensation, how did it begin? Did it begin with a group of aged men? Not at all. Peter stood up with the eleven. Peter was probably the oldest, but they were a band of twelve men in the prime of life. Twelve young men, who had overcome the wicked one and had overcome the world, were standing for God, seven weeks after Christ had been crucified, in the very city where He had suffered. They were bearing His reproach, without the slightest hesitation, prepared to face the very sanhedrim that had condemned Him to death. What could the enemy do? Nothing! In such a situation the testimony went forward in power.
In passing, I would refer to one particular young man in the Old Testament. In @Exodus 33, Moses pitched the tent outside the camp, and afterwards it says Moses, "returned to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua the son of
{411}
Nun, a young man, departed not from within the tent" (verse 11). What an object of affection he was to God, a young man who would not leave the presence of God, God was more to him than all else. If God was to be found outside the camp in that tent, there Joshua would be; he departed not from within the tent. The word Nun means continuance. He was a young man who continued -- he went right through, and that is what God has in mind for every young person here. Your affections should be so held for Him, that you would not depart from His presence, but continue until you arrive at full growth in the apprehension of His purpose.
We could speak also of young men in the New Testament. Think of Stephen -- he was not an old man, but God committed His testimony for the moment to Stephen. How gloriously he carried it on, *an overcomer* completely victorious in his death. When men become violent towards a witness it just proves that his witness is irrefutable. When men have to resort to violence it shows they are defeated. That is what happened to Stephen, he went out in complete triumph over all his enemies. There was another young man there. Those who stoned Stephen laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. He was a most unlikely young man for the testimony, as men would think. Consenting to Stephen's death, he breathed out threatenings and slaughter, although he had seen Stephen breathing out nothing but the spirit of Christ. But he never forgot what he saw in Stephen. "When the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting" (@Acts 22: 20). How it pricked his conscience to see a man breathing out the spirit of Christ
{412}
in the greatest suffering, when he was breathing out threatenings and slaughter. And the result was the Lord appeared to that young man, and, the Lord having appeared to him, he took up the torch of testimony which Stephen had laid down, and carried it forward. It shows what God looks for in young men, you see. You are to carry forward the testimony.
And now I pass on to Matthew, because it speaks even of children there. At the close of the Lord's life the children were a great comfort to his heart. They were in the temple, and they were saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David". And the Lord says, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise". Now I want to apply this passage to our day. Similar things have happened in the closing part of this dispensation in which we live. It says, "Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those that sold the doves". He cleansed the temple, and that is what has happened in the last 150 years. The Lord Jesus raised up Mr. Darby, who went through the length and breadth of christendom, and exposed every evil practice. Morally he cast out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers. He overthrew everything in his ministry, that the enemy had brought in. If you had gone back to the temple in Jerusalem the day after, you would have found all the tables back, doves still being sold, and that is what has happened in christendom. A ministry has come in which has exposed everything. The fact that the false official priesthood around us has continued its old practices and
{413}
rejected the ministry the Lord has given will only add to the severity of their judgment.
Then the Lord says, "My house shall be called a house of prayer", and the Lord is helping us to understand this, and to understand how to pray. Following this, "blind and lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them". That has been a great feature of the revival. So called christian countries were filled with blind and lame people, when Mr. Darby was raised up. People who were blind as to the purpose of God, and as to the truth of Christ and the assembly, and people who had never learned to value the Spirit, so that they were not able to walk; they were lame; and yet they were pious souls. It says, He healed them, that is what has happened. Ministry has been given which has exposed all the practices of christendom, but alongside of it there has been a ministry which has opened the eyes of the blind. Men have seen, "what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe" (@Ephesians 1: 18, 19). And the lame have been made to walk. We have been taught to value the Spirit, and to learn what the Spirit would be to us. So that we are no longer held in legal bondage trying to keep the Ten Commandments, but have learned that "the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" (@Romans 8: 4). These are great results.
But then, at this point, the greatest result in testimony was the praise of the children. It shows the importance of the children being in everything. "Thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
{414}
bondman, and thy handmaid, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow" (@Deuteronomy 16: 14). They were all to be at the feast. It was the children who provided the particular testimony at this important time. "When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders which he wrought, and the children crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant". There was such a powerful testimony that these opposers were indignant, they did not know what to say. All they could do was to question the Lord, "Hearest thou what these say?" This is a very important matter. You can not be too young to be in this, you see. It includes the youths and the maidens, and even the children. If you really know the Lord Jesus you can be in this matter. Of course, in another way, it includes us all; we should all be in the spirit of babes and sucklings, marked by simplicity and receptiveness and dependence. The Lord's remark is, "have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?" Now this is a feature of the moment, *the perfecting of praise* out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. According to @Psalm 8: 2 from which this is quoted, it is this which silences the enemy and the avenger.
There is an internal enemy and an external one (see footnotes *o* and *p* to @Psalm 8: 2). Communism and Unionism are external. It is the infidel feature of opposition. The internal enemy, which will culminate in antichrist, is like the Romish system, and other opposing forces within the christian profession. Now the way God silences both enemies is by perfecting praise in the mouths of the saints, especially of the young people. Young men
{415}
and women filled with praise, afford a testimony which the world is bound to take note of, and to which Satan has no effective answer. They are a living testimony to the fact that Christ is just as sufficient as He was at the beginning of christianity. And it says that He has "perfected praise". I believe it is an important matter that praise should be *perfected* out of our mouths. The praise at any given time is to be commensurate with the way God is making Himself known. The testimony at that time was that Christ was the Son of David. The rulers refused Him as such, but this gospel traces his descent from David the king. That was the testimony at this time, and praise was perfected in these children saying Hosanna to the Son of David.
As things developed the praise would take on greater fulness, and that is what has happened in the revival. The blind have begun to see, the lame have begun to walk, and as the truth has been recovered so has the answering praise been perfected. One rejoices in what is going on at the present moment, because, through God's grace, the truth as to the Godhead has been recovered, and thus the worship of God in His greatness and majesty. And a particular feature of the moment is the way God is helping young men in the service of praise. I have been to many meetings where one could say that, in measure, praise has been perfected in the mouths of young men at the close of the meeting. We older ones have been thrilled to hear young men responsive to the current of the Spirit's ministry at the present time. *Praise perfected* is a great feature of the testimony. If we develop more and more in this, God may be pleased to bring more and more exercised souls into the morning meetings. It is there they
{416}
see the testimony in its greatest expression, God's name confessed in a sacrifice of praise (see @Hebrews 13: 15). It would astound many to see the young people and children happily in this service.
Now I pass on to John's epistle, where there is a challenge to the young. The young men are those who are expected to be carrying the burdens of the testimony. He says, "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong". How delighted we are to see young men who are strong, young men who have really committed themselves to the Lord, and devoted their minds to the truth, so that the word of God abides in them. We look around upon the young men and women here with great desire that you might apply your minds to the truth. It is the most magnificent exercise for the human mind as energised by the Spirit of God. Apart from the Spirit you could not do it. But the thing is to apply your mind to divine things, not as you would study a text-book, but in dependence upon the Holy Spirit. Do what Paul says to Timothy -- "Occupy thyself with these things" (@1 Timothy 4: 15). Let your mind always, when free, be in that direction, always open to receive impressions, always ready to follow up impressions. "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (@2 Timothy 2: 7).
So it says the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the wicked one. Now the wicked one is a view of Satan acting through antichrist. The little children in the next section are in danger of antichrist, but if they rely on the unction they will not be deceived by the antichrist. The unction gives them the power to discern what is truth and what is error. But I love to think of young men according
{417}
to God! They have overcome the wicked one, you could not overthrow them by error. If a Jehovah's Witness comes to the door, he will not disturb a young man in whom the word of God is abiding, nor will a Christian Scientist, nor will a person bringing any other of the revived heresies that abound around us today. They have no power over a young man in whom the word of God abides. Now we rejoice in young men and women like that!
But there is still something else to be overcome, that is the world. "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?" (@1 John 5: 5). Now it is incumbent upon all of us to overcome the world. If not, we shall be lost to the testimony. You may be strong and have the word of God abiding in you today, and you have overcome the wicked one. You can successfully refute false doctrines. But if you do not overcome the world, you will become a casualty as far as the testimony is concerned. The Lord is the great example. In the temptations there was no question of the Lord being tested by the wicked one. He is Himself the Truth. No error could have any effect on Him. That conflict would not come in there. But the enemy brought every feature of the world, of which he is the prince and the god, to bear upon Christ. He brought every allurement, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, but the Lord Jesus overcame the world. And so it is a question as to whether we are overcomers? The world is passing. It is folly to let the things of time outweigh the things of eternity. You will be filled with regrets sooner or later if that is your course. You will have missed an
{418}
opportunity never to be repeated. This little span of time should be used in relation to eternity, and the will of God.
So he says, "Love not the world, nor the things in the world". Satan would aim at your affections through the world. He would corrupt your affections, bringing in idolatry. Every lust is an idol, Paul tells us, because any lust comes between my soul and Christ. And so it says at the close of this epistle, "He is the true God and eternal life. Children, keep yourselves from idols". That is, keep yourself from every lust, everything that would draw your affections away from Christ. "If anyone love the world, the love of the Father is not in him". The way to overcome the world is to have the love of the Father in you, that is to let your affections centre on the One in whom the Father's affections centre. The Father loves the Son, and if the Father's love is in me, I shall love the One that He loves. The Father will not tolerate a rival to Christ. The Father is going to deal in unsparing judgment with anything that attempts to rival Christ. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand. He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him" (@John 3: 35, 36). The wrath of God is going to fall on everything, and every one, who sets himself up as a rival to Christ, and is not subject to Christ. And if the love of the Father is in us, it means that Christ will be our object and our motive, and we shall be delivered from the world.
Now @Revelation 21: 7 is the final word from the one sitting on the throne. The eternal state is being depicted in all its blessedness -- finality. "And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me".
{419}
Think of the grace of the One on the throne! After the majestic declaration, "Behold, I make all things new". He turns to his bondman John, and he says, "these words are true and faithful". They must be if *He* says them, but think of the grace which assures the heart of His bondman. And then it says again, "And he said to me", He turns to this bondman John again. His bondman was a lover. His bondman had been a young man who had overcome. He had overcome the wicked one, overcome the world, and had become a father; and yet he himself would never take any place but that of a bondman. And the One on the throne loved him. So it says, "he said to me, It is done". Think of coming into divine confidence in such a way that, in the setting of divine majesty, the One on the throne would turn to you and tell you certain things.
And then He goes on to say, "I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely". As much as to say, If these eternal things attract your heart, and have awakened desires in your soul, I will satisfy every desire. I want desires to come into *your* soul about eternal things. "He that does the will of God abides for eternity". They outweigh infinitely material things; and He would say to you if those longings are in your heart, I will give you "the fountain of the water of life freely". I will satisfy every longing of your heart after that eternal scene. God will surely do it. If you are on the path of His will, you are on a path of unending satisfaction. And then He says, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things". Now where are we to stand as to this? You are a young man, you have overcome the wicked one, the word of God abides in you; but have you overcome the world? There is the final word
{420}
from the throne, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things". Now what are we going to do about it? Are we going to be among the overcomers, and therefore to be owned in this setting of sublime and eternal majesty? "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". It is being owned as son in the setting of eternal majesty. You say, But we are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus. Certainly! Through the grace of God we are sons and know something of sonship in the family setting. But, even in a human royal family, not every son is worthy to be owned in the setting of majesty. We have experienced that. So the word here is, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". What a reward! In the greatest setting of majesty that could ever be conceived, he is owned as son.
May the Lord stimulate our hearts to go in for these things; to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, and to be marked by one purpose. This one thing I do, Paul says, "forgetting the things behind … I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 3: 13, 14). What I have told you now is the prize, "I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son". May the Lord help us, for His name's sake.
