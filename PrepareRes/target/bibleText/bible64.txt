{#3 John}
{1}
1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
2 Beloved, I desire that in all things thou shouldest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers. Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3 For I rejoiced exceedingly when [the] brethren came and bore testimony to thy [holding fast the] truth, even as *thou* walkest in truth. For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
4 I have no greater joy than these things that I hear of my children walking in the truth. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully [in] whatever thou mayest have wrought towards the brethren and that strangers, Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
6 (who have witnessed of thy love before [the] assembly,) in setting forward whom on their journey worthily of God, thou wilt do well; Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:
7 for for the name have they gone forth, taking nothing of those of the nations. Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
8 *We* therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-workers with the truth. We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
9 I wrote something to the assembly; but Diotrephes, who loves to have the first place among them, receives us not. I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
10 For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brethren; and those who would he prevents, and casts [them] out of the assembly. Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth [them] out of the church.
11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He that does good is of God. He that does evil has not seen God. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
12 Demetrius has witness borne to him by all, and by the truth itself; and *we* also bear witness, and thou knowest that our witness is true. Demetrius hath good report of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, and we [also] bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
13 I had many things to write to thee, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee; I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:
14 but I hope soon to see thee, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace [be] to thee. The friends greet thee. Greet the friends by name. But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] to thee. [Our] friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
