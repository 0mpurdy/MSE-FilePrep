10 Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness, for <i>theirs</i> is the kingdom of the heavens. Blessed [are] they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you, and say every wicked thing against you, lying, for my sake. Blessed are ye, when [men] shall revile you, and persecute [you], and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [is] your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
13 <i>Ye</i> are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have become insipid, wherewith shall it be salted? It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men. Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

15 Nor do [men] light a lamp and put it under the bushel, but upon the lamp-stand, and it shines for all who are in the house. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
16 Let your light thus shine before men, so that they may see your upright works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
17 Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets; I am not come to make void, but to fulfil. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
18 For verily I say unto you, Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
19 Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall practise and teach [them], <i>he</i> shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 For I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
21 Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; but whosoever shall kill shall be subject to the judgment. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
22 But <i>I</i> say unto you, that every one that is lightly angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment; but whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be subject to [be called before] the sanhedrim; but whosoever shall say, Fool, shall be subject to the penalty of the hell of fire. But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
23 If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
24 leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
25 Make friends with thine adverse party quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him; lest some time the adverse party deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
26 Verily I say to thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
27 Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
28 But <i>I</i> say unto you, that every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
29 But if thy right eye be a snare to thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
30 And if thy right hand be a snare to thee, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
31 It has been said too, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce. It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
32 But <i>I</i> say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for cause of fornication, makes her commit adultery, and whosoever marries one that is put away commits adultery. But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
33 Again, ye have heard that it has been said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn. Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
34 But <i>I</i> say unto you, Do not swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is [the] throne of God; But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
35 nor by the earth, because it is [the] footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is [the] city of the great King. Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
37 But let your word be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but what is more than these is from evil. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
38 Ye have heard that it has been said, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth. Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
39 But <i>I</i> say unto you, not to resist evil; but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other; But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40 and to him that would go to law with thee and take thy body coat, leave him thy cloak also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also.
41 And whoever will compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
42 To him that asks of thee give, and from him that desires to borrow of thee turn not away. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
43 Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
44 But <i>I</i> say unto you, Love your enemies, [bless those who curse you,] do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who [insult you and] persecute you, But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
45 that ye may be [the] sons of your Father who is in [the] heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust. That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
46 For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same? For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
47 And if ye should salute your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? Do not also the Gentiles the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do not even the publicans so?
48 Be <i>ye</i> therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

1 Take heed not to do your alms before men to be seen of them, otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
2 When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
3 But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does; But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
4 so that thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render [it] to thee. That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so that they should appear to men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
6 But <i>thou</i>, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render [it] to thee. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as those who are of the nations: for they think they shall be heard through their much speaking. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
8 Be not ye therefore like them, for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye beg [anything] of him. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
9 Thus therefore pray <i>ye</i>: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified, After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
10 let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth; Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven.
11 give us to-day our needed bread, Give us this day our daily bread.
12 and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors, And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
13 and lead us not into temptation, but save us from evil. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
14 For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father also will forgive you [yours], For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
15 but if ye do not forgive men their offences, neither will your Father forgive your offences. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
16 And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, downcast in countenance; for they disfigure their faces, so that they may appear fasting to men: verily I say unto you, They have their reward. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
17 But <i>thou</i>, [when] fasting, anoint thy head and wash thy face, But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
18 so that thou mayest not appear fasting unto men, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret shall render [it] to thee. That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust spoils, and where thieves dig through and steal; Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust spoils, and where thieves do not dig through nor steal; But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
21 for where thy treasure is, there will be also thy heart. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
22 The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light: The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
23 but if thine eye be wicked, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great the darkness! But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness!
24 No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
25 For this cause I say unto you, Do not be careful about your life, what ye should eat and what ye should drink; nor for your body what ye should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment? Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
26 Look at the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into granaries, and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are <i>ye</i> not much more excellent than they? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
27 But which of you by carefulness can add to his growth one cubit? Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
28 And why are ye careful about clothing? Observe with attention the lilies of the field, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
29 but I say unto you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these. And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
30 But if God so clothe the herbage of the field, which is to-day, and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, will he not much rather you, O [ye] of little faith? Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
31 Be not therefore careful, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we put on? Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
32 for all these things the nations seek after; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things. (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
34 Be not careful therefore for the morrow, for the morrow shall be careful about itself. Sufficient to the day [is] its own evil. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.
{7}
1 Judge not, that ye may not be judged; Judge not, that ye be not judged.
2 for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
3 But why lookest thou on the mote that is in the eye of thy brother, but observest not the beam that is in thine eye? And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Allow [me], I will cast out the mote from thine eye; and behold, the beam is in thine eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam [is] in thine own eye?
5 Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine eye, and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the mote out of the eye of thy brother. Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
6 Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, lest they trample them with their feet, and turning round rend you. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
7 Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
8 For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
9 Or what man is there of you who, if his son shall ask of him a loaf of bread, will give him a stone; Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
10 and if he ask a fish, will give him a serpent? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
11 If therefore <i>ye</i>, being wicked, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much rather shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask of him? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
12 Therefore all things whatever ye desire that men should do to you, thus do <i>ye</i> also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
13 Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter in through it. Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
14 For narrow the gate and straitened the way that leads to life, and they are few who find it. Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
15 But beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but within are ravening wolves. Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
16 By their fruits ye shall know them. Do [men] gather a bunch of grapes from thorns, or from thistles figs? Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
17 So every good tree produces good fruits, but the worthless tree produces bad fruits. Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a worthless tree produce good fruits. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
19 Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
20 By their fruits then surely ye shall know them. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
21 Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that does the will of my Father who is in the heavens. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
22 Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied through <i>thy</i> name, and through <i>thy</i> name cast out demons, and through <i>thy</i> name done many works of power? Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
23 and then will I avow unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, workers of lawlessness. And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
24 Whoever therefore hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock; Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
25 and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew and fell upon that house, and it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the rock. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
26 And every one who hears these my words and does not do them, he shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand; And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
27 and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell, and its fall was great. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his doctrine, And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:

1 And that [same] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea. The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
2 And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore. And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
3 And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow: And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
4 and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them; And when he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
5 and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth, Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
6 but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up; And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
7 and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them; And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
8 and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty. But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
9 He that has ears, let him hear. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
10 And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables? And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
11 And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given; He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
12 for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
13 For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand; Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
14 and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see; And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
15 for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. For this people's heart is waxed gross, and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and should understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
16 But blessed are <i>your</i> eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear; But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
17 for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them]. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see [those things] which ye see, and have not seen [them]; and to hear [those things] which ye hear, and have not heard [them].
18 <i>Ye</i>, therefore, hear the parable of the sower. Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
19 From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, then cometh the wicked [one], and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
20 But he that is sown on the rocky places -- this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
21 but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended. Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
22 And he that is sown among the thorns -- this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
23 But he that is sown upon the good ground -- this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth [it]; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
24 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field; Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
26 But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
27 And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel? So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
28 And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
29 But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it. But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
30 Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
31 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field; Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
32 which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches. Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
33 He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened. Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
34 All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them, All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
35 so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
36 Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
37 But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man, He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
38 and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one]; The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
39 and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels. The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
40 As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
41 The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness; The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
42 and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
43 Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
44 The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
45 Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls; Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
46 and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it. Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
47 Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind, Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
48 which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out. Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
49 Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just, So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
50 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
51 Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord]. Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
52 And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old. Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.
53 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence. And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
54 And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power? And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?
55 Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this [man] all these things? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this [man] all these things?
57 And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house. And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
58 And he did not there many works of power, because of their unbelief. And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
{14}
1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
2 and said to his servants, This is John the baptist: <i>he</i> is risen from the dead, and because of this these works of power display their force in him. And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.
3 For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother. For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put [him] in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
4 For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
5 And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet. And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
6 But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod; But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
7 whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask. Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
8 But she, being set on by her mother, says, Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist. And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
9 And the king was grieved; but on account of the oaths, and those lying at table with [him], he commanded [it] to be given. And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded [it] to be given [her].
10 And he sent and beheaded John in the prison; And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
11 and his head was brought upon a dish, and was given to the damsel, and she carried [it] to her mother. And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought [it] to her mother.
12 And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and came and brought word to Jesus. And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
13 And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities. When Jesus heard [of it], he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard [thereof], they followed him on foot out of the cities.
14 And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm. And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
15 But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves. And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
16 But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give <i>ye</i> them to eat. But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
17 But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes. And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
18 And he said, Bring them here to me. He said, Bring them hither to me.
19 And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to [his] disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
20 And all ate and were filled, and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
21 But those that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
22 And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds. And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
23 And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there, And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
24 but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
25 But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.
26 And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
27 But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is <i>I</i>: be not afraid. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
28 And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be <i>thou</i>, command me to come to thee upon the waters. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
29 And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
30 But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
31 And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt? And immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
32 And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell. And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
33 But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God's Son. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
34 And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret. And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
35 And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill, And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
36 and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well. And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
{15}
1 Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying, Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
2 Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
3 But he answering said to them, Why do <i>ye</i> also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching? But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
4 For God commanded saying, Honour father and mother; and, He that speaks ill of father or mother, let him die the death. For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
5 But <i>ye</i> say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever [it be] by which [received] from me thou wouldest be profited: But ye say, Whosoever shall say to [his] father or [his] mother, [It is] a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
6 and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching. And honour not his father or his mother, [he shall be free]. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
7 Hypocrites! well has Esaias prophesied about you, saying, [Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
8 This people honour me with the lips, but their heart is far away from me; This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with [their] lips; but their heart is far from me.
9 but in vain do they worship me, teaching [as] teachings commandments of men. But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.
10 And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand: And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
11 Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man; but what goes forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
12 Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended? Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
13 But he answering said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up. But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
14 Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of blind: but if blind lead blind, both will fall into a ditch. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
15 And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable. Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
16 But he said, Are <i>ye</i> also still without intelligence? And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
17 Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught? Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
18 but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile man. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
19 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies; For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
20 these are the things which defile man; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man. These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
21 And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon; Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
22 and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, [thou] Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
23 But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
24 But he answering said, I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel's house. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
25 But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
26 But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] to dogs.
27 But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
28 Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from <i>that</i> hour. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great [is] thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
29 And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there; And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
30 and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them: And great multitudes came unto him, having with them [those that were] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
31 so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
32 But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way. Then Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
33 And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd? And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
34 And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes. And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
35 And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground; And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
36 and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd. And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake [them], and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
37 And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full; And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets full.
38 but they that ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
39 And, having dismissed the crowds, he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan. And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
{16}
1 And the Pharisees and Sadducees, coming to [him], asked him, tempting [him], to shew them a sign out of heaven. The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.
2 But he answering said to them, When evening is come, ye say, Fine weather, for the sky is red; He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, [It will be] fair weather: for the sky is red.
3 and in the morning, A storm to-day, for the sky is red [and] lowering; ye know [how] to discern the face of the sky, but ye cannot the signs of the times. And in the morning, [It will be] foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O [ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not [discern] the signs of the times?
4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas. And he left them and went away. A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
6 And Jesus said to them, See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we have taken no bread. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have taken no bread.
8 And Jesus knowing [it], said, Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have taken no bread? [Which] when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
9 Do ye not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many hand-baskets ye took [up]? Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
10 nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took [up]? Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
11 How do ye not understand that [it was] not concerning bread I said to you, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? How is it that ye do not understand that I spake [it] not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
12 Then they comprehended that he did not speak of being beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then understood they how that he bade [them] not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
13 But when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, he demanded of his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am? When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
14 And they said, Some, John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others again, Jeremias or one of the prophets. And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
15 He says to them, But <i>ye</i>, who do ye say that I am? He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
16 And Simon Peter answering said, <i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
17 And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed [it] to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
18 And <i>I</i> also, I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
19 And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
20 Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ. Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
21 From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he must go away to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised. From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
22 And Peter taking him to [him] began to rebuke him, saying, [God] be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee. Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
23 But turning round, he said to Peter, Get away behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men. But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
25 For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
26 For what does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
27 For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his doings. For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
28 Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

9 And as they descended from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of man be risen up from among [the] dead.

10 And [his] disciples demanded of him saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first have come? And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
11 And he answering said to them, Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
12 But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would. Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them. But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
13 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist. Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.

16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
21 But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [the] hands of men, And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

24 And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas? And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute [money] came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
25 He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers?

27 But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee. Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
{18}
1 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens? At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
2 And Jesus having called a little child to [him], set it in their midst, And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
3 and said, Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens. And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
4 Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, <i>he</i> is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens; Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
5 and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
6 But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and [that] he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
7 Woe to the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes! Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
8 And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and cast [it] from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, [rather] than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire. Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast [it] from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed, [rather] than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
10 See that ye do not despise one of these little ones; for I say unto you that their angels in [the] heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in [the] heavens. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
11 For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost. For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
12 What think ye? If a certain man should have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not, leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains, go and seek the one that has gone astray? How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
13 And if it should come to pass that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray. And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that [sheep], than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
14 So it is not the will of your Father who is in [the] heavens that one of these little ones should perish. Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
15 But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
16 But if he do not hear [thee], take with thee one or two besides, that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three. But if he will not hear [thee, then] take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
17 But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell [it] unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
18 Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
19 Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in [the] heavens. Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
20 For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
21 Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times? Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
22 Jesus says to him, I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven. Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
23 For this cause the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who would reckon with his bondmen. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
24 And having begun to reckon, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
25 But he not having anything to pay, [his] lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children, and everything that he had, and that payment should be made. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
26 The bondman therefore falling down did him homage, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay thee all. The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
27 And the lord of that bondman, being moved with compassion, loosed him and forgave him the loan. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
28 But that bondman having gone out, found one of his fellow-bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii. And having seized him, he throttled him, saying, Pay [me] if thou owest anything. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
29 His fellow-bondman therefore, having fallen down [at his feet], besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
30 But he would not, but went away and cast him into prison, until he should pay what was owing. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
31 But his fellow-bondmen, having seen what had taken place, were greatly grieved, and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place. So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
32 Then his lord, having called him to [him], says to him, Wicked bondman! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me; Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
33 shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-bondman, as <i>I</i> also had compassion on thee? Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
34 And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him. And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
35 Thus also my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
{19}

5 and said, On account of this a man shall leave father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh? And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
6 so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
7 They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [her] away? They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

9 But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, not for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and he who marries one put away commits adultery. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be] for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
10 His disciples say to him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.
11 And he said to them, All cannot receive this word, but those to whom it has been given; But he said unto them, All [men] cannot receive this saying, save [they] to whom it is given.
12 for there are eunuchs which have been born thus from [their] mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it]. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from [their] mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].

18 He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
19 Honour thy father and thy mother, and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Honour thy father and [thy] mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
20 The young man says to him, All these have I kept; what lack I yet? The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
21 Jesus said to him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell what thou hast and give to [the] poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

23 And Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say unto you, A rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of the heavens; Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
24 and again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to enter a needle's eye than a rich man into the kingdom of God. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
25 And when the disciples heard [it] they were exceedingly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

29 And every one who has left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit life eternal. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
30 But many first shall be last, and last first. But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first.
{20}
1 For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
2 And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
3 And having gone out about [the] third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle; And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
4 and to them he said, Go also ye into the vineyard, and whatsoever may be just I will give you. And they went their way. And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
5 Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
6 But about the eleventh [hour], having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
7 They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go also ye into the vineyard [and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive]. They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, [that] shall ye receive.
8 But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them [their] hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
9 And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius. And when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
10 And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
11 And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house, And when they had received [it], they murmured against the goodman of the house,
12 saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat. Saying, These last have wrought [but] one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.

3 and sent his bondmen to call the persons invited to the wedding feast, and they would not come. And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
4 Again he sent other bondmen, saying, Say to the persons invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatted beasts are killed, and all things ready; come to the wedding feast. Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come unto the marriage.

9 go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways, and as many as ye shall find invite to the wedding feast. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
10 And those bondmen went out into the highways, and brought together all as many as they found, both evil and good; and the wedding feast was furnished with guests. So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.

25 Now there were with us seven brethren; and the first having married died, and not having seed, left his wife to his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
26 In like manner also the second and the third, unto the seven. Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
27 And last of all the woman also died. And last of all the woman died also.
28 In the resurrection therefore of which of the seven shall she be wife, for all had her? Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
29 And Jesus answering said to them, Ye err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

37 And he said to him, Thou shalt love [the] Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding. Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
38 This is [the] great and first commandment. This is the first and great commandment.
39 And [the] second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

46 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did any one dare from that day to question him any more. And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any [man] from that day forth ask him any more [questions].

4 but bind burdens heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of men, but will not move them with their finger. For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay [them] on men's shoulders; but they [themselves] will not move them with one of their fingers.
5 And all their works they do to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders [of their garments], But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
6 and love the chief place in feasts and the first seats in the synagogues, And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
7 and salutations in the market-places, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

9 And call not [any one] your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, he who is in the heavens. And call no [man] your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
10 Neither be called instructors, for one is your instructor, the Christ. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, [even] Christ.
11 But the greatest of you shall be your servant. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

14  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.

19 [Fools and] blind ones, for which is greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifies the gift? [Ye] fools and blind: for whether [is] greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
20 He therefore that swears by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it. Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
21 And he that swears by the temple swears by it and by him that dwells in it. And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
22 And he that swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him that sits upon it. And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and ye have left aside the weightier matters of the law, judgment and mercy and faith: these ye ought to have done and not have left those aside. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
26 Blind Pharisee, make clean first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that their outside also may become clean. [Thou] blind Pharisee, cleanse first that [which is] within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead [men's] bones, and of all uncleanness.
28 Thus also <i>ye</i>, outwardly ye appear righteous to men, but within are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the just, Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,

10 And then will many be offended, and will deliver one another up, and hate one another; And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
11 and many false prophets shall arise and shall mislead many; And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
12 and because lawlessness shall prevail, the love of the most shall grow cold; And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
13 but he that has endured to the end, <i>he</i> shall be saved. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

23 Then if any one say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or here, believe [it] not. Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here [is] Christ, or there; believe [it] not.
24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall give great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.

1 Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be made like to ten virgins that having taken their torches, went forth to meet the bridegroom. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
2 And five of them were prudent and five foolish. And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.
3 They that were foolish took their torches and did not take oil with them; They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
4 but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their torches. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
5 Now the bridegroom tarrying, they all grew heavy and slept. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
6 But in [the] middle of [the] night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
8 And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our torches are going out. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
9 But the prudent answered saying, [We cannot,] lest it might not suffice for us and for you. Go rather to those that sell, and buy for yourselves. But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
10 But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the [ones that were] ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
11 Afterwards come also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
12 but he answering said, Verily I say unto you, I do not know you. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
13 Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
14 For [it is] as [if] a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance. For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
15 And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his particular ability, and immediately went away out of the country. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
16 And he that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them, and made five other talents. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made [them] other five talents.
17 In like manner also he that [had received] the two, [he also] gained two others. And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained other two.
18 But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth, and hid the money of his lord. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
19 And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
20 And he that had received the five talents came to [him] and brought five other talents, saying, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me five talents; behold, I have gained five other talents besides them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
21 His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter into the joy of thy lord. His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
22 And he also that had received the two talents came to [him] and said, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents besides them. He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
23 His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
24 And he also that had received the one talent coming to [him] said, [My] lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sowed, and gathering from where thou hadst not scattered, Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
25 and being afraid I went away and hid thy talent in the earth; behold, thou hast that which is thine. And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [that is] thine.
26 And his lord answering said to him, Wicked and slothful bondman, thou knewest that I reap where I had not sowed, and gather from where I had not scattered; His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
27 thou oughtest then to have put my money to the money-changers, and when I came I should have got what is mine with interest. Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that has the ten talents: Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] unto him which hath ten talents.
29 for to every one that has shall be given, and he shall be in abundance; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
30 And cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
31 But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory, When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
32 and all the nations shall be gathered before him; and he shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:
33 and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on [his] left. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
34 Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [the] world's foundation: Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
35 for I hungered, and ye gave me to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
36 naked, and ye clothed me; I was ill, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me. Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
37 Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished thee; or thirsting, and gave thee to drink? Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]? or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?
38 and when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in; or naked, and clothed thee? When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked, and clothed [thee]?
39 and when saw we thee ill, or in prison, and came to thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
40 And the King answering shall say to them, Verily, I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me. And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
41 Then shall he say also to those on the left, Go from me, cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
42 for I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me not to drink; For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; ill, and in prison, and ye did not visit me. I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
44 Then shall <i>they</i> also answer saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and have not ministered to thee? Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
45 Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least, neither have ye done it to me. Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
46 And these shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

1 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,

7 a woman, having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table. There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat].
8 But the disciples seeing it became indignant, saying, To what end [was] this waste? But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?
9 for this might have been sold for much and been given to the poor. For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
10 But Jesus knowing [it] said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? for she has wrought a good work toward me. When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
11 For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
12 For in pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.
13 Verily I say to you, Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this [woman] has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

15 and said, What are ye willing to give me, and <i>I</i> will deliver him up to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver. And said [unto them], What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
25 And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it <i>I</i>, Rabbi? He says to him, <i>Thou</i> hast said. Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
