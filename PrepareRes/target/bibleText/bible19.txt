{#Psalms}
{1}
1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners; Blessed [is] the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
2 But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
3 And he [is] as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and all that he doeth prospereth. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
4 The wicked are not so; but are as the chaff which the wind driveth away. The ungodly [are] not so: but [are] like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
6 For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish. For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

8 Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth: Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession.
9 Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of iron, as a potter's vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
10 And now, O kings, be ye wise, be admonished, ye judges of the earth. Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
11 Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
