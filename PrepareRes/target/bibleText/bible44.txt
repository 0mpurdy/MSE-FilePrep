3 opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered and risen up from among the dead, and that this is the Christ, Jesus whom <i>I</i> announce to you.

6 and not having found them, dragged Jason and certain brethren before the politarchs, crying out, These [men] that have set the world in tumult, are come here also, And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
7 whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, that there is another king, Jesus. Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, [one] Jesus.

20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We wish therefore to know what these things may mean. For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
21 Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news. (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
22 And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship; Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
23 for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing [him], him I announce to you. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
24 The God who has made the world and all things which are in it, <i>he</i>, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands, God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
25 nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself giving to all life and breath and all things; Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
26 and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling, And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
27 that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us: That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
28 for in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring. For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
29 Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, [the] graven form of man's art and imagination. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.
30 God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent, And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
31 because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised him from among [the] dead. Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he hath ordained; [whereof] he hath given assurance unto all [men], in that he hath raised him from the dead.
32 And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this [matter].
33 Thus Paul went out of their midst. So Paul departed from among them.

2 and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them, And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

7 And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue. And he departed thence, and entered into a certain [man's] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
9 And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent; Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:
10 because <i>I</i> am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city. For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

26 and ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great crowd, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying that they are no gods which are made with hands. Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:
27 Now not only there is danger for us that our business come into discredit, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be counted for nothing, and that her greatness should be destroyed whom the whole of Asia and the world reveres. So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
28 And having heard [this], and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians. And when they heard [these sayings], they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.

34 But, recognising that he was a Jew, there was one cry from all, shouting for about two hours, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians. But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
35 And the townclerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Ephesians, what man is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of Artemis the great, and of the [image] which fell down from heaven? And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?
36 These things therefore being undeniable, it is necessary that ye should be calm and do nothing headlong. Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
37 For ye have brought these men, [who are] neither temple-plunderers, nor speak injuriously of your goddess. For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
38 If therefore Demetrius and the artisans who [are] with him have a matter against any one, the courts are being held, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.
39 But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly. But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
40 For also we are in danger to be put in accusation for sedition for this [affair] of to-day, no cause existing in reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse. For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.

11 And having gone up, and having broken the bread, and eaten, and having long spoken until daybreak, so he went away. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.

16 for Paul thought it desirable to sail by Ephesus, so that he might not be made to spend time in Asia; for he hastened, if it was possible for him, to be the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

19 serving the Lord with all lowliness, and tears, and temptations, which happened to me through the plots of the Jews; Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
20 how I held back nothing of what is profitable, so as not to announce [it] to you, and to teach you publicly and in every house, [And] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,
21 testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ. Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
22 And now, behold, bound in my spirit <i>I</i> go to Jerusalem, not knowing what things shall happen to me in it; And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
23 only that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me. Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
24 But I make no account of [my] life [as] dear to myself, so that I finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom [of God], shall see my face no more. And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
26 Wherefore I witness to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all, Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] pure from the blood of all [men].
27 for I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
28 Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers, to shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own. Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
29 [For] <i>I</i> know [this,] that there will come in amongst you after my departure grievous wolves, not sparing the flock; For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
30 and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
31 Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I ceased not admonishing each one [of you] with tears. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
32 And now I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build [you] up and give [to you] an inheritance among all the sanctified.

27 And when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, set all the crowd in a tumult, and laid hands upon him, And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
28 crying, Israelites, help! this is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and has brought Greeks too into the temple, and profaned this holy place. Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all [men] every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
29 For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
30 And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and having laid hold on Paul they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut. And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
31 And as they were seeking to kill him, a representation came to the chiliarch of the band that the whole of Jerusalem was in a tumult; And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
32 who, taking with him immediately soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them. But they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, ceased beating Paul. Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
33 Then the chiliarch came up and laid hold upon him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he might be, and what he had done. Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
34 And different persons cried some different thing in the crowd. But he, not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, commanded him to be brought into the fortress. And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
35 But when he got upon the stairs it was so that he was borne by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
36 For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
37 But as he was about to be led into the fortress, Paul says to the chiliarch, Is it allowed me to say something to thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek? And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
38 Thou art not then that Egyptian who before these days raised a sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins? Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
39 But Paul said, <i>I</i> am a Jew of Tarsus, citizen of no insignificant city of Cilicia, and I beseech of thee, allow me to speak to the people. But Paul said, I am a man [which am] a Jew of Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
40 And when he had allowed him, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and a great silence having been made, he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto [them] in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
{22}
1 Brethren and fathers, hear my defence which I now make to you. Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence [which I make] now unto you.
2 And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more quiet; and he says, (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
3 <i>I</i> am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to [the] exactness of the law of [our] fathers, being zealous for God, as <i>ye</i> are all this day; I am verily a man [which am] a Jew, born in Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, [and] taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
4 who have persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women; And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
5 as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the elderhood: from whom also, having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus to bring those also who were there, bound, to Jerusalem, to be punished. As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
6 And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of heaven a great light round about me. And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
7 And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
8 And <i>I</i> answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, <i>I</i> am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom <i>thou</i> persecutest. And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
9 But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me. And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
11 And as I could not see, through the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus. And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
12 And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there], And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt [there],
13 coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And <i>I</i>, in the same hour, received my sight and saw him. Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
14 And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth; And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
15 for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
16 And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
17 And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy, And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
18 and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
19 And <i>I</i> said, Lord, they themselves know that <i>I</i> was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee; And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
20 and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
21 And he said to me, Go, for <i>I</i> will send thee to the nations afar off. And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
22 And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live. And they gave him audience unto this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
23 And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes, and casting dust into the air, And as they cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,
24 the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him. The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
25 But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned? And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
26 And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this man is a Roman. When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
27 And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art <i>thou</i> a Roman? And he said, Yes. Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
28 And the chiliarch answered, <i>I</i>, for a great sum, bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But <i>I</i> was also [free] born. And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was [free] born.
29 Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
30 And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and having brought Paul down set him before them. On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
{23}
1 And Paul, fixing his eyes on the council, said, Brethren, I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day. And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men [and] brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
2 But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to smite his mouth. And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
3 Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, whited wall. And <i>thou</i>, dost thou sit judging me according to the law, and breaking the law commandest me to be smitten? Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, [thou] whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
4 And those that stood by said, Dost thou rail against the high priest of God? And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
5 And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evilly of the ruler of thy people. Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
6 But Paul, knowing that the one part [of them] were of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, cried out in the council, Brethren, <i>I</i> am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees: <i>I</i> am judged concerning the hope and resurrection of [the] dead. But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
7 And when he had spoken this, there was a tumult of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided. And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
8 For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but Pharisees confess both of them. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
9 And there was a great clamour, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part rising up contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel... And there arose a great cry: and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
10 And a great tumult having arisen, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been torn in pieces by them, commanded the troop to come down and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the fortress. And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle.
11 But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also. And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
12 And when it was day, the Jews, having banded together, put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul. And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
13 And they were more than forty who had joined together in this oath; And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
14 and they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have cursed ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
15 Now therefore do ye with the council make a representation to the chiliarch so that he may bring him down to you, as about to determine more precisely what concerns him, and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him. Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
16 But Paul's sister's son, having heard of the lying in wait, came and entered into the fortress and reported [it] to Paul. And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
17 And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this youth to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him. Then Paul called one of the centurions unto [him], and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
18 He therefore, having taken him with [him], led him to the chiliarch, and says, The prisoner Paul called me to [him] and asked me to lead this youth to thee, who has something to say to thee. So he took him, and brought [him] to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto [him], and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
19 And the chiliarch having taken him by the hand, and having gone apart in private, inquired, What is it that thou hast to report to me? Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went [with him] aside privately, and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?
20 And he said, The Jews have agreed together to make a request to thee, that thou mayest bring Paul down to-morrow into the council, as about to inquire something more precise concerning him. And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
21 Do not thou then be persuaded by them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they kill him; and now they are ready waiting the promise from thee. But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
22 The chiliarch then dismissed the youth, commanding [him], Utter to no one that thou hast represented these things to me. So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him, See thou] tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.
23 And having called to [him] certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred light-armed footmen, for the third hour of the night. And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
24 And [he ordered them] to provide beasts, that they might set Paul on them and carry [him] safe through to Felix the governor, And provide [them] beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring [him] safe unto Felix the governor.
25 having written a letter, couched in this form: And he wrote a letter after this manner:
26 Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greeting. Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix [sendeth] greeting.
27 This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, I came up with the military and took out [of their hands], having learned that he was a Roman. This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
28 And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council; And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
29 whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have no charge laid against him [making him] worthy of death or of bonds. Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
30 But having received information of a plot about to be put in execution against the man [by the Jews], I have immediately sent him to thee, commanding also his accusers to say before thee the things that are against him. [Farewell.] And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what [they had] against him. Farewell.
31 The soldiers therefore, according to what was ordered them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris, Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.
32 and on the morrow, having left the horsemen to go with him, returned to the fortress. On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
33 And these, having entered into Caesarea, and given up the letter to the governor, presented Paul also to him. Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
34 And having read [it], and asked of what eparchy he was, and learned that [he was] of Cilicia, And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia;
35 he said, I will hear thee fully when thine accusers also are arrived. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium. I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
{24}
1 And after five days came down the high priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator called Tertullus, and laid their informations against Paul before the governor. And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
2 And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy forethought, And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
3 we receive [it] always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
4 But that I may not too much intrude on thy time, I beseech thee to hear us briefly in thy kindness. Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
5 For finding this man a pest, and moving sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazaraeans; For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
6 who also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also had seized, [and would have judged according to our law; Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
7 but Lysias, the chiliarch, coming up, took [him] away with great force out of our hands, But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,
8 having commanded his accusers to come to thee;] of whom thou canst thyself, in examining [him], know the certainty of all these things of which we accuse him. Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
9 And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against [Paul], saying that these things were so. And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
10 But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak, answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern myself. Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
11 As thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem, Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
12 and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city; And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
13 neither can they make good the things of which they now accuse me. Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
14 But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which are written throughout the law, and in the prophets; But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
15 having hope towards God, which they themselves also receive, that there is to be a resurrection both of just and unjust. And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
16 For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in everything a conscience without offence towards God and men. And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and [toward] men.
17 And after a lapse of many years I arrived, bringing alms to my nation, and offerings. Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
18 Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia, Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
19 who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have anything against me; Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
20 or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the council, Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
21 [other] than concerning this one voice which I cried standing amongst them: I am judged this day by you touching [the] resurrection of [the] dead. Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
22 And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come down I will determine your affair; And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
23 ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to him. And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
24 And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
25 And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee; And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
26 hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him. He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
27 But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound. But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
{25}
1 Festus therefore, being come into the eparchy, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
2 And the chief priests and the chief of the Jews laid informations before him against Paul, and besought him, Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
3 asking as a grace against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying people in wait to kill him on the way. And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
4 Festus therefore answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly. But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly [thither].
5 Let therefore the persons of authority among you, says he, going down too, if there be anything in this man, accuse him. Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with [me], and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
6 And having remained among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day, having sat down on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought. And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
7 And when he was come, the Jews who were come down from Jerusalem stood round, bringing many and grievous charges which they were not able to prove: And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
8 Paul answering for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended [in] anything. While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.
9 But Festus, desirous of obliging the Jews, to acquire their favour, answering Paul, said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be judged before me concerning these things? But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
10 But Paul said, I am standing before the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as <i>thou</i> also very well knowest. Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
11 If then I have done any wrong and committed anything worthy of death, I do not deprecate dying; but if there is nothing of those things of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar. For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
12 Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar. To Caesar shalt thou go. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
13 And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute Festus. And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
14 And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix, And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
15 concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring judgment against him: About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring [to have] judgment against him.
16 to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching the charge. To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
17 When therefore they had come together here, without putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought: Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
18 concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such accusation of guilt as <i>I</i> supposed; Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
19 but had against him certain questions of their own system of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom Paul affirmed to be living. But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
20 And as I myself was at a loss as to an inquiry into these things, I said, Was he willing to go to Jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things? And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
21 But Paul having appealed to be kept for the cognisance of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I shall send him to Caesar. But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
22 And Agrippa [said] to Festus, I myself also would desire to hear the man. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
23 On the morrow therefore, Agrippa being come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and having entered into the hall of audience, with the chiliarchs and the men of distinction of the city, and Festus having given command, Paul was brought. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.
24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this person, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews applied to me both in Jerusalem and here, crying out against [him] that he ought not to live any longer. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
25 But I, having found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and this [man] himself having appealed to Augustus, I have decided to send him; But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
26 concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been gone into I may have something to write: Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
27 for it seems to me senseless, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him. For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes [laid] against him.
{26}
1 And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence: Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
2 I count myself happy, king Agrippa, in having to answer to-day before thee concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
3 especially because thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. Especially [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
4 My manner of life then from my youth, which from its commencement was passed among my nation in Jerusalem, know all the Jews, My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
5 who knew me before from the outset [of my life], if they would bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
6 And now I stand to be judged because of the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
7 to which our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night hope to arrive; about which hope, O king, I am accused of [the] Jews. Unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, instantly serving [God] day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
8 Why should it be judged a thing incredible in your sight if God raises the dead? Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
9 <i>I</i> indeed myself thought that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazaraean. I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
10 Which also I did in Jerusalem, and myself shut up in prisons many of the saints, having received the authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I gave my vote. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].
11 And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme. And, being exceedingly furious against them, I persecuted them even to cities out [of our own land]. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities.
12 And when, [engaged] in this, I was journeying to Damascus, with authority and power from the chief priests, Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
13 at mid-day, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the brightness of the sun, shining from heaven round about me and those who were journeying with me. At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
14 And, when we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [it is] hard for thee to kick against goads. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, <i>I</i> am Jesus whom <i>thou</i> persecutest: And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
16 but rise up and stand on thy feet; for, for this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in, But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;
17 taking thee out from among the people, and the nations, to whom <i>I</i> send thee, Delivering thee from the people, and [from] the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
18 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me. To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
19 Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision; Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
20 but have, first to those both in Damascus and Jerusalem, and to all the region of Judaea, and to the nations, announced that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and [then] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
21 On account of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, attempted to lay hands on and destroy me. For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill [me].
22 Having therefore met with [the] help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing else than those things which both the prophets and Moses have said should happen, Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
23 [namely,] whether Christ should suffer; whether he first, through resurrection of [the] dead, should announce light both to the people and to the nations. That Christ should suffer, [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
24 And as he answered for his defence with these things, Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much learning turns thee to madness. And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
25 But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness; But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
26 for the king is informed about these things, to whom also I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner. For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
28 And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
29 And Paul [said], I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as <i>I</i> also am, except these bonds. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
30 And the king stood up, and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them, And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
31 and having gone apart, they spoke to one another saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds. And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
32 And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been let go if he had not appealed to Caesar. Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
{27}
1 But when it had been determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered up Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, by name Julius, of Augustus' company. And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
2 And going on board a ship of Adramyttium about to navigate by the places along Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; [one] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
3 And the next day we arrived at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and suffered him to go to his friends and refresh himself. And the next [day] we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
4 And setting sail thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
5 And having sailed over the waters of Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra in Lycia: And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.
6 and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, he made us go on board her. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
7 And sailing slowly for many days, and having with difficulty got abreast of Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete abreast of Salmone; And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
8 and coasting it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was [the] city of Lasaea. And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city [of] Lasea.
9 And much time having now been spent, and navigation being already dangerous, because the fast also was already past, Paul counselled them, Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them],
10 saying, Men, I perceive that the navigation will be with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives. And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
11 But the centurion believed rather the helmsman and the shipowner than what was said by Paul. Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
12 And the harbour being ill adapted to winter in, the most counselled to set sail thence, if perhaps they might reach Phoenice to winter in, a port of Crete looking north-east and south-east. And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, [and there] to winter; [which is] an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
13 And [the] south wind blowing gently, supposing that they had gained their object, having weighed anchor they sailed close in shore along Crete. And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, loosing [thence], they sailed close by Crete.
14 But not long after there came down it a hurricane called Euroclydon. But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
15 And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven [before it]. And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let [her] drive.
16 But running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were with difficulty able to make ourselves masters of the boat; And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
17 which having hoisted up, they used helps, frapping the ship; and fearing lest they should run into Syrtis and run aground, and having lowered the gear they were so driven. Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.
18 But the storm being extremely violent on us, on the next day they threw cargo overboard, And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;
19 and on the third day with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture. And the third [day] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
20 And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm lying on us, in the end all hope of our being saved was taken away. And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
21 And when they had been a long while without taking food, Paul then standing up in the midst of them said, Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me, and not have made sail from Crete and have gained this disaster and loss. But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
22 And now I exhort you to be of good courage, for there shall be no loss at all of life of [any] of you, only of the ship. And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of [any man's] life among you, but of the ship.
23 For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night, For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
24 saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee. Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
25 Wherefore be of good courage, men, for I believe God that thus it shall be, as it has been said to me. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
26 But we must be cast ashore on a certain island. Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
27 And when the fourteenth night was come, we being driven about in Adria, towards the middle of the night the sailors supposed that some land neared them, But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
28 and having sounded found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther and having again sounded they found fifteen fathoms; And sounded, and found [it] twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found [it] fifteen fathoms.
29 and fearing lest we should be cast on rocky places, casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished that day were come. Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
30 But the sailors wishing to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea under pretext of being about to carry out anchors from the prow, And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship <i>ye</i> cannot be saved. Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let her fall. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
33 And while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food, saying, Ye have passed the fourteenth day watching in expectation without taking food. And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
34 Wherefore I exhort you to partake of food, for this has to do with your safety; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish. Wherefore I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
35 And, having said these things and taken a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it began to eat. And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.
36 And all taking courage, themselves also took food. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took [some] meat.
37 And we were in the ship, all the souls, two hundred and seventy-six. And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
38 And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea. And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
39 And when it was day they did not recognise the land; but they perceived a certain bay having a strand, on which they were minded, if they should be able, to run the ship ashore; And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
40 and, having cast off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the strand. And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
41 And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground, and the prow having stuck itself fast remained unmoved, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves. And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
42 And [the] counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim off and escape. And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
43 But the centurion, desirous of saving Paul, hindered them of their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, casting themselves first [into the sea], to get out on land; But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea], and get to land:
44 and the rest, some on boards, some on some of the things [that came] from the ship; and thus it came to pass that all got safe to land. And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
{28}
1 And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island was called Melita. And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
2 But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for, having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold. And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
3 And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming out from the heat seized his hand. And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
4 And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not allowed to live. And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
5 <i>He</i> however, having shaken off the beast into the fire, felt no harm. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
6 But <i>they</i> expected that he would have swollen or fallen down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
7 Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very friendly way. In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
8 And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and laid his hands on him cured him. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
9 But this having taken place, the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were healed: So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
10 who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants. Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.
11 And after three months we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian, with [the] Dioscuri for its ensign. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
12 And having come to Syracuse we remained three days. And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.
13 Whence, going in a circuitous course, we arrived at Rhegium; and after one day, the wind having changed to south, on the second day we came to Puteoli, And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
14 where, having found brethren, we were begged to stay with them seven days. And thus we went to Rome. Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
15 And thence the brethren, having heard about us, came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage. And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
16 And when we came to Rome, [the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but] Paul was allowed to remain by himself with the soldier who kept him. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
17 And it came to pass after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they had come together he said to them, Brethren, <i>I</i> having done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
18 who having examined me were minded to let me go, because there was nothing worthy of death in me. Who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.
19 But the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation of. But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
20 For this cause therefore I have called you to [me] to see and to speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain about me. For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
21 And they said to him, For our part, we have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor has any one of the brethren who has arrived reported or said anything evil concerning thee. And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
22 But we beg to hear of thee what thou thinkest, for as concerning this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against. But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
23 And having appointed him a day many came to him to the lodging, to whom he expounded, testifying of the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from early morning to evening. And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.
24 And some were persuaded of the things which were said, but some disbelieved. And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
25 And being disagreed among themselves they left; Paul having spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Esaias the prophet to our fathers, And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
26 saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive. Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
27 For the heart of this people has become fat, and they hear heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
28 Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; <i>they</i> also will hear [it]. Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and [that] they will hear it.
