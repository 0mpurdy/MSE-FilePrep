1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity. Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity.
3 What profit hath man of all his labour wherewith he laboureth under the sun? What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
4 [One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh, but the earth standeth for ever. [One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
5 The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
6 The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
7 All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
8 All things are full of toil; none can express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. All things [are] full of labour; man cannot utter [it]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
9 That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there is nothing new under the sun. The thing that hath been, it [is that] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall be done: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun.
10 Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us. Is there [any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this [is] new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards. [There is] no remembrance of former [things]; neither shall there be [any] remembrance of [things] that are to come with [those] that shall come after.
12 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
13 And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind. I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.
15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. [That which is] crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge. I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all [they] that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
17 And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind. And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
18 For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. For in much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
{2}
1 I said in my heart, Come now, I will try thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. But behold, this also is vanity. I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity.
2 I said of laughter, Madness! and of mirth, What availeth it? I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
3 I searched in my heart how to cherish my flesh with wine, while practising my heart with wisdom; and how to lay hold on folly, till I should see what was that good for the children of men which they should do under the heavens all the days of their life. I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
5 I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of every kind of fruit; I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits:
6 I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood, where the trees are reared. I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
7 I acquired servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that had been in Jerusalem before me. I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the children of men, a wife and concubines. I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
9 And I became great, and increased more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them: I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion from all my labour. And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that it had cost me to do [them]; and behold, all was vanity and pursuit of the wind, and there was no profit under the sun. Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun.
12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what shall the man [do] that cometh after the king? -- that which hath already been done. And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been already done.
13 And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as light excelleth darkness. Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
14 The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself also perceived that one event happeneth to them all. The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
15 And I said in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool so will it happen even to me; and why was I then so wise? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity.
16 For there shall be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; because everything is already forgotten in the days which come. And how dieth the wise even as the fool? For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.
17 And I hated life; for the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and pursuit of the wind. Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.
18 And I hated all my labour wherewith I had been toiling under the sun, because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
19 And who knoweth whether he will be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour at which I have laboured, and wherein I have been wise under the sun. This also is vanity. And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity.
20 Then I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour wherewith I had laboured under the sun. Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
21 For there is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill, and who leaveth it to a man that hath not laboured therein, to be his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.
22 For what will man have of all his labour and of the striving of his heart, wherewith he hath wearied himself under the sun? For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
23 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail vexation: even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
24 There is nothing good for man, but that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.
25 For who can eat, or who be eager, more than I? For who can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto], more than I?
26 For he giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good in God's sight. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind. For [God] giveth to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.

1 To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heavens: To every [thing there is] a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
2 A time to be born, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted;
3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
6 A time to seek, and a time to lose; A time to keep, and a time to cast away; A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; A time to keep silence, and a time to speak; A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
8 A time to love, and a time to hate; A time of war, and a time of peace. A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
9 What profit hath he that worketh from that wherein he laboureth? What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
10 I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of men to toil in. I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
11 He hath made everything beautiful in its time; also he hath set the world in their heart, so that man findeth not out from the beginning to the end the work that God doeth. He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
12 I know that there is nothing good for them but to rejoice and to do well in their life; I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
13 yea also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, it is the gift of God. And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God.
14 I know that whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever; there is nothing to be added to it, nor anything to be taken from it; and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him. I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.
15 That which is was long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God bringeth back again that which is past. That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
16 And moreover I saw under the sun, that in the place of judgment, wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there. And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.
17 I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.
18 I said in my heart, It is thus with the children of men, that God may prove them, and that they should see that they themselves are but beasts. I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
19 For what befalleth the children of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other, and they have all one breath; and man hath no pre-eminence above the beast: for all is vanity. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.
20 All go unto one place: all are of the dust, and all return to dust. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
21 Who knoweth the spirit of the children of men? Doth it go upwards? and the spirit of the beasts, doth it go downwards to the earth? Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
22 And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

1 And I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was power, and they had no comforter. So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.
2 Then I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive; Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
3 and more fortunate than both is he who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
4 And I saw all labour, and all success of work, that it is man's jealousy of his neighbour. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind. Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.
5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
6 Better is a handful with quietness, than both hands full with labour and pursuit of the wind. Better [is] an handful [with] quietness, than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.
7 And I returned and saw vanity under the sun. Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
8 There is one [alone] and without a second; also he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, and [he saith not], For whom then am I labouring, and depriving my soul of good? This also is vanity and a grievous occupation. There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a sore travail.
9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath not another to lift him up! For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for [he hath] not another to help him up.
11 Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one alone be warm? Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?
12 And if a [man] overpower the one, the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
13 Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth no more how to be admonished. Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
14 For out of the prison-house he came forth to reign, although he was born poor in his kingdom. For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becometh poor.
15 I saw all the living that walk under the sun, with the child, the second, that should stand up in his stead. I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
16 [There is] no end of all the people, of all that stood before them; those however that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after the wind. [There is] no end of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.
{5}
1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and draw near to hear, rather than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil. Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in the heavens, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God: for God [is] in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business, and a fool's voice through a multitude of words. For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice [is known] by multitude of words.
4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for [he hath] no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Better [is it] that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an inadvertence. Wherefore should God be wroth at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it [was] an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
7 For in the multitude of dreams are vanities; so with many words: but fear God. For in the multitude of dreams and many words [there are] also [divers] vanities: but fear thou God.
8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for a higher than the high is watching, and there are higher than they. If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for [he that is] higher than the highest regardeth; and [there be] higher than they.
9 Moreover the earth is every way profitable: the king [himself] is dependent upon the field. Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king [himself] is served by the field.
10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This also is vanity. He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this [is] also vanity.
11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what profit is there to the owner thereof, except the beholding [of them] with his eyes? When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good [is there] to the owners thereof, saving the beholding [of them] with their eyes?
12 The sleep of the labourer is sweet, whether he have eaten little or much; but the fulness of the rich doth not suffer him to sleep. The sleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
13 There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt; There is a sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
14 or those riches perish by some evil circumstance, and if he have begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and [there is] nothing in his hand.
15 As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go away again as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
16 And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came so doth he go away, and what profit hath he, in having laboured for the wind? And this also [is] a sore evil, [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and hath much vexation, and sickness, and irritation. All his days also he eateth in darkness, and [he hath] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
18 Behold what I have seen good and comely: [it is] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour wherewith [man] laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for that is his portion. Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and comely [for one] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it [is] his portion.
19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and power to eat thereof, and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour: that is a gift of God. Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God.
20 For he will not much remember the days of his life, because God answereth [him] with the joy of his heart. For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth [him] in the joy of his heart.
{6}
1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is frequent among men: There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it [is] common among men:
2 one to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and a sore evil. A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.
3 If a man beget a hundred [sons], and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, but his soul be not filled with good, and also he have no burial, I say an untimely birth is better than he. If a man beget an hundred [children], and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also [that] he have no burial; I say, [that] an untimely birth [is] better than he.
4 For it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness; For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
5 moreover it hath not seen nor known the sun: this hath rest rather than the other. Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known [any thing]: this hath more rest than the other.
6 Yea, though he live twice a thousand years, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? Yea, though he live a thousand years twice [told], yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?
7 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
8 For what advantage hath the wise above the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?
9 Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and pursuit of the wind. Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.
10 That which is hath already been named; and what man is, is known, and that he cannot contend with him that is mightier than he. That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it [is] man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
11 For there are many things that increase vanity: what is man advantaged? Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what [is] man the better?
12 For who knoweth what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell man what shall be after him under the sun? For who knoweth what [is] good for man in [this] life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

1 A [good] name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of one's birth. A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
2 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: in that that is the end of all men, and the living taketh it to heart. [It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.
3 Vexation is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools in the house of mirth. The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of mirth.
5 It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise, than to hear the song of fools. [It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity. For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity.
7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart. Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
8 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; better is a patient spirit than a proud spirit. Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.

14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are righteous [men] unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; and there are wicked [men] to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous.
