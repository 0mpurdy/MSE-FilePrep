{#2 Corinthians}
{1}
1 Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and the brother Timotheus, to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
2 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions, and God of all encouragement; Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
4 who encourages us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to encourage those who are in any tribulation whatever, through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged of God. Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
5 Because, even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us, so through the Christ does our encouragement also abound. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
6 But whether we are in tribulation, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation, wrought in the endurance of the same sufferings which *we* also suffer, And whether we be afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.
7 (and our hope for you [is] sure;) or whether we are encouraged, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation: knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement. And our hope of you [is] stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so [shall ye be] also of the consolation.
8 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened [to us] in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond [our] power, so as to despair even of living. For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
9 But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
10 who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver; Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us];
11 ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us. Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
12 For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
13 For we do not write other things to you but what ye well know and recognise; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end, For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
14 even as also ye have recognised us in part, that we are your boast, even as *ye* [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
15 And with this confidence I purposed to come to you previously, that ye might have a second favour; And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
16 and to pass through to Macedonia by you, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be set forward by you to Judaea. And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
17 Having therefore this purpose, did I then use lightness? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to flesh, that there should be with me yea yea, and nay nay? When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
18 Now God [is] faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay. But [as] God [is] true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.
19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
20 For whatever promises of God [there are], in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us. For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
21 Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, [is] God, Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is] God;
22 who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
23 But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth. Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
24 Not that we rule over your faith, but are fellow-workmen of your joy: for by faith ye stand. Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
{2}
1 But I have judged this with myself, not to come back to you in grief. But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
2 For if *I* grieve you, who also [is] it that gladdens me, if not he that is grieved through me? For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
3 And I have written this very [letter] [to you], that coming I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy; trusting in you all that my joy is [that] of you all. And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.
4 For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that ye may be grieved, but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
5 But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge [you]) all of you. But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
6 Sufficient to such a one [is] this rebuke which [has been inflicted] by the many; Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many.
7 so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief. So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
8 Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of [your] love. Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love toward him.
9 For to this end also I have written, that I might know, by putting you to the test, if as to everything ye are obedient. For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
10 But to whom ye forgive anything, *I* also; for I also, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, [it is] for your sakes in [the] person of Christ; To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Christ;
11 that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of *his* thoughts. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
12 Now when I came to Troas for the [publication of the] glad tidings of the Christ, a door also being opened to me in [the] Lord, Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
13 I had no rest in my spirit at not finding Titus my brother; but bidding them adieu, I came away to Macedonia. I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
14 But thanks [be] to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place. Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
15 For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish: For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
16 to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life; and who [is] sufficient for these things? To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?
17 For we do not, as the many, make a trade of the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ. For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
{3}
1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or [commendatory] from you? Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?
2 *Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
3 being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but [the] Spirit of [the] living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of [the] heart. [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
4 And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God: And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
5 not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency [is] of God; Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;
6 who has also made us competent, [as] ministers of [the] new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens. Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
7 (But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, [a glory] which is annulled; But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
8 how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit subsist in glory? How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
9 For if the ministry of condemnation [be] glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory. For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
10 For also that [which was] glorified is not glorified in this respect, on account of the surpassing glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
11 For if that annulled [was introduced] with glory, much rather that which abides [subsists] in glory. For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
12 Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness: Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
13 and not according as Moses put a veil on his own face, so that the children of Israel should not fix their eyes on the end of that annulled. And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
14 But their thoughts have been darkened, for unto this day the same veil remains in reading the old covenant, unremoved, which in Christ is annulled. But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
15 But unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil lies upon their heart. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
16 But when it shall turn to [the] Lord, the veil is taken away.) Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of [the] Lord [is, there is] liberty. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
18 But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by [the] Lord [the] Spirit. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.
{4}
1 Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not. Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
2 But we have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God. But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
3 But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost; But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
4 in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is [the] image of God, should not shine forth [for them]. In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
6 Because [it is] the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in [the] face of [Jesus] Christ. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us: But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
8 every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up; [We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;
9 persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
10 always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
11 for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh; For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
12 so that death works in us, but life in you. So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
13 And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; *we* also believe, therefore also we speak; We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
14 knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present [us] with you. Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.
15 For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace abounding through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
16 Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day by day. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day.
17 For our momentary [and] light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory; For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;
18 while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen [are] for a time, but those that are not seen eternal. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.
{5}
1 For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2 For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which [is] from heaven; For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
3 if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked. If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
4 For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that [what is] mortal may be swallowed up by life. For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
5 Now he that has wrought us for this very thing [is] God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit. Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
6 Therefore [we are] always confident, and know that while present in the body we are absent from the Lord, Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight;) (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
8 we are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord. We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
9 Wherefore also we are zealous, whether present or absent, to be agreeable to him. Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
10 For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ, that each may receive the things [done] in the body, according to those he has done, whether [it be] good or evil. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.
11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
12 [For] we do not again commend ourselves to you, but [we are] giving to you occasion of boast in our behalf, that ye may have [such] with those boasting in countenance, and not in heart. For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
13 For whether we are beside ourselves, [it is] to God; or are sober, [it is] for you. For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.
14 For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
15 and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised. And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
16 So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know [him thus] no longer. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.
17 So if any one [be] in Christ, [there is] a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
18 and all things [are] of the God who has reconciled us to himself by [Jesus] Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation: And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
19 how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences; and putting in us the word of that reconciliation. To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
20 We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as [it were] beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ, Be reconciled to God. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
21 Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that *we* might become God's righteousness in him. For he hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
{6}
1 But [as] fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not the grace of God in vain: We then, [as] workers together [with him], beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
2 (for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time, and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now [is the] well-accepted time; behold, now [the] day of salvation:) (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)
3 giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed; Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
4 but in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits, But in all [things] approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
5 in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
6 in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in [the] Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
7 in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left, By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
8 through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true; By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;
9 as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; As unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
10 as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things. As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.
11 Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded. O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections; Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
13 but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let *your* heart also expand itself. Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be ye also enlarged.
14 Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation [is there] between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness? Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
15 and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
16 and what agreement of God's temple with idols? for *ye* are [the] living God's temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
17 Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith [the] Lord, and touch not [what is] unclean, and *I* will receive you; Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you,
18 and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith [the] Lord Almighty. And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

1 Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2 Receive us: we have injured no one, we have ruined no one, we have made gain of no one. Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
3 I do not speak for condemnation, for I have already said that ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together. I speak not [this] to condemn [you]: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with [you].
4 Great [is] my boldness towards you, great my exulting in respect of you; I am filled with encouragement; I overabound in joy under all our affliction. Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
5 For indeed, when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but [we were] afflicted in every way; without combats, within fears. For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings, within [were] fears.
6 But he who encourages those that are [brought] low, [even] God, encouraged us by the coming of Titus; Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
7 and not by his coming only, but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you; relating to us your ardent desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I the more rejoiced. And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
8 For if also I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret [it], if even I have regretted it; for I see that that letter, if even [it were] only for a time, grieved you. For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season.
9 Now I rejoice, not that ye have been grieved, but that ye have been grieved to repentance; for ye have been grieved according to God, that in nothing ye might be injured by us. Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
10 For grief according to God works repentance to salvation, never to be regretted; but the grief of the world works death. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
11 For, behold, this same thing, your being grieved according to God, how much diligence it wrought in *you*, but [what] excusing [of yourselves], but [what] indignation, but [what] fear, but [what] ardent desire, but [what] zeal, but [what] vengeance: in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter. For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, [what] clearing of yourselves, yea, [what] indignation, yea, [what] fear, yea, [what] vehement desire, yea, [what] zeal, yea, [what] revenge! In all [things] ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
12 So then, if also I wrote to you, [it was] not for the sake of him that injured, nor for the sake of him that was injured, but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being manifested to you before God. Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
13 For this reason we have been encouraged. And we the rather rejoiced in our encouragement more abundantly by reason of the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
14 Because if I boasted to him anything about you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken to you all things in truth, so also our boasting to Titus has been [the] truth; For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which [I made] before Titus, is found a truth.
15 and his affections are more abundantly towards you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
16 I rejoice that in everything I am confident as to you. I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all [things].

1 But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia; Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
2 that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their [free-hearted] liberality. How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
3 For according to [their] power, I bear witness, and beyond [their] power, [they were] willing of their own accord, For to [their] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;
4 begging of us with much entreaty [to give effect to] the grace and fellowship of the service which [was to be rendered] to the saints. Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
5 And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will. And [this they did], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
6 So that we begged Titus that, according as he had before begun, so he would also complete as to you this grace also; Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
7 but even as ye abound in every way, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in love from you to us, that ye may abound in this grace also. Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.
8 I do not speak as commanding [it], but through the zeal of others, and proving the genuineness of your love. I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
10 And I give [my] opinion in this, for this is profitable for you who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago. And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
11 But now also complete the doing of it; so that as [there was] the readiness to be willing, so also to complete out of what ye have. Now therefore perform the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.
12 For if the readiness be there, [a man is] accepted according to what he may have, not according to what he has not. For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he hath not.
13 For [it is] not in order that there may be ease for others, and for you distress, For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
14 but [on the principle] of equality; in the present time your abundance for their lack, that their abundance may be for your lack, so that there should be equality. But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:
15 According as it is written, He who [gathered] much had no excess, and he who [gathered] little was nothing short. As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack.
16 But thanks [be] to God, who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus. But thanks [be] to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
17 For he received indeed the entreaty, but, being full of zeal, he went of his own accord to you; For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
18 but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies; And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;
19 and not only [so], but [is] also chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and [a witness of] our readiness; And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [declaration of] your ready mind:
20 avoiding this, that any one should blame us in this abundance [which is] administered by us; Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
21 for we provide for things honest, not only before [the] Lord, but also before men. Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
22 And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things, and now more diligently zealous through the great confidence [he has] as to you. And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you.
23 Whether as regards Titus, [he is] my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf; or our brethren, [they are] deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory. Whether [any do enquire] of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren [be enquired of, they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Christ.
24 Shew therefore to them, before the assemblies, the proof of your love, and of our boasting about you. Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
{9}
1 For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you. For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2 For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since a year ago, and the zeal [reported] of you has stimulated the mass [of the brethren]. For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
3 But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared; Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
4 lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, *we*, that we say not *ye*, may be put to shame in this confidence. Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
5 I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you. Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] covetousness.
6 But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing: But this [I say], He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
7 each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, [so let him give]; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
8 But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work: And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to every good work:
9 according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever. (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
10 Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
11 enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God. Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
12 Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
13 they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution unto them, and unto all [men];
14 and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God [which is] upon you. And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
15 Thanks [be] to God for his unspeakable free gift. Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift.
{10}
1 But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, who, as to appearance, [when present] [am] mean among you, but absent am bold towards you; Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
2 but I beseech that present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I think to be daring towards some who think of us as walking according to flesh. But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
3 For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
4 For the arms of our warfare [are] not fleshly, but powerful according to God to [the] overthrow of strongholds; (For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
5 overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ; Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
6 and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled. And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
7 Do ye look at what concerns appearance? If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ, let him think this again in himself, that even as he [is] of Christ, so also [are] we. Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ's, even so [are] we Christ's.
8 For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given [to us] for building up and not for your overthrowing, I shall not be put to shame; For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
9 that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters: That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
10 because his letters, he says, [are] weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught. For [his] letters, say they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible.
11 Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters [when] absent, such also present in deed. Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [will we be] also in deed when we are present.
12 For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not intelligent. For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
13 Now *we* will not boast out of measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach to you also. But we will not boast of things without [our] measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
14 For we do not, as not reaching to you, overstretch ourselves, (for we have come to you also in the glad tidings of the Christ;) For we stretch not ourselves beyond [our measure], as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in [preaching] the gospel of Christ:
15 not boasting out of measure in other people's labours, but having hope, your faith increasing, to be enlarged amongst you, according to our rule, yet more abundantly Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is], of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
16 to announce the glad tidings to that [which is] beyond you, not to be boasting in another's rule of things made ready to hand. To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.
17 But he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
18 For not *he* that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
{11}
1 Would that ye would bear with me [in] a little folly; but indeed bear with me. Would to God ye could bear with me a little in [my] folly: and indeed bear with me.
2 For I am jealous as to you with a jealousy [which is] of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present [you] a chaste virgin to Christ. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.
3 But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, [so] your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
4 For if indeed he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or ye get a different Spirit, which ye have not got, or a different glad tidings, which ye have not received, ye might well bear with [it]. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or [if] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with [him].
5 For I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles. For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
6 But if [I am] a simple person in speech, yet not in knowledge, but in everything making [the truth] manifest in all things to you. But though [I be] rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
7 Have I committed sin, abasing myself in order that *ye* might be exalted, because I gratuitously announced to you the glad tidings of God? Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
8 I spoiled other assemblies, receiving hire for ministry towards you. I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them], to do you service.
9 And being present with you and lacking, I did not lazily burden any one, (for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I lacked,) and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will keep myself. And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and [so] will I keep [myself].
10 [The] truth of Christ is in me that this boasting shall not be stopped as to me in the regions of Achaia. As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
11 Why? because I do not love you? God knows. Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
12 But what I do, I will also do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those wishing [for] an opportunity, that wherein they boast they may be found even as we. But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
13 For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
14 And [it is] not wonderful, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
15 It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
16 Again I say, Let not any one think me to be a fool; but if otherwise, receive me then even as a fool, that *I* also may boast myself some little. I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
17 What I speak I do not speak according to [the] Lord, but as in folly, in this confidence of boasting. That which I speak, I speak [it] not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
18 Since many boast according to flesh, *I* also will boast. Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
19 For ye bear fools readily, being wise. For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye [yourselves] are wise.
20 For ye bear if any one bring you into bondage, if any one devour [you], if any one get [your money], if any one exalt himself, if any one beat you on the face. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour [you], if a man take [of you], if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
21 I speak as to dishonour, as though *we* had been weak; but wherein any one is daring, (I speak in folly,) *I* also am daring. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
22 Are they Hebrews? *I* also. Are they Israelites? *I* also. Are they seed of Abraham? *I* also. Are they Hebrews? so [am] I. Are they Israelites? so [am] I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so [am] I.
23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as being beside myself) *I* above measure [so]; in labours exceedingly abundant, in stripes to excess, in prisons exceedingly abundant, in deaths oft. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
24 From the Jews five times have I received forty [stripes], save one. Of the Jews five times received I forty [stripes] save one.
25 Thrice have I been scourged, once I have been stoned, three times I have suffered shipwreck, a night and day I passed in the deep: Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
26 in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from [my own] race, in perils from [the] nations, in perils in [the] city, in perils in [the] desert, in perils on [the] sea, in perils among false brethren; [In] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by [mine own] countrymen, [in] perils by the heathen, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;
27 in labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
28 Besides those things that are without, the crowd [of cares] pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies. Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I burn not? Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
30 If it is needful to boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity. If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows -- he who is blessed for ever -- that I do not lie. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
32 In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up, wishing to take me; In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
33 and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
{12}
1 Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of [the] Lord. It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in [the] body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such [a one] caught up to [the] third heaven. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
3 And I know such a man, (whether in [the] body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
4 that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter. How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
5 Of such [a one] I will boast, but of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses. Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
6 For if I shall desire to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will say [the] truth; but I forbear, lest any one should think as to me above what he sees me [to be], or whatever he may hear of me. For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or [that] he heareth of me.
7 And that I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted. And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
8 For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
9 And he said to me, My grace suffices thee; for [my] power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
10 Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
11 I have become a fool; *ye* have compelled me; for *I* ought to have been commended by you; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles, if also I am nothing. I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
12 The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power. Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
13 For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies, unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you? Forgive me this injury. For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
14 Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be in laziness a charge; for I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
15 Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved. And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
16 But be it so. *I* did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by guile. But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
17 Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you? Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
18 I begged Titus, and sent the brother with [him]: did Titus at all make gain of you? have we not walked in the same spirit? [have we] not in the same steps? I desired Titus, and with [him] I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps?
19 Ye have long been supposing that we excuse ourselves to you: we speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up. Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
20 For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that *I* be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest [there might be] strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances; For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
21 lest my God should humble me as to you when I come again, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before, and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised. [And] lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and [that] I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
{13}
1 This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every matter be established. This [is] the third [time] I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
2 I have declared beforehand, and I say beforehand as present the second time, and now absent, to those that have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare. I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, (who is not weak towards you, but is powerful among you, Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
4 for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power; for indeed *we* are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God's power towards you,) For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
5 examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; prove your own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates? Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
6 Now I hope that ye will know that *we* are not reprobates. But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
7 But we pray to God that ye may do nothing evil; not that *we* may appear approved, but that *ye* may do what is right, and *we* be as reprobates. Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
9 For we rejoice when *we* may be weak and *ye* may be powerful. But this also we pray for, your perfecting. For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your perfection.
10 On this account I write these things being absent, that being present I may not use severity according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for overthrowing. Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
11 For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
12 Salute one another with a holy kiss. Greet one another with an holy kiss.
13 All the saints salute you. All the saints salute you.
14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, [be] with you all. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, [be] with you all. Amen. <<[The second [epistle] to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, [a city] of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas.]>>
