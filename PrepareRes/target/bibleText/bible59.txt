1 James, bondman of God and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which [are] in the dispersion, greeting. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
2 Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various temptations, My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
3 knowing that the proving of your faith works endurance. Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
4 But let endurance have [its] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
5 But if any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
6 but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting. For he that doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed about; But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
7 for let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord; For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
8 [he is] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.
9 But let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation, Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
10 and the rich in his humiliation, because as [the] grass's flower he will pass away. But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
11 For the sun has risen with its burning heat, and has withered the grass, and its flower has fallen, and the comeliness of its look has perished: thus the rich also shall wither in his goings. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
12 Blessed [is the] man who endures temptation; for, having been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which He has promised to them that love him. Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
13 Let no man, being tempted, say, I am tempted of God. For God cannot be tempted by evil things, and himself tempts no one. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
14 But every one is tempted, drawn away, and enticed by his own lust; But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
15 then lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; but sin fully completed brings forth death. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
16 Do not err, my beloved brethren. Do not err, my beloved brethren.
17 Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
18 According to his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we should be a certain first-fruits of *his* creatures. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
19 So that, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
20 for man's wrath does not work God's righteousness. For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
21 Wherefore, laying aside all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, accept with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
22 But be ye doers of [the] word and not hearers only, beguiling yourselves. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
23 For if any man be a hearer of [the] word and not a doer, *he* is like to a man considering his natural face in a mirror: For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
24 for he has considered himself and is gone away, and straightway he has forgotten what he was like. For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
25 But *he* that fixes his view on [the] perfect law, that of liberty, and abides in [it], being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of [the] work, *he* shall be blessed in his doing. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
26 If any one think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, this man's religion is vain. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.
27 Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.

1 My brethren, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [Lord] of glory, with respect of persons: My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.
2 for if there come unto your synagogue a man with a gold ring in splendid apparel, and a poor man also come in in vile apparel, For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
3 and ye look upon him who wears the splendid apparel, and say, Do thou sit here well, and say to the poor, Do thou stand there, or sit here under my footstool: And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
4 have ye not made a difference among yourselves, and become judges having evil thoughts? Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
5 Hear, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen the poor as to the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to them that love him? Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
6 But *ye* have despised the poor [man]. Do not the rich oppress you, and [do not] *they* drag you before [the] tribunals? But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
7 And [do not] *they* blaspheme the excellent name which has been called upon you? Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
8 If indeed ye keep [the] royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well. If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
9 But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
10 For whoever shall keep the whole law and shall offend in one [point], he has come under the guilt of [breaking] all. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.
11 For he who said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become transgressor of [the] law. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
12 So speak ye, and so act, as those that are to be judged by [the] law of liberty; So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
13 for judgment [will be] without mercy to him that has shewn no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment. For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
14 What [is] the profit, my brethren, if any one say he have faith, but have not works? can faith save him? What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
15 Now if a brother or a sister is naked and destitute of daily food, If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
16 and one from amongst you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; but give not to them the needful things for the body, what [is] the profit? And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?
17 So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself. Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
18 But some one will say, *Thou* hast faith and *I* have works. Shew me thy faith without works, and *I* from my works will shew thee my faith. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
19 *Thou* believest that God is one. Thou doest well. The demons even believe, and tremble. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
22 Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and that by works faith was perfected. Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
23 And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and he was called Friend of God. And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
24 Ye see that a man is justified on the principle of works, and not on the principle of faith only. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
25 But was not in like manner also Rahab the harlot justified on the principle of works, when she had received the messengers and put [them] forth by another way? Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?
26 For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

1 Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment. My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
2 For we all often offend. If any one offend not in word, *he* [is] a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too. For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body.
3 Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies. Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
4 Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder, wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will. Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
5 Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles! Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
6 and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body, and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell. And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
7 For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species; For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
8 but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison. But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
9 Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after [the] likeness of God. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
10 Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
11 Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth sweet and bitter? Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?
12 Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water. Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
13 Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom; Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
14 but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
15 This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish.
16 For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder and every evil thing. For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.
17 But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
18 But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

1 Whence [come] wars and whence fightings among you? [Is it] not thence, -- from your pleasures, which war in your members? From whence [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members?
2 Ye lust and have not: ye kill and are full of envy, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war; ye have not because ye ask not. Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
3 Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may consume [it] in your pleasures. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts.
4 Adulteresses, know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore is minded to be [the] friend of the world is constituted enemy of God. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
5 Think ye that the scripture speaks in vain? Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously? Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
6 But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says, God sets himself against [the] proud, but gives grace to [the] lowly. But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
7 Subject yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, sinners, and purify [your] hearts, ye double-minded. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.
9 Be wretched, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.
10 Humble yourselves before [the] Lord, and he shall exalt you. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
11 Speak not against one another, brethren. He that speaks against [his] brother, or judges his brother, speaks against [the] law and judges [the] law. But if thou judgest [the] law, thou art not doer of [the] law, but judge. Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
12 One is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy: but who art *thou* who judgest thy neighbour? There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
13 Go to now, ye who say, To-day or to-morrow will we go into such a city and spend a year there, and traffic and make gain, Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
14 ye who do not know what will be on the morrow, ([for] what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, appearing for a little while, and then disappearing,) Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
15 instead of your saying, If the Lord should [so] will and we should live, we will also do this or that. For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
16 But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil. But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
17 To him therefore who knows how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.
{5}
1 Go to now, ye rich, weep, howling over your miseries that [are] coming upon [you]. Go to now, [ye] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [you].
2 Your wealth is become rotten, and your garments moth-eaten. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
3 Your gold and silver is eaten away, and their canker shall be for a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have heaped up treasure in [the] last days. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
4 Behold, the wages of your labourers, who have harvested your fields, wrongfully kept back by you, cry, and the cries of those that have reaped are entered into the ears of [the] Lord of sabaoth. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
5 Ye have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged yourselves; ye have nourished your hearts [as] in a day of slaughter; Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
6 ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you. Ye have condemned [and] killed the just; [and] he doth not resist you.
7 Have patience, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the Lord. Behold, the labourer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, having patience for it until it receive [the] early and [the] latter rain. Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
8 *Ye* also have patience: stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is drawn nigh. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
9 Complain not one against another, brethren, that ye be not judged. Behold, the judge stands before the door. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
10 Take [as] an example, brethren, of suffering and having patience, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of [the] Lord. Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
11 Behold, we call them blessed who have endured. Ye have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
12 But before all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, that ye do not fall under judgment. But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
13 Does any one among you suffer evil? let him pray. Is any happy? let him sing psalms. Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
14 Is any sick among you? let him call to [him] the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of [the] Lord; Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
15 and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
16 Confess therefore your offences to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. [The] fervent supplication of the righteous [man] has much power. Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
17 Elias was a man of like passions to us, and he prayed with prayer that it should not rain; and it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months; Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
18 and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
19 My brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and one bring him back, Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
20 let him know that he that brings back a sinner from [the] error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins. Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
