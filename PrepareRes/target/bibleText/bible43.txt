{#John}
{1}
1 In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
2 <i>He</i> was in the beginning with God. The same was in the beginning with God.
3 All things received being through him, and without him not one [thing] received being which has received being. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
5 And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
6 There was a man sent from God, his name John. There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.
7 He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe.
8 <i>He</i> was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light. He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.
9 The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man. [That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
10 He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through him, and the world knew him not. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
11 He came to his own, and his own received him not; He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
12 but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:
13 who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
15 (John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;) John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
16 for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace. And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
17 For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ. For the law was given by Moses, [but] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
18 No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared [him]. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].
19 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou? And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
20 And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ. And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
22 They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
23 He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet. He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
24 And they were sent from among the Pharisees. And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
25 And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet? And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
26 John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
27 he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose. He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
28 These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
29 On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
30 He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me; This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
31 and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
32 And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him. And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
33 And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
34 And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
35 Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples. Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
36 And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God. And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
37 And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
38 But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And <i>they</i> said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou? Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
39 He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour. He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him. One of the two which heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
41 He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ). He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
42 And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone). And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
43 On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me. The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.
44 And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
45 Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
46 And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
48 Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
49 Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
50 Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
51 And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

1 And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
2 And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
3 And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
4 Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
5 His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].
6 Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
7 Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
8 And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the feast-master. And they carried [it]. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it].
9 But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom, When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
10 and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now. And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.
11 This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
12 After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
13 And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
14 And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting; And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
15 and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables, And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
16 and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
17 [And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
18 The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things? Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
19 Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
20 The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days? Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
21 But <i>he</i> spoke of the temple of his body. But he spake of the temple of his body.
22 When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
23 And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
24 But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all [men], But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],
25 and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man. And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.

1 But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
2 he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
3 Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
4 Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born being old? can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born? Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
7 Do not wonder that I said to thee, It is needful that <i>ye</i> should be born anew. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
8 The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be? Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
10 Jesus answered and said to him, Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things! Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
12 If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe? If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?
13 And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven. And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.
14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
15 that every one who believes on him may [not perish, but] have life eternal. That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
17 For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
18 He that believes on him is not judged: but he that believes not has been already judged, because he has not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
19 And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
20 For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are; For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
21 but he that practises the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he abode with them and baptised. After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
23 And John also was baptising in Aenon, near Salim, because there was a great deal of water there; and they came to [him] and were baptised: And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
24 for John was not yet cast into prison. For John was not yet cast into prison.
25 There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification. Then there arose a question between [some] of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
26 And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, he baptises, and all come to him. And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come to him.
27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
28 Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
29 He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy then is fulfilled. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
30 He must increase, but I must decrease. He must increase, but I [must] decrease.
31 He who comes from above is above all. He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks [as] of the earth. He who comes out of heaven is above all, He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
32 [and] what he has seen and has heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony. And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
33 He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true; He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
34 for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure. For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him].
35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things [to be] in his hand. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
36 He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

1 When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
2 (however, Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples), (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
3 he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee. He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
4 And he must needs pass through Samaria. And he must needs go through Samaria.
5 He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
6 Now a fountain of Jacob's was there; Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.
7 A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
8 (for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions). (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
9 The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
10 Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
11 The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water? The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
13 Jesus answered and said to her, Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again; Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
14 but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
15 The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw. The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
16 Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here. Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
17 The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband; The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
18 for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband: this thou hast spoken truly. For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
19 The woman says to him, Sir, I see that thou art a prophet. The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
21 Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
22 Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
23 But [the] hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
24 God [is] a spirit; and they who worship him must worship [him] in spirit and truth. God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.
25 The woman says to him, I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when <i>he</i> comes he will tell us all things. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
26 Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am [he]. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].
27 And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
28 The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men, The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
29 Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ? Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
30 They went out of the city and came to him. Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
31 But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat. In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
32 But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not know. But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
33 The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one brought him [anything] to eat? Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [ought] to eat?
34 Jesus says to them, My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work. Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
35 Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
36 He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
37 For in this is [verified] the true saying, It is one who sows and another who reaps. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
38 I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
39 But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done. And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
40 When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them, and he abode there two days. So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
41 And more a great deal believed on account of his word; And many more believed because of his own word;
42 and they said to the woman, [It is] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world. And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
43 But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee, Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
44 for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country. For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
45 When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast. Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
46 He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick. So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
47 He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him and asked [him] that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
48 Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
49 The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
50 Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
51 But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and brought [him] word saying, Thy child lives. And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.
52 He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
53 The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house. So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
54 This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea into Galilee. This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
{5}
1 After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
2 Now there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
3 In these lay a multitude of sick, blind, lame, withered, [awaiting the moving of the water. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
4 For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water. Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well, whatever disease he laboured under.] For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
5 But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
6 Jesus seeing this [man] lying [there], and knowing that he was [in that state] now a great length of time, says to him, Wouldest thou become well? When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
7 The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me. The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
8 Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
9 And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch and walked: and on that day was sabbath. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
10 The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath, it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch. The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.
11 He answered them, He that made me well, <i>he</i> said to me, Take up thy couch and walk. He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
12 They asked him [therefore], Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy couch and walk? Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
13 But he that had been healed knew not who it was, for Jesus had slidden away, there being a crowd in the place. And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.
14 After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
16 And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill him], because he had done these things on sabbath. And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work. But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
18 For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God. Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
19 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things <i>he</i> does, these things also the Son does in like manner. Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
20 For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder. For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
21 For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them], thus the Son also quickens whom he will: For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
22 for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son; For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
23 that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him. That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
26 For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself, For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
27 and has given him authority to execute judgment [also], because he is Son of man. And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
28 Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
29 and shall go forth; those that have practised good, to resurrection of life, and those that have done evil, to resurrection of judgment. And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
30 I cannot do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I do not seek my will, but the will of him that has sent me. I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
31 If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
32 It is another who bears witness concerning me, and I know that the witness which he bears concerning me is true. There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
33 Ye have sent unto John, and he has borne witness to the truth. Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
34 But I do not receive witness from man, but I say this that <i>ye</i> might be saved. But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
35 <i>He</i> was the burning and shining lamp, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
36 But I have the witness [that is] greater than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me. But I have greater witness than [that] of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
37 And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have seen his shape, And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
38 and ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom <i>he</i> hath sent, him ye do not believe. And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
39 Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me; Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
40 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
41 I do not receive glory from men, I receive not honour from men.
42 but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive. I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
44 How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and seek not the glory which [comes] from God alone? How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that [cometh] from God only?
45 Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] who accuses you, Moses, on whom ye trust; Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.
46 for if ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
47 But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words? But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

1 After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, [or] of Tiberias, After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.
2 and a great crowd followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought upon the sick. And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there sat with his disciples: And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
4 but the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
5 Jesus then, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat? When Jesus then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
6 But this he said trying him, for he knew what he was going to do. And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
7 Philip answered him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them, that each may have some little [portion]. Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him, One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,
9 There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many? There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
10 [And] Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place: the men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
11 And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed [them] to those that were set down; and in like manner of the small fishes as much as they would. And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
12 And when they had been filled, he says to his disciples, Gather together the fragments which are over and above, that nothing may be lost. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
13 They gathered [them] therefore together, and filled twelve hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves, which were over and above to those that had eaten. Therefore they gathered [them] together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
14 The men therefore, having seen the sign which Jesus had done, said, This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
15 Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him, that they might make [him] king, departed again to the mountain himself alone. When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
16 But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea, And when even was [now] come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
17 and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them, And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
18 and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
19 Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they were frightened. So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
20 But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid. But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
21 They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went. Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
22 On the morrow the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little ship there except that into which his disciples had got, and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the ship, but [that] his disciples had gone away alone; The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples were gone away alone;
23 (but other little ships out of Tiberias came near to the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks;) (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
24 when therefore the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, <i>they</i> got into the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
25 And having found him the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when art thou arrived here? And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs, but because ye have eaten of the loaves and been filled. Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
27 Work not [for] the food which perishes, but [for] the food which abides unto life eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you; for him has the Father sealed, [even] God. Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
28 They said therefore to him, What should we do that we may work the works of God? Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
29 Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom <i>he</i> has sent. Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
30 They said therefore to him, What sign then doest thou that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work? They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
32 Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, [It is] not Moses that has given you the bread out of heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
33 For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
34 They said therefore to him, Lord, ever give to us this bread. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
35 [And] Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst at any time. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
36 But I have said to you, that ye have also seen me and do not believe. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
37 All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
38 For I am come down from heaven, not that I should do <i>my</i> will, but the will of him that has sent me. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
39 And this is the will of him that has sent me, that of all that he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
40 For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, should have life eternal; and I will raise him up at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
41 The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which has come down out of heaven. The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
42 And they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have known? how then does <i>he</i> say, I am come down out of heaven? And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
43 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves. Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
44 No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one that has heard from the Father [himself], and has learned [of him], comes to me; It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.
46 not that any one has seen the Father, except he who is of God, he has seen the Father. Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.
47 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes [on me] has life eternal. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
48 I am the bread of life. I am that bread of life.
49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
51 I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven: if any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever; but the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
52 The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How can he give us this flesh to eat? The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?
53 Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
54 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up at the last day: Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
55 for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
56 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
57 As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, <i>he</i> also who eats me shall live also on account of me. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
58 This is the bread which has come down out of heaven. Not as the fathers ate and died: he that eats this bread shall live for ever. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
59 These things he said in [the] synagogue, teaching in Capernaum. These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
60 Many therefore of his disciples having heard [it] said, This word is hard; who can hear it? Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this], said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmur concerning this, said to them, Does this offend you? When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
62 If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before? [What] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
63 It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life. It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, [they] are spirit, and [they] are life.
64 But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would deliver him up. But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father. And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
66 From that [time] many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him. From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
67 Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
69 and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
71 Now he spoke of Judas [the son] of Simon, Iscariote, for he [it was who] should deliver him up, being one of the twelve. He spake of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
{7}
1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him. After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
2 Now the tabernacles, the feast of the Jews, was near. Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
3 His brethren therefore said to him, Remove hence and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest; His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
4 for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be [known] in public. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world: For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
5 for neither did his brethren believe on him. For neither did his brethren believe in him.
6 Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready. Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
7 The world cannot hate you, but me it hates, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are evil. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
8 Ye, go ye up to this feast. I go not up to this feast, for <i>my</i> time is not yet fulfilled. Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
9 Having said these things to them he abode in Galilee. When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.
10 But when his brethren had gone up, then he himself also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret. But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
11 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
12 And there was much murmuring concerning him among the crowds. Some said, He is [a] good [man]; others said, No; but he deceives the crowd. And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
13 However, no one spoke openly concerning him on account of [their] fear of the Jews. Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
14 But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
15 The Jews therefore wondered, saying, How knows this [man] letters, having never learned? And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
16 Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but [that] of him that has sent me. Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
17 If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or [that] I speak from myself. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or [whether] I speak of myself.
18 He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that has sent him, he is true, and unrighteousness is not in him. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
19 Has not Moses given you the law, and no one of you practises the law? Why do ye seek to kill me? Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
20 The crowd answered [and said], Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
21 Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all wonder. Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
22 Therefore Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on sabbath. Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
23 If a man receives circumcision on sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be violated, are ye angry with me because I have made a man entirely sound on sabbath? If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
24 Judge not according to sight, but judge righteous judgment. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
25 Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
26 and behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers then indeed recognised that this is the Christ? But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
27 But [as to] this [man] we know whence he is. Now [as to] the Christ, when he comes, no one knows whence he is. Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
28 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me and ye know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye do not know. Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
29 I know him, because I am from him, and <i>he</i> has sent me. But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
30 They sought therefore to take him; and no one laid his hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come. Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
31 But many of the crowd believed on him, and said, Will the Christ, when he comes, do more signs than those which this [man] has done? And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they might take him. The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to him that has sent me. Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me.
34 Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me], and where I am ye cannot come. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.
35 The Jews therefore said to one another, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
36 What word is this which he said, Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me]; and where I am ye cannot come? What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?
37 In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
38 He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
39 But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for [the] Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
40 [Some] out of the crowd therefore, having heard this word, said, This is truly the prophet. Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
41 Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee? Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
42 Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was? Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
43 There was a division therefore in the crowd on account of him. So there was a division among the people because of him.
44 But some of them desired to take him, but no one laid hands upon him. And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him? Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
46 The officers answered, Never man spoke thus, as this man [speaks]. The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also deceived? Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
48 Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
49 But this crowd, which does not know the law, are accursed. But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
50 Nicodemus says to them (being one of themselves), Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
51 Does our law judge a man before it have first heard from himself, and know what he does? Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
52 They answered and said to him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and look, that no prophet arises out of Galilee. They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
53 And every one went to his home. And every man went unto his own house.
{8}
1 But Jesus went to the mount of Olives. Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
3 And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [to him] a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst, And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
4 they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in the very act, committing adultery. They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
5 Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou therefore, what sayest thou? Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
6 But this they said proving him, that they might have [something] to accuse him [of]. But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground. This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].
7 But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
8 And again stooping down he wrote on the ground. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
9 But they, having heard [that], went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there. And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
10 And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee? When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
11 And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
12 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
13 The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true. The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
14 Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go. Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
15 Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
16 And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
17 And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true: It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
18 I am [one] who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
19 They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father. Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
20 These words spoke he in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one took him, for his hour was not yet come. These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
21 He said therefore again to them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin; where I go ye cannot come. Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
22 The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go ye cannot come? Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
23 And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world. And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
24 I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins; for unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.
25 They said therefore to him, Who art thou? [And] Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also say to you. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.
26 I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but he that has sent me is true, and I, what I have heard from him, these things I say to the world. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
27 They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
28 Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things. Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
29 And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
30 As he spoke these things many believed on him. As he spake these words, many believed on him.
31 Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples; Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;
32 and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
33 They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never been under bondage to any one; how sayest thou, Ye shall become free? They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
35 Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.
36 If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word has no entrance in you. I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
38 I speak what I have seen with my Father, and ye then do what ye have seen with your father. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
39 They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham; They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
40 but now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
41 Ye do the works of your father. They said [therefore] to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, God. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.
42 Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for neither am I come of myself, but <i>he</i> has sent me. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
43 Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word. Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.
44 Ye are of the devil, as [your] father, and ye desire to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks of what is his own; for he is a liar and its father: Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
45 and because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me. And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.
46 Which of you convinces me of sin? If I speak truth, why do ye not believe me? Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
47 He that is of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear [them] not, because ye are not of God. He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.
48 The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon? Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
50 But I do not seek my own glory: there is he that seeks and judges. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one shall keep my word, he shall never see death. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
52 The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham has died, and the prophets, and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste death. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who has died? and the prophets have died: whom makest thou thyself? Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me, [of] whom ye say, He is our God. Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
55 And ye know him not; but I know him; and if I said, I know him not, I should be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word. Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
56 Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it], and was glad.
57 The Jews therefore said to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham? Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
58 Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
59 They took up therefore stones that they might cast [them] at him; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, [going through the midst of them, and thus passed on.] Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
{9}
1 And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth. And as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from [his] birth.
2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this [man] or his parents, that he should be born blind? And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
3 Jesus answered, Neither has this [man] sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him. Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
4 I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day. [The] night is coming, when no one can work. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
5 As long as I am in the world, I am [the] light of the world. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
6 Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
7 And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing. And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
8 The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging? The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
9 Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him: <i>he</i> said, It is I. Some said, This is he: others [said], He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he].
10 They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been opened? Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
11 He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw. He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
12 They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not know. Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
13 They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees. They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
14 Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
15 The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
16 Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
17 They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
18 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
19 And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind: how then does he now see? And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
20 His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
21 but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. <i>He</i> is of age: ask <i>him</i>; <i>he</i> will speak concerning himself. But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
22 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue. These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
23 On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask <i>him</i>. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
24 They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
25 He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no], I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
26 And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes? Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
27 He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples? He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be his disciples?
28 They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
29 We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we know not whence he is. We know that God spake unto Moses: [as for] this [fellow], we know not from whence he is.
30 The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that <i>ye</i> do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes. The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes.
31 [But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
32 Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
33 If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do nothing. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
34 They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out. They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
36 He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
37 And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
38 And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

1 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, <i>he</i> is a thief and a robber; Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
2 but he that enters in by the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
3 To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
4 When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
5 But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
6 This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was [of] which he spoke to them. This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
7 Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
8 All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
9 I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
10 The thief comes not but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I am come that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.
11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep: I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
12 but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
13 Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
14 I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep], and am known of mine.
15 as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
16 And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd.
17 On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment of my Father. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
19 There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words; There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
20 but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye hear him? And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
21 Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people's eyes? Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father's name, these bear witness concerning me: Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
26 but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you. But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
28 and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand. And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.
29 My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father. My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.
30 I and the Father are one. I and [my] Father are one.
31 The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me? Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
33 The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God. The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
35 If he called <i>them</i> gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken), If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
36 do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God? Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
38 but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I in him. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father [is] in me, and I in him.
39 They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
40 and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there. And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

42 And many believed on him there. And many believed on him there.

9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world; Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
10 but if any one walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
11 These things said he; and after this he says to them, Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
12 The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen asleep, he will get well. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
13 But Jesus spoke of his death, but <i>they</i> thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
14 Jesus therefore then said to them plainly, Lazarus has died. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

43 for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
44 But Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me; Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
45 and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
46 I am come into the world [as] light, that every one that believes on me may not abide in darkness; I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
47 and if any one hear my words and do not keep [them], I judge him not, for I am not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
48 He that rejects me and does not receive my words, has him who judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
49 For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak; For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
50 and I know that his commandment is life eternal. What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
2 And during supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, that he should deliver him up, And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], to betray him;
3 [Jesus,] knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God, Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
4 rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
5 then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel wherewith he was girded.
6 He comes therefore to Simon Peter; and <i>he</i> says to him, Lord, dost thou wash <i>my</i> feet? Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou dost not know now, but thou shalt know hereafter. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
8 Peter says to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
9 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head.
10 Jesus says to him, He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean; and ye are clean, but not all. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
11 For he knew him that delivered him up: on account of this he said, Ye are not all clean. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
12 When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye know what I have done to you? So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
13 Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am [so]. Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for [so] I am.
14 If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet; If I then, [your] Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
15 for I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should do also. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
16 Verily, verily, I say to you, The bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
17 If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
18 I speak not of you all. I know those whom I have chosen; but that the scripture might be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me. I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.
19 I tell you [it] now before it happens, that when it happens, ye may believe that I am [he]. Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he].
20 Verily, verily, I say to you, He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he that receives me receives him who has sent me. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
21 Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up. When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
22 The disciples therefore looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke. Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
23 Now there was at table one of his disciples in the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus loved. Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
24 Simon Peter makes a sign therefore to him to ask who it might be of whom he spoke. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.
25 But he, leaning on the breast of Jesus, says to him, Lord, who is it? He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
26 Jesus answers, He it is to whom I, after I have dipped the morsel, give it. And having dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote. Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped [it]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon.
27 And, after the morsel, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore says to him, What thou doest, do quickly. And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
28 But none of those at table knew why he said this to him; Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
29 for some supposed, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy the things of which we have need for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor. For some [of them] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
30 Having therefore received the morsel, he went out immediately; and it was night. He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
31 When therefore he was gone out Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
32 If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
33 Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and, as I said to the Jews, Where I go ye cannot come, I say to you also now. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
34 A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
35 By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves. By this shall all [men] know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
36 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where goest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me after. Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
37 Peter says to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee. Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
38 Jesus answers, Thou wilt lay down thy life for me! Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice. Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
{14}
1 Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe on God, believe also on me. Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
2 In my Father's house there are many abodes; were it not so, I had told you: for I go to prepare you a place; In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were] not [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
3 and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be also.
4 And ye know where I go, and ye know the way. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
5 Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou goest, and how can we know the way? Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
6 Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
7 If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father, and henceforth ye know him and have seen him. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
8 Philip says to him, Lord, shew us the Father and it suffices us. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
9 Jesus says to him, Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father? Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father?
10 Believest thou not that I [am] in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself; but the Father who abides in me, he does the works. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
11 Believe <i>me</i> that I [am] in the Father and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the works' sake themselves. Believe me that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
12 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works which I do shall he do also, and he shall do greater than these, because I go to the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, this will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14 If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do [it].
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. If ye love me, keep my commandments.
16 And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you. [Even] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
18 I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
19 Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
20 In that day ye shall know that I [am] in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. At that day ye shall know that I [am] in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
21 He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
22 Judas, not the Iscariote, says to him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world? Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
23 Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
24 He that loves me not does not keep my words; and the word which ye hear is not mine, but [that] of the Father who has sent me. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
25 These things I have said to you, abiding with you; These things have I spoken unto you, being [yet] present with you.
26 but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, <i>he</i> shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you. But the Comforter, [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
27 I leave peace with you; I give <i>my</i> peace to you: not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it fear. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
28 Ye have heard that I have said unto you, I go away and I am coming to you. If ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father, for [my] Father is greater than I. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come [again] unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
29 And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it shall have come to pass ye may believe. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
30 I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing; Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
31 but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has commanded me, thus I do. Rise up, let us go hence. But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
{15}
1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
2 [As to] every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it away; and [as to] every one bearing fruit, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
3 Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
4 Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine, thus neither [can] ye unless ye abide in me. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
5 I am the vine, ye [are] the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, <i>he</i> bears much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing. I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
6 Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch, and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned.
7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
8 In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
9 As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
10 If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
11 I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you, and your joy be full. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and [that] your joy might be full.
12 This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
13 No one has greater love than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
14 Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
15 I call you no longer bondmen, for the bondman does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have set you that ye should go and [that] ye should bear fruit, and [that] your fruit should abide, that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
17 These things I command you, that ye love one another. These things I command you, that ye love one another.
18 If the world hate you, know that it has hated me before you. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you.
19 If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on account of this the world hates you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
20 Remember the word which I said unto you, The bondman is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep also yours. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
21 But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they have not known him that sent me. But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.
22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.
23 He that hates me hates also my Father. He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
24 If I had not done among them the works which no other one has done, they had not had sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
25 But that the word written in their law might be fulfilled, They hated me without a cause. But [this cometh to pass], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, <i>he</i> shall bear witness concerning me; But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
27 and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from [the] beginning. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
{16}
1 These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended. These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
2 They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God; They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
3 and these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor me. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
4 But I have spoken these things to you, that when their hour shall have come, ye may remember them, that I have said [them] unto you. But I did not say these things unto you from [the] beginning, because I was with you. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
5 But now I go to him that has sent me, and none of you demands of me, Where goest thou? But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
7 But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
8 And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
9 of sin, because they do not believe on me; Of sin, because they believe not on me;
10 of righteousness, because I go away to [my] Father, and ye behold me no longer; Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
11 of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
12 I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
13 But when <i>he</i> is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
14 He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce [it] to you. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.
15 All things that the Father has are mine; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce [it] to you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.
16 A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, [because I go away to the Father]. A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
17 [Some] of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this he says to us, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, and, Because I go away to the Father? Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
18 They said therefore, What is this which he says [of] the little while? We do not know [of] what he speaks. They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.
19 Jesus knew therefore that they desired to demand of him, and said to them, Do ye inquire of this among yourselves that I said, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me? Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
20 Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and lament, ye, but the world shall rejoice; and ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy. Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
21 A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief because her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the trouble, on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world. A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
22 And ye now therefore have grief; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you. And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
23 And in that day ye shall demand nothing of me: verily, verily, I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you. And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give [it] you.
24 Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
25 These things I have spoken to you in allegories; the hour is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories, but will declare to you openly concerning the Father. These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
26 In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you, At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
27 for the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God. For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
28 I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
29 His disciples say to him, Lo, now thou speakest openly and utterest no allegory. His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
30 Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast not need that any one should demand of thee. By this we believe that thou art come from God. Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
32 Behold, [the] hour is coming, and has come, that ye shall be scattered, each to his own, and shall leave me alone; and [yet] I am not alone, for the Father is with me. Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
33 These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good courage: I have overcome the world. These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
{17}
1 These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee; These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
2 as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that [as to] all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal. As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
3 And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
4 I have glorified <i>thee</i> on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it; I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
5 and now glorify <i>me</i>, <i>thou</i> Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
6 I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
7 Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee; Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
8 for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received [them], and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received [them], and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
9 I demand concerning them; I do not demand concerning the world, but concerning those whom thou hast given me, for they are thine, I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.
10 (and all that is mine is thine, and [all] that is thine mine,) and I am glorified in them. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
11 And I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we [are].
12 When I was with them I kept them in thy name; those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
13 And now I come to thee. And these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them. And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
14 I have given them thy word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
15 I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
16 They are not of the world, as I am not of the world. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
17 Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
18 As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world; As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
19 and I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
20 And I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word; Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
21 that they may be all one, as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
22 And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one; And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
23 I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one [and] that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and [that] thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
24 Father, [as to] those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before [the] foundation of [the] world. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
25 Righteous Father, -- and the world has not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
26 And I have made known to them thy name, and will make [it] known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
{18}
1 Jesus, having said these things, went out with his disciples beyond the torrent Cedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, he and his disciples. When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
2 And Judas also, who delivered him up, knew the place, because Jesus was often there, in company with his disciples. And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
3 Judas therefore, having got the band, and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Judas then, having received a band [of men] and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye? Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
5 They answered him, Jesus the Nazaraean. Jesus says to them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who delivered him up, stood with them. They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am [he]. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
6 When therefore he said to them, I am [he], they went away backward and fell to the ground. As soon then as he had said unto them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.
7 He demanded of them therefore again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazaraean. Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
8 Jesus answered, I told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go away; Jesus answered, I have told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
9 that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, [As to] those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them. That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.
10 Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear; and the bondman's name was Malchus. Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
11 Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it? Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
12 The band therefore, and the chiliarch, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him: Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
13 and they led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
14 But it was Caiaphas who counselled the Jews that it was better that one man should perish for the people. Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
15 Now Simon Peter followed Jesus, and the other disciple. But that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest; And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
16 but Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the porteress and brought in Peter. But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
17 The maid therefore, who was porteress, says to Peter, Art thou also of the disciples of this man? He says, I am not. Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also [one] of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
18 But the bondmen and officers, having made a fire of coals (for it was cold), stood and warmed themselves; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself. And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
19 The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine. The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
20 Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I taught always in [the] synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
21 Why demandest thou of me? Demand of those who have heard, what I have spoken to them; behold, they know what I have said. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
22 But as he said these things, one of the officers who stood by gave a blow on the face to Jesus, saying, Answerest thou the high priest thus? And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
24 Annas [then] had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
25 But Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Art thou also of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples? He denied [it], and said, I am not.
26 One of the bondmen of the high priest, who was kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? One of the servants of the high priest, being [his] kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
27 Peter denied therefore again, and immediately [the] cock crew. Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
28 They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium; and it was early morn. And <i>they</i> entered not into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but eat the passover. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
29 Pilate therefore went out to them and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man? Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
30 They answered and said to him, If this [man] were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to thee. They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
31 Pilate therefore said to them, Take him, ye, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted to us to put any one to death; Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying what death he should die. That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
33 Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called Jesus, and said to him, Thou art the king of the Jews? Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
34 Jesus answered [him], Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee concerning me? Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
37 Pilate therefore said to him, Thou art then a king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest [it], that I am a king. I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice. Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
38 Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault whatever in him. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault [at all].
39 But ye have a custom that I release [some] one to you at the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews? But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
40 They cried therefore again all, saying, Not this [man], but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
{19}
1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [him]. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged [him].
2 And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him, And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
3 and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face. And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
4 And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever. Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
5 (Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the man! Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold the man!
6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him. When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify [him]: for I find no fault in him.
7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
8 When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid, When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
9 and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
10 Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to <i>me</i>? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee? Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
11 Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin. Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power [at all] against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
12 From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar. And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
13 Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha; When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
14 (now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king! And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
15 But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. But they cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
16 Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away. Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.
17 And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha; And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle. Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
19 And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews. And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
20 This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, [and] Greek, [and] Latin.
21 The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that <i>he</i> said, I am king of the Jews. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
22 Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
24 They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
25 And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
26 Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
27 Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home].
28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst. After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
29 There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.
30 When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
31 The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.
32 The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him; Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
33 but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs, But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
34 but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water. But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
35 And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe. And he that saw [it] bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
36 For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken. For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
37 And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced. And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
38 And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus. And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
39 And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight]. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound [weight].
40 They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial. Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
41 But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
42 There therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation [day]; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
{20}
1 And on the first [day] of the week Mary of Magdala comes in early morn to the tomb, while it was still dark, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb. The first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
2 She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
3 Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
4 And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb, So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
5 and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in. And he stooping down, [and looking in], saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
6 Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying, Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
7 and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself. And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
8 Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed; Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
9 for they had not yet known the scripture, that he must rise from among [the] dead. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
10 The disciples therefore went away again to their own home. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
11 But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without. As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb, But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, [and looked] into the sepulchre,
12 and beholds two angels sitting in white [garments], one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
13 And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
14 Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [there], and knew not that it was Jesus. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
15 Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
16 Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
17 Jesus says to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and [to] my God, and your God.
18 Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to her. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had spoken these things unto her.
19 When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first [day] of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace [be] to you. Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.
20 And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them [his] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
21 [Jesus] said therefore again to them, Peace [be] to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as [my] Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
22 And having said this, he breathed into [them], and says to them, Receive [the] Holy Spirit: And when he had said this, he breathed on [them], and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
23 whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; [and] whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.

25 The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
26 And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace [be] to you. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: [then] came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you.
27 Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here and see my hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side; and be not unbelieving, but believing. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
28 Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
29 Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed: blessed they who have not seen and have believed. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.
30 Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book; And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
31 but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

3 Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and went on board, and that night took nothing. Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
4 And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
5 Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No. Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.
6 And he said to them, Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find. They cast therefore, and they could no longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat [on him] (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea; Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's coat [unto him], (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
8 and the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from the land, but somewhere about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of fishes. And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
9 When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
10 Jesus says to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken. Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
11 Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not rent. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
12 Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus saith unto them, Come [and] dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
13 Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish in like manner. Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
14 This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among [the] dead. This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
15 When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs. So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
16 He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep. He saith to him again the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
17 He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
18 Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry [thee] whither thou wouldest not.
19 But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me. This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
20 Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up? Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
21 Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this [man]? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do]?
22 Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me. Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee? follow thou me.
23 This word therefore went out among the brethren, That disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?
24 This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true. This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
