{#Galatians}
{1}
1 Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God [the] Father who raised him from among [the] dead, Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
2 and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia. And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
3 Grace to you, and peace, from God [the] Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, Grace [be] to you and peace from God the Father, and [from] our Lord Jesus Christ,
4 who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father; Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
5 to whom [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen. To whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
6 I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel, I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
7 which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
8 But if even *we* or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you, let him be accursed. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
9 As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have received, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
10 For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman. For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
11 But I let you know, brethren, [as to] the glad tidings which were announced by me, that they are not according to man. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
12 For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I taught [them], but by revelation of Jesus Christ. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
13 For ye have heard [what was] my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it; For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
14 and advanced in Judaism beyond many [my] contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers. And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
15 But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace, But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,
16 was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
17 nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days; Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
19 but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord. But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.
20 Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
21 Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
22 But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ; And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
23 only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged: But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
24 and they glorified God in me. And they glorified God in me.
{2}
1 Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me]; Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with [me] also.
2 and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but privately to those conspicuous [among them], lest in any way I run or had run in vain; And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
3 (but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised;) But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
4 and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage; And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
5 to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you. To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
6 But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat -- whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing; But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed [to be somewhat] in conference added nothing to me:
7 but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision, But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the gospel] of the circumcision [was] unto Peter;
8 (for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,) (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
9 and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that *we* [should go] to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision; And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we [should go] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
10 only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do. Only [they would] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned: But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
12 for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision; For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
13 and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
14 But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize? But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
15 We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations, We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
16 but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
17 Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin? Far be the thought. But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
18 For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again, I constitute myself a transgressor. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
19 For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
20 I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
21 I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness [is] by law, then Christ has died for nothing. I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
{3}
1 O senseless Galatians, who has bewitched you; to whom, as before your very eyes, Jesus Christ has been portrayed, crucified [among you]? O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
2 This only I wish to learn of you, Have ye received the Spirit on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of faith? This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
3 Are ye so senseless? having begun in Spirit, are ye going to be made perfect in flesh? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
4 Have ye suffered so many things in vain, if indeed also in vain? Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if [it be] yet in vain.
5 He therefore who ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, [is it] on the principle of works of law, or of [the] report of faith? He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
7 Know then that they that are on the principle of faith, these are Abraham's sons; Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
8 and the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham: In thee all the nations shall be blessed. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.
9 So that they who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
10 For as many as are on the principle of works of law are under curse. For it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of the law to do them; For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
11 but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident, because The just shall live on the principle of faith; But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
12 but the law is not on the principle of faith; but, He that shall have done these things shall live by them. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.
13 Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one hanged upon a tree,) Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:
14 that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
15 Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man's covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
16 But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
17 Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
18 For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise. For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.
19 Why then the law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator. Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
20 But a mediator is not of one, but God is one. Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.
21 [Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the thought. For if a law had been given able to quicken, then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law; [Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
22 but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those that believe. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
23 But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
24 So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we might be justified on the principle of faith. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
25 But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor; But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
26 for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
27 For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
28 There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus: There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
29 but if *ye* [are] of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise. And if ye [be] Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
{4}
1 Now I say, As long as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all; Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
2 but he is under guardians and stewards until the period fixed by the father. But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
3 So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the principles of the world; Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
4 but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
5 that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship. To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
6 But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
7 So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
8 But then indeed, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods; Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
9 but now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye desire to be again anew in bondage? But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
10 Ye observe days and months and times and years. Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
11 I am afraid of you, lest indeed I have laboured in vain as to you. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
12 Be as *I* [am], for *I* also [am] as *ye*, brethren, I beseech you: ye have not at all wronged me. Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all.
13 But ye know that in weakness of the flesh I announced the glad tidings to you at the first; Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
14 and my temptation, which [was] in my flesh, ye did not slight nor reject with contempt; but ye received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.
15 What then [was] your blessedness? for I bear you witness that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given [them] to me. Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
16 So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you? Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
17 They are not rightly zealous after you, but desire to shut you out [from us], that ye may be zealous after them. They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
18 But [it is] right to be zealous at all times in what is right, and not only when I am present with you -- But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.
19 my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you: My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
20 and I should wish to be present with you now, and change my voice, for I am perplexed as to you. I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
21 Tell me, ye who are desirous of being under law, do ye not listen to the law? Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the maid servant, and one of the free woman. For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
23 But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise. But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.
24 Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is Hagar. Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
25 For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children; For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
26 but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband. For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
28 But *ye*, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
29 But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now. But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.
30 But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman. Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
31 So then, brethren, we are not maid servant's children, but [children] of the free woman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
{5}
1 Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
2 Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
3 And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
4 Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
5 For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
7 Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth? Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
8 The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you. This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.
9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
10 *I* have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [of it], whosoever he may be. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
11 But *I*, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
12 I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion. I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
13 For *ye* have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do] not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
15 but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
16 But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh's lust. [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire; For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
18 but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness, Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
21 envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God's kingdom. Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
23 meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law. Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
24 But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
25 If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
26 Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
{6}
1 Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
2 Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
3 For if any man reputes himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself; For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
4 but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs to another. But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
5 For each shall bear his own burden. For every man shall bear his own burden.
6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things. Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
7 Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
8 For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life: For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
9 but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if we do not faint, we shall reap. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
10 So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
11 See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand. Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
12 As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
13 For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
14 But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [the] world is crucified to me, and I to the world. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
15 For [in Christ Jesus] neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
16 And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
17 For the rest let no one trouble me, for *I* bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus. From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit, brethren. Amen. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen. <<[To [the] Galatians written from Rome.]>>
