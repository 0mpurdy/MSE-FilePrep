{#1 Thessalonians}
{1}
1 Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians [which is] in God the Father and [in] the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you at our prayers, We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
3 remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
4 knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election. Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
5 For our glad tidings were not with you in word only, but also in power, and in [the] Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as ye know what we were among you for your sakes: For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
6 and *ye* became our imitators, and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of [the] Holy Spirit, And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
7 so that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia: So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
8 for the word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith which [is] towards God has gone abroad, so that we have no need to say anything; For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
9 for they themselves relate concerning us what entering in we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
10 and to await his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from among the dead, Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath. And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
{2}
1 For ye know yourselves, brethren, our entering in which [we had] to you, that it has not been in vain; For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
2 but, having suffered before and been insulted, even as ye know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the glad tidings of God with much earnest striving. But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
3 For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile; For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
4 but even as we have been approved of God to have the glad tidings entrusted to us, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who proves our hearts. But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
5 For we have not at any time been [among you] with flattering discourse, even as ye know, nor with a pretext for covetousness, God [is] witness; For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness:
6 nor seeking glory from men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have been a charge as Christ's apostles; Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
7 but have been gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse would cherish her own children. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
8 Thus, yearning over you, we had found our delight in having imparted to you not only the glad tidings of God, but our own lives also, because ye had become beloved of us. So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, not to be chargeable to any one of you, we have preached to you the glad tidings of God. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
10 *Ye* [are] witnesses, and God, how piously and righteously and blamelessly we have conducted ourselves with you that believe: Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
11 as ye know how, as a father his own children, we used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify, As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,
12 that ye should walk worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory. That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
13 And for this cause we also give thanks to God unceasingly that, having received [the] word of [the] report of God by us, ye accepted, not men's word, but, even as it is truly, God's word, which also works in you who believe. For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
14 For *ye*, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; for *ye* also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen as also *they* of the Jews, For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews:
15 who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have driven us out by persecution, and do not please God, and [are] against all men, Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
16 forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be saved, that they may fill up their sins always: but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost. Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
17 But we, brethren, having been bereaved of you and separated for a little moment in person, not in heart, have used more abundant diligence to see your face with much desire; But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
18 wherefore we have desired to come to you, even I Paul, both once and twice, and Satan has hindered us. Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
19 For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? [are] not *ye* also before our Lord Jesus at his coming? For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
20 for ye are our glory and joy. For ye are our glory and joy.
{3}
1 Wherefore, being no longer able to refrain ourselves, we thought good to be left alone in Athens, Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
2 and sent Timotheus, our brother and fellow-workman under God in the glad tidings of Christ, to confirm you and encourage [you] concerning your faith, And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:
3 that no one might be moved by these afflictions. (For yourselves know that we are set for this; That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
4 for also, when we were with you, we told you beforehand we are about to be in tribulation, even as also it came to pass, and ye know.) For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
5 For this reason *I* also, no longer able to refrain myself, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter had tempted you and our labour should be come to nothing. For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
6 But Timotheus having just come to us from you, and brought to us the glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have always good remembrance of us, desiring much to see us, even as we also you; But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:
7 for this reason we have been comforted in you, brethren, in all our distress and tribulation, through your faith, Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
8 because now we live if *ye* stand firm in [the] Lord. For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
9 For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice on account of you before our God, For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
10 night and day beseeching exceedingly to the end that we may see your face, and perfect what is lacking in your faith? Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
11 But our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you. Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
12 But you, may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love toward one another, and toward all, even as we also towards you, And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you:
13 in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
{4}
1 For the rest, then, brethren, we beg you and exhort you in [the] Lord Jesus, even as ye have received from us how ye ought to walk and please God, even as ye also do walk, that ye would abound still more. Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.
2 For ye know what charges we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
3 For this is [the] will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication; For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
4 that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour, That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
5 (not in passionate desire, even as the nations who know not God,) Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
6 not overstepping the rights of and wronging his brother in the matter, because the Lord [is] the avenger of all these things, even as we also told you before, and have fully testified. That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
7 For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
8 He therefore that [in this] disregards [his brother], disregards, not man, but God, who has given also his Holy Spirit to you. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
9 Now concerning brotherly love ye have no need that we should write to you, for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
10 For also ye do this towards all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, to abound still more, And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
11 and to seek earnestly to be quiet and mind your own affairs, and work with your [own] hands, even as we charged you, And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
12 that ye may walk reputably towards those without, and may have need of no one. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.
13 But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are fallen asleep, to the end that ye be not grieved even as also the rest who have no hope. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
14 For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
15 (For this we say to you in [the] word of [the] Lord, that *we*, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep; For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
16 for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
17 then *we*, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in [the] clouds, to meet the Lord in [the] air; and thus we shall be always with [the] Lord. Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
18 So encourage one another with these words.) Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
{5}
1 But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
2 for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of [the] Lord so comes as a thief by night. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
3 When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon her that is with child; and they shall in no wise escape. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
4 But *ye*, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief: But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
5 for all *ye* are sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
6 So then do not let us sleep as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober; Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.
7 for they that sleep sleep by night, and they that drink drink by night; For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
8 but *we* being of [the] day, let us be sober, putting on [the] breastplate of faith and love, and as helmet [the] hope of salvation; But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
9 because God has not set us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
10 who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him. Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
11 Wherefore encourage one another, and build up each one the other, even as also ye do. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
12 But we beg you, brethren, to know those who labour among you, and take the lead among you in [the] Lord, and admonish you, And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
13 and to regard them exceedingly in love on account of their work. Be in peace among yourselves. And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. [And] be at peace among yourselves.
14 But we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, sustain the weak, be patient towards all. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].
15 See that no one render to any evil for evil, but pursue always what is good towards one another and towards all; See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].
16 rejoice always; Rejoice evermore.
17 pray unceasingly; Pray without ceasing.
18 in everything give thanks, for this is [the] will of God in Christ Jesus towards you; In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
19 quench not the Spirit; Quench not the Spirit.
20 do not lightly esteem prophecies; Despise not prophesyings.
21 but prove all things, hold fast the right; Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
22 hold aloof from every form of wickedness. Abstain from all appearance of evil.
23 Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
24 He [is] faithful who calls you, who will also perform [it]. Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].
25 Brethren, pray for us. Brethren, pray for us.
26 Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss. Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
27 I adjure you by the Lord that the letter be read to all the [holy] brethren. I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen. <<[The first [epistle] to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.]>>
