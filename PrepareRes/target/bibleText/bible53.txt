{#2 Thessalonians}
{1}
1 Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, because your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all towards one another abounds; We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
4 so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the assemblies of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, which ye are sustaining; So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
5 a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for the sake of which ye also suffer; [Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
6 if at least [it is a] righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you, Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
7 and to you that are troubled repose with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with [the] angels of his power, And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
9 who shall pay the penalty [of] everlasting destruction from [the] presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might, Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
10 when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed, (for our testimony to you has been believed,) in that day. When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
11 To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and fulfil all [the] good pleasure of [his] goodness and [the] work of faith with power, Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power:
12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus [Christ] may be glorified in you and *ye* in him, according to the grace of our God, and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ. That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{2}
1 Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and [by] our gathering together unto him,
2 that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as [if it were] by us, as that the day of the Lord is present. That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
3 Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because [it will not be] unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition; Let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come], except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
4 who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
5 Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, I said these things to you? Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
6 And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time. And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
7 For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only [there is] he who restrains now until he be gone, For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth [will let], until he be taken out of the way.
8 and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming; And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
9 whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, [Even him], whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
10 and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved. And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
11 And for this reason God sends to them a working of error, that they should believe what is false, And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
12 that all might be judged who have not believed the truth, but have found pleasure in unrighteousness. That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
13 But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of [the] Lord, that God has chosen you from [the] beginning to salvation in sanctification of [the] Spirit and belief of [the] truth: But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
14 whereto he has called you by our glad tidings, to [the] obtaining of [the] glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15 So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the instructions which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our letter. Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
16 But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us, and given [us] eternal consolation and good hope by grace, Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given [us] everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
17 encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word. Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
{3}
1 For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also with you; Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have [free] course, and be glorified, even as [it is] with you:
2 and that we may be delivered from bad and evil men, for faith [is] not [the portion] of all. And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith.
3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and keep [you] from evil. But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil.
4 But we trust in the Lord as to you, that the things which we enjoin, ye both do and will do. And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.
5 But the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of the Christ. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.
6 Now we enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the instruction which he received from us. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
7 For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us, because we have not walked disorderly among you; For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
8 nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost; but in toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to any one of you: Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
9 not that we have not the right, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you, in order to your imitating us. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
10 For also when we were with you we enjoined you this, that if any man does not like to work, neither let him eat. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
11 For we hear that [there are] some walking among you disorderly, not working at all, but busybodies. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
12 Now such we enjoin and exhort in [the] Lord Jesus Christ, that working quietly they eat their own bread. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
13 But *ye*, brethren, do not faint in well-doing. But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
14 But if any one obey not our word by the letter, mark that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed of himself; And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
15 and do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother. Yet count [him] not as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.
16 But the Lord of peace himself give you peace continually in every way. The Lord [be] with you all. Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord [be] with you all.
17 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is [the] mark in every letter; so I write. The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen. <<[The second [epistle] to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.]>>
