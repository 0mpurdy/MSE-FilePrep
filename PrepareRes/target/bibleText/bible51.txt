1 Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus, by God's will, and Timotheus the brother, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus [our] brother,
2 to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which [are] in Colosse. Grace to you and peace from God our Father [and Lord Jesus Christ]. To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually [when] praying for you, We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
4 having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints,
5 on account of the hope which [is] laid up for you in the heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings, For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
6 which are come to you, as [they are] in all the world, [and] are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard [them] and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth: Which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as [it doth] also in you, since the day ye heard [of it], and knew the grace of God in truth:
7 even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you, As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
8 who has also manifested to us your love in [the] Spirit. Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
9 For this reason *we* also, from the day we heard [of your faith and love], do not cease praying and asking for you, to the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
10 [so as] to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by the true knowledge of God; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
11 strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy; Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
12 giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light, Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
13 who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated [us] into the kingdom of the Son of his love: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son:
14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins; In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the forgiveness of sins:
15 who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation; Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
16 because by him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him and for him. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
17 And *he* is before all, and all things subsist together by him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
18 And *he* is the head of the body, the assembly; who is [the] beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that *he* might have the first place in all things: And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all [things] he might have the preeminence.
19 for in him all the fulness [of the Godhead] was pleased to dwell, For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell;
20 and by him to reconcile all things to itself, having made peace by the blood of his cross -- by him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens. And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, [I say], whether [they be] things in earth, or things in heaven.
21 And you, who once were alienated and enemies in mind by wicked works, yet now has it reconciled And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
22 in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy and unblamable and irreproachable before it, In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
23 if indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm, and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which [is] under heaven, of which *I* Paul became minister. If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
24 Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:
25 of which *I* became minister, according to the dispensation of God which [is] given me towards you to complete the word of God, Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
26 the mystery which [has been] hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints; [Even] the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
27 to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory: To whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
28 whom *we* announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ. Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
29 Whereunto also I toil, combating according to his working, which works in me in power. Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
{2}
1 For I would have you know what combat I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh; For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and [for] them at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
2 to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to [the] full knowledge of the mystery of God; That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
3 in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge. In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
4 And I say this to the end that no one may delude you by persuasive speech. And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
5 For if indeed in the flesh I am absent, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
6 As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in him, As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:
7 rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving. Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
8 See that there be no one who shall lead *you* away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
9 For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
10 and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority, And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
11 in whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ; In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
12 buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with [him] through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead. Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
13 And you, being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having forgiven us all the offences; And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
14 having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which [stood out] against us, which was contrary to us, he has taken it also out of the way, having nailed it to the cross; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
15 having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a show of them publicly, leading them in triumph by it. [And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
16 Let none therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in matter of feast, or new moon, or sabbaths, Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:
17 which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ. Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.
18 Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize, doing his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh, Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
19 and not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God. And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
20 If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as [if] alive in [the] world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances? Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
21 Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
22 (things which are all for destruction in the using [of them]:) according to the injunctions and teachings of men, Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
23 (which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary worship, and humility, and harsh treatment of the body, not in a certain honour,) to [the] satisfaction of the flesh. Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
{3}
1 If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things [which are] above, where the Christ is, sitting at [the] right hand of God: If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
2 have your mind on the things [that are] above, not on the things [that are] on the earth; Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
3 for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
4 When the Christ is manifested who [is] our life, then shall *ye* also be manifested with him in glory. When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
5 Put to death therefore your members which [are] upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, vile passions, evil lust, and unbridled desire, which is idolatry. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
6 On account of which things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
7 In which *ye* also once walked when ye lived in these things. In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
8 But now, put off, *ye* also, all [these] things, wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, vile language out of your mouth. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
9 Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds, Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
10 and having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to [the] image of him that has created him; And have put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
11 wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ [is] everything, and in all. Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ [is] all, and in all.
12 Put on therefore, as [the] elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
13 forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any should have a complaint against any; even as the Christ has forgiven you, so also [do] *ye*. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.
14 And to all these [add] love, which is the bond of perfectness. And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
15 And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
16 Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
17 And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, [do] all things in [the] name of [the] Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

20 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in [the] Lord. Children, obey [your] parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
21 Fathers, do not vex your children, to the end that they be not disheartened. Fathers, provoke not your children [to anger], lest they be discouraged.
22 Bondmen, obey in all things your masters according to flesh; not with eye-services, as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord. Servants, obey in all things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
23 Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as [doing it] to the Lord, and not to men; And whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
24 knowing that of [the] Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ. Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
25 For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has done, and there is no respect of persons. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

1 Masters, give to bondmen what is just and fair, knowing that *ye* also have a Master in [the] heavens. Masters, give unto [your] servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
2 Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving; Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
3 praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ, on account of which also I am bound, Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:
