7 and he within answering should say, Do not disturb me; the door is already shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up to give [it] thee? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
8 -- I say to you, Although he will not get up and give [them] to him because he is his friend, because of his shamelessness, at any rate, he will rise and give him as many as he wants. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
9 And <i>I</i> say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you. And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
10 For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it will be opened. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
11 But of whom of you that is a father shall a son ask bread, and [the father] shall give him a stone? or also a fish, and instead of a fish shall give him a serpent? If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if [he ask] a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
12 or if also he shall ask an egg, shall give him a scorpion? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
13 If therefore <i>ye</i>, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give [the] Holy Spirit to them that ask him? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
14 And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came to pass, the demon being gone out, the dumb [man] spoke. And the crowds wondered. And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
15 But some from among them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts he out demons. But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
16 And others tempting [him] sought from him a sign out of heaven. And others, tempting [him], sought of him a sign from heaven.
17 But <i>he</i>, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation: and a house set against a house falls; But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falleth.
18 and if also Satan is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom subsist? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
19 But if <i>I</i> by Beelzebub cast out demons, your sons -- by whom do they cast [them] out? For this reason <i>they</i> shall be your judges. And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast [them] out? therefore shall they be your judges.
20 But if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you. But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
21 When the strong [man] armed keeps his own house, his goods are in peace; When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
22 but when the stronger than he coming upon [him] overcomes him, he takes away his panoply in which he trusted, and he will divide the spoil [he has taken] from him. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
23 He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters. He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
24 When the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest; and not finding [any] he says, I will return to my house whence I came out. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
25 And having come, he finds it swept and adorned. And when he cometh, he findeth [it] swept and garnished.
26 Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Then goeth he, and taketh [to him] seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first.
27 And it came to pass as he spake these things, a certain woman, lifting up her voice out of the crowd, said to him, Blessed is the womb that has borne thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed [is] the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.
28 But <i>he</i> said, Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep [it]. But he said, Yea rather, blessed [are] they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
29 But as the crowds thronged together, he began to say, This generation is a wicked generation: it seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it but the sign of Jonas. And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
30 For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, thus shall also the Son of man be to this generation. For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
31 A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than Solomon is here. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.
32 Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas is here. The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas [is] here.
33 But no one having lit a lamp sets it in secret, nor under the corn-measure, but on the lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light. No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth [it] in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.
34 The lamp of the body is thine eye: when thine eye is simple, thy whole body also is light; but when it is wicked, thy body also is dark. The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when [thine eye] is evil, thy body also [is] full of darkness.
35 See therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
36 If therefore thy whole body [is] light, not having any part dark, it shall be all light as when the lamp lights thee with its brightness. If thy whole body therefore [be] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.
37 But as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him; and entering in he placed himself at table. And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
38 But the Pharisee seeing [it] wondered that he had not first washed before dinner. And when the Pharisee saw [it], he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.
39 But the Lord said to him, Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inward [parts] are full of plunder and wickedness. And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
40 Fools, has not he who has made the outside made the inside also? [Ye] fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
41 But rather give alms of what ye have, and behold, all things are clean to you. But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
42 But woe unto you, Pharisees, for ye pay tithes of mint and rue and every herb, and pass by the judgment and the love of God: these ye ought to have done, and not have left those aside. But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
43 Woe unto you, Pharisees, for ye love the first seat in the synagogues and salutations in the market-places. Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
44 Woe unto you, for ye are as the sepulchres which appear not, and the men walking over them do not know [it]. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over [them] are not aware [of them].
45 And one of the doctors of the law answering says to him, Teacher, in saying these things thou insultest us also. Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.
46 And he said, To you also woe, doctors of the law, for ye lay upon men burdens heavy to bear, and yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. And he said, Woe unto you also, [ye] lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
47 Woe unto you, for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, but your fathers killed them. Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
48 Ye bear witness then, and consent to the works of your fathers; for <i>they</i> killed them, and <i>ye</i> build [their sepulchres]. Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
49 For this reason also the wisdom of God has said, I will send to them prophets and apostles, and of these shall they kill and drive out by persecution, Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they shall slay and persecute:
50 that the blood of all the prophets which has been poured out from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation, That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the house; yea, I say to you, it shall be required of this generation. From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
52 Woe unto you, the doctors of the law, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; yourselves have not entered in, and those who were entering in ye have hindered. Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
53 And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him urgently, and to make him speak of many things; And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:
54 watching him, [and seeking] to catch something out of his mouth, [that they might accuse him]. Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
{12}
1 In those [times], the myriads of the crowd being gathered together, so that they trod one on another, he began to say to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy; In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
2 but there is nothing covered up which shall not be revealed, nor secret that shall not be known; For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
3 therefore whatever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light, and what ye have spoken in the ear in chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
4 But I say to you, my friends, Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
5 But I will shew you whom ye shall fear: Fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear <i>him</i>. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
6 Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? and one of them is not forgotten before God. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore, ye are better than many sparrows. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
8 But I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, the Son of man will confess him also before the angels of God; Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
9 but he that shall have denied me before men shall be denied before the angels of God; But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
10 and whoever shall say a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him; but to him that speaks injuriously against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.
11 But when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and the authorities, be not careful how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say; And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and [unto] magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
12 for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said. For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
13 And a person said to him out of the crowd, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me. And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
14 But he said to him, Man, who established me [as] a judge or a divider over you? And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
15 And he said to them, Take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness, for [it is] not because a man is in abundance [that] his life is in his possessions. And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
16 And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly. And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
17 And he reasoned within himself saying, What shall I do? for I have not [a place] where I shall lay up my fruits. And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
18 And he said, This will I do: I will take away my granaries and build greater, and there I will lay up all my produce and my good things; And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
19 and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much good things laid by for many years; repose thyself, eat, drink, be merry. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry.
20 But God said to him, Fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; and whose shall be what thou hast prepared? But God said unto him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
21 Thus is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. So [is] he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
22 And he said to his disciples, For this cause I say unto you, Be not careful for life, what ye shall eat, nor for the body, what ye shall put on. And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
23 The life is more than food, and the body than raiment. The life is more than meat, and the body [is more] than raiment.
24 Consider the ravens, that they sow not nor reap; which have neither storehouse nor granary; and God feeds them. How much better are <i>ye</i> than the birds? Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?
25 But which of you by being careful can add to his stature one cubit? And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
26 If therefore ye cannot [do] even what is least, why are ye careful about the rest? If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?
27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I say unto you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these. Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
28 But if God thus clothe the grass, which to-day is in the field and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, how much rather you, O ye of little faith? If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more [will he clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
29 And <i>ye</i>, seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, and be not in anxiety; And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
30 for all these things do the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that ye have need of these things; For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
31 but seek his kingdom, and [all] these things shall be added to you. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
32 Fear not, little flock, for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
33 Sell what ye possess and give alms; make to yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure which does not fail in the heavens, where thief does not draw near nor moth destroy. Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
34 For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
35 Let your loins be girded about, and lamps burning; Let your loins be girded about, and [your] lights burning;
36 and <i>ye</i> like men who wait their own lord whenever he may leave the wedding, that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately. And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
37 Blessed are those bondmen whom the lord [on] coming shall find watching; verily I say unto you, that he will gird himself and make them recline at table, and coming up will serve them. Blessed [are] those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.
38 And if he come in the second watch, and come in the third watch, and find [them] thus, blessed are those [bondmen]. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find [them] so, blessed are those servants.
39 But this know, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be dug through. And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
40 And ye therefore, be <i>ye</i> ready, for in the hour in which ye do not think [it], the Son of man comes. Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
41 And Peter said to him, Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all? Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
42 And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give the measure of corn in season? And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give [them their] portion of meat in due season?
43 Blessed is that bondman whom his lord [on] coming shall find doing thus; Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
44 verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he has. Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
45 But if that bondman should say in his heart, My lord delays to come, and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and to drink and to be drunken, But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
46 the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it, and in an hour he knows not of, and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers. The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for [him], and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
47 But that bondman who knew his own lord's will, and had not prepared [himself] nor done his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes]; And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not [himself], neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes].
48 but he who knew [it] not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. And to every one to whom much has been given, much shall be required from him; and to whom [men] have committed much, they will ask from him the more. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes]. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
49 I have come to cast a fire on the earth; and what will I if already it has been kindled? I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
50 But I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how am I straitened until it shall have been accomplished! But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
51 Think ye that I have come to give peace in the earth? Nay, I say to you, but rather division: Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
52 for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided; three shall be divided against two, and two against three: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
53 father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
54 And he said also to the crowds, When ye see a cloud rising out of the west, straightway ye say, A shower is coming; and so it happens. And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.
55 And when [ye see] the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it happens. And when [ye see] the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.
56 Hypocrites, ye know how to judge of the appearance of the earth and of the heaven; how [is it then that] ye do not discern this time? [Ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?
57 And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
58 For as thou goest with thine adverse party before a magistrate, strive in the way to be reconciled with him, lest he drag thee away to the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, [as thou art] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
59 I say unto thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out thence until thou hast paid the very last mite. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.

1 Now at the same time there were present some who told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with [that of] their sacrifices. There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
2 And he answering said to them, Think ye that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they suffered such things? And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?
3 No, I say to you, but if ye repent not, ye shall all perish in the same manner. I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
4 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, think ye that <i>they</i> were debtors beyond all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
5 No, I say to you, but if ye repent not, ye shall all perish in like manner. I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
6 And he spoke this parable: A certain [man] had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit upon it and did not find [any]. He spake also this parable; A certain [man] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
7 And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, [these] three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none: cut it down; why does it also render the ground useless? Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
8 But he answering says to him, Sir, let it alone for this year also, until I shall dig about it and put dung, And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung [it]:
9 and if it shall bear fruit -- but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down. And if it bear fruit, [well]: and if not, [then] after that thou shalt cut it down.

12 And Jesus, seeing her, called to [her], and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And when Jesus saw her, he called [her to him], and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
13 And he laid his hands upon her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. And he laid [his] hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
14 But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath, answering said to the crowd, There are six days in which [people] ought to work; in these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
15 The Lord therefore answered him and said, Hypocrites! does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and leading [it] away, water [it]? The Lord then answered him, and said, [Thou] hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or [his] ass from the stall, and lead [him] away to watering?
16 And this [woman], who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, [these] eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?
17 And as he said these things, all who were opposed to him were ashamed; and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things which were being done by him. And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
18 And he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it? Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?
19 It is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
20 And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

25 From the time that the master of the house shall have risen up and shall have shut the door, and ye shall begin to stand without and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he answering shall say to you, I know you not whence ye are: When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:
26 then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten in thy presence and drunk, and thou hast taught in our streets; Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
27 and he shall say, I tell you, I do not know you whence ye are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.
28 There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves cast out. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] thrust out.
29 And they shall come from east and west, and from north and south, and shall lie down at table in the kingdom of God. And they shall come from the east, and [from] the west, and from the north, and [from] the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

33 but I must needs walk to-day and to-morrow and the [day] following, for it must not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the [city] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen her brood under her wings, and ye would not. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen [doth gather] her brood under [her] wings, and ye would not!
35 Behold, your house is left unto you; and I say unto you, that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say, Blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord.

8 When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not lay thyself down in the first place at table, lest perhaps a more honourable than thou be invited by him, When thou art bidden of any [man] to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;
9 and he who invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give place to this [man], and then thou begin with shame to take the last place. And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
10 But when thou hast been invited, go and put thyself down in the last place, that when he who has invited thee comes, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour before all that are lying at table with thee; But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.
11 for every one that exalts himself shall be abased, and he that abases himself shall be exalted. For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
12 And he said also to him that had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsfolk, nor rich neighbours, lest it may be they also should invite thee in return, and a recompense be made thee. Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor [thy] rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.
13 But when thou makest a feast, call poor, crippled, lame, blind: But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
14 and thou shalt be blessed; for they have not [the means] to recompense thee; for it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the just. And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
15 And one of those that were lying at table with [them], hearing these things, said to him, Blessed [is] he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed [is] he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
16 And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many. Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:

18 And all began, without exception, to excuse themselves. The first said to him, I have bought land, and I must go out and see it; I pray thee hold me for excused. And they all with one [consent] began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee hold me for excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
20 And another said, I have married a wife, and on this account I cannot come. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
21 And the bondman came up and brought back word of these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, in anger, said to his bondman, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring here the poor and crippled and lame and blind. So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
22 And the bondman said, Sir, it is done as thou hast commanded, and there is still room. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
23 And the lord said to the bondman, Go out into the ways and fences and compel to come in, that my house may be filled; And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, that my house may be filled.
24 for I say to you, that not one of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper. For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
25 And great crowds went with him; and, turning round, he said to them, And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
26 If any man come to me, and shall not hate his own father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yea, and his own life too, he cannot be my disciple; If any [man] come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
27 and whoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
28 For which of you, desirous of building a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, if he have what [is needed] to complete it; For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have [sufficient] to finish [it]?
29 in order that, having laid the foundation of it, and not being able to finish it, all who see it do not begin to mock at him, Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish [it], all that behold [it] begin to mock him,
30 saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish? Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
31 Or what king, going on his way to engage in war with another king, does not, sitting down first, take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him coming against him with twenty thousand? Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
32 and if not, while he is yet far off, having sent an embassy, he asks for terms of peace. Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.
33 Thus then every one of you who forsakes not all that is his own cannot be my disciple. So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
34 Salt [then] [is] good, but if the salt also has become savourless, wherewith shall it be seasoned? Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
35 It is proper neither for land nor for dung; it is cast out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; [but] men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

1 And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming near to him to hear him; Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
2 and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This [man] receives sinners and eats with them. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
3 And he spoke to them this parable, saying, And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
4 What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost, until he find it? What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
5 and having found it, he lays it upon his own shoulders, rejoicing; And when he hath found [it], he layeth [it] on his shoulders, rejoicing.
6 and being come to the house, calls together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep. And when he cometh home, he calleth together [his] friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
7 I say unto you, that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner, [more] than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
8 Or, what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it? Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find [it]?
9 and having found it she calls together the friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost. And when she hath found [it], she calleth [her] friends and [her] neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
10 Thus, I say unto you, there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
11 And he said, A certain man had two sons; And he said, A certain man had two sons:
12 and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give to me the share of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided to them what he was possessed of. And the younger of them said to [his] father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth [to me]. And he divided unto them [his] living.
13 And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off, and there dissipated his property, living in debauchery. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
14 But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
15 And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
16 And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating; and no one gave to him. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
17 And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have abundance of bread, and <i>I</i> perish here by famine. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
18 I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
19 I am no longer worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
20 And he rose up and went to his own father. But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
21 And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
22 But the father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [it], and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet; But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet:
23 and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill [it]; and let us eat, and be merry:
24 for this my son was dead and has come to life, was lost and has been found. And they began to make merry. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
25 And his elder son was in the field; and as, coming [up], he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.
26 And having called one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
27 And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and well. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
28 But he became angry and would not go in. And his father went out and besought him. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.
29 But he answering said to his father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends: And he answering said to [his] father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
30 but when this thy son, who has devoured thy substance with harlots, is come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
31 But he said to him, Child, <i>thou</i> art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
32 But it was right to make merry and rejoice, because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost and has been found. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
{16}
1 And he said also to [his] disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and <i>he</i> was accused to him as wasting his goods. And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
2 And having called him, he said to him, What [is] this that I hear of thee? give the reckoning of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
3 And the steward said within himself, What shall I do; for my lord is taking the stewardship from me? I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
4 I know what I will do, that when I shall have been removed from the stewardship I may be received into their houses. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
5 And having called to [him] each one of the debtors of his own lord, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord? So he called every one of his lord's debtors [unto him], and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
6 And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take thy writing and sit down quickly and write fifty. And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
7 Then he said to another, And thou, how much dost thou owe? And he said, A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him, Take thy writing and write eighty. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
8 And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had done prudently. For the sons of this world are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
9 And <i>I</i> say to you, Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
10 He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who shall entrust to you the true? If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?
12 and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who shall give to you your own? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or he will cleave to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and mocked him. And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
15 And he said to them, <i>Ye</i> are they who justify themselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for what amongst men is highly thought of is an abomination before God. And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
16 The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God are announced, and every one forces his way into it. The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
17 But it is easier that the heaven and the earth should pass away than that one tittle of the law should fail. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
18 Every one who puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery; and every one that marries one put away from a husband commits adultery. Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from [her] husband committeth adultery.
19 Now there was a rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, making good cheer in splendour every day. There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
20 And [there was] a poor man, by name Lazarus, [who] was laid at his gateway full of sores, And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
21 and desiring to be filled with the crumbs which fell from the table of the rich man; but the dogs also coming licked his sores. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
22 And it came to pass that the poor man died, and that he was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham. And the rich man also died and was buried. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
23 And in hades lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
24 And he crying out said, Father Abraham, have compassion on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering in this flame. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
25 But Abraham said, Child, recollect that <i>thou</i> hast fully received thy good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted here, and <i>thou</i> art in suffering. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those who desire to pass hence to you cannot, nor do they who [desire to cross] from there pass over unto us. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
27 And he said, I beseech thee then, father, that thou wouldest send him to the house of my father, Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
28 for I have five brothers, so that he may earnestly testify to them, that they also may not come to this place of torment. For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
29 But Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets: let them hear them. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
30 But he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one from the dead should go to them, they will repent. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
31 And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, not even if one rise from among [the] dead will they be persuaded. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
{17}
1 And he said to his disciples, It cannot be but that offences come, but woe [to him] by whom they come! Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe [unto him], through whom they come!
2 It would be [more] profitable for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should be a snare to one of these little ones. It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.
3 Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother should sin, rebuke him; and if he should repent, forgive him. Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
4 And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times should return to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
5 And the apostles said to the Lord, Give more faith to us. And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
6 But the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye had said to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you. And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
7 But which of you [is there] who, having a bondman ploughing or shepherding, when he comes in out of the field, will say, Come and lie down immediately to table? But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
8 But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup on, and gird thyself and serve me that I may eat and drink; and after that <i>thou</i> shalt eat and drink? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
9 Is he thankful to the bondman because he has done what was ordered? I judge not. Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
10 Thus <i>ye</i> also, when ye shall have done all things that have been ordered you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen; we have done what it was our duty to do.
