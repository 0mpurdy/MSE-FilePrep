{#2 John}
{1}
1 The elder to [the] elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the truth, The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
2 for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity. For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
3 Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God [the] Father, and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
4 I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father. I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from [the] beginning, that we should love one another. And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
6 And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is the deceiver and the antichrist. For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
8 See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
9 Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has both the Father and the Son. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
10 If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into [the] house, and greet him not; If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed:
11 for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works. For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
12 Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full. Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write] with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
13 The children of thine elect sister greet thee. The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
