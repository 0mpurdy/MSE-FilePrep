		It is an unspeakable privilege to be permitted, in any small degree, to minister to the souls of those who are so precious to Christ.<a name=1:2></a> "Lovest thou me?<a name=1:3></a> Feed my sheep.<a name=1:4></a>" Such were the touching words of the departing Shepherd; and, assuredly, when they fall powerfully upon the heart, they must rouse all the energies of one's moral being to carry out, in every possible way the gracious desire breathed therein.<a name=1:5></a> To gather and to feed the lambs and sheep of the flock of Christ, are the most exalted services in which any one can be engaged.<a name=1:6></a> Not a single honest effort put forth for the achievement of such noble ends, will be forgotten in that day "when the Chief Shepherd shall appear.<a name=1:7></a>"

		There is something peculiarly striking in the manner in which the Holy Ghost opens this sublime book.<a name=1:10></a> He introduces us, at once, to God, in the essential fullness of His Being, and the solitariness of His acting.<a name=1:11></a> All prefatory matter is omitted.<a name=1:12></a> It is to God we are brought.<a name=1:13></a> We hear Him, as it were, breaking earth's silence, and shining in upon earth's darkness, for the purpose of developing a sphere in which He might display His eternal power And Godhead.<a name=1:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing here on which idle curiosity may feed -- nothing on which the poor, human mind may speculate.<a name=1:15></a> There is the sublimity and reality of DIVINE TRUTH, in its moral power to act on the heart, and on the understanding.<a name=1:16></a> It could never come within the range of the Spirit of God to gratify idle curiosity, by the presentation of curious theories.<a name=1:17></a> Geologists may explore the bowels of the earth, and draw forth from thence materials from which to add to, and, in some

		"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.<a name=2:6></a>" The first sentence in the divine canon sets us in the presence of Him who is the infinite source of all true blessedness.<a name=2:7></a> There is no elaborate argument in proof of the existence of God.<a name=2:8></a> The Holy Ghost could not enter upon anything of the kind.<a name=2:9></a> God reveals Himself.<a name=2:10></a> He makes Himself known by His works.<a name=2:11></a> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork.<a name=2:12></a>" "All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord.<a name=2:13></a>" "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.<a name=2:14></a>" None but an infidel or an atheist would seek an argument in proof of the Being of One who, by the word of His mouth, called worlds into existence, and declared Himself the All wise, the Almighty, and the everlasting God.<a name=2:15></a> Who but "God" could "create" anything.<a name=2:16></a> "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.<a name=2:17></a>" (Isaiah 40: 26) "The gods of the heathen are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.<a name=2:18></a>" In the Book of Job 38-41 we have an appeal of the very grandest

		description, on the part of Jehovah Himself, to the work of creation, as an unanswerable argument in proof of His infinite superiority; and this appeal, while it sets before the understanding the most vivid and convincing demonstration of God's omnipotence, touches the heart, also, by its amazing condescension.<a name=3:1></a> The majesty and the love, the power and the tenderness, are all divine.<a name=3:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.<a name=3:3></a>" Here was, in good truth, a scene in which God alone could act.<a name=3:4></a> Man, in the pride of his heart, has since proved himself but too ready to interfere with God in other and far higher spheres of action; but, in the scene before us, man had no place until, indeed, he became, like all the rest, the subject of creative power.<a name=3:5></a> God was alone in creation.<a name=3:6></a> He looked forth from His eternal dwelling-place of light upon the wild waste, and there beheld the sphere in which His wondrous plans and counsels were yet to be unfolded and brought out -- where the Eternal Son was yet to live, and labour, and testify, and bleed, and die, in order to display, in the view of wondering worlds, the glorious perfections of the Godhead.<a name=3:7></a> All was darkness and chaos; but God is the God of light and order.<a name=3:8></a> "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.<a name=3:9></a>" Darkness and confusion cannot live in His presence, whether we look at it in a physical, moral, intellectual, or spiritual point of view.<a name=3:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.<a name=3:11></a>" He sat brooding over the Scene of His future operations.<a name=3:12></a> A dark scene, truly; and one in which

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there was ample room for the God of light and life to act.<a name=4:1></a> He alone could enlighten the darkness, cause life to spring up, substitute order for chaos, open an expanse between the waters, where life might display itself without fear of death.<a name=4:2></a> These were operations worthy of God.<a name=4:3></a>

		"God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<a name=4:4></a>" How simple!<a name=4:5></a> And yet how Godlike!<a name=4:6></a> "He spake, and it was done.<a name=4:7></a> He commanded, and it stood fast.<a name=4:8></a>" Infidelity may ask, "How?<a name=4:9></a> where?<a name=4:10></a> when?<a name=4:11></a>" The answer is, "By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.<a name=4:12></a>" (Hebrews 11: 3) This satisfies the teachable spirit.<a name=4:13></a> Philosophy may smile contemptuously at this, and pronounce it rude ignorance, or blind credulity, suitable enough for an age of semi-barbarism, but quite unworthy of men living in an enlightened age of the world's history, when the museum and the telescope have put us in possession of facts of which the inspired penman knew nothing.<a name=4:14></a> What wisdom?<a name=4:15></a> What learning?<a name=4:16></a> Yea, rather, what folly What nonsense What total inability to grasp the scope and design of sacred scripture?<a name=4:17></a> It, assuredly, is not God's object to make us astronomers or geologists; or to occupy us with details which the microscope or the telescope lays before every school-boy.<a name=4:18></a> His object is to lead us into His presence, as worshippers, with hearts and understandings taught and duly governed by His holy Word.<a name=4:19></a> But this would never do for the so-called philosopher, who, despising what he terms the vulgar and narrow-minded prejudices of the devout disciple of the Word,

		boldly seizes his telescope, and therewith scans the distant heavens, or travels into the deep recesses of earth in search of strata, formations, and fossils -- all of which, according to his account, greatly improve, if they do not flatly contradict, the inspired narrative.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With such "oppositions of science, falsely so called," we have nothing to do.<a name=5:2></a> We believe that all true discoveries, whether "in the heavens above, in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth," will harmonise with that which is written in the word of God; and if they do not thus harmonise, they are perfectly contemptible in the judgement of every true lover of scripture.<a name=5:3></a> This gives great rest to the heart in a day like the present, so productive of learned speculations and high-sounding theories, which, alas in too many instances, savour of rationalism and positive infidelity.<a name=5:4></a> It is most needful to have the heart thoroughly established as to the fullness, the authority, the completeness, the majesty, the plenary inspiration of the sacred volume.<a name=5:5></a> This will be found to be the only effectual safeguard against the rationalism of Germany and the superstition of Rome.<a name=5:6></a> Accurate acquaintance with, and profound subjection to, the Word, are the great <i>desiderata</i> of the present moment.<a name=5:7></a> May the Lord, in His great grace, abundantly increase, in our midst, both the one and the other.<a name=5:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.<a name=5:9></a> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.<a name=5:10></a>" Here we have the two great symbols so largely employed throughout the Word.<a name=5:11></a> The presence of light makes the day; the absence thereof makes the night.<a name=5:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is in the history of souls.<a name=6:1></a> There are "the sons of light" and "the sons of darkness.<a name=6:2></a>" This is a most marked and solemn distinction.<a name=6:3></a> All upon whom the light of Life has shone -- all who have been effectually visited by "the dayspring from on high" -- all who have received the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ -- all such, whoever and wherever they may be, belong to the first class, are "the sons of light, and the sons of the day.<a name=6:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, all who are still in nature's darkness, natures blindness, nature's unbelief -- all who have not yet received into their hearts, by faith, the cheering beams of the Sun of righteousness, all such are still wrapped in the shades of spiritual night, are "the sons of darkness," "the sons of the night.<a name=6:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, pause and ask yourself, in the presence of the Searcher of hearts, to which of these two classes do you, at this moment, belong.<a name=6:6></a> That you belong to either the one or the other is beyond all question.<a name=6:7></a> You may be poor, despised, unlettered; but if, through grace, there is a link connecting you with the Son of God, "the light of the world," then you are, in very deed, a son of the day, and destined, ere long, to shine in that celestial sphere, that region of glory, of which "the slain Lamb" will be the central sun, for ever.<a name=6:8></a> This is not your own doing.<a name=6:9></a> It is the result of the counsel and operation of God Himself, who has given yon light and life, joy and peace, in Jesus, and His accomplished sacrifice.<a name=6:10></a> But if you are a total stranger to the hallowed action and influence of divine light, if your eyes have not been opened to behold any beauty in the Son of God, then, though you had all the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point on which I would dwell is the creation of lights.<a name=7:3></a> "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.<a name=7:4></a> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<a name=7:5></a> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.<a name=7:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sun is the great centre of light, and the centre of our system.<a name=7:7></a> Round him the lesser orbs revolve.<a name=7:8></a> From him, too, they derive their light.<a name=7:9></a> Hence, he may, very legitimately, be viewed as an apt symbol of Him who is soon to arise, with healing in His wings, to gladden the hearts of those that fear the Lord.<a name=7:10></a> The aptness and beauty of the symbol would fully appear to one who, having spent the night in watching, beholds the rising sun gilding, with his bright beams, the eastern sky.<a name=7:11></a> The mists and shades of night are all dispersed, and the whole creation seems to hail the returning orb of light.<a name=7:12></a> Thus will it be, by and by, when the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moon, being in herself opaque, derives all her light from the sun.<a name=8:3></a> She always reflects the sun's light, save when earth and its influences intervene<a href="#8:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=8:4></a> No sooner has the sun sunk beneath our horizon than the moon presents herself to receive his beams and reflect them back upon a dark world, or should she be visible during the day, she always exhibits a pale light, the necessary result of appearing in the presence of superior brightness.<a name=8:5></a> True it is, as has been remarked, the world sometimes intervenes; dark clouds, thick mists, and chilling vapours, too, arise from earth's surface, and hide from our view her silvery light.<a name=8:6></a>

		Now, as the sun is a beautiful and an appropriate symbol of Christ, so the moon strikingly reminds us of the Church.<a name=8:7></a> The fountain of her light is hidden from view.<a name=8:8></a> The world seeth Him not, but she sees Him; and she is responsible to reflect His beams upon a benighted world.<a name=8:9></a> The world has no other way in which to learn anything of Christ but by the Church.<a name=8:10></a> "Ye," says the inspired apostle, "are our epistle, .<a name=8:11></a>.<a name=8:12></a>.<a name=8:13></a> .<a name=8:14></a>known and read of all men.<a name=8:15></a>" And again, "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ" (2 Corinthians 3: 2, 3).<a name=8:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The stars are distant lights.<a name=9:14></a> They shine in other spheres, and have little connection with this system, save that their twinkling can be seen.<a name=9:15></a> "One star differeth from another star in glory.<a name=9:16></a>" Thus will it be in the coming kingdom of the Son.<a name=9:17></a> He will shine forth in living and everlasting lustre.<a name=9:18></a> His body, the Church, will faithfully reflect His beams on all around; while saints individually shall shine in those spheres which a righteous Judge shall allot to them, as a reward of service during the dark night of His absence.<a name=9:19></a> This thought should animate us to a more ardent and

		The lower orders of creation are next introduced.<a name=10:3></a> The sea and the earth are made to team with life.<a name=10:4></a> Some May feel warranted in regarding the operations of each successive day, as foreshadowing the various dispensations, and their great characteristic principles of action.<a name=10:5></a> I would only remark, as to this, that there is great need, when handling the word in this way, to watch, with holy jealousy, the working of imagination; and also to pay strict attention to the general analogy of scripture, else we may make sad mistakes.<a name=10:6></a> I do not feel at liberty to enter upon such a line of interpretation; I shall therefore confine myself to what I believe to be the plain sense of the sacred text.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now consider man's place, as set over the works of God's hands.<a name=10:8></a> All having been set in order, one was needed to take the headship.<a name=10:9></a> "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<a name=10:10></a> So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he <i>them</i>.<a name=10:11></a> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.<a name=10:12></a>" My reader will observe the change from "him" to "them.<a name=10:13></a>" We are not presented with the actual fact of the formation of the woman, until the next chapter;

		Looking at Adam and Eve as a type of Christ and the Church, as scripture fully warrants us to do, we see how that the death of Christ needed to be an accomplished fact, ere the Church could be set up; though, in the purpose of God, she was looked at, and chosen in Christ, before the foundation of the world.<a name=13:5></a> There is, however, a vast difference between the secret purpose of God and the revelation and accomplishment thereof.<a name=13:6></a> Before the divine purpose could be actualised in reference to the constituent parts of the Church, it was necessary that the Son should be rejected and crucified -- that He should take His seat on high -- that He should send down the Holy Ghost to baptise believers into one body.<a name=13:7></a> It is not that souls were not quickened and saved, previous to the death of Christ.<a name=13:8></a> They assuredly were.<a name=13:9></a> Adam was saved, and thousands of others, from age to age, in virtue of the sacrifice of Christ, though that sacrifice was not yet accomplished.<a name=13:10></a> But the salvation of individual souls is one thing; and the formation of the

		<a class="footnote" name="#23:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>This subject will, if the Lord permit, come before us again in Exodus 20; but I would, here, observe, that very much of the offence and misunderstanding connected with the important subject of the Sabbath, may be justly traced to the inconsiderate and injudicious conduct of some who, in their zeal for what they termed Christian liberty, in reference to the Sabbath, rather lose sight of the claims of honest consciences and also of the place which the Lord's day occupies in the New Testament. Some have been known to enter upon their weekly avocations, simply to show their liberty, and thus they caused much needless offence. Such acting could never have been suggested by the Spirit of Christ. If I am ever so clear and free, in my own mind, I should respect the consciences of my brethren: and, moreover, I do not believe that those who so carry themselves, really understand the true and precious privileges connected with the Lord's day. We should only be too thankful to be rid of all secular occupation and distraction, to think of having recourse to them, for the purpose of showing our liberty. The good providence of our God has so arranged for His people throughout the British Empire, that they can, without pecuniary loss, enjoy the rest of the Lord's day, inasmuch as all are obliged to abstain from business. This must be regarded, by every well-regulated mind, as a mercy; for, if it were not thus ordered, we know how man's covetous heart would, if possible, rob the Christian of the sweet privilege of attending the assembly, on the Lord's day. And who can tell what would be the deadening effect of uninterrupted engagement with this worlds traffic? Those Christians who, from Monday morning to Saturday night, breathe the dense atmosphere of the mart, the market, and the manufactory, can form some idea of it. <p>It cannot be regarded as a Good sign to find men introducing measures for the public profanation of the Lord's day. It, assuredly, marks the progress of infidelity and French influence. <p>But there are some who teach that the expression *e kuriake emera*, which is rightly enough translated, "the Lord's day," refers to "the day of the Lord" and that the exiled apostle found himself carried forward, as it were, into the Spirit of the day of the Lord. I do not believe the original would bear such an interpretation; and, besides, we have in 1 Thessalonians 5: 2, and 2 Peter 3: 10, the exact words, "the day of the Lord," the original of which is quite different from the expression above referred to, being not *e kuriake emera*, but *e emera kurion*. This entirely settles the matter, so far as the mere criticism is concerned; and as to interpretation, it is plain that by far the greater portion of the Apocalypse is occupied, not with "the day of the Lord" but with events prior thereto.

When God is seen acting in relation with man, He takes the title Lord God," -- (Jehovah Elohim;) but until man appears on the scene, the word "Lord': is not used. I shall just point out three out of many passages in which the distinction is very strikingly presented. "And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God (Elohim) had commanded him; and the Lord (Jehovah) shut him in (Genesis 7: 16) Elohim was going to destroy the world which He had made; but Jehovah took care of the man with whom He stood in relation. Again, "that all the earth may know that there is a God (Elohim) in Israel. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord (Jehovah) saveth," &c. (1 Samuel 17: 46, 47) All the earth was to recognise the presence of Elohim; but Israel was called to recognise the actings of Jehovah, with whom they stood in relation. Lastly, "Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord (Jehovah) helped him; and God (Elohim) moved them to depart from him." (2 Chr. 18: 31) Jehovah took care of His poor erring servant; but Elohim, though unknown, acted upon the hearts of the uncircumcised Syrians.

		There is blessing in every act of obedience; but the moment the soul hesitates, the enemy has the advantage; he will, assuredly, use it, to thrust the soul further and further from God.<a name=33:8></a> Thus, in the chapter before us, the question, "Hath God said?<a name=33:9></a>" was followed up, "Ye shall not surely die.<a name=33:10></a>" That is to say, there was first the question raised, as to whether God had spoken, and then followed the open contradiction of what God had said.<a name=33:11></a> This solemn fact is abundantly sufficient to show how dangerous it is to admit near the heart a question as to divine revelation, in its fullness and integrity.<a name=33:12></a> A refined rationalism is very near akin to bold infidelity; and the infidelity that dares to judge God's Word is not far from the atheism that denies His existence.<a name=33:13></a> Eve would never have stood by to hear God contradicted, if she had not previously fallen into looseness and indifference as to His word.<a name=33:14></a> She, too, had her "phases of Faith," or, to speak more correctly, her phases of Infidelity: she suffered God to be contradicted by a creature, simply because?<a name=33:15></a> His word had lost

		This furnishes a most solemn warning to all who are in danger of being ensnared by an unhallowed rationalism.<a name=34:2></a> There is no true security, save in a profound faith in the plenary inspiration and supreme authority of "ALL SCRIPTURE.<a name=34:3></a>" The soul that is endowed with this has a triumphant answer to every objector, whether he issue from Rome or Germany.<a name=34:4></a> "There is nothing new under the sun.<a name=34:5></a>" The self-same evil which is now corrupting the very springs of religious thought and feeling, throughout the fairest portion of the continent of Europe, was that which laid Eve's heart in ruins, in the garden of Eden.<a name=34:6></a> The first step in her downward course was her hearkening to the question, "Hath God said.<a name=34:7></a>" And then, onward she went, from stage to stage, until, at length, she bowed before the serpent, and owned him as her god, and the fountain of truth.<a name=34:8></a> Yes, my reader, the serpent displaced God, and the serpent's lie God's truth.<a name=34:9></a> Thus it was with fallen man; and thus it is with fallen man's posterity.<a name=34:10></a> God's word has no place in the heart of the unregenerated man; but the lie of the serpent has.<a name=34:11></a> Let the formation of man's heart be examined, and it will be found that there is a place therein for Satan's lie, but none whatever for the truth of God.<a name=34:12></a> Hence the force of the word to Nicodemus, "Ye must be born again.<a name=34:13></a>"

		But, it is important to observe the mode in which the serpent sought to shake Eve's confidence in God's truth, and thus bring her under the power of infidel "<i>reason</i>.<a name=34:14></a>" It was by shaking her confidence in God's love.<a name=34:15></a> He sought to shake her confidence in what God had

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eve's security against the influence of all this reasoning, would have been simple repose in the infinite goodness of God.<a name=35:6></a> She should have said to the serpent, "I have the fullest confidence in God's goodness, therefore, I deem it impossible that He could withhold any real good from me.<a name=35:7></a> If that fruit were good for me, I should surely have it; but the fact of being forbidden by God proves that I would be no better, but much worse off by the eating of it.<a name=35:8></a> I am convinced of God's love and I am convinced of God's truth, and I believe, too, that you are an evil one come to draw my heart away from the fountain of goodness and truth.<a name=35:9></a> Get thee behind me, Satan.<a name=35:10></a>" This would have been a noble reply.<a name=35:11></a> But it was not given.<a name=35:12></a> Her confidence in truth and love gave way, and all was lost; and so we find that there is just as little place in the heart of fallen for God's love, as there is for God's truth.<a name=35:13></a> The heart of man is a stranger to both the one and the other, until renewed by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=35:14></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#45:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Man not only accuses God of being the author of his fall, but also blames Him for his non-recovery. How often do we hear persons say that they cannot believe unless God give them the power to believe; and, further, that unless they are the subjects of God's eternal decree, they cannot be saved. <p>Now it is perfectly true, that no man can believe the gospel, except by the power of the Holy Ghost; and it is also true, that who so believe the gospel are the happy subjects of God's eternal counsels. But does all this set aside man's responsibility to believe a plain testimony set before him in God's Word. It most certainly does no such thing. But it does reveal the sad evil of man's heart, which leads him to reject Gods testimony which is plainly revealed, and to give as a reason for so doing God's decree which is a profound secret, known only to Himself However it will not avail, for we read in 1 Thessalonians 1: 8, 9, that those "Who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, shall be punished with everlasting destruction." Men are responsible to believe the gospel, and they will be punished for not believing it. They are not responsible to know anything about God's counsels, inasmuch as they are not revealed, and, therefore, there can be no guilt attached to ignorance concerning them. The apostle could say to the Thessalonians, "knowing brethren beloved, our election of God." How did he know it? Was it by having access to the page of God's secret and eternal decrees? By no means. How then? "Because (*hoti*) our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power." (1 Thessalonians 1: 4, 5) This is the way to know the election of any. When the gospel comes in power, it is a plain proof of God's election. <p>But, I doubt not, the people who draw a plea from the divine counsels for rejecting the divine testimony, only want some flimsy excuse to continue in sin. They really do not want God; and it would be far more honest in them to say so, plainly, than to put forward a plea which is not merely flimsy, but positively blasphemous. Such a plea will not avail them much amid the terrors of the day of judgement now fast approaching.

		All this, and much more, lay involved in Cain's "unbloody sacrifice.<a name=57:15></a>" He displayed entire ignorance, in reference to divine requirements, in reference to his own character and condition, as a lost and guilty sinner, and in reference to the true state of that ground, the fruit of which he presumed to offer.<a name=57:16></a> No doubt, reason might say, "what more acceptable offering could a man

It has reference to Enoch and Noah. The former was taken away, as we have seen. before the judgement came; whereas the latter was carried through the judgement. Now, it is thought that Enoch is a figure of the Church, who shall be taken away before human evil reaches its climax, and before the divine judgement falls thereon. Noah, on the other hand, is a figure of the remnant of Israel, who shall be brought through the deep waters of affliction. and through the fire of judgement, and led into the full enjoyment of millennial bliss, in virtue of God's everlasting covenant. I may add, that I quite receive this thought in reference to those two Old Testament fathers. I consider that it has the full support of the general scope and analogy of Holy Scripture.

		<a class="footnote" name="#97:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is interesting to look at this entire subject of the ark and deluge in connection with that most important and deeply significant ordinance of baptism. A truly baptised person, that is, one who as the apostle says, "obeys from the heart that type of doctrine to which he is delivered" is one who has passed from the old world into the new, in spirit and principle, and by faith. The water rolls over his person, signifying that his old man is buried, that his place in nature is ignored -- that his old nature is entirely set aside; in short, that he is a dead man. When he is plunged beneath the water, expression is given to the fact, that his name, place and existence, in nature, are put out of sight; that the flesh, with all that pertained thereto, its sins, its iniquities, its liabilities, is buried in the grave of Christ, and never can come into God's sight again. <p>Again when he rises up out of the water, expression is given to the truth that he only comes up as the possessor of a new life, even the resurrection of Christ. If Christ had not been raised from the dead, the believer could not come up out of the water, but should remain buried beneath its surface, as the simple expression of the place which righteously belongs to nature. But inasmuch as Christ rose from the dead in the power of a new life, having entirely put away our sins, we also come up out of the water; and, in so doing set, forth the fact that we are put, by the grace of God, and through the death of Christ, in full possession of a new life to which divine righteousness inseparably attaches. "We are buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." (See Rom 6 and Col 2. passim. Comp. also 1 Peter 3: 18-22) All this makes the institution of baptism one of immense importance, and pregnant with meaning.

		By comparing Genesis 12: 1, Genesis 11: 31, with Acts 7: 2-4, we learn a truth of immense practical value to the soul.<a name=112:5></a> "The Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and <i>from thy kindred</i>, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee.<a name=112:6></a> (Genesis 12: 1) Such was the communication made to Abraham -- a communication of the most definite character, designed of God to act upon Abraham's heart and conscience.<a name=112:7></a> "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into a land that I shall show thee.<a name=112:8></a> Then went he forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran, (or Haran;) and from thence, <i>when his father was dead</i>, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell.<a name=112:9></a>" (Acts 7: 2-4) The result of this communication is given in Genesis 11: 31, "And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, <i>to go

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From all these passages taken together, we learn that ties of nature hindered the full response of Abraham's soul to the call of God.<a name=113:8></a> Though called to Canaan, he, nevertheless, tarried at Haran, till nature's was snapped by death, and then, with unimpeded step he made his way to the place to which "the God glory" had called him.<a name=113:9></a> This is full of meaning.<a name=113:10></a> influences of nature are ever hostile to the full and practical power of "the calling of God.<a name=113:11></a>" We are sadly prone to take lower ground than that which the divine call would set before us.<a name=113:12></a> It needs great simplicity and integrity of faith to enable the soul to rise to the height of God's thoughts, and to make our own of that which He reveals.<a name=113:13></a>

		The apostle's prayer (Ephesians 1: 15-22) demonstrates how fully he, by the Holy Ghost, entered into the difficulty with which the Church would ever have to contend in seeking to apprehend "the hope of <i>God's calling</i> and the riches of the glory of <i>his</i> inheritance in the saints;" because, evidently, if we fail to apprehend the calling, we cannot walk worthy" thereof.<a name=113:14></a> I must know where I am called to go, before I can go thither.<a name=113:15></a> Had Abraham's soul been fully under the power of the truth" that God's calling was to Canaan, and that too, lay "his inheritance," he could not have remained in Charran.<a name=113:16></a> And so with us.<a name=113:17></a> If we are led by the Holy Ghost into the understanding of the truth, that we are called with a heavenly calling; that our home, our portion, our hope, our inheritance, are all above, where Christ sitteth at God's right hand," we

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as in Abraham's case, it was death that broke the link by which nature bound him to Charran; so, in our case, it is death which breaks the link by which nature ties us down to this present world.<a name=114:13></a> We must realise the truth that we have died in Christ, our head and representative -- that our place in nature, and in the world, is amongst the things that were -- that the cross of Christ is to us what the Red sea was to Israel, namely, that which separates us, for ever, from the land of death and judgement.<a name=114:14></a> Thus only shall we be able to walk, in any measure, "worthy of the calling

	<div class="paragraph">
		How precious, therefore, is the cross, in this its first phase, as the basis of the sinner's peace, the basis of his worship, and the basis of his eternal relationship with the God who in there so blessedly and so gloriously revealed?<a name=116:8></a> How precious to God, as furnishing Him with a righteous ground on which to go in the full display of all His matchless perfections, and in His most gracious dealings with the sinner!<a name=116:9></a> So precious is it to God that, as a recent writer has well remarked, ALL that He has said -- all that He has done, from the very beginning, indicates that it was ever uppermost in His heart.<a name=116:10></a> And no wonder!<a name=116:11></a> His dear and well-beloved Son was to hang there, between heaven and earth, the object of all the shame and suffering that men and devils could heap upon Him, because He loved to do His Father's will, and redeem the children of His grace.<a name=116:12></a> It will be the grand centre of attraction, as the fullest expression of His love, throughout eternity.<a name=116:13></a>"

		The opening of this chapter presents to us a subject of immense interest to the heart, namely, the true character of divine restoration.<a name=128:1></a> When the child of God has, in any way, declined in his spiritual condition, and lost his communion, he is in great danger, when conscience begins to work, of failing in the apprehension of divine grace, and of stopping short of the proper mark of divine restoration.<a name=128:2></a> Now, we know that God does everything in a way entirely worthy of Himself.<a name=128:3></a> Whether He creates, redeems, converts, restores, or provides, He can only act like Himself.<a name=128:4></a> What is worthy of Himself is, ever and only, His standard of action.<a name=128:5></a> This is unspeakably happy for us, inasmuch as we would ever seek to "limit the Holy One of Israel;" and in nothing are we so prone to limit Him as in His restoring grace.<a name=128:6></a> In the case now before us, we see that Abraham was not only delivered out of Egypt, but brought back" unto the place where his tent had been <i>at the beginning</i>, .<a name=128:7></a>.<a name=128:8></a>.<a name=128:9></a> .<a name=128:10></a>.<a name=128:11></a> unto the place of the altar which he had made there <i>at the first:</i> and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord.<a name=128:12></a>" Nothing can satisfy God, in reference to a wanderer or backslider, but his being entirely restored.<a name=128:13></a> We, in the self-righteousness of our hearts, might imagine that such an one should take a lower place than that which he had formerly occupied; and so he should, were it a question of his merit or his character; but, inasmuch as it is, altogether, a question of grace, it is God's prerogative to

		However, the man of faith is not exempt from the assaults of the enemy; and it frequently happens that immediately after a victory, one has to encounter a fresh temptation.<a name=143:9></a> Thus it was with Abraham.<a name=143:10></a> "The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chederlaomer, and of the kings that were with him.<a name=143:11></a>" There was, evidently, a very deep and insidious design of the enemy in this movement.<a name=143:12></a> "The king of Sodom" presents a very different thought, and exhibits a very different phase of the enemy's power, from what we have in "Chederlaomer and the kings that were with him.<a name=143:13></a>" In the former, we have rather the hiss of the serpent; in the latter, the roar of the lion; but whether it were the serpent or

		And, then, as to the ministry, the "bread and wine" refreshed Abraham's spirit, after his conflict with Chederlaomer; while the benediction prepared his heart for his conflict with the king of Sodom.<a name=144:8></a> Abraham was a conqueror, and yet he was about to be a combatant, and the royal priest refreshed the conqueror's spirit, and fortified the combatant's heart.<a name=144:9></a>

		It is peculiarly sweet to observe the manner in which Melchizedek introduces God to the thoughts of Abraham.<a name=144:10></a> He calls Him "the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth;" and, not only so, but pronounces Abraham "blessed" of that same God.<a name=144:11></a> This was effectually preparing him for the king of Sodom.<a name=144:12></a> A man who was "blessed" of God, did not need to take aught from the enemy; and if the possessor of heaven and earth" filled his vision, "the goods" of Sodom could

		In it we have unfolded to us the two great principles of sonship and heirship.<a name=147:7></a> "And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?<a name=147:8></a> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.<a name=147:9></a>" Abraham desired a son, for he knew, upon divine authority, that his "seed" should inherit the land.<a name=147:10></a> (Genesis 13: 15) Sonship and heirship are inseparably connected in the thoughts of God "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.<a name=147:11></a>" Sonship is the proper basis of everything; and, moreover, it is the result of God's sovereign counsel and operation, as we read in James, "of his own will begat he us.<a name=147:12></a>" Finally, it is founded upon God's eternal principle of resurrection.<a name=147:13></a> How else could it be?<a name=147:14></a> Abraham's body was "dead;" wherefore, in his case, as in every

		other, sonship must be in the power of resurrection.<a name=148:1></a> Nature is dead, and can neither beget nor conceive ought for God.<a name=148:2></a> There lay the inheritance stretching out before the patriarch's eye, in all its magnificent dimensions; but where was the heir?<a name=148:3></a> Abraham's body and Sarah's womb alike answered "death.<a name=148:4></a>" But Jehovah is the God of resurrection, and, therefore, a "dead body" was the very thing for Him to act upon.<a name=148:5></a> Had nature not been dead, God should have put it to death ere He could fully show Himself.<a name=148:6></a> The most suitable theatre for the living God is that from which nature, with all its boasted powers and empty pretensions, has been totally expelled by the sentence of death.<a name=148:7></a> Wherefore, God's word to Abraham was, "look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them; and he said unto him, so shall thy seed be.<a name=148:8></a>" When the God of resurrection fills the vision there is no limit to the soul's blessing, for He who can quicken the dead, can do anything.<a name=148:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it unto him for righteousness.<a name=148:10></a>" The imputation of righteousness to Abraham is, here, founded upon his believing in the Lord as the Quickener of the dead.<a name=148:11></a> It is in this character that He reveals Himself in a world where death reigns; and when a soul believes in Him, as such, it is counted righteous in His sight.<a name=148:12></a> This necessarily shuts man out, as regards his co-operation, for what can he do in the midst of a scene of death?<a name=148:13></a> Can he raise the dead?<a name=148:14></a> Can he open the gates of the grave?<a name=148:15></a> Can he deliver himself from the power of death, and walk forth, in life and liberty, beyond the limits of its dreary domain?<a name=148:16></a> Assuredly not.<a name=148:17></a> Well, then, if he cannot do

		so, he cannot work out righteousness, nor establish himself in the relation of sonship.<a name=149:1></a> "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living," and, therefore, so long as a man is under the power of death, and under the dominion of sin, he can neither know the position of a son, nor the condition of righteousness.<a name=149:2></a> Thus, God alone can bestow the adoption of sons, and He alone can impute righteousness, and both are connected with faith in Him as the One who raised up Christ from the dead.<a name=149:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in this way that the apostle handles the question of Abraham's faith, in Romans 4, where he says, "It was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed unto him; but for us also to whom it shall be imputed, <i>if We believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead</i>.<a name=149:4></a>" Here, the God of resurrection is presented "to us also," as the object of faith, and our faith in Him as the alone ground of our righteousness.<a name=149:5></a> If Abraham had looked up into heaven's vault, spangled with innumerable stars, and then looked at "his own body now dead," how could he ever grasp the idea of a seed as numerous as those stars?<a name=149:6></a> Impossible.<a name=149:7></a> But he did not look at his own body, but at the resurrection power of God, and, inasmuch as that was the power which was to produce the seed, we can easily see that the stars of heaven and the sand on the sea-shore are but feeble figures indeed; for what natural object could possibly illustrate the effect of that power which can raise the dead?<a name=149:8></a>

		Hence, therefore, sonship, being founded on resurrection, stands connected with perfect justification -- perfect righteousness -- perfect freedom from everything which could, in any wise, be against us.<a name=151:1></a> God could not have us in His presence with sin upon us.<a name=151:2></a> He could not suffer a single speck or stain of sin upon His sons and daughters.<a name=151:3></a> The father could not have the prodigal at <i>His</i> table with the rags of the far country upon him.<a name=151:4></a> He could go forth to meet him in those rags.<a name=151:5></a> He could fall upon his neck and kiss him, in those rags.<a name=151:6></a> It was worthy, and beautifully characteristic of his <i>grace</i> so to do; but then to seat him at his table in the rags would never do.<a name=151:7></a> The grace that brought the father out to the prodigal, reigns through the righteousness which brought the prodigal in to the father.<a name=151:8></a> It would not have been grace had the father waited for the son to deck himself in robes of his own providing; and it would not have been righteous to bring him in in his rags; but both grace and righteousness shone forth in all their respective brightness and beauty when the father went out and fell on the prodigal's neck; but yet did not give him a seat at the table until he was clad and decked in a manner suited to that elevated and happy position.<a name=151:9></a> God, in Christ, has stooped to the very lowest point of man's moral condition, that, by stooping He might raise man to the very highest point of blessedness, in fellowship with Himself.<a name=151:10></a> From all this, it follows, that our sonship, with all its consequent dignities and privileges, is entirely independent of us.<a name=151:11></a> We have just as little to do with it as Abraham's dead body and Sarah's dead womb had to do with a seed as numerous as the stars which garnish the heavens, or as

		But, then, our chapter opens another most important subject to our view, namely, <i>heirship</i>.<a name=152:3></a> The question of sonship and righteousness being fully settled -- divinely and unconditionally settled, the Lord said unto Abraham, "I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.<a name=152:4></a>" Here comes out the great question of heirship, and the peculiar path along which the chosen heirs are to travel ere they reach the promised inheritance.<a name=152:5></a> "If children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we <i>suffer</i> with him, that we may be also glorified together.<a name=152:6></a>" Our way to the kingdom lies through suffering, affliction, and tribulation; but, thank God, we can, by faith, say," the <i>sufferings</i> of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.<a name=152:7></a> And further, we know that "our <i>light affliction</i> which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.<a name=152:8></a>" Finally, "we glory in <i>tribulation</i>, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.<a name=152:9></a>" It is a high honour and a real privilege to be allowed to drink of our blessed Master's cup, and be baptised with His baptism; to travel in blest companionship with Him along the road which leads directly to the glorious inheritance.<a name=152:10></a> The Heir and the joint-heirs reach that inheritance by the pathway of suffering.<a name=152:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which to view a suffering Christ: first, as bruised of Jehovah; secondly, as rejected of men.<a name=153:7></a> In the former, He stood alone; in the latter, we have the honour of being associated with Him.<a name=153:8></a> In the former, I say, He stood alone, for who could have stood with Him?<a name=153:9></a> He bore the wrath of God alone; He travelled in solitude, down into "the rough valley that had neither been eared nor sown," and there He settled, for ever, the question of our sins.<a name=153:10></a> <i>With</i> this we had nothing to do, though to this we are eternally indebted for everything.<a name=153:11></a> He fought the fight and gained the victory, alone; but He divides the spoils with us.<a name=153:12></a> He was in solitude in the horrible pit and miry clay;" but directly He planted His foot on the everlasting "rock of resurrection, He associates us with Him.<a name=153:13></a> He uttered the cry alone; He sings the "<i>new song</i>" in company (Psalm 40: 2, 3).<a name=153:14></a>

		Now, in the case before us, in this chapter, it is evident that Hagar was not God's instrument for the accomplishment of His promise to Abraham.<a name=162:8></a> He had promised a son, no doubt, but He had not said that this son would be Hagar's; and, in point of fact, we find from the narrative, that both Abraham and Sarah "multiplied their sorrow," by having recourse to Hagar; for "when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.<a name=162:9></a>" This was but the beginning of those multiplied sorrows, which flowed from hastening after nature's resources.<a name=162:10></a> Sarah's dignity was trampled down by an Egyptian bond-woman, and she found herself in the place of weakness and contempt.<a name=162:11></a> The only true place of dignity and power is the place of felt weakness and dependence.<a name=162:12></a> There is no one so entirely independent of all around, as the man who is really walking by faith, and waiting only upon God; but the moment a child of God makes himself a debtor to nature or the world, he loses his dignity, and will speedily be made to feel his loss.<a name=162:13></a> It is no easy task to estimate the loss sustained

		"And Sarai said, My wrong be <i>upon thee</i>.<a name=163:3></a>" When we act wrong, we are, oft-times, prone to lay the blame on some one else.<a name=163:4></a> Sarah was only reaping the fruit of her own proposal, and yet she says to Abraham, "My wrong be upon thee;" and then, with Abraham's permission, she seeks to get rid of the trial which her own impatience had brought upon her.<a name=163:5></a> "But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee.<a name=163:6></a> And when Sarah dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.<a name=163:7></a>" This will not do.<a name=163:8></a> "The bond-woman" cannot be got rid of by hard treatment.<a name=163:9></a> When we make mistakes, and find ourselves called upon to encounter the results thereof, we cannot counteract those results by carrying ourselves with a high hand.<a name=163:10></a> We frequently try this method, but we are sure to make matters worse thereby.<a name=163:11></a> If we have done wrong, we should humble ourselves and confess the wrong, and wait on God for deliverance.<a name=163:12></a> But there was nothing like this manifested in Sarah's case.<a name=163:13></a> Quite the reverse.<a name=163:14></a> There is no sense of having done wrong; and, so far from waiting on God for deliverance, she seeks to deliver herself in her own way.<a name=163:15></a> However, it will always be found that every effort which we make to rectify our errors, previous to the full confession thereof, only tends to render our path more difficult.<a name=163:16></a> Thus Hagar had to

		Now, we should view all this in a double aspect: first, as teaching us a direct practical principle of much value; and secondly, in a doctrinal point of view.<a name=164:2></a> And, first, as to the direct, practical teaching, we may learn that when, through the unbelief of our hearts, we make mistakes, it is not all in a moment, nor yet by our own devices, we can remedy them.<a name=164:3></a> Things must take their course.<a name=164:4></a> "Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.<a name=164:5></a> For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.<a name=164:6></a>" This is an unalterable principle, meeting us, again and again, on the page of inspiration, and also on the page of our personal history.<a name=164:7></a> Grace forgives the sin and restores the soul, but that which is sown must be reaped.<a name=164:8></a> Abraham and Sarah had to endure the presence of the bond-woman and her son for a number of years, and, then, get rid of them in God's way.<a name=164:9></a> There is peculiar blessedness in leaving ourselves in God's hands.<a name=164:10></a> Had Abraham and Sarah done so, on the present occasion, they would never have been troubled with the presence of the bond-woman and her son; but, having made themselves debtors to nature, they had to endure the consequences.<a name=164:11></a> But, alas!<a name=164:12></a> we are often "like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke," when it would be our exceeding comfort to "behave and quiet ourselves as a child that is weaned of his mother.<a name=164:13></a>" No two figures can be more opposite than a stubborn bullock and a weaned child.<a name=164:14></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, as to the doctrinal view of this chapter.<a name=165:2></a> We are authorised to look at Hagar and her son, as figures of the covenant of works, and all who are thereby brought into bondage.<a name=165:3></a> (Galatians 4: 22-25) "The flesh" is, in this important passage, contrasted with "promise;" and thus we not only get the divine idea as to what the term "flesh" implies, but also as to Abraham's effort to obtain the seed by means of Hagar, instead of resting in God's "promise.<a name=165:4></a>" The two covenants are allegorised by Hagar and Sarah, and are diametrically opposite the one to the other.<a name=165:5></a> The one gendering to bondage, inasmuch as it raised the question as to man's competency "to do" and "not to do," and made life entirely dependent upon that competency.<a name=165:6></a> "The man that doeth these things shall live in them.<a name=165:7></a>" This was the Hagar-covenant.<a name=165:8></a> But the Sarah-covenant reveals God as the God of promise, which promise is entirely independent of man, and founded upon God's willingness and ability to fulfil it.<a name=165:9></a> When God makes a promise, there is no "if' attached thereto.<a name=165:10></a> He makes it unconditionally, and is resolved to fulfil it; and faith rests in Him, in perfect liberty of heart.<a name=165:11></a> It needs no effort of nature to reach the accomplishment of A divine promise.<a name=165:12></a> Here was, precisely, where Abraham and Sarah failed.<a name=165:13></a> They made an effort of nature to reach a certain end, which end was absolutely secured by a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The error into which the Galatians allowed themselves to be drawn, was the addition of something of nature to what Christ had already accomplished for them by the cross.<a name=166:6></a> The gospel which had been preached to them, and which they had received, was the simple presentation of God's absolute, unqualified, and unconditional grace.<a name=166:7></a> "Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth crucified among them.<a name=166:8></a>" This was not merely promise divinely made, but promise divinely and most gloriously accomplished.<a name=166:9></a> A crucified Christ settled everything, in reference both to God's claims and man's necessities.<a name=166:10></a> But the false teachers upset all this, or sought to upset it, by saying, "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.<a name=166:11></a>" This, as the apostle teaches them, was, in reality, "making Christ of none effect.<a name=166:12></a>" Christ must either be a <i>whole</i> Saviour, or no Saviour at all.<a name=166:13></a> the moment a man says, "except ye he this or that, ye cannot be saved," he totally subverts Christianity; for in Christianity I find God coming down to me, <i>just as I am</i>, a lost, guilty, self-destroyed sinner; and coming, moreover, with a full remission of all my sins, and a full salvation from my lost estate, all perfectly wrought by Himself on the cross.<a name=166:14></a>

		Hence, therefore, a man who tells me, "you must be so and so, in order to be saved," robs the cross of all its glory, and robs me of all my peace.<a name=167:1></a> If salvation depends upon our being or doing ought, we shall, inevitably, be lost.<a name=167:2></a> Thank God, it does not; for the great fundamental principle of the gospel is, that God is ALL -- man is NOTHING.<a name=167:3></a> It is not a mixture of God and man.<a name=167:4></a> It is all of God.<a name=167:5></a> The peace of the gospel does not repose, in part, on Christ's work;, and, in part, on man's work; it reposes <i>wholly</i> on Christ's work, because that work is perfect -- perfect for ever; and it renders all who put their trust in it as perfect as itself.<a name=167:6></a>

		Under the law, God, as it were, stood still to see what man could do; but, in the gospel, God is seen acting, and as for man, he has but to "stand still and see the salvation of God.<a name=167:7></a>" This being so, the inspired apostle hesitates not to say to the Galatians, "Christ is become of no effect unto you; whosoever of you are justified by law, (<i>en nomo</i>,) ye are fallen from grace.<a name=167:8></a>" If man has anything to do in the matter, God is shut out; and if God is shut out, there can be no salvation, for it is impossible that man can work out a salvation by that which proves him a lost creature; and then if it be a question of <i>grace</i>, it must be all grace.<a name=167:9></a> It cannot be half grace, half law.<a name=167:10></a> The two covenants are perfectly distinct.<a name=167:11></a> It cannot be half Sarah and half Hagar.<a name=167:12></a> It must be either the one or the other.<a name=167:13></a> If it be Hagar, God has nothing to do with it; and if it be Sarah, man has nothing to do with it.<a name=167:14></a> Thus it stands throughout.<a name=167:15></a> The law addresses man, tests him, sees what he is really worth, proves him a ruin, and puts

		The gospel, on the contrary, assuming man to be lost ruined, dead, reveals God as He is -- the Saviour of the lost -- the Pardoner of the guilty -- the Quickener of the dead.<a name=168:3></a> It reveals Him, not as exacting ought from man; (for what could be expected from one who has died a bankrupt) but as exhibiting His own independent grace in redemption.<a name=168:4></a> This makes a material difference and will account for the extraordinary strength of the language employed in the Epistle to the Galatians: "I marvel" -- "Who hath bewitched you" -- "I am afraid of you" -- "I stand in doubt of you" -- "I would they were even cut off that trouble you.<a name=168:5></a>" This is the language of the Holy Ghost, who knows the value of a full Christ, and a full salvation; and who also knows how essential the knowledge of both is to a lost sinner.<a name=168:6></a> We have no such language as this in any other epistle; not even in that to the Corinthians, although there were some of the grossest disorders to be corrected amongst them.<a name=168:7></a> all human failure and error can be corrected by bringing in God's grace; but the Galatians, like Abraham in this chapter, were going away from God, and returning to the flesh.<a name=168:8></a> What remedy could be devised for this?<a name=168:9></a> How can yon correct an error which consists in departing from that which alone can correct anything?<a name=168:10></a> To fall from grace, is to get back under the law, from

		Here we have God's remedy for Abraham's failure set before us.<a name=169:3></a>" And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto him, I am the <i>Almighty God:</i> walk before <i>me</i>, and be thou <i>perfect</i>"<a href="#169:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=169:4></a> This is a most comprehensive

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#169:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I would here offer a remark as to the word "perfect." When Abraham was called upon to be "perfect," it did not mean perfect in himself; for this he never was, and never could be. It simply, meant that he should be perfect as regards the object before his heart that his hopes and expectations were to be perfectly and undividedly centred in the "Almighty God." <p>In looking through the New Testament, we find the word "perfect" used in, at least, four distinct senses. In Matthew 5: 48, we read, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Here we learn from the context that the word "perfect" refers to the principle of our walk. At verse 44, we read, "love your enemies, ... ... that ye may be the sons of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust" Hence, to be "perfect" in the sense of Matthew 5: 48 is to act on a principle of grace toward all, even toward those who are injurious and hostile. A Christian going to law, and asserting or contending for his rights, is not "perfect as his Father" for his Father is dealing in grace, whereas he is dealing in righteousness. <p>The question here is not as to the right or wrong of going to law with worldly people, (as to brethren, 1 Corinthians 6 is conclusive.) All I contend for is, that a Christian so doing is acting in a character the direct opposite to that of his Father; for assuredly He is not going to law with the world. He is not now on a judgement-seat, but on a mercy-seat -- a throne of grace. He showers His blessings upon those who, were He to go to law with them, should be in hell. Wherefore it is plain that a Christian, when he brings a man before the judgement-seat, is not "perfect as his Father which is in heaven is perfect." <p>At the close of Matthew 18 we have a parable which teaches us that a man who asserts his rights is ignorant of the character and proper effect of grace. The servant was not unrighteous in demanding what was due to him; but he was ungracious. He was totally unlike his master. He had been forgiven ten thousand talents, and yet he could seize his fellow by the throat for a paltry hundred pence. What was the consequence? He was delivered to the tormentors. He lost the happy sense of grace, and was left to reap the bitter fruits of having asserted his rights, while being himself a subject of grace. And, observe further, he was called a wicked servant," not because of having owed "ten thousand talents, "but because of not having forgiven the "hundred pence." The master had ample grace to settle the former, but he had not grace to settle the latter. This parable has a solemn voice for all Christians going to law; for although in the application of it, it is said, "so shall my heavenly Father do to you, if you, from your heart, forgive not every one his brother their trespasses," yet is the principle of general application, that a man acting in righteousness will lose the sense of grace. <p>In Hebrews 9 we have another sense of the term "Perfect." Here, too, the context settles the import of the word. It is "perfect, as pertaining to the conscience." This is a deeply important use of the term. The worshipper under the law never could have a perfect conscience, for the simplest reason possible, because he never had a perfect sacrifice. The blood of a bullock and a goat did well enough For a time, but it could not do for ever and, therefore, could not give a perfect conscience. Now, however, the weakest believer in Jesus is privileged to have a perfect conscience. Why? Is it because he is a better man than the worshipper under the law Nay; but because he has gotten a better sacrifice. If Christ's sacrifice is perfect for ever, the believer's conscience is perfect for ever. The two things necessarily go together. For the Christian not to have a perfect conscience is a dishonour to the sacrifice of Christ. It is tantamount to saying that His sacrifice is only temporary, and not eternal in its effect; and what is this but to bring it down to the level of the sacrifices under the Mosaic economy. <p>It is very needful to distinguish between perfection in the flesh and perfection as to conscience. To pretend to the former, is to exalt self; to refuse the Latter, is to dishonour Christ. The babe in Christ should have a perfect conscience; whereas St. Paul had not, nor could have, perfect flesh. The flesh is not presented in the word as a thing which is to be perfected, but as a thing which has been crucified. This makes a wide difference. The Christian has sin in him, but not on him. Why? Because Christ, who had no sin in Him, ever, had sin on Him, when He was nailed to the cross. <p>Finally, in Philippians 3 we have two other senses of the word "perfect." The apostle says, "not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect," and yet a little further on he says, "Let as many as be perfect be thus minded." The former refers to the apostles full and everlasting conformity to Christ in glory. The latter refers to our having Christ as the all-engrossing object before the heart's affections.

		Further, we do not find that Lot is permitted to enjoy any of the high distinctions and privileges with which Abraham was favoured.<a name=187:4></a> Instead of refreshing the Lord, Lot gets his righteous soul vexed; instead of enjoying communion <i>with</i> the Lord, he is at a lamentable distance <i>from</i> the Lord; and, lastly, instead of interceding for others, he finds enough to do to intercede for himself.<a name=187:5></a> The Lord remained to commune with Abraham, and merely sent His angels to Sodom; and these angels could, with difficulty, be induced to enter into Lot's house, or partake of his hospitality: "they said, Nay, but we <i>will abide in the street all night</i>.<a name=187:6></a>" What a rebuke!<a name=187:7></a> How different from the willing acceptance of Abraham's invitation, as expressed in the words, "So do as thou hast said.<a name=187:8></a>"

		But there is another point of much interest and value brought out here.<a name=195:5></a> We find that Abraham had harboured an evil thing for a number of years: be had, it seems, started upon his course with a certain reserve in his soul, which reserve was the result of his want of full, unqualified confidence in God.<a name=195:6></a> Had he been able fully to trust God in reference to Sarah, there would have been no need of any reserve or subterfuge whatever.<a name=195:7></a> God would have fenced her round about from every ill; and who can harm those, who are the happy subjects of His unslumbering guardianship?<a name=195:8></a> However, through mercy, Abraham is enabled to bring out the root of the whole matter -- to confess and judge it thoroughly, and get rid of it.<a name=195:9></a> This is the true way to act.<a name=195:10></a> There can be no real blessing and power till every particle of leaven is brought forth into the light and there trampled under foot.<a name=195:11></a> God's patience is exhaustless.<a name=195:12></a> He can wait.<a name=195:13></a> He can bear with us; but He never will conduct a soul to the culminating point of blessing and power, while leaven remains known and unjudged.<a name=195:14></a> Thus much as to Abimelech and Abraham.<a name=195:15></a> Let us now look at the moral dignity of the latter, in the view of God.<a name=195:16></a>

		In the history of God's people, whether we look at them as a whole, or as individuals, we are often struck with the amazing difference between what they are in God's view, and what they are in the view of the world.<a name=196:1></a> God sees His people in Christ.<a name=196:2></a> He looks at them through Christ; and hence He sees them "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.<a name=196:3></a>" They are as Christ is before God.<a name=196:4></a> They are perfected for ever, as to their standing in Christ.<a name=196:5></a> "They are not in the flesh but in the spirit.<a name=196:6></a>"

		But, in themselves, they are poor, feeble, imperfect, stumbling, inconsistent creatures; and, inasmuch as it is what they are in themselves, and that alone, that the world takes knowledge of, therefore it is that the difference seems so great between the divine and the human estimate.<a name=196:7></a>

		Yet it is God's prerogative to set forth the beauty, the dignity, and the perfection of His people.<a name=196:8></a> It is His exclusive prerogative, inasmuch as it is He Himself who has bestowed those things.<a name=196:9></a> They are only comely through the comeliness which He has put upon them; and it is, therefore, due to Him to declare what that comeliness is; and truly He does it in a manner worthy of Himself, and never more blessedly than when the enemy comes forth to injure, to curse, or accuse.<a name=196:10></a> Thus, when Balak seeks to curse the seed of Abraham, Jehovah's word is, "I have not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither have I seen perverseness in Israel.<a name=196:11></a>" "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel.<a name=196:12></a> Again, when Satan stands forth to resist Joshua, the word is, "The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, .<a name=196:13></a>.<a name=196:14></a>.<a name=196:15></a> .<a name=196:16></a>.<a name=196:17></a>is not this a brand plucked out of the

		Thus, in Abraham's case, he might lower himself in the view of Abimelech, king of Gerar; and Abimelech might have to rebuke him, yet, when God comes to deal with the case, He says to Abimelech, "Behold, thou art but a dead man;" and of Abraham he says," He is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee.<a name=197:4></a>" Yes, with all "the integrity of his heart, and the innocency of his hands," the king of Gerar was "but a dead man;" and, moreover, he must be a debtor to the prayers of the erring and inconsistent stranger for the restoration of the health of his household.<a name=197:5></a> Such is the manner of God: He may have many a secret controversy with His child, on the ground of his practical ways; but directly the enemy enters a suit against him, Jehovah ever pleads His servant's cause.<a name=197:6></a> "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<a name=197:7></a>" "He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.<a name=197:8></a>" "It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?<a name=197:9></a> No dart of the enemy can penetrate the shield, behind which the Lord has hidden the very feeblest lamb of His blood-bought flock.<a name=197:10></a> He hides His people in His pavilion, sets their feet upon the rock of ages, lifts their heads above their enemies round about, and fills their hearts with the everlasting joy of His salivation.<a name=197:11></a>

		But, in reality, as might be expected, there is the fullest and most perfect harmony between these two apostles; indeed, on the subject of justification, the one is the counterpart or exponent of the other.<a name=214:5></a> Paul gives us the inward principle, James the outward development of that principle; the former presents the hidden life, the latter the manifested life; the former looks at man in relation to God, the latter looks at him in his relation to man.<a name=214:6></a> Now we want both: the inward would not do without the outward; and the outward would be valueless and powerless without the inward.<a name=214:7></a> "Abraham was justified" when "he believed God;" and "Abraham was justified" when" he offered Isaac his son.<a name=214:8></a>" In the former case we have his secret standing; in the latter, his public acknowledgement by

		We now return to our chapter.<a name=215:10></a> It is deeply interesting to mark here how Abraham's soul is led into a fresh discovery of God's character by the trial of his faith.<a name=215:11></a> When we are enabled to bear the testings of God's own hand, it is sure to lead us into some new experience with respect to His character, which makes us to know how valuable the testing is.<a name=215:12></a> If Abraham had not stretched out his hand to slay his son, he never would have known the rich and exquisite depths of that title which he here bestows upon God, viz.<a name=215:13></a>, "Jehovah Jireh.<a name=215:14></a>" It is only when we are really put to the test that we

		There is one point which, before closing my remarks on this chapter, I shall notice, and that is the gracious way in which God gives Abraham credit for having done the act which he had showed himself so fully prepared to do.<a name=216:13></a> "<i>By myself have I sworn</i>, saith the Lord; for <i>because thou hast done this thing</i>, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing, I will bless thee, and in multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.<a name=216:14></a>" This beautifully corresponds with the Spirit's notice of Abraham's acting, as put before us in Hebrews 11 and also

		The sons of Heth knew nothing about this.<a name=220:2></a> The thoughts which were filling the patriarch's soul were entirely foreign to the uncircumcised children of Heth.<a name=220:3></a> To them it seemed a small matter where he buried his dead, but it was by no means a small matter to him.<a name=220:4></a> "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.<a name=220:5></a>" It might, and manifestly did, appear strange to them to make so much ado about a grave; but, "beloved, the world knoweth us not, even as it knew him not.<a name=220:6></a>" The finest traits and characteristics of faith are those which are most incomprehensible to the natural man.<a name=220:7></a> The Canaanites had no idea of the expectations which were giving character to Abraham's actings on this occasion.<a name=220:8></a> They had no ides that he was looking forward to the possession of the land, while he was merely looking for a spot in which, as a dead man, he might wait for God's time, and God's manner, viz.<a name=220:9></a>, the MORNING OF RESURRECTION.<a name=220:10></a> He felt <i>he</i> had no controversy with the children of Heth, and hence he was quite prepared to lay his head in the grave, and allow God to act for him, and with him, and by him.<a name=220:11></a>

		Thus we may view this beautiful chapter in a twofold light; first, as setting before us a plain, practical principle, as to our dealings with the men of this world; and secondly, as presenting the blessed hope which should ever animate the man of faith.<a name=221:8></a> Putting both these points together, we have an example of what the child of God should ever be.<a name=221:9></a> The hope set before us in the gospel is a glorious immortality; and this, while it lifts the heart above every influence of nature and the world, furnishes a high and holy principle with which to govern all our intercourse with those who are without.<a name=221:10></a> "We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=221:11></a>" This is our hope.<a name=221:12></a> What is the moral effect of this?<a name=221:13></a> "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<a name=221:14></a>" (1 John 3: 2, 3) If I am to be like Christ by and by, I shall seek to be as like Him now as I can.<a name=221:15></a>

		GENESIS 24
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection of this chapter, with the two which precede it, is worthy of notice.<a name=223:1></a> In Genesis 22 the son is offered up; in Genesis 23 Sarah is laid aside; and in Genesis 24 the servant is sent forth to procure a bride for him who had been, as it were, received from the dead in a figure.<a name=223:2></a> This connection, in a very striking manner, coincides with the order of events connected with the calling out of the Church.<a name=223:3></a> whether this coincidence is to be regarded as of divine origin, will, it may be, raise a question in the minds of some; but it must at least be regarded as not a little remarkable.<a name=223:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When me turn to the New Testament, the grand events which meet our view are, first, the rejection and death of Christ; secondly, the setting aside of Israel after the flesh; and, lastly, the calling out of the Church to occupy the high position of the bride of the Lamb.<a name=223:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, all this exactly corresponds with the contents of this and the two preceding chapters.<a name=223:6></a> The death of Christ needed to be an accomplished fact, ere the Church, properly so called, could be called out.<a name=223:7></a> "The middle wall of partition" needed to be broken down, ere the "<i>One new man</i>" could be developed.<a name=223:8></a> It is well to understand this in order that we may know the place which the Church occupies in the ways of God.<a name=223:9></a> So long as the Jewish economy subsisted there was the most strict separation maintained between Jew and Gentile, and

		hence the idea of both being united in one new man was far removed from the mind of a Jew.<a name=224:1></a> He was led to view himself in a position of entire superiority to that of a gentile, and to view the latter as utterly unclean, to whom it was unlawful to come in (Acts 10: 28).<a name=224:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Israel had walked with God according to the truth of the relationship into which He had graciously brought them, they would have continued in their peculiar place of separation and superiority; but this they did not do; and, therefore, when they had filled up the measure of their iniquity, by crucifying the Lord of life and glory, and rejecting the testimony of the Holy Ghost, we find St.<a name=224:3></a> Paul is raised up to be the minister of a new thing, which was held back in the counsels of God, while the testimony to Israel was going on.<a name=224:4></a> "For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you-ward: how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, <i>as it is now</i> revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets (i.<a name=224:5></a>e.<a name=224:6></a>, New Testament prophets, <i>tois hagiois apostolois autou kai prophetais</i>) by the Spirit; that the gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.<a name=224:7></a>" (Ephesians 3: 1-6) This is conclusive.<a name=224:8></a> The mystery of the Church, composed of Jew and Gentile, baptised by one Spirit into one body, united to the glorious Head in the heavens, had never been revealed until Paul's day.<a name=224:9></a> Of this mystery the apostle goes on to say, "<i>I</i> was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, given unto me, by the effectual

		It were easy to enter upon a more elaborate demonstration of this most important truth, were this the place for so doing; but I shall now go on with our chapter, having merely touched upon a question of commanding interest, because of its being suggested by the position of Genesis 24.<a name=225:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There may be a question, in some minds, as to whether we are to view this deeply-interesting portion of scripture as <i>a type</i> of the calling out of the Church by the Holy Ghost.<a name=225:8></a> For myself, I feel happier in merely handling it as <i>an illustration</i> of that glorious work.<a name=225:9></a> We cannot suppose that the Spirit of God would occupy an unusually long chapter with the mere detail of a family compact, were that compact not typical

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in order to the clear and full understanding of the contents of the entire chapter, we may consider the following points, viz.<a name=226:8></a>, 1, <i>the oath</i>; 2, <i>the testimony</i>; 3, <i>the result</i>.<a name=226:9></a> It is beautiful to observe that the call and exaltation of Rebekah were founded upon the oath between Abraham and his servant.<a name=226:10></a> She knew nothing of this, though she was, in the purpose of God, so entirely the subject of it all.<a name=226:11></a> So is it exactly with the Church of God as a whole and each constituent part.<a name=226:12></a> "In thy book were all my members written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them.<a name=226:13></a>" (Psalm 139: 16) "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=226:14></a>" (Ephesians 1: 3, 4)

		met all the penalty due to sin; He made Himself responsible for everything on behalf of His body the Church; He was nailed to the cross as her representative He bore her sins in His own body on the tree, and went down into the grave under the full weight of them.<a name=228:1></a> Hence, nothing can be more complete than the Church's deliverance from all that was against her.<a name=228:2></a> She is quickened out of the grave of Christ, where all her trespasses were laid.<a name=228:3></a> The life which she has is a life taken up at the other side of death, after every possible demand had been met.<a name=228:4></a> Hence, this life is connected with, and founded upon, divine righteousness, inasmuch as Christ's title to life is founded upon His having entirely exhausted the Power of death; and He is the Church's life.<a name=228:5></a> Thus the Church enjoys divine life; she stands in divine righteousness; and the hope that animates her is the hope of righteousness.<a name=228:6></a> (See, amongst many other scriptures, John 3: 16, 36; John 5: 39, 40; John 6: 27, 40, 47, 68; John 11: 25; John 17: 2; Romans 5: 21; Romans 6: 23; 1 Timothy 1: 16; 1 John 2: 25; 5: 20; Jude 21; Ephesians 2: 1-6, 14, 15; Colossians 1: 12-22 Colossians 2: 10-15; Rom 1: 17; Rom 3: 21-26; Rom 4: 5, 23-25; 2 Corinthians 5: 21; Galatians 5: 5).<a name=228:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures most fully establish the three points, viz.<a name=228:8></a>, the life, the righteousness, and the hope of the Church, all of which flow from her being one with Him who was raised from the dead.<a name=228:9></a> Now, nothing can be so calculated to assure the heart as the conviction that the Church's existence is essential to the glory of Christ.<a name=228:10></a> "The woman is the glory of the man.<a name=228:11></a>" (1 Corinthians 11: 7) And again, the Church is called "the fullness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=228:12></a>" (Ephesians 1: 23) This last is a remarkable expression.<a name=228:13></a> The word translated "fullness"

		means the complement, that which, being added to something else, makes up a whole.<a name=229:1></a> Thus it is that Christ the Head, and the Church the body, make up the "one new man.<a name=229:2></a>" (Ephesians 2: 15) Looking at the matter in this point of view, it is no marvel that the Church should have been the object of God's eternal counsels.<a name=229:3></a> When me view her as the body, the Bride, the companion, the counterpart, of His only-begotten Son, we feel that there was, through grace, wondrous reason for her being so thought of before the foundation of the world.<a name=229:4></a> Rebekah was necessary to Isaac, and therefore, she was the subject of secret counsel while yet in profound ignorance about her high destiny ALL Abraham's thought was about Isaac.<a name=229:5></a> "I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take <i>a wife unto my son</i> of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.<a name=229:6></a>" Here we see that the all-important point was, "a wife unto my son.<a name=229:7></a>" "It is not good that the man should be alone.<a name=229:8></a>" This opens up a very deep and blessed view of the Church.<a name=229:9></a> In the counsels of God she is necessary to Christ; and in the accomplished work of Christ, divine provision has been made for her being called into existence.<a name=229:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While occupied with such a character of truth as this, it is no longer a question as to whether God can save poor sinners; He actually wants to "make a marriage" for his Son," and the Church is the destined bride -- she is the object of the Father's purpose, the object of the Son's love, and of the testimony of the Holy Ghost.<a name=229:11></a> She is to be the sharer of all the Son's dignity and glory, as she is the sharer of all that love of which He

		"And Isaac went unto Abimelech, king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.<a name=239:6></a>" There is a manifest difference between Egypt and Gerar.<a name=239:7></a> Egypt is the expression of the world in its natural resources, and its independence of God.<a name=239:8></a> "My river is mine own," is the language of an Egyptian who knew not Jehovah, and thought not of looking to Him for ought.<a name=239:9></a> Egypt was, locally, further removed from Canaan than Gerar; and, morally, it expresses a condition of soul further from God.<a name=239:10></a> Gerar is thus referred to in Genesis 10 "And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza as thou goest unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.<a name=239:11></a>" (verse 19) We are informed that "from Gerar to Jerusalem

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Had Isaac not gone to Abimelech, king of Gerar, he would have had no necessity for denying his wife; but the slightest divergence from the true line of conduct superinduces spiritual weakness.<a name=240:7></a> It was when Peter stood and warmed himself at the high priest's fire that he denied his Master.<a name=240:8></a> Now, it is manifest that Isaac was not really happy in Gerar.<a name=240:9></a> True, the Lord says unto him, "sojourn in this land;" but how often does the Lord give directions to His people morally suitable to the condition He knows them to be in, and calculated also to arouse them to a true sense of that condition?<a name=240:10></a> He directed Moses, in Numbers 13 to send men to search the land of Canaan; but had they not been in a low moral condition, such a step would not have been necessary We know well that faith does not need "<i>to spy out</i>" when God's promise lies before us.<a name=240:11></a> Again, he directed Moses to choose out seventy elders to help him in the work; but had Moses fully entered into the dignity and blessedness of his position, he would not have needed such a direction.<a name=240:12></a> So, in reference to the setting up of a king, in 1 Samuel 8.<a name=240:13></a> They ought not to have needed a king.<a name=240:14></a> Hence, we must always take into consideration the condition of an individual or

		But again it may be said, if Isaac's position in Gerar was wrong, how do we read, "Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received the same year an hundred-fold: and the Lord blessed him.<a name=241:2></a>" (verse 12) I reply, we can never judge that a person's condition is right because of prosperous circumstances.<a name=241:3></a> We have had already to remark, that there is a great difference between the Lord's presence and His blessing.<a name=241:4></a> Many have the latter without the former; and, moreover, the heart is prone to mistake the one for the other -- prone to put the blessing; for the presence; or at least to argue that the one must ever accompany the other.<a name=241:5></a> This is a great mistake.<a name=241:6></a> How many do we see surrounded by God's blessings, who neither have, nor wish for, God's presence?<a name=241:7></a> It is important to see this.<a name=241:8></a> A man may "wax great, and go forward, and grow until he becomes very great, and have possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants," and all the while, not have the full, unhindered joy of the Lord's presence with him.<a name=241:9></a> Flocks and herds are not the Lord.<a name=241:10></a> They are things on account of which the Philistines might envy Isaac, whereas they never would have envied him on account of the Lord's presence.<a name=241:11></a> He might have been enjoying the sweetest and richest communion with God, and the Philistines have thought nothing whatever about it?<a name=241:12></a> simply because they had no heart to understand or appreciate such a reality.<a name=241:13></a> Flocks, herds, servants, and wells of water they could appreciate; but the divine presence they could not appreciate.<a name=241:14></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#266:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It is deeply interesting to the spiritual mind to mark how sedulously the Spirit of God, in Romans 9 and indeed throughout all scripture, guards against the horrid inference which the human mind draws from the doctrine of God's election -- when He speaks of "vessels of wrath," He simply says, "fitted to destruction." He does not say that God "fitted" them. <p>Whereas, on the other hand, when He refers to "the vessels of mercy" he says, "whom he had afore prepared unto glory." This is most marked. <p>If my reader will turn for a moment to Matt 25: 34-41, he will find another striking and beautiful instance of the same thing. <p>When the king addresses those on His right hand, he says, "*Come, ye blessed of my Father*, inherit the kingdom *prepared for you* from the foundation of the world." (Verse 34) But when He addresses those on His left, He says, "Depart from me ye cursed." He does not say, "cursed of My Father." And, further, He says, "into everlasting fire, prepared," not for *you*, but "for the devil and his angels." (Verse 41) <p>In a word, then, it is plain that God has "prepared' a kingdom of glory, and "vessels of mercy' to inherit that kingdom; but He has not prepared" everlasting fire" for men, but for the "devil and his angels" nor has He fitted the "vessels of wrath," but they have fitted themselves. <p>The word of God as clearly establishes "election" as it sedulously guards against "*reprobation*." Everyone who finds himself in heaven will have to thank God for it; and everyone that finds himself in hell will have to thank himself.

		Though Jacob asked God to deliver him from his brother Esau, he evidently was not satisfied with that, and therefore he tried to "appease him with a present.<a name=273:1></a>" Thus his confidence was in the "present," and not entirely in God.<a name=273:2></a> "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.<a name=273:3></a>" It is often hard to detect what is the real ground of the heart's confidence.<a name=273:4></a> We imagine, or would fain persuade ourselves, that we are leaning upon God, when we are, in reality, leaning upon some scheme of our own devising.<a name=273:5></a> Who, after hearkening to Jacob's prayer, wherein he says," Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children," could imagine him saying, "I will appease him with a present.<a name=273:6></a>" Had he forgotten his prayer?<a name=273:7></a> Was he making a God of his present?<a name=273:8></a> Did he place more confidence in a few cattle than in Jehovah, to whom he had just been committing himself?<a name=273:9></a> These are questions which naturally arise out of Jacob's actings in reference to Esau, and we can readily answer them by looking into the glass of our own hearts.<a name=273:10></a> There we learn, as well as on the page of Jacob's history, how much more apt we are to lean on our own management than on God; but it will not do; we must be brought to see the end of our management, that it is perfect folly, and that the true path of wisdom is to repose in full confidence upon God.<a name=273:11></a>

		Thus it is in this interesting chapter; when Jacob had made this prudent arrangements, we read, "And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.<a name=274:5></a>" This is a turning point in the history of this very remarkable man.<a name=274:6></a> To be left alone with God is the only true way of arriving at a just knowledge of ourselves and our ways.<a name=274:7></a> We can never get a true estimate of nature and all its actings, until we have weighed them in the balance of the sanctuary, and there we ascertain their real worth, No matter what we may think about ourselves, nor yet what man may think about us; the great question is, what does God think about us?<a name=274:8></a> and the answer to this question can only be heard when we are "left alone.<a name=274:9></a>" Away from the world; away from self; away from all the thoughts, reasonings, imaginations, and emotions of mere nature, and "alone" with God -- thus, and thus alone, can we get a correct judgement about ourselves.<a name=274:10></a>

		I would remark, ere leaving this chapter, that the book of Job is, in a certain sense, a detailed commentary on this scene in Jacob's history.<a name=278:9></a> Throughout the first thirty-one chapters, Job grapples with his friends, and maintains his point against all their arguments; but in Job 32 God, by the instrumentality of Elihu, begins to wrestle with him; and in Job 38 He comes down upon Him directly with all the majesty of His power, overwhelms him by the display of His greatness and glory, and elicits from him the well-known words, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth <i>thee</i>.<a name=278:10></a> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.<a name=278:11></a>" (Job.<a name=278:12></a> 42: 5, 6) This was really touching the hollow of his thigh.<a name=278:13></a> And mark the expression, "mine eye

		In perusing these interesting sections of inspiration, we perceive a remarkable chain of providential actings, all tending to one grand point, namely, <i>the exaltation of the man who had been in the pit</i>; and, at the same time, bringing out, by the way, a number of subordinate objects.<a name=294:1></a> "The thoughts of many hearts" were to be "revealed;" but Joseph was to be exalted.<a name=294:2></a> "He called for a famine upon!<a name=294:3></a> the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.<a name=294:4></a> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant; whose feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in Iron; until the time that his word came; the word of the Lord tried him.<a name=294:5></a> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.<a name=294:6></a> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance; to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom" (Psalm 105: 16-22).<a name=294:7></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#304:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>The close of Jacob's career stands in most pleasing contrast with all the previous scenes of his eventful history. It reminds one of a serene evening, after a tempestuous day: the sun, which during the day had been hidden from view by clouds, mists, and fogs, sets in majesty and brightness, gilding with his beams the western sky, and holding out the cheering prospect of a bright tomorrow. Thus is it with our aged patriarch. The supplanting, the bargain-making, the running, the management, the shifting, the shuffling the unbelieving selfish fears -- all those dark clouds of nature and of earth seem to have passed away, and he comes forth, in all the calm elevation of faith, to bestow blessings, and impart dignities, in that holy skillfulness, which communion with God can alone impart. <p>Though nature's eyes are dim, faiths vision is sharp. He is not to be deceived as to the relative positions assigned to Ephraim and Manasseh, in the counsels of God. He has not, like his father Isaac, in Genesis 27, to "tremble very exceedingly," in view of an almost fatal mistake. Quite the reverse. His intelligent reply to his less instructed son is, "I know it, my son, I know it." The power of sense has not, as in Isaac's ease, dimmed his spiritual vision. He has been taught, in the school of experience, the importance of keeping close to the divine purpose, and nature's influence cannot move him from thence. <p>In Genesis 48: 11, we have a very beautiful example of the mode in which our God ever rises above all our thoughts, and proves Himself better than all our fears. "And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face; and, lo, God hath showed me also thy seed." To nature's view, Joseph was dead; whereas in God's view he was alive, and seated in the highest place of authority, next the throne. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." (1 Corinthians 2: 9) Would that our souls could rise higher in their apprehension of God and His ways. <p>It is interesting to notice the way in which the titles "Jacob'' and "Israel are introduced in the close of the Book of Genesis; as, for example, "One told Jacob, and said, Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed" Then, it is immediately added, "And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz." Now, we know, there is nothing in scripture without its specific meaning, and hence this interchange of names contains some instruction. In general, it may be remarked, that "Jacob" sets forth the depth to which God had descended; "Israel," the height to which Jacob was raised.
