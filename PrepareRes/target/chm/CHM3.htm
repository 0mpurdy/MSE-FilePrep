		Preface to the Second Edition
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rapid sale of a large edition of this volume evidences an amount of interest in the study of the Book of Leviticus, for which I unfeignedly bless the Lord.<a name=0:1></a> Too many, even of the people of God, seem to think that this section of inspiration contains nothing of any interest or value to them.<a name=0:2></a> They regard it as a detail of rites and ceremonies with which they have nothing to do -- a record of by-gone institutions, affording no instruction or edification for them.<a name=0:3></a> That this is a great mistake, thousands are now discovering.<a name=0:4></a> Very many who for years, looked upon the Book of Leviticus as little more than a dry catalogue of Jewish ordinances, are now discovering in it an exhaustless mine of spiritual wealth for which they cannot be too thankful.<a name=0:5></a> They have brought its marvellous pages under the light of the New Testament scriptures, and they can only wonder at that which is now unfolded to their gaze.<a name=0:6></a> That they may discover yet more of the precious treasure, is my earnest desire on their behalf.<a name=0:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have carefully revised the following pages, and, I may say, I have left them very much as I found them.<a name=0:8></a> An expression, here and there, which seemed likely to be misunderstood, I have slightly touched.<a name=0:9></a> I have also added a brief note or two.<a name=0:10></a> These trifling matters excepted, the Second Edition is a reprint of the First, and, as such, it is again committed to the care of Him from whom all blessings flow.<a name=0:11></a> May He be graciously pleased to crown it, still further, with the stamp of His approval.<a name=0:12></a> His seal and sanction are all that any book requires to make it useful; and, truly, we may say, the book that has not these, has nothing.<a name=0:13></a>

		LEVITICUS 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ere entering upon the details of the chapter before us, there are two things which demand our careful consideration; namely, first, Jehovah's position; and, secondly, the order in which the offerings are presented.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:2></a>" Such was the position from which Jehovah made the communications contained in this Book, He had been speaking from Mount Sinai, and his position, there, gave marked character to the communication.<a name=1:3></a> From the fiery mount "went a fiery law;" but, here, He speaks "out of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:4></a>" This was an entirely different position.<a name=1:5></a> We have seen this tabernacle set up, at the close of the preceding book.<a name=1:6></a> "And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate.<a name=1:7></a> So Moses finished the work.<a name=1:8></a> Then a cloud
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .<a name=2:1></a>.<a name=2:2></a>.<a name=2:3></a> .<a name=2:4></a>.<a name=2:5></a>.<a name=2:6></a> .<a name=2:7></a> For the glory of the Lord was upon the tabernacle, by day, and fire was on it, by night, in the sight of all the House of Israel, throughout all their journeys" (Exodus 40: 33-38).<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the tabernacle was God's dwelling place, in grace.<a name=2:9></a> He could take up His, abode there, because He was surrounded, on all sides, by that which vividly set forth the ground of His relationship with the people.<a name=2:10></a> Had He come into their midst, in the full display of the character revealed upon Mount Sinai, it could only have been to "consume them in a moment," as a "Stiff-necked people.<a name=2:11></a>" But He retired within the veil -- type of Christ's flesh, (Hebrews 10: 20) -- and took His place on the mercy seat where the blood of atonement, and not the "stiff-neckedness" of Israel, was that which met His view, and satisfied the claims of His nature.<a name=2:12></a> The blood which was brought into the sanctuary, by the high priest, was the type of that precious blood which cleanses from all sin; and, although Israel, after the flesh, saw nothing of this, it, nevertheless, justified God in abiding amongst them -- it "sanctified to the purifying of the flesh" (Hebrews 9: 13).<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to Jehovah's position in this Book, which must be taken into account, in order to a proper understanding of the communications made therein.<a name=2:14></a> In them we shall find inflexible holiness united with the purest grace.<a name=2:15></a> God is holy, no matter from whence He speaks.<a name=2:16></a> He was holy on Mount Sinai, and holy above the mercy-seat; but, in the former case, His holiness stood connected with "a devouring fire;" in the latter, it was connected with patient grace.<a name=2:17></a> Now, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connection of perfect holiness with perfect grace is that which characterises the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, which redemption is, in various ways, shadowed forth in the Book of Leviticus.<a name=3:1></a> God must be holy, even though it should be in the eternal condemnation of impenitent sinners; but the full display of His holiness, in the salvation of sinners, calls forth heaven's loudest and loftiest note of praise.<a name=3:2></a> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, Good-will toward men.<a name=3:3></a>" (Luke 2: 14.<a name=3:4></a>) This doxology could not have been sung in connection with "the fiery law.<a name=3:5></a>" No doubt, there was "glory to God in the highest," but there was no "Peace on earth" nor "good pleasure in men," inasmuch as it was the declaration of what men ought to be, ere God could take pleasure in them.<a name=3:6></a> But when "the Son" took His place, as a man, on the earth, the mind of Heaven could express its entire delight in Him as the One whose Person and work could combine, in the most perfect manner, divine glory with human blessedness.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, one word, as to the order of the offerings, in the opening chapters of the Book of Leviticus.<a name=3:8></a> The Lord begins with the burnt offering, and ends with the trespass offering.<a name=3:9></a> That is to say, He leaves off where we begin.<a name=3:10></a> This order is marked and most instructive.<a name=3:11></a> When, first, the arrow of conviction enters the soul, there are deep searchings of conscience, in reference to sins actually committed.<a name=3:12></a> Memory casts back its enlightened eye over the page of one's past life, and sees it stained with numberless trespasses against God and man.<a name=3:13></a> At this point of the soul's history, it is not so occupied with the question of the root from
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whence those trespasses have sprung, as with the stern and palpable fact that such and such things have actually been committed; and, hence, it needs to know that God has provided a sacrifice through which "all trespasses" can be "frankly forgiven.<a name=4:1></a>" This is presented to us in the trespass offering.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as one advances, in the divine life, he becomes conscious that those sins which he has committed are but branches from a root, streams from a fountain; and, moreover, that sin in his nature is that fountain -- that root.<a name=4:3></a> This leads to far deeper exercise, which can only be met by a deeper insight into the work of the cross.<a name=4:4></a> In a word, the cross will need to be apprehended by that in which God Himself has "condemned <i>sin in the flesh</i>," (Romans 8: 3) My reader will observe, it does not say, "sins in the flesh," but the root from whence these have sprung, namely, "<i>sin</i> in the <i>flesh</i>.<a name=4:5></a>" this is a truth of immense importance.<a name=4:6></a> Christ not merely "died for our <i>sins</i>, according to the scriptures," but He was "made <i>sin</i> for us.<a name=4:7></a>" (2 Corinthians 5: 21) This is the doctrine of the sin offering.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is when the heart and conscience are set at rest, through the knowledge of Christ's work, that we can feed upon Himself as the ground of our peace and joy, in the presence of God.<a name=4:9></a> There can be no such thing known as peace or joy, until we see all our trespasses forgiven and our sin judged.<a name=4:10></a> The trespass offering and the sin offering must be known, ere the Peace offering, joy offering, or thanksgiving offering can be appreciated.<a name=4:11></a> Hence, therefore, the order in which the peace offering stands, corresponds with the order of our spiritual apprehension of Christ.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same perfect order is observable in reference to the meat offering.<a name=5:1></a> When the soul is led to taste the sweetness of spiritual communion with Christ -- to feed upon Him, in peace and thankfulness, in the divine presence, it is drawn out in earnest desire to know more of the wondrous mysteries of His Person; and this desire is most blessedly met in the meat offering, which is the type of Christ's perfect manhood.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in the burnt offering, we are conducted to a point beyond which it is impossible to go, and that is, the work of the cross, as accomplished under the immediate eye of God, and as the expression of the unswerving devotion of the heart of Christ.<a name=5:3></a> All these things will come before us, in beauteous detail, as we pass along; we are here only looking at the order of the offerings, which is truly marvellous, whichever way we travel, whether <i>outward</i> from God to us, or <i>inward</i> from us to God.<a name=5:4></a> In either case, we begin with the cross and end with the cross.<a name=5:5></a> If we begin with the burnt offering, we see Christ, on the cross, doing the will of God -- making atonement, according to the measure of His perfect surrender of Himself to God.<a name=5:6></a> If we begin with the trespass offering, we see Christ, on the cross, bearing our sins, and putting them away, according to the perfection of His atoning sacrifice; while, in each and all, we Behold the excellency, the beauty, and the perfection of His divine and adorable Person.<a name=5:7></a> Surely, all this is sufficient to awaken in our hearts the deepest interest in the study of those precious types which we shall now proceed to consider in detail.<a name=5:8></a> And may God the Holy Ghost, who penned the Book of Leviticus, expound its contents in living power to our hearts; that
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		so, when we have reached the close, we may have abundant cause to bless His name for many thrilling and soul-stirring views of the Person and work of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, now, henceforth, and for evermore.<a name=6:1></a> Amen.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the burnt offering, with which our book opens, we have a type of Christ "offering himself without spot to God.<a name=6:3></a>" Hence the position which the Holy Ghost assigns to it.<a name=6:4></a> If the Lord Jesus Christ came forth to accomplish the glorious work of atonement, His highest and most fondly-cherished object, in so doing, was the glory of God.<a name=6:5></a> "Lo, I come, to do thy will, O God," was the grand motto in every scene and circumstance of His life, and in none more markedly than in the work of the cross.<a name=6:6></a> Let the will of God be what it might, He came to do it.<a name=6:7></a> Blessed be God, we know what our portion is in the accomplishment of this "Will" for by it "we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once.<a name=6:8></a>" (Hebrews 10: 10) Still, the primary aspect of Christ's work was to God-ward.<a name=6:9></a> It was an ineffable delight to Him to accomplish the will of God on this earth.<a name=6:10></a> No one had ever done this before.<a name=6:11></a> Some had, through grace, done "that which was right in the sight of the Lord;" but no one had ever, perfectly, invariably, from first to last, without hesitation, and without divergence, done the will of God.<a name=6:12></a> But this was, exactly, what the Lord Jesus did.<a name=6:13></a> He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was "obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=7:1></a>" (Philippians 2: 8) "He steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.<a name=7:2></a>" And as He walked from the garden of Gethsemane to the cross of Calvary, the intense devotion of His heart told itself forth in these accents: "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=7:3></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in all this self-emptied devotedness to God, there was truly a sweet savour.<a name=7:4></a> A perfect Man on the earth accomplishing the will of God, even in death, was an object of amazing interest to the mind of Heaven.<a name=7:5></a> Who could fathom the profound depths of that devoted heart, which displayed itself, under the eye of God, on the cross?<a name=7:6></a> Surely, none but God; for in this, as in everything else, it holds good that "no man knoweth the Son, but the Father;" and no one can know ought about Him, save as the Father reveals Him.<a name=7:7></a> The mind of man can, in some measure, grasp any subject of knowledge "under the sun.<a name=7:8></a>" Human science can be laid hold of by the human intellect; but no man knoweth the Son, save as the Father reveals Him, by the power of the Holy Ghost, through the written word.<a name=7:9></a> The Holy Ghost delights to reveal the Son -- to take of the things of Jesus, and show them unto us.<a name=7:10></a> These things we have, in all their fullness and beauty, in the word.<a name=7:11></a> There can be no new revelation, inasmuch as the Spirit brought "<i>all</i> things" to the apostles' memory, and led them into "<i>all</i> truth.<a name=7:12></a>" There can be nothing beyond "all truth;" and, hence, all pretension to a new revelation, and the development of new truth, -- meaning thereby truth not contained in the sacred canon of inspiration -- is an effort, on man's part, to add to what
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God calls "all truth.<a name=8:1></a>" No doubt, the Spirit may unfold and apply, with new and extraordinary power, truth contained in the word; but this is, obviously, a very different thing from our travelling outside the range of divine revelation, for the purpose of finding principles, ideas, or dogmas, which shall command the conscience.<a name=8:2></a> This latter can only be regarded in the light of impious presumption.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel narrative, we have Christ presented to us in the varied phases of His character, His Person, and His work.<a name=8:4></a> To those precious documents the people of God in all ages have rejoiced to betake themselves, and drink in their heavenly revelations of the object of their love and confidence -- the One to whom they owed everything, for time and eternity.<a name=8:5></a> But very few, comparatively, have ever been led to regard the rites and ceremonies of the Levitical economy as fraught with the most minute instruction in reference to the same commanding theme.<a name=8:6></a> The offerings of Leviticus, for example, have been too much regarded as so many antiquated records of Jewish customs, conveying no intelligible voice to our ears -- no spiritual light to our understandings.<a name=8:7></a> However, it must be admitted that the apparently abstruse records of Leviticus, as well as the sublime strains of Isaiah.<a name=8:8></a> take their place amongst the "things which were written aforetime," and they are, therefore, "for Our learning.<a name=8:9></a>" True, we shall need to study those records, as indeed all Scripture, with an humble, self-emptied spirit; with reverent dependence upon the teaching of Him who graciously penned them for us; with sedulous attention to the general scope, bearing, and analogy of the entire body of divine

	<div class="paragraph">
		revelation; with an effectual curb on the imagination, that it may not take unhallowed flights; but if thus, through grace, we enter upon the study of the types of Leviticus, we shall find in them a vein of the richest and finest ore.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now proceed to examine the burnt offering, which, as we have remarked, presents Christ, offering Himself, without spot, to God.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If His offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male, without blemish.<a name=9:3></a>" The essential glory and dignity of Christ's Person form the basis of Christianity.<a name=9:4></a> He imparts that dignity and glory to every thing He does, and to every office He sustains, No office could possibly add glory to Him who is "God over all, blessed for ever" -- "God manifest in the flesh" -- the glorious "Immanuel" -- "God with us" -- the eternal Word -- the Creator and Sustainer of the universe.<a name=9:5></a> What office could add to the dignity of such an One?<a name=9:6></a> In point of fact, we know that all His offices are connected with His humanity; and in assuming that humanity, He stooped from the glory which He had with the Father, before the world was.<a name=9:7></a> He thus stooped, in order to glorify God perfectly, in the very midst of a scene where all was hostile to Him.<a name=9:8></a> He came to be "eaten up" by a holy, unquenchable zeal for the glory of God, and the effectual carrying out of His eternal counsels.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The unblemished male, of the first year, was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ offering Himself for the perfect accomplishment of the will of God.<a name=9:10></a> There should be nothing expressive either of weakness or imperfection.<a name=9:11></a> "A male of the first year" was required.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall see, when we come to examine the other offerings, that "a female" was, in some cases, permitted; but that was only expressive of the imperfection which attached to the worshipper's apprehension, and in nowise of any defect in the offering, inasmuch as it was "unblemished" in the one case, as well as in the other.<a name=10:1></a> Here, however, it was an offering of the very highest order, because it was Christ offering Himself to God.<a name=10:2></a> Christ, in the burnt offering, was exclusively for the eye and heart of God.<a name=10:3></a> This point should be distinctly apprehended.<a name=10:4></a> God alone could duly estimate the Person and work of Christ.<a name=10:5></a> He alone could fully appreciate the cross as the expression of Christ's perfect devotedness.<a name=10:6></a> The cross.<a name=10:7></a> as foreshadowed by the burnt offering, had an element in it which only the divine mind could apprehend.<a name=10:8></a> It had depths so profound that neither mortal nor angel could fathom them.<a name=10:9></a> There was a voice in it which was intended exclusively for, and went directly to, the ear of the Fat her.<a name=10:10></a> There were communications between the cross of Calvary and the throne of God, which lay far beyond the highest range of created intelligence.<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord.<a name=10:12></a>" The use of the word "<i>voluntary</i>," here, brings out, with great clearness, the grand idea in the burnt offerings.<a name=10:13></a> It leads us to contemplate the cross in an aspect which is not sufficiently apprehended.<a name=10:14></a> We are too apt to look upon the cross merely as the place where the great question of sin was gone into and settled, between eternal Justice and the spotless victim -- as the place where our guilt was atoned for, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		where Satan was gloriously vanquished.<a name=11:1></a> Eternal and universal praise to redeeming love!<a name=11:2></a> The cross was all this.<a name=11:3></a> But it was more than this.<a name=11:4></a> It was the place where Christ's love to the Father was told out in language which only the Father could hear and understand.<a name=11:5></a> It is in the latter aspect that we have it typified, in the burnt offering; and, therefore, it is that the word voluntary" occurs.<a name=11:6></a> Were it merely a question of the imputation of sin, and of enduring the wrath of God on account of sin, such an expression would not be in moral order.<a name=11:7></a> The blessed Lord Jesus could not, with strict propriety, be represented as <i>willing</i> to be "made sin" -- <i>willing</i> to endure the wrath of God, and the hiding of His countenance; And, in this one fact, we learn, in the clearest manner, that the <i>burnt offering does not foreshadow Christ, on the cross, bearing sin</i> but Christ on the cross, accomplishing the will of God.<a name=11:8></a> that Christ Himself contemplated the cross in these two aspects of it, is evident from His own words.<a name=11:9></a> When he looked at the cross as the place of sin-bearing -- when He anticipated the horrors with which, in this point of view, it stood invested, He exclaimed, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me.<a name=11:10></a>" (Luke 23: 42) He shrank from that which His work, as a sin-bearer, involved.<a name=11:11></a> His pure and holy mind shrank from the thought of contact with sin; and His loving heart shrank from the thought of losing, for a moment, the light of God's countenance.<a name=11:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, then, the cross had another aspect.<a name=11:13></a> It stood before the eye of Christ as a scene, in which He could fully tell out all the deep secrets of His love to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Father -- a place in which He could, "of his own voluntary will," take the cup which the Father had given Him, and drain it to the very dregs.<a name=12:1></a> True it is that the whole life of Christ emitted a fragrant odour, which ever ascended to the Father's throne -- He did always those things which pleased the Father -- He ever did the will of God; but the burnt offering does not typify Him in His life -- precious, beyond all thought, as was every act of that life -- but in His death, and in that, not as one "made a curse for us," but as one presenting to the heart of the Father an odour of incomparable fragrance.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth invests the cross with peculiar charms for the spiritual mind.<a name=12:3></a> It imparts to the sufferings of our blessed Lord an interest of the most intense character.<a name=12:4></a> The guilty sinner, no doubt, finds in the cross a divine answer to the deepest and most earnest cravings of heart and conscience.<a name=12:5></a> The true believer finds in the cross that which captivates every affection of his heart, and transfixes his whole moral being.<a name=12:6></a> The angels find in the cross a theme for ceaseless admiration.<a name=12:7></a> All this is true; but there is that, in the cross, which passes far beyond the loftiest conceptions of saints or angels; namely, the deep-toned devotion of the heart of the Son presented to, and appreciated by, the heart of the Father.<a name=12:8></a> This is the elevated aspect of the cross, which is so strikingly shadowed forth in the burnt offering.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, here, let me remark that the distinctive beauty of the burnt offering must be entirely sacrificed, if we admit the idea that Christ was a sin-bearer all His life.<a name=12:10></a> There would then be no force, no value, no meaning in the word "voluntary.<a name=12:11></a>" There could be no room for

	<div class="paragraph">
		voluntary action in the case of one who was compelled, by the very necessity of his position, to yield up his life.<a name=13:1></a> If Christ were a sin-bearer, in His life, then, assuredly, His death must have been a <i>necessary</i>, not a voluntary, act.<a name=13:2></a> Indeed, it may be safely asserted that there is not one of the offerings the beauty of which would not be marred, and its strict integrity sacrificed, by the theory of a <i>Life</i> of sin-bearing.<a name=13:3></a> In the burnt offering, this is especially the case, inasmuch as it is not, in it, a question of sin-bearing, or enduring the wrath of God, but entirely one of voluntary devotedness, manifested in the death of the cross.<a name=13:4></a> In the burnt offering we recognise a type of God the Son, accomplishing, by God the Spirit, the will of God the Father.<a name=13:5></a> This He did "of His own voluntary will.<a name=13:6></a>" "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<a name=13:7></a>" (John 10: 17) Here we have the burnt offering aspect of the death of Christ.<a name=13:8></a> On the other hand, the prophet, contemplating Him as the sin offering, says, "his life is <i>taken</i> from the earth.<a name=13:9></a>" (Acts 8: 33, which is the LXX.<a name=13:10></a> version of Isaiah 53: 8) Again, Christ says, "No one (<i>ou deis</i>) taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<a name=13:11></a>" Was He a sin-bearer when He said this?<a name=13:12></a> Observe, it is "no one" man, angel, devil, or else.<a name=13:13></a> It was His own voluntary act, to lay down His life that He might take it again.<a name=13:14></a> "I delight to do thy will, O my God.<a name=13:15></a>" Such was the language of the divine burnt offering -- of Him who found His unutterable joy in offering Himself without spot to God.<a name=13:16></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#22:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>It may be well, at this point, to inform the reader that the Hebrew word which is rendered "burn," in the case of the burnt offering is wholly different from that which is used in the sin offering. I shall, because of the peculiar interest of the subject, refer to a few of the passages in which each word occurs. The word used in the burnt offering signifies "incense," or to "burn incense," and occurs in the following passages, in some one or other of its various inflections. Leviticus 6: 15; "and all the *frankincense*, ... . and shall *burn* it upon the altar." Deut, 33: 10; "they shall put *incense* before thee, and whole *burnt* sacrifice upon thine altar. Exodus 30: 1; "and thou shalt make an altar to *burn incense* upon." Psalm 46: 15; "with the incense of rams." Jeremiah 44: 21 "The *incense* that ye *burned* in the cities of Judah." Cant. 3: 15 Perfumed with Myrrh and *frankincense*." Passages might be multiplied, but the above will suffice to show the use of the word which occurs in the burnt offering. <p>The Hebrew word which is rendered "burn," in connection with the sin offering, signifies to burn, in general, and occurs in the following passages. Genesis 40: 3; "let us make brick, and *burn* them thoroughly." Leviticus 10: 16; "And Moses diligently sought the goat of the *sin* offering and, behold, it was *burnt*." 2 Chr. 16: 14; "And they made a very great *burning* for him." <p>Thus, not only was the sin offering burnt in a different place, but a different word is adopted by the Holy Ghost to express the burning of it. Now, we cannot imagine, for a moment, that this distinction is a mere interchange of words, the use of which is indifferent. I believe the wisdom of the Holy Ghost is as manifest in the use of the two words, as it is in any other point of difference in the two offerings. The spiritual reader will attach the proper value to the above most interesting distinction.

		When the apostle speaks of Christ's being made perfect through suffering," it is as "the Captain of our salvation that he contemplates Him, and not as the eternal Son who, as regards His own abstract Person and nature, was divinely perfect and could not possibly have ought added to Him.<a name=38:31></a> So, also, when He Himself says, "Behold I cast out devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected," (Luke 13: 32) He refers to His being perfected, in the power of resurrection, as the accomplisher of the entire work of redemption.<a name=38:32></a> So far as He was personally concerned, He could say, even on His way forth from the garden of Gethsemane, "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<a name=38:33></a> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<a name=38:34></a>" (Matthew 26: 53, 54).<a name=38:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well that the soul be clear as to this -- well to have a divine sense of the harmony which exists between those scriptures which present Christ in the essential dignity of His Person, and the divine purity of His nature, and those which present Him in His relation with His people, and as accomplishing the great work of redemption.<a name=38:36></a> At times we find both these things combined, in the same passage, as in Hebrews 5: 8, 9: "Though <i>he were a Son</i>, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him.<a name=38:37></a>" We must, however, bear in mind that not one of those relations into which Christ, voluntarily, entered -- whether as the expression of divine love to a lost world, or the servant of the divine counsels not one of these could possibly interfere with the essential purity, excellency, and glory of His Person.<a name=38:38></a> "The Holy Ghost came upon" the virgin, and the power of the Highest overshadowed her;" and "therefore that holy thing which was born of her was called the Son of God.<a name=38:39></a>" Most magnificent unfolding, this, of the deep secret of Christ's pure and perfect humanity -- the great antitype of the "<i>fine flour mingled with oil</i>!<a name=38:40></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here, let me observe, that, between humanity, as seen in the Lord Jesus Christ, and humanity, as seen in us, there could be no union.<a name=38:41></a> That which is pure could never coalesce with that which is impure.<a name=38:42></a> That which is incorruptible could never unite with that which is corruptible.<a name=38:43></a> The spiritual and the carnal -- the heavenly and the earthly -- could never combine.<a name=38:44></a> Hence, therefore, it follows that incarnation was not, as some have attempted to teach, Christ's taking our fallen nature into union with Himself.<a name=38:45></a> If He could have done this, there would have been no need of the death of the cross.<a name=38:46></a> He needed not, in that case, to feel "straitened" until the baptism was accomplished -- the corn of wheat did not need to fall into the ground and die.<a name=38:47></a>" This is a point of great moment.<a name=38:48></a> Let the spiritual mind ponder it deeply.<a name=38:49></a> Christ could not possibly take sinful humanity into union with Himself.<a name=38:50></a> Hear what the angel said to Joseph, in the first chapter of Matthew's gospel.<a name=38:51></a> "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; <i>for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost</i>.<a name=38:52></a>" See now Joseph's natural sensibilities, as well as Mary's pious ignorance, are made the occasion of a fuller unfolding of the holy mystery of Christ's humanity; and also of guarding that humanity against all the Blasphemous attacks of the enemy!<a name=38:53></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How, then, is it that believers are united to Christ.<a name=38:54></a> Is it in incarnation or resurrection?<a name=38:55></a> In resurrection, assuredly.<a name=38:56></a> How is this proved?<a name=38:57></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth <i>alone</i>.<a name=38:58></a>" (John 12: 24.<a name=38:59></a>) At this side of death, there could be no union between Christ and His people.<a name=38:60></a> It is in the power of a new life that believers are united to Christ.<a name=38:61></a> They were dead <i>in sin</i>, and He, in perfect grace, came down, and, though Himself pure and sinless, was "made sin" -- "died <i>unto sin</i>" -- put it away -- rose triumphant over it, and all pertaining to it, and, in resurrection, became the Head of a new race.<a name=38:62></a> Adam was the head of the old creation, which fell with him.<a name=38:63></a> Christ, by dying, put Himself under the full weight of His people's condition, and having perfectly met all that was against them, rose; victorious over all, and carried them with Him into the new creation, of which He is the glorious Head and Centre.<a name=38:64></a> Hence, we read, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.<a name=38:65></a>" (1 Corinthians 6: 17.<a name=38:66></a>) But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were <i>dead in sins</i>, hath quickened us <i>together with Christ</i>, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=38:67></a>" (Ephesians 2: 4-6.<a name=38:68></a>) For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=38:69></a>" (Ephesians 5: 30.<a name=38:70></a>) "And you <i>being dead in your sins</i>, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, <i>hath he quickened together with him</i>, having forgiven you all trespasses" (Colossians 2: 13).<a name=38:71></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Passages might be multiplied, but the above are amply sufficient to prove that it was not in incarnation, but in death, that Christ took a position in which His people could be "quickened together with him.<a name=38:72></a>" Does this seem unimportant to the reader?<a name=38:73></a> Let him examine it in the light of Scripture.<a name=38:74></a> Let him weigh all the consequences.<a name=38:75></a> Let him view it in its bearing upon Christ's Person, upon His life, upon His death, upon our condition, by nature, in the old creation, and our place, through mercy, in the new.<a name=38:76></a> Let him consider it thus, and, I feel persuaded, he will no longer regard it as a light matter.<a name=38:77></a> Of one thing, at least, he may rest assured, that the writer of these pages would not pen a single line to prove this point, did he not consider it to be fraught with the most momentous results.<a name=38:78></a> The whole of divine revelation so hangs together -- is so adjusted by the hand of the Holy Ghost is so consistent in all its parts, that, if one truth be disturbed, the entire arch is injured.<a name=38:79></a> This consideration should suffice to produce, in the mind of every Christian, a holy caution lest, by some rude touch, he mar the beauteous superstructure.<a name=38:80></a> Every stone must be left in its divinely appointed place; and, unquestionably, the truth as to Christ's Person is the keystone of the arch.<a name=38:81></a>

		Having thus endeavoured to unfold the truth typified by the "fine flour <i>mingled</i> with oil," we may remark another point of much interest in the expression, "He shall <i>pour</i> oil upon it.<a name=38:82></a>" In this we have a type of the anointing of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:83></a> The body of the Lord Jesus was not merely formed, mysteriously, by the Holy Ghost, but that pure and holy vessel was also anointed for service, by the same power.<a name=38:84></a> And it came to pass when all the people were baptised, and Jesus also being baptised and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove, upon him, and there was a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased" (Luke 3: 21, 22).<a name=38:85></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The anointing of the Lord Jesus, by the Holy Ghost, previous to His entrance upon His public ministry, is of immense practical importance to every one who really desires to be a true and an effectual servant of God.<a name=38:86></a> though conceived, as to His manhood, by the Holy Ghost; though, in His own proper Person, "God manifest in the flesh;" though embodying, in Himself, all the fullness of the Godhead; yet, be it well observed, when coming forth, as man, to do the will of God, on the earth, whatever that will might be, whether preaching the gospel, teaching in the synagogues, healing the sick, cleansing the leper, casting out devils, feeding the hungry, or raising the dead, He did all by the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:87></a> That holy and heavenly vessel in which God the Son was pleased to appear in this world, was formed, filled, Anointed, and led by the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:88></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a deep and holy lesson for us!<a name=38:89></a> A most needful and salutary lesson!<a name=38:90></a> How prone are we to run unsent!<a name=38:91></a> How prone to act in the mere energy of the flesh!<a name=38:92></a> How much of that which looks like ministry is only the restless and unhallowed activity of a nature which has never been measured and judged in the divine presence!<a name=38:93></a> Truly, we need to contemplate, more closely, our divine "meat offering" -- to understand, more fully, the meaning of the "Fine flour anointed with oil.<a name=38:94></a>" We need to meditate, more deeply, upon Christ Himself, who, though possessing, in His own Person, divine power, nevertheless, did all His work, wrought all His miracles, and, finally, offered himself without spot to God, by the eternal Spirit.<a name=38:95></a> He could say, "I, by the Spirit of God, cast out devils.<a name=38:96></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing is of any value save that which is wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:97></a> A man may write; but, if his pen be not guided and used by the Holy Ghost, his lines will produce no permanent result.<a name=38:98></a> A man may speak; but, if his lips be not anointed by the Holy Ghost, his word will not take permanent root.<a name=38:99></a> This is a solemn consideration, and, if properly weighed, would lead to much watchfulness over ourselves, and much earnest dependence upon the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:100></a> What we need is thorough self-emptiness, so that there may be room left for the Spirit to act by us.<a name=38:101></a> It is impossible that a man full of himself can be the vessel of the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:102></a> Such an one must, first, be emptied of himself, and, then, the Spirit can use him.<a name=38:103></a> When we contemplate the Person and ministry of the Lord Jesus, we see how that, in every scene and circumstance, He acted by the direct power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:104></a> Having taken His place, as man, down here, He showed that men should not only live by the Word, but act by the Spirit of God.<a name=38:105></a> Even though, as man, His will was perfect -- His thoughts, His words, His acts, all perfect, yet would He not act, save by the direct authority of the Word, and by the direct power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:106></a> Oh!<a name=38:107></a> that in this, as in every thing else, we could, more closely, more faithfully, follow in His steps.<a name=38:108></a> Then, indeed, would our ministry be more effective, our testimony more fruitful, our whole course more entirely to the glory of God.<a name=38:109></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next ingredient in the meat offering demanding our consideration is "the frankincense.<a name=38:110></a>" As has been remarked, the "fine flour" was the basis of the offering.<a name=38:111></a> The "oil" and "frankincense" were the two leading adjuncts; and, truly, the connection between these two latter is most instructive.<a name=38:112></a> The "oil" typifies the <i>power</i> of Christ's ministry; the "frankincense" typifies the <i>object</i> thereof.<a name=38:113></a> The former teaches us that He did everything by the Spirit of God; the latter that He did everything to the glory of God.<a name=38:114></a> The frankincense presents that in the life of Christ, which was, exclusively, for God.<a name=38:115></a> This is evident from the second verse: "And he shall bring it (the meat offering) to Aaron's sons, the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with <i>all the frankincense</i> thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.<a name=38:116></a>" Thus was it in the true meat offering -- the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=38:117></a> There was that in His blessed life which was exclusively for God.<a name=38:118></a> Every thought, every word, every look, every act of His, emitted a fragrance which went up, immediately, to God.<a name=38:119></a> And, as in the type, it was the fire of the altar" that drew forth the sweet odour of the frankincense; so, in the Anti type, the more he was "tried," in all the scenes and circumstances of His blessed life, the more fully was it manifested that, in His manhood, there was nothing that could not ascend, as an odour of a sweet smell, to the throne of God.<a name=38:120></a> If, in the burnt offering, we behold Christ "offering himself, without spot, to God;" in the meat offering, we behold Him presenting all the intrinsic excellence and perfect actings of His human nature to God.<a name=38:121></a> A perfect, a self-emptied, an obedient man, on the earth, doing the will of God, acting by the authority of the word, and by the power of the Spirit, had a sweet odour which could only be for divine acceptance.<a name=38:122></a> The fact that all the frankincense" was consumed on the altar, fixes its import in the simplest manner.<a name=38:123></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It now only remains for us to consider an ingredient which was an inseparable adjunct of the meat offering, namely, "<i>salt</i>.<a name=38:124></a>" "and every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.<a name=38:125></a>" The expression, "salt of the covenant," sets forth the enduring character of that covenant.<a name=38:126></a> God Himself has so ordained it, in all things, that nought can ever alter it -- no influence can ever corrupt it.<a name=38:127></a> In a spiritual and practical point of view, it is impossible to over-estimate the value of such an ingredient.<a name=38:128></a> "Let your conversation be always with grace, seasoned with <i>salt</i>.<a name=38:129></a>" The whole conversation of the Perfect Man exhibited the power of this principle.<a name=38:130></a> His words were not merely words of grace, but words of pungent power -- words divinely adapted to preserve from all taint and corrupting influence.<a name=38:131></a> He never uttered a word which was not redolent with "frankincense" and seasoned with salt.<a name=38:132></a> The former was most acceptable to God, the latter most profitable for man.<a name=38:133></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sometimes, alas!<a name=38:134></a> man's corrupt heart and vitiated taste could not tolerate the pungency of the divinely salted meat offering.<a name=38:135></a> Witness, for example, the scene in the synagogue of Nazareth.<a name=38:136></a> (Luke 4: 16-29) The people could bear him witness, and wonder at the <i>gracious</i> words which proceeded out of his mouth;" but when He proceeded to season those words with <i>salt</i>, which was so needful, in order to preserve them from the corrupting influence of their national pride, they would fain have cast Him over the brow of the hill whereon their city was built.<a name=38:137></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, also, in Luke 14, when His words of "grace" had drawn "great multitudes" after Him, He instantly throws in the "salt," by setting forth, in words of holy faithfulness, the sure results of following Him.<a name=38:138></a> Come, for all things are now ready," Here was the "grace.<a name=38:139></a>" but, then, "whosoever forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.<a name=38:140></a>" Here was the salt.<a name=38:141></a>" Grace is attractive; but "Salt is good.<a name=38:142></a>" Gracious discourse may be popular; but salted discourse never will.<a name=38:143></a> The pure gospel of the grace of God may, at certain times, and under certain circumstances, be run after by the multitude" for a while; but when the "salt" of a fervid and faithful application is introduced, it will soon thin the benches of all save such as are brought under the power of the word.<a name=38:144></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus considered the ingredients which composed the meal offering, we shall now refer to those which were excluded from it.<a name=38:145></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first of these was "leaven.<a name=38:146></a>" No meat offering which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven.<a name=38:147></a>" This ingredient is used throughout the inspired volume, without so much as a single exception, as the symbol of <i>evil</i>.<a name=38:148></a> In Leviticus 23, which will be noticed in due course, we find leaven admitted in the two loaves which were offered on the day of Pentecost; but from the meat offering, leaven was most sedulously excluded.<a name=38:149></a> There was to be nothing sour: nothing that would puff up, nothing expressive of evil in that which typified the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=38:150></a>" In Him, there could be nothing savouring of nature's sourness, nothing turgid, nothing inflated.<a name=38:151></a> All was pure, solid, and genuine.<a name=38:152></a> His word might, at times, cut to the quick; but it was never sour.<a name=38:153></a> His style never rose above the occasion.<a name=38:154></a> His deportment ever exhibited the deep reality of one walking in the immediate presence of God.<a name=38:155></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In those who bear the name of Jesus, we know, too well, alas!<a name=38:156></a> how leaven shows itself in all its properties and effects.<a name=38:157></a> There has been but one untainted sheaf of human fruit -- but one perfectly unleavened meat offering; and, blessed be God, that one is ours -- ours to feed upon in the sanctuary of the divine presence, in fellowship with God.<a name=38:158></a> No exercise can be more truly edifying and refreshing for the renewed mind than to dwell upon the unleavened perfectness of Christ's humanity -- to contemplate the life and ministry of One who was, absolutely and essentially, unleavened.<a name=38:159></a> In all His springs of thought, affection, desire, and imagination, there was not so much as a particle of leaven.<a name=38:160></a> He was the sinless, spotless, perfect Man.<a name=38:161></a> And the more we are enabled, by the power of the Spirit, to enter into all this, the deeper will be our experience of the grace which led this perfect One to place Himself under the full consequences of His people's sins, as He did when He hung upon the cross.<a name=38:162></a> his thought, however, belongs entirely to the sin-offering aspect of our blessed Lord.<a name=38:163></a> In the meat offering, sin is not in question.<a name=38:164></a> It is not the type of a sin-bearer, but of a real, perfect, unblemished Man, conceived and anointed by the Holy Ghost, possessing an unleavened nature, and living an unleavened life, down here; emitting, ever, to God-ward, the fragrance of His own personal excellency, and maintaining, amongst men, a deportment characterised by grace seasoned with salt.<a name=38:165></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was another ingredient, as positively excluded from the meat offering as leaven," and that was honey.<a name=38:166></a>" For ye shall burn no leaven, <i>nor any honey</i>, in any offering of the Lord made by fire.<a name=38:167></a>" (verse 11).<a name=38:168></a> Now, as "leaven" is the expression of that which is positively and palpably <i>evil</i>, in nature, we may regard honey" as the significant symbol of that which is apparently <i>sweet</i> and attractive.<a name=38:169></a> Both are disallowed of God -- both were carefully excluded from the meat offering -- both were unfit for the altar.<a name=38:170></a> Men may undertake, like Saul, to distinguish between what is "vile and refuse," and what is not; but the judgement of God ranks the delicate Agag with the vilest of the sons of Amalek;.<a name=38:171></a> No doubt, there are some good moral qualities in man which must be taken for what they are worth.<a name=38:172></a> hast thou found <i>honey</i>, eat so much as is convenient;" but, be it remembered, it found no place in the meat offering, nor in its Antitype.<a name=38:173></a> There was the fullness of the Holy Ghost; there was the fragrant odour of the frankincense; there was the preservative virtue of the salt of the covenant.<a name=38:174></a>" All these things accompanied the fine flour," in the Person of the true "meat offering;" but "no honey.<a name=38:175></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a lesson for the heart is here!<a name=38:176></a> yea, what a volume of wholesome instruction!<a name=38:177></a> The blessed Lord Jesus knew how to give nature and its relationships their proper place.<a name=38:178></a> He knew how much honey "was convenient.<a name=38:179></a>" He could say to His mother, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<a name=38:180></a>" And yet He could say, again, to the beloved disciple, Behold thy mother.<a name=38:181></a>" In other words, nature's claims were never allowed to interfere with the presentation to God of all the energies of Christ's perfect manhood.<a name=38:182></a> Mary and others too might have thought that her human relation to the blessed One gave her some peculiar claim or influence, on merely natural grounds.<a name=38:183></a> There came, then, his brethren ("after the flesh") and his mother, and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.<a name=38:184></a> And the multitude sat about him; and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.<a name=38:185></a>" What was the reply of the true Meat Offering?<a name=38:186></a> Did He, at once, abandon His work, in order to respond to nature's call?<a name=38:187></a> By no means.<a name=38:188></a> Had He done so, it would have been to mingle honey" with the meat offering, which could not be.<a name=38:189></a> The honey was faithfully excluded, on this, as on every occasion, when God's claims were to be attended to, and instead thereof, the power of the Spirit, the odour of the frankincense," and the virtues of the salt" were blessedly exhibited.<a name=38:190></a> And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?<a name=38:191></a> And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<a name=38:192></a> For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.<a name=38:193></a>"<a href="#38:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (Mark 3: 31-35.<a name=38:194></a>)

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>How important to see, in the above beautiful passage, that doing God's will brings the soul into a relationship with Christ, of which His brethren according to the flesh knew nothing, on merely natural grounds. It was as true, with respect to those brethren, as any one else, that except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Mary could not have been saved by the mere fact of her being the mother of Jesus. She needed personal faith in Christ as much as any other member of Adam's fallen family. She needed to pass, by being born again, not of the old creation into the new. It was by treasuring up Christ's words in her heart that this blessed woman was saved. No doubt, she was highly favoured" in being chosen as a vessel, to such a holy office; but, then, as a lost sinner, she needed! to rejoice in God her Saviour, like any one else. She stands on the same platform, is washed in the same blood, clothed in the same righteousness, and will sing the same song, as all the rest of God's redeemed. <p>This simple fact will give additional force and clearness to a point already stated, namely; that incarnation was not Christ's taking our nature into union with Himself. This truth should be carefully pondered. It is fully brought out in 2 Corinthians 5, "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea, *though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more*. Therefore if any man be *in Christ*, he is a new creation: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new" (verse 14-17).

		There are few things which the servant of Christ finds more difficult than to adjust, with spiritual accuracy, the claims of natural relationship, so as not to suffer them to interfere with the claims of the Master.<a name=38:195></a> In the case of our blessed Lord, as we know, the adjustment was divine.<a name=38:196></a> In our case, it often happens that divinely-recognised duties are openly neglected for what we imagine to be the service of Christ.<a name=38:197></a> The doctrine of God is constantly sacrificed to the apparent work of the gospel.<a name=38:198></a> Now, it is well to remember that true devotedness always starts from a point within which all godly claims are fully secured.<a name=38:199></a> If I hold a situation which demands my services from ten till four every day, I have no right to go out to visit or preach, during those hours.<a name=38:200></a> If I am in business, I am bound to maintain the integrity of that business, in a godly manner.<a name=38:201></a> I have no right to run hither and thither preaching, while my business, at home, lies in sixes and sevens, bringing great reproach on the holy doctrine of God.<a name=38:202></a> A man may say, I feel myself called to preach the gospel, and I find my situation, or my business, a clog.<a name=38:203></a> Well, <i>if you are divinely called and fitted</i> for the work; of the gospel, and that you cannot combine the two things, then resign your situation, or wind up your business, in a godly manner, and go forth, in the name of the Lord.<a name=38:204></a> But, clearly, so long as I hold a situation, or carry on a business, my work in the gospel must begin from a point within which the godly claims of such business or situation are fully responded to.<a name=38:205></a> This is devotedness.<a name=38:206></a> Ought else is confusion, however well intended.<a name=38:207></a> Blessed be God, we have a perfect example before us in the life of the Lord Jesus, and ample guidance, for the new man, in the word of God; so that we need not make any mistakes, in the varied relationships which we may be called, in the providence of God, to all, or as to the various claims which God's moral government has set up, in connection with such relationships.<a name=38:208></a>

The second point, in our theme, is the mode in which the meat offering was prepared.<a name=38:209></a> This was, as we read, by the action of fire.<a name=38:210></a> It was "baken in an oven" -- "baken in a pan" -- or "baken in a frying pan.<a name=38:211></a>" The process of baking suggests the idea of suffering.<a name=38:212></a> But inasmuch as the meat offering is called "a sweet savour" -- a term which is never applied to the sin offering, or trespass offering -- it is evident that there is no thought of suffering for sin -- no thought of suffering the wrath of God on account of sin -- no thought of suffering at the hand of infinite Justice, as the sinner's substitute.<a name=38:213></a> The two ideas of "sweet savour" and suffering for sin, are wholly incompatible, according to the Levitical economy.<a name=38:214></a> It would completely destroy the type of the meat offering, were we to introduce into it the idea of suffering for sin.<a name=38:215></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In contemplating the <i>life</i> of the Lord Jesus, which, as we have already remarked, is the special subject foreshadowed in the meat offering, we may notice three distinct kinds of suffering; namely, suffering for righteousness; suffering by the power of sympathy; and suffering, in anticipation.<a name=38:216></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the righteous Servant of God, He suffered in the midst of a scene in which all was contrary to Him; but this was the very opposite of suffering for sin.<a name=38:217></a> It is of the utmost importance to distinguish between these two kinds of suffering.<a name=38:218></a> The confounding of them must lead to serious error.<a name=38:219></a> suffering as a righteous One, standing amongst men, on God's behalf, is one thing; and suffering instead of men, under the hand of God, is quite another.<a name=38:220></a> The Lord Jesus suffered for righteousness, during His <i>life</i>.<a name=38:221></a> He suffered for sin, in His death.<a name=38:222></a> During His life, man and Satan did their utmost; and, even at the cross, they put forth all their powers; but when all that they could do was done -- when they had travelled, in their deadly enmity, to the utmost limit of human and diabolical opposition, there lay, far beyond a region of impenetrable gloom and horror into which the Sin-bearer had to travel, in the accomplishment of His work.<a name=38:223></a> During His life He ever walked in the unclouded light of the Divine countenance; but, on the cursed tree, the dark shadow of sin intervened, and shut out that light, and drew forth that mysterious cry, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=38:224></a>" This was a moment which stands absolutely alone, in the annals of eternity.<a name=38:225></a> From time to time, during the life of Christ, down here heaven had opened to give forth the expression of divine complacency in Him; but on the cross God forsook Him, because He was making His soul an offering for sin.<a name=38:226></a> If Christ had been a sin-bearer all His life, then what was the difference between the cross and any other period?<a name=38:227></a> Why was He not forsaken of God during His entire course?<a name=38:228></a> What was the difference between Christ on the cross, and Christ on the holy mount of transfiguration?<a name=38:229></a> was He forsaken of God, on the mount?<a name=38:230></a> Was He a sin-bearer there?<a name=38:231></a> These are very simple questions, which should be answered By those who maintain the ides of a life of sin-bearing.<a name=38:232></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The plain fact is this, there was nothing either in Christ's humanity, or in the nature of His associations, which could possibly connect Him with sin, or wrath, or death.<a name=38:233></a> He was made sin" on the cross; and there He endured the wrath of God, and there He gave up His life, as an all-sufficient atonement for sin; but nothing of this finds a place in the meat offering.<a name=38:234></a> True, we have the process of baking -- the action of fire; but this is not the wrath of God.<a name=38:235></a> The meat offering was not a sin offering, but a sweet savour" offering.<a name=38:236></a> Thus, its import is definitely fixed; and, moreover, the intelligent interpretation of it must ever guard, with holy jealousy, the precious truth of Christ's spotless humanity, and the true nature of His associations.<a name=38:237></a> To make Him, by the necessity of His birth, a sinbearer, or to place Him, thereby, under the curse of the law, and the wrath of God, is to contradict the entire truth of God, as to incarnation -- truth announced by the angel, and repeated, again and again, by the inspired apostle.<a name=38:238></a> Moreover, it destroys the entire character and object of Christ's life, and robs the cross of its distinctive glory.<a name=38:239></a> It lowers the sense of what sin is, and of what atonement is.<a name=38:240></a> In one word, it removes the keystone of the arch of revelation, and lays all in hopeless ruin and confusion around us.<a name=38:241></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, again, the Lord Jesus suffered by the power of Sympathy; and this character of suffering unfolds to us the deep secrets of His tender heart.<a name=38:242></a> Human sorrow, and human misery ever touched a chord in that bosom of love.<a name=38:243></a> It was impossible that a perfect human heart could avoid feeling, according to its own divine sensibilities, the miseries which sin had entailed upon the human family.<a name=38:244></a> Though, personally free, both from the cause and the effect -- though belonging to heaven, and living a perfect heavenly life, on the earth, yet did He descend, by the power of an intense sympathy, into the deepest depths of human sorrow yea, He felt the sorrow, more keenly by far, than those who were the direct subjects thereof, inasmuch as His humanity was perfect.<a name=38:245></a> And, further, He was able to contemplate both the sorrow and its cause, according to their just measure and character, in the presence of God.<a name=38:246></a> He felt as none else could feel.<a name=38:247></a> His feelings -- His affections -- His sensibilities -- His whole moral and mental constitution were perfect; and, hence, none can tell what such an One must have suffered, in passing through such a world as this.<a name=38:248></a> He beheld the human family struggling beneath the ponderous weight of guilt and wretchedness; He beheld the whole creation groaning under the yoke; the cry of the prisoner fell upon His ear; the tear of the widow met His view; bereavement and poverty touched His sensitive heart; sickness and death made Him groan in the spirit;" His sympathetic sufferings were beyond all human conception.<a name=38:249></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall quote a passage for my reader, illustrative of that character of suffering to which we are now referring.<a name=38:250></a> When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, <i>Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses</i>.<a name=38:251></a>" (Matthew 8: 16, 17) This was entirely sympathetic -- the power of fellow-feeling, which in Him was perfect.<a name=38:252></a> He had no sicknesses or infirmities of His own.<a name=38:253></a> Those things which are sometimes spoken of as sinless infirmities," were, in His case, but the evidences of a veritable, a real, a perfect manhood.<a name=38:254></a> But by sympathy, by perfect fellow feeling, He took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.<a name=38:255></a>" None?<a name=38:256></a> but a perfect man could have done this.<a name=38:257></a> We may feel for, and with, each other; but only Jesus could make human infirmity and sickness His own.<a name=38:258></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, had He been bearing all these things by the necessity of His birth, or of His relations with Israel and the human family, we should have lost all the beauty and preciousness of His voluntary sympathy.<a name=38:259></a> There could be no room for voluntary action when absolute necessity was laid upon Him.<a name=38:260></a> But, on the other hand, when we see His entire freedom, both personally and relatively, from human misery and that which produced it, we can enter into that perfect grace and compassion which led Him to take our infirmities, and bear our sicknesses," in the power of true sympathy.<a name=38:261></a> There is, therefore, a very manifest difference between Christ's suffering as a voluntary sympathiser with human misery, and His sufferings as the sinner's substitute.<a name=38:262></a> The former are apparent throughout His entire <i>life</i>; the latter are confined to His <i>death</i>.<a name=38:263></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, we have to consider Christ's sufferings, by anticipation.<a name=38:264></a> We find the dark shadow of the cross casting itself athwart His path, and producing a very keen order of suffering which, however, must be as clearly distinguished from His atoning suffering as either His suffering for righteousness, or His suffering by sympathy.<a name=38:265></a> Let as take a passage, in proof: And he came out, and went, as He was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.<a name=38:266></a> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless, not my will but thine, be done.<a name=38:267></a> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him.<a name=38:268></a> and being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.<a name=38:269></a>" (Luke 22: 39-44.<a name=38:270></a>) Again, we read, And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<a name=38:271></a> Then saith he unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me .<a name=38:272></a>.<a name=38:273></a>.<a name=38:274></a> .<a name=38:275></a>.<a name=38:276></a> he went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done" (Matthew 26: 37-42).<a name=38:277></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From these verses, it is evident, there was a something, in prospect, which the blessed Lord had never encountered before.<a name=38:278></a> There was a cup" being filled out for Him of which He had not yet drunk.<a name=38:279></a> If He had been a sin-bearer all His life, then why this intense agony at the thought of coming in contact with sin and enduring the wrath of God on account of sin?<a name=38:280></a> what was the difference between Christ, in Gethsemane, and Christ, at Calvary, if He were a sin-bearer all His life?<a name=38:281></a> There was a material difference!<a name=38:282></a> but it is because He was not a sin-bearer all His life.<a name=38:283></a> What is the difference?<a name=38:284></a> In Gethsemane, He was <i>anticipating</i> the cross!<a name=38:285></a> at Calvary, He was actually <i>enduring</i> it.<a name=38:286></a> In Gethsemane, there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him;" at Calvary, He was forsaken of all.<a name=38:287></a> There was no angelic ministry there.<a name=38:288></a> In Gethsemane He addresses God as <i>Father</i>," thus enjoying the full communion of that ineffable relationship; but at Calvary, He cries, My <i>God</i>, My <i>God</i>, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=38:289></a>" Here the sin-bearer looks up, and beholds the throne of eternal Justice enveloped in dark clouds, and the countenance of inflexible Holiness averted from Him because He was being made sin for us.<a name=38:290></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will, I trust, find no difficulty in examining this subject for himself.<a name=38:291></a> He will be able to trace, in detail, the three characters of the <i>life</i>-sufferings of our blessed Lord, and to distinguish between them and His <i>death</i>-sufferings-His sufferings for sin.<a name=38:292></a> He will see how that, when man and Satan had done their utmost, there yet remained a character of suffering which was perfectly unique, namely, suffering, at the hand of God, on account of sin -- suffering as the sinner's substitute.<a name=38:293></a> Until He came to the cross, He could ever look up and bask in the clear light of His Father's countenance.<a name=38:294></a> In the darkest hour, He found a sure resource above.<a name=38:295></a> His path down here was a rough one.<a name=38:296></a> How could it be otherwise, in a world where all was directly contrary to His pure and holy nature?<a name=38:297></a> He had to endure the contradiction of singers against himself.<a name=38:298></a>" He had to endure" the reproach of them that reproached God.<a name=38:299></a>" What had He not to endure?<a name=38:300></a> He was misunderstood, misinterpreted, abused, maligned, accused of being mad, and of having a devil.<a name=38:301></a> He was betrayed, denied, deserted, mocked, buffeted, spit upon, crowned with thorns, cast out, condemned, and nailed between two malefactors.<a name=38:302></a> All these things He endured at the hand of man, together with all the unutterable terrors which Satan brought to bear upon His spirit; but let it be, once more, emphatically repeated, when man and Satan had exhausted their power and enmity, our blessed Lord and Saviour had to endure a something compared with which all the rest was as nothing, and that was the hiding of God's countenance -- the three hours of darkness and awful gloom, during which He suffered what none but God could know.<a name=38:303></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when scripture speaks of our having fellowship with Christ's sufferings, it refers, simply, to His sufferings for righteousness -- his sufferings at the hand of man.<a name=38:304></a> Christ suffered for sin, that we might not have to suffer for it.<a name=38:305></a> He endured the wrath of God, that we might not have to endure it.<a name=38:306></a> This is the ground of our peace.<a name=38:307></a> But, as regards suffering from man, we shall always find that the more faithfully we follow in the footsteps of Christ, the more we shall suffer in this respect; but this is a matter of gift, a matter of privilege, a favour, a dignity.<a name=38:308></a> (See Philippians 1: 29, 30) To walk in the footsteps of Christ -- to enjoy companionship with Him -- to be thrown into a place of sympathy with Him, are privileges of the very highest order.<a name=38:309></a> Would that we all entered, more fully, into them!<a name=38:310></a> But, alas!<a name=38:311></a> we are too well content to do without them -- too well satisfied, like Peter, to follow afar off" -- to keep aloof from a despised and suffering Christ.<a name=38:312></a> All this is, undoubtedly, our heavy loss.<a name=38:313></a> Had we only more fellowship with His sufferings, the crown would glisten, far more brightly, in our soul's vision.<a name=38:314></a> When we shrink from fellowship with Christ's sufferings, we rob ourselves of the deep joy of His present companionship, and also of the moral power of the hope of His future glory.<a name=38:315></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. Having considered the ingredients which composed the meat offering, and the various forms in which it was presented, it only remains for us to refer to the persons who partook of it.<a name=38:316></a> These were the head and members of the priestly house.<a name=38:317></a> "And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.<a name=38:318></a>" (verse 10) As in the burnt offering, we observed the sons of Aaron introduced as types of all true believers, not as convicted sinners, but as worshipping Priests; so, in the meat offering, we find them feeding upon the remnant of that which had been laid, as it were, on the table of the God of Israel.<a name=38:319></a> This was a high and holy privilege.<a name=38:320></a> None but priests could enjoy it.<a name=38:321></a> This is set forth, with great distinctness, in "the law of the meat offering," which I shall here quote at length.<a name=38:322></a> And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, before the altar.<a name=38:323></a> And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and <i>all the frankincense</i> which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it unto the Lord.<a name=38:324></a> And the remainder thereof shell Aaron and his sons eat: with <i>unleavened bread</i> shall it be eaten, <i>in the Holy place</i>; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.<a name=38:325></a> It shall not be baken with leaven.<a name=38:326></a> I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.<a name=38:327></a> <i>All the males</i> among the children of Aaron shall eat of it: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations, concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire: <i>every one that toucheth them shall be holy</i>" (Leviticus 6: 14-18).<a name=38:328></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, we are furnished with a beauteous figure of the Church, feeding, "in the holy place," in the power of practical holiness, upon the perfections of the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=38:329></a>" This is our portion, through the grace of God; but, we must remember, it is to be eaten with unleavened bread.<a name=38:330></a>" We cannot feed upon Christ if we are indulging in anything evil.<a name=38:331></a> Every one that toucheth them shall be holy.<a name=38:332></a>" Moreover, it must be in the holy place.<a name=38:333></a>" Our position, our practice, our persons, our associations, must be holy, ere we can feed upon the meat offering.<a name=38:334></a> Finally, it is, all the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it.<a name=38:335></a>" That is to say, real priestly energy, according to the divine idea of it, is required, in order to enjoy this holy portion.<a name=38:336></a> Aaron's <i>Sons</i>" set forth the idea of <i>energy</i> in priestly action.<a name=38:337></a> His "<i>daughters</i>," <i>feebleness</i> therein.<a name=38:338></a> (Comp.<a name=38:339></a> Numbers 18: 8-13) There were some things which the sons could eat which the daughters could not.<a name=38:340></a> Our hearts should earnestly desire the highest measure of priestly energy, so that we may discharge the highest priestly functions, and partake of the highest order of priestly food.<a name=38:341></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, let me add that, inasmuch as we are made, through grace," partakers of the divine nature," we can, if living in the energy of that nature, walk in the footsteps of Him who is foreshadowed in the meat offering.<a name=38:342></a> If only we are self-emptied, our every act may emit a sweet odour to God.<a name=38:343></a> the smallest as well as the greatest services may, by the power of the Holy Ghost, present the fragrance of Christ.<a name=38:344></a> The paying of a visit, the writing of a letter, the public ministry of the word, giving a cup of cold water to a disciple, giving a penny to a pauper, yea, the common-place acts of eating and drinking -- all may emit the sweet perfume of the name and grace of Jesus.<a name=38:345></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, also, if only nature be kept in the place of death, there may be, in us, the exhibition of that which is not corruptible, even a conversation seasoned with the "salt" of abiding communion with God.<a name=38:346></a> But, in all these things, we fail and come short.<a name=38:347></a> We grieve the Holy Spirit of God in our ways.<a name=38:348></a> We are prone to self-seeking or men-pleasing, in our very best services, and we fail to "season" our conversation.<a name=38:349></a> Hence, our constant deficiency in the "oil," the "frankincense," and the Salt while, at the same time, there is the tendency to suffer the "leaven" or the "honey" of nature to make its appearance.<a name=38:350></a> There has been but one perfect meat offering;" and, blessed be God, we are accepted in Him.<a name=38:351></a> We are the sons" of the true Aaron; our place is in the sanctuary, where we can feed upon the holy portion.<a name=38:352></a> Happy place!<a name=38:353></a> Happy portion!<a name=38:354></a> May we enjoy them more than ever we have done.<a name=38:355></a> May our retirement of heart from all but Christ be more profound.<a name=38:356></a> May our gaze at Him be so intense, that we shall have no heart for the attractions of the scene around us, nor yet for the ten thousand petty circumstances, in our path, which would fret the heart and perplex the mind.<a name=38:357></a> May we rejoice in Christ, in the sunshine and in the darkness; when the gentle breezes of summer play around us, and when the storms of winter rage fiercely abroad; when passing over the surface of a placid lake, or tossed on the bosom of a stormy ocean.<a name=38:358></a> Thank God "we have found Him" who is to be our satisfying portion for ever.<a name=38:359></a> We shall spend eternity dwelling upon the divine perfections of the Lord Jesus.<a name=38:360></a> Our eyes shall never be averted from Him, when once we have seen Him as He is.<a name=38:361></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Spirit of God work mightily in us, to strengthen us, "in the inner man.<a name=38:362></a>" May He enable us to feed upon that perfect Meat Offering, the memorial of which has been fed upon by God Himself!<a name=38:363></a> This is our holy and happy privilege.<a name=38:364></a> May we realise it, yet more fully!<a name=38:365></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		LEVITICUS 3.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more closely we contemplate the offerings, the more fully do we see how that no one offering furnishes a complete view of Christ.<a name=38:366></a> It is only by putting all together, that anything like a just idea can be formed.<a name=38:367></a> Each offering, as might be expected, has features peculiar to itself.<a name=38:368></a> The Peace offering differs from the burnt offering, in many points; and a clear understanding of the points in which any one type differs from the others, will be found to help much in the apprehension of its special import.<a name=38:369></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in comparing the peace offering with the burnt offering, we find that the threefold action of "flaying," "Cutting it into its pieces," and "washing the inwards and legs" is entirely omitted; and this is quite in character.<a name=38:370></a> In the burnt offering, as we have seen, we find Christ offering Himself to, and accepted by God, and hence, the completeness of His self-surrender, and also the searching process to which He submitted Himself, had to be typified.<a name=38:371></a> In the peace offering, the leading thought is the communion of the worshipper.<a name=38:372></a> It is not Christ as enjoyed, exclusively, by God, but as enjoyed by the worshipper, in communion with God.<a name=38:373></a> Therefore it is that the whole line of action is less intense.<a name=38:374></a> No heart, be its love ever so elevated, could possibly rise to the height of Christ's devotedness to God, or of God's acceptance of Christ.<a name=38:375></a> None but God Himself could duly note the pulsations of that heart which throbbed in the bosom of Jesus; and, therefore, a type was needed to set forth that one feature of Christ's death, namely, His perfect devotedness therein to God.<a name=38:376></a> This type we have in the burnt offering, in which, alone, we observe the threefold action above referred to.<a name=38:377></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, also, in reference to the character of the sacrifice.<a name=38:378></a> In the burnt offering, it should be "a male without blemish;" whereas, in the peace offering, it might be "a male or female," though equally "without blemish.<a name=38:379></a>" The nature of Christ, whether we view Him as enjoyed exclusively by God, or by the worshipper in fellowship with God, must ever be one and the same.<a name=38:380></a> There can be no alteration in that.<a name=38:381></a> The only reason why "a female" was permitted in the peace offering, was because it was a question of the worshipper's capacity to enjoy that blessed One, who, in Himself, is "the same yesterday, today, and for ever" (Hebrews 13).<a name=38:382></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in the burnt offering, we read, "The priest shall burn <i>all</i>;" whereas, in the peace offering, a <i>part</i> only was burnt, that is, "the fat, the kidneys, and the caul.<a name=38:383></a> This makes it exceedingly simple.<a name=38:384></a> The most excellent portion of the sacrifice was laid on God's altar.<a name=38:385></a> The inward parts -- the hidden energies -- the tender sensibilities of the blessed Jesus, were devoted to God as the only One who could perfectly enjoy them.<a name=38:386></a> Aaron and his sons fed upon "the wave breast" and "the heave shoulder.<a name=38:387></a>"<a href="#38:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> (See carefully Leviticus 7: 28-36) All the members of the priestly family, in communion with their head, had their proper portion of the peace offering.<a name=38:388></a> And now, all true believers constituted, by grace, priests unto God, can feed upon the <i>affections</i> and the <i>strength</i> of the true Peace Offering -- can enjoy the happy assurance of having His loving heart and powerful shoulder to comfort and sustain them continually<a href="#38:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>.<a name=38:389></a> "This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office; which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them by a statute for ever throughout their generations.<a name=38:390></a>" (Leviticus 7: 35, 36)

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>The "breast" and the "shoulder" are emblematical of love and power -- strength and affection.

		All these are important points of difference between the burnt offering and the peace offering; and, when taken together, they set the two offerings, with great clearness, before the mind.<a name=38:391></a> There is something more in the peace offering than the abstract devotedness of Christ to the will of God.<a name=38:392></a> The worshipper is introduced; and that, not merely as a spectator, but as a participator -- not merely to gaze, but to feed.<a name=38:393></a> This gives very marked character to this offering.<a name=38:394></a> When I look at the Lord Jesus in the burnt offering, I see Him as One whose heart was devoted to the one object of glorifying God and accomplishing His will.<a name=38:395></a> But when I see Him in the peace offering, I find One who has a place in His loving heart, and on His powerful shoulder, for a worthless, helpless sinner.<a name=38:396></a> In the burnt offering, the breast and shoulder, legs and inwards, head and fat, were all burnt on the altar -- all went up as a sweet savour to God.<a name=38:397></a> But in the peace offering, that very portion that suits me is left for me.<a name=38:398></a> Nor am I left to feed, in solitude, on that which meets my individual need.<a name=38:399></a> By no means.<a name=38:400></a> I feed in communion -- in communion with God, and in communion with my fellow priests.<a name=38:401></a> I feed, in the full and happy intelligence, that the selfsame sacrifice which feeds my soul has already refreshed the heart of God; and, moreover, that the same portion which feeds me feeds all my fellow worshippers.<a name=38:402></a> Communion is the order here -- communion with God -- the communion of saints.<a name=38:403></a> There was no such thing as isolation in the peace offering.<a name=38:404></a> God had His portion, and so had the priestly family.<a name=38:405></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is in connection with the Antitype of the peace offering.<a name=38:406></a> The very same Jesus who is the object of heaven's delight, is he spring of joy, of strength, and of comfort to every believing heart; and not only to every heart, in particular, but also to the whole church of God, in fellowship.<a name=38:407></a> God, in His exceeding grace, has given His people the very same object that He has Himself.<a name=38:408></a> "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=38:409></a>" (1 John 1) True, our thoughts of Jesus can never rise to the height of God's thoughts.<a name=38:410></a> Our estimation of such an object must ever fall far short of His; and, hence, in the type, the house of Aaron could not partake of the fat.<a name=38:411></a> But though we can never rise to the standard of the divine estimation of Christ's Person and sacrifice, it is, nevertheless, the same object we are occupied With, and, therefore, the house of Aaron had "the wave breast and the heave shoulder.<a name=38:412></a>" All this is replete with comfort and joy to the heart.<a name=38:413></a> The Lord Jesus Christ -- the One "who was dead, but is alive for evermore," is now the exclusive object before the eye and thoughts of God; and, in perfect grace, He has given unto us a portion in the same blessed and all-glorious Person.<a name=38:414></a> Christ is our object too -- the object of our hearts, and the theme of our song.<a name=38:415></a> "Having made peace by the blood of his cross," He ascended into heaven, and sent down the Holy Ghost, that "other Comforter," by whose powerful ministrations we feed upon the breast and shoulder "of our divine "Peace Offering.<a name=38:416></a>" He is, indeed, our peace; and it is our exceeding joy to know that such is God's delight in the establishment of our peace that the sweet odour of our Peace offering has refreshed His heart.<a name=38:417></a> This imparts a peculiar charm to this type.<a name=38:418></a> Christ, as the burnt offering, commands the admiration of the heart; Christ, as the peace offering, establishes the peace of the conscience, and meets the deep and manifold necessities of the soul.<a name=38:419></a> The sons of Aaron might stand around the altar of burnt offering; they might behold the flame of that offering ascending to the God of Israel; they might see the sacrifice reduced to ashes; they might, in view of all this, bow their heads and worship; but they carried nought away for themselves.<a name=38:420></a> Not so in the peace offering.<a name=38:421></a> In it they not only beheld that which was capable of emitting a sweet odour to God, but also of yielding a most substantial portion for themselves on which they could feed, in happy and holy fellowship.<a name=38:422></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, assuredly, it heightens the enjoyment of every true priest to know that God (to use the language of our type) has had His portion, ere he gets the breast and the shoulder.<a name=38:423></a> The thought of this gives tone and energy, unction and elevation to the worship and communion.<a name=38:424></a> It unfolds the amazing grace of Him who has given us the same object, the same theme, the same joy with Himself.<a name=38:425></a> Nothing lower -- nothing less than this could satisfy Him.<a name=38:426></a> The Father will have the prodigal feeding upon the fatted calf, in fellowship with Himself.<a name=38:427></a> He will not assign him lower -- place than at His own table, nor any other portion than that on which He feeds Himself.<a name=38:428></a> The language of the peace offering is, "it is meet that we should make merry and be glad" -- "Let <i>us</i> eat and be merry.<a name=38:429></a>" Such is the precious grace of God!<a name=38:430></a> No doubt, we have reason to be glad, as being the partakers of such grace; but when we can hear the blessed God saying, "Let us eat and be merry," it should call forth from our hearts a continual stream of praise and thanksgiving.<a name=38:431></a> God's joy in the salvation of sinners, and His joy in the communion of saints, may well elicit the admiration of men and angels throughout eternity.<a name=38:432></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having, thus, compared the peace offering with the burnt offering, we may, now, briefly glance at it, in connection with the meat offering.<a name=38:433></a> The leading point of difference, here, is that, in the peace offering, there was blood-shedding, and in the meat offering, there was not.<a name=38:434></a> They were both "sweet savour" offerings; and, as we learn, from Leviticus 7: 12, the two offerings here very intimately associated.<a name=38:435></a> Now, both the connection and the contrast are full of meaning and instruction.<a name=38:436></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is only in communion with God that the soul can delight itself in contemplating the perfect humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:437></a> God the Holy Ghost must <i>impart</i>, as He must also <i>direct</i>, by the word, the vision by which we can gaze on "the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=38:438></a>" He might have been revealed "in the likeness of sinful flesh;" He might have lived and laboured on this earth; He might have shone, amid the darkness of this world, in all the heavenly lustre and beauty which belonged to His Person; He might have passed rapidly, like a brilliant luminary, across this world's horizon; and, all the while, have been beyond the range of the sinner's vision.<a name=38:439></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man could not enter into the deep joy of communion with all this, simply because there mould be no basis laid down on which this communion might rest.<a name=38:440></a> In the peace offering, this necessary basis is fully and clearly established.<a name=38:441></a> "He shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.<a name=38:442></a>" (Leviticus 3: 2) Here, we have that which the meet offering does not supply, namely, a solid foundation for the worshipper's communion with all the fullness, the preciousness, and the beauty of Christ, so far as He.<a name=38:443></a> by the gracious energy of the Holy Ghost, is enabled to enter thereunto.<a name=38:444></a> Standing on the platform which "the precious blood of Christ "provides, we can range, with tranquillised hearts, and worshipping spirits, throughout all the wondrous scenes of the manhood of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:445></a> Had we nought save the meat offering aspect of Christ, we should lack the title by which, and the ground on which, we can contemplate and enjoy Him therein.<a name=38:446></a> If there were no blood-shedding, there could be no title, no standing place for the sinner.<a name=38:447></a> but Leviticus 7: 12 links the meat offering with the peace offering, and, by so doing, teaches us that, when our souls have found peace, we can delight in the One, who has "made peace," and who is "our peace.<a name=38:448></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let it be distinctly understood that while, in the peace offering, we have the shedding and sprinkling of blood, yet sin-bearing is not the thought.<a name=38:449></a> When we view Christ, in the peace offering, He does not stand before us as the bearer of our sins, as in the sin and trespass offerings; but (having borne them) as the ground of our peaceful and happy fellowship with God.<a name=38:450></a> If sin-bearing were in question, it could not be said, "It is an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the Lord.<a name=38:451></a>" (Leviticus 3: 5 comp.<a name=38:452></a> with Leviticus 4: 10-12) Still, though sin-bearing is not the thought, there is full provision for one who knows himself to be a sinner, else he could not have any portion therein.<a name=38:453></a> To have fellowship with God we must be "in the light;" and how can we be there?<a name=38:454></a> Only on the ground of that precious statement, "the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=38:455></a>" (1 John 1) The more we abide in the light, the deeper will be our sense of everything which is contrary to that light, and the deeper, also, our sense of the value of that blood which entitles us to be there.<a name=38:456></a> The more closely we walk with God, the more we shall know of "the unsearchable riches of Christ.<a name=38:457></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most needful to be established in the truth that we are in the presence of God, only as the partakers of divine life, and as standing in divine righteousness.<a name=38:458></a> The Father could only have the prodigal at his table, clothed in "the best robe," and in all the integrity of that relationship in which He viewed him.<a name=38:459></a> Had the prodigal been left in his rags, or placed" as a hired servant" in the house, we never should have heard those glorious words, "Let us eat and be merry: for this <i>my son</i> was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.<a name=38:460></a>" Thus it is with all true believers.<a name=38:461></a> Their old nature is not recognised as existing, before God.<a name=38:462></a> He counts it dead, and so should they.<a name=38:463></a> It is dead, to God -- dead, to faith.<a name=38:464></a> It must be kept in the place of death.<a name=38:465></a> It is not by improving our old nature that we get into the divine presence; but as the possessors of a new nature.<a name=38:466></a> It was not by repairing the rags of his former condition that the prodigal got a place at the Father's table, but by being clothed in a robe which he had never seen, or thought of before.<a name=38:467></a> He did not bring this robe with him from the "far country," neither did he provide it as he came along; but the father had it for him in the house.<a name=38:468></a> The prodigal did not make it, or help to make it; but the father provided it for him, and rejoiced to see it on him.<a name=38:469></a> Thus it was they sat down together, to feed in happy fellowship, upon "the fatted calf.<a name=38:470></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall now proceed to quote at length "the law of the sacrifice of peace offering," in which we shall find some additional points of much interest -- points which belong peculiarly to itself: "And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the Lord.<a name=38:471></a> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour fried.<a name=38:472></a> Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.<a name=38:473></a> And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.<a name=38:474></a> And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.<a name=38:475></a> But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten; but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.<a name=38:476></a> And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.<a name=38:477></a> And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh all that be clean shall eat thereof.<a name=38:478></a> But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.<a name=38:479></a> Moreover, the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people" (Leviticus 7: 11-21).<a name=38:480></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the utmost importance that we accurately distinguish between sin in the flesh, and sin on the conscience.<a name=38:481></a> If we confound these two, our souls must, necessarily, be unhinged, and our worship marred.<a name=38:482></a> An attentive consideration of 1 John 1: 8-10 will throw much light upon this subject, the understanding of which is so essential to a due appreciation of the entire doctrine of the peace offering, and more especially of that point therein at which we have now arrived.<a name=38:483></a> There is no one who will be so conscious of indwelling sin as the man who walks in the light.<a name=38:484></a> "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.<a name=38:485></a>" In the verse immediately preceding, we read, "the blood of Jesus Christ his Son Cleanseth us from <i>all sin</i>.<a name=38:486></a>" Here the distinction between sin in us, and sin on us, is fully brought out and established.<a name=38:487></a> To say that there is sin on the believer, in the presence of God, is to call in question the purging efficacy of the blood of Jesus, and to deny the truth of the divine record.<a name=38:488></a> If the blood of Jesus can perfectly purge, then the believer's conscience is perfectly purged.<a name=38:489></a> The word of God thus puts the matter; and we must ever remember that it is from God Himself we are to learn what the true condition of the believer is, in His sight.<a name=38:490></a> We are more disposed to be occupied in telling God what we are in ourselves, than to allow Him to tell us what we are in Christ.<a name=38:491></a> In other words, we are more taken up with our own self-consciousness, than with God's revelation of Himself.<a name=38:492></a> God speaks to us on the ground of what He is in Himself and of what He has accomplished, in Christ.<a name=38:493></a> Such is the nature and character of His revelation of which faith takes hold, and thus fills the soul with perfect peace.<a name=38:494></a> God's revelation is one thing; my consciousness is quite another.<a name=38:495></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the same word which tells us we have no sin <i>on</i> us, tells us, with equal force and clearness, that we have sin <i>in</i> us.<a name=38:496></a> "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<a name=38:497></a>" Every one who has "truth "in him, will know that he has "<i>sin</i>" in him, likewise; for truth reveals every thing as it is.<a name=38:498></a> What, then, are we to do?<a name=38:499></a> It is our privilege so to walk in the power of the new nature, that the "<i>sin</i>" which dwells in us may not manifest itself in the form of "<i>sins</i>.<a name=38:500></a>" The Christian's position is one of victory and liberty.<a name=38:501></a> He is not only delivered from the guilt of sin, but also from sin as a ruling principle in his life.<a name=38:502></a> "knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.<a name=38:503></a> For he that is dead is freed from sin .<a name=38:504></a>.<a name=38:505></a>.<a name=38:506></a> .<a name=38:507></a>.<a name=38:508></a>.<a name=38:509></a> let not sin therefore <i>reign</i> in your mortal body, that ye should <i>obey it</i> in the lusts thereof .<a name=38:510></a>.<a name=38:511></a>.<a name=38:512></a> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for we are not under the law, but under grace.<a name=38:513></a>" (Romans 6: 6-14) Sin is there in all its native vileness; but the believer is "dead to it.<a name=38:514></a>" How?<a name=38:515></a> He died in Christ.<a name=38:516></a> By nature he was dead <i>in</i> sin.<a name=38:517></a> By grace he is dead <i>to</i> it.<a name=38:518></a> What claim can anything or any one have upon a dead man?<a name=38:519></a> None whatever.<a name=38:520></a> Christ "died unto sin once," and the believer died in Him.<a name=38:521></a> "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.<a name=38:522></a> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<a name=38:523></a>" What is the result of this, in reference to believers?<a name=38:524></a> "<i>Likewise reckon</i> ye also yourselves to be <i>dead indeed unto sin</i>, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=38:525></a>" Such is the believer's unalterable position, before God so that it is his holy privilege to enjoy freedom from sin as a <i>ruler</i> over him, though it be a <i>dweller</i> in him.<a name=38:526></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, then, "if any man sin," what is to be done?<a name=38:527></a> The inspired apostle furnishes a full and most blessed answer: "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<a name=38:528></a>" (1 John 1: 9) Confession is the mode in which the conscience is to be kept free.<a name=38:529></a> The apostle does not say, "If we pray for pardon, he is gracious and merciful to forgive us.<a name=38:530></a>" No doubt, it is ever happy for a child to breathe the sense of need into his father's ear -- to tell him of feebleness, to confess folly, infirmity, and failure.<a name=38:531></a> All this is most true; and, moreover, it is equally true that our Father is most gracious and merciful to meet His children in all their weakness and ignorance; but, while all this is true, the Holy Ghost declares, by the apostle, that, "if we <i>confess</i>," God is "<i>faithful</i> and <i>just</i> to forgive.<a name=38:532></a>" confession, therefore, is the divine mode.<a name=38:533></a> A Christian, having erred, in thought, word, or deed, might pray for pardon, for days and months together, and not have any assurance, from 1 John 1: 9, that he was forgiven; whereas the moment he truly confesses his sin, before God, it is a simple matter of faith to know that he is perfectly forgiven and perfectly cleansed.<a name=38:534></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an immense moral difference between praying for forgiveness, and confessing our sins, whether we look at it in reference to the character of God, the sacrifice of Christ, or the condition of the soul.<a name=38:535></a> It is quite possible that a person's prayer may involve the confession of his sin, whatever it may happen to be, and thus come to the same thing.<a name=38:536></a> But, then, it is always well to keep close to scripture, in what we think, and say, and do.<a name=38:537></a> It must be evident that when the Holy Ghost speaks of <i>confession</i>, He does not mean praying.<a name=38:538></a> And, it is equally evident that He knows there are moral elements in, and practical results flowing out of, confession, which do not belong to prayer.<a name=38:539></a> In point of fact, one has often found that a habit of importuning God for the forgiveness of sins, displayed ignorance as to the way in which God has revealed Himself in the Person and work of Christ; as to the relation in which the sacrifice of Christ has set the believer; and as to the divine mode of getting the conscience relieved from the burden, and purified from the soil, of sin.<a name=38:540></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been perfectly satisfied, as to all the believer's sins, in the cross of Christ.<a name=38:541></a> On that cross, a full atonement was presented for every jot and tittle of sin, in the believer's nature, and on his conscience.<a name=38:542></a> Hence, therefore, God does not need any further propitiation.<a name=38:543></a> He does not need ought to draw His heart toward the believer.<a name=38:544></a> We do not require to supplicate Him to be "faithful and just," when His faithfulness and justice have been so gloriously displayed, vindicated, and answered, in the death of Christ.<a name=38:545></a> Our sins can never come into God's presence, inasmuch as Christ who bore them all, and put them away, is there instead.<a name=38:546></a> But, if we sin, conscience will feel it, must feel it; yes, the Holy Ghost will make us feel it.<a name=38:547></a> He cannot allow so much as a single light thought to pass unjudged.<a name=38:548></a> What then?<a name=38:549></a> Has our sin made its way into the presence of God?<a name=38:550></a> Has it found its place in the unsullied light of the inner sanctuary?<a name=38:551></a> God forbid!<a name=38:552></a> The "Advocate" is there -- "Jesus Christ the righteous," to maintain, in unbroken integrity, the relationship in which we stand.<a name=38:553></a> But, though sin cannot affect God's thoughts in reference to us, it can and does affect our thoughts in reference to Him.<a name=38:554></a><a href="#38:f4"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> Though it cannot make its way into His presence, it can make its way into ours, in a most distressing and humiliating manner.<a name=38:555></a> Though it cannot hide the Advocate from God's view, it can hide Him from ours.<a name=38:556></a> It gathers, like a thick, dark cloud, on our spiritual horizon, so that our souls cannot bask in the blessed beams of our Father's countenance, It cannot affect our relationship with God, but it can very seriously affect our enjoyment thereof.<a name=38:557></a> What, therefore, are we to do?<a name=38:558></a> The word answers," if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<a name=38:559></a>" By confession, we get our conscience cleared; the sweet sense of our relationship restored; the dark; cloud dispersed; the chilling, withering influence removed; our thoughts of God set straight.<a name=38:560></a> Such is the divine method; and we may truly say that the heart that knows what it is to have ever been in the place of confession, will feel the divine power of the apostle's words, "My little children, these things write I unto you, THAT YE SIN NOT.<a name=38:561></a>" (1 John 2: 1)
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f4"><sup>++++</sup></a>The reader will bear in mind that the subject treated of in the text, leaves wholly untouched the important and most practical truth taught in John 14: 21-23, namely, the peculiar love of the Father for an obedient child, and the special communion of such a child with the Father and the Son. May this truth be written on all our hearts, by the pen of God the Holy Ghost.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, there is a style of praying for forgiveness, which involves a losing sight of the perfect ground of forgiveness, which has been laid in the sacrifice of the cross.<a name=38:562></a> If God forgives sins, He must be "faithful and just," in so doing.<a name=38:563></a> But it is quite clear that our prayers, be they ever so sincere and earnest, could not form the basis of God's faithfulness and justice, in forgiving us our sins.<a name=38:564></a> Nought save the work of the cross could do this.<a name=38:565></a> There the faithfulness and justice of God have had their fullest establishment, and that, too, in immediate reference to out actual sins, as well as to the root thereof, in our nature.<a name=38:566></a> God has already judged our sins in the Person of our Substitute, "on the tree;" and, in the act of confession, we judge ourselves.<a name=38:567></a> This is essential to divine forgiveness and restoration.<a name=38:568></a> The very smallest unconfessed, unjudged sin, on the conscience, will entirely mar our communion with God.<a name=38:569></a> Sin in us need not do this; but if we suffer sin to remain on us, we cannot have fellowship with God.<a name=38:570></a> He has put away our sins in such a manner, as that He can have us in His presence; and, so long as we abide in His presence, sin does not trouble us.<a name=38:571></a> But, if we get out of His presence, and commit sin, even in thought, our communion must, of necessity, be suspended, until, by confession, we have got rid of the sin.<a name=38:572></a> All this, I need hardly add, is founded, exclusively, upon the perfect sacrifice and righteous advocacy of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:573></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, as to the difference between prayer and confession, as respects the condition of the heart before God, and its moral sense of the hatefulness of sin, it cannot, possibly, be over-estimated.<a name=38:574></a> It is a much easier thing to ask, in a general way, for the forgiveness of our sins than to confess those sins.<a name=38:575></a> Confession involves <i>self-judgement</i>; asking for forgiveness may not, and, in itself, does not.<a name=38:576></a> This alone would be sufficient to point out the difference.<a name=38:577></a> Self-judgement is one of the most valuable and healthful exercises of the Christian life; and, therefore, anything which produces it, must be highly esteemed by every earnest Christian.<a name=38:578></a>

		The difference between asking for pardon, and confessing the sin, is continually exemplified in dealing with children.<a name=38:579></a> If a child has done anything wrong, he finds much less difficulty in asking his father to forgive him, than in openly and unreservedly confessing the wrong.<a name=38:580></a> In asking for forgiveness, the child may have in his mind a number of things which tend to lessen the sense of the evil; he may be secretly thinking that he was not so much to blame, after all, though, to be sure, it is only proper to ask his father to forgive him; whereas, in confessing the wrong, there is just the one thing, and that is self-judgement.<a name=38:581></a> Further, in asking for forgiveness the child may be influenced, mainly, by a desire to escape the consequences of his wrong; whereas, a judicious parent will seek to produce a just sense of its moral evil, which can only exist in connection with the full confession of the fault -- in connection with self-judgement.<a name=38:582></a>

		Thus it is, in reference to God's dealings with His children, when they do wrong.<a name=38:583></a> He must have the whole thing brought out and thoroughly judged.<a name=38:584></a> He will make us not only dread the consequences of sin which are unutterable -- but hate the thing itself, because of its hatefulness, in his sight.<a name=38:585></a> Were it possible for us, when we commit sin, to be forgiven, merely for the asking, our sense of sin, and our shrinking from it, would not be nearly so intense; and, as a consequence, our estimate of the fellowship with which we are blessed, would not be nearly so high.<a name=38:586></a> The moral effect of all this upon the general tone of our spiritual constitution, and also upon our whole character and practical career, must be obvious to every experienced Christian.<a name=38:587></a><a href="#38:f5"><sup class="footnote-link">++++</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f5"><sup>+++++</sup></a>The case of Simon Magus, in Acts 8, may present a difficulty to the reader. But of him, it is sufficient to say that one "in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity, "could never be set forth as a model for God's dear children. His case in nowise interferes with the doctrine of 1 John 1: 9. He was not in the relationship of a child, and, as a consequence, not a subject of the advocacy. I would further add, that the subject of the Lord's prayer is by no means involved in what is stated above. I wish to confine myself to the immediate passage under consideration. We must ever avoid laying down iron rules. A soul may cry to God, under any circumstances, and ask for what it needs. He is ever ready to hear and answer.

		This entire train of thought is intimately connected with.<a name=38:588></a> and fully borne out by, two leading principles laid down in "the law of the peace offering.<a name=38:589></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 13, of the seventh of Leviticus, we read, "he shall offer for his offering leavened bread.<a name=38:590></a>" And, yet, at verse 20, we read, "But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.<a name=38:591></a>" Here, we have the two things clearly set before us, namely, sin in us, and sin on us.<a name=38:592></a> "Leaven" was permitted, because there was sin in the worshipper's nature.<a name=38:593></a> "Uncleanness" was forbidden, because there should be no sin on the worshipper's conscience.<a name=38:594></a> If sin be in question, communion must be out of the question.<a name=38:595></a> God has met and provided for the sin, which He knows to be in us, by the blood of atonement; and, hence, of the leavened bread in the peace offering, we read, "of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord, and it shall be <i>the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings</i>.<a name=38:596></a>" (verse 14) In other words, the "leaven," in the worshipper's nature, was perfectly met by the "blood" Of the sacrifice.<a name=38:597></a> The priest who eats the leavened bread, must be the sprinkler of the blood.<a name=38:598></a> God has put our sin out of His sight for ever.<a name=38:599></a> Though it be in us, it is not the object on which His eye rests.<a name=38:600></a> He sees only the blood; And, therefore, He can go on with us, and allow us the most unhindered fellowship with Him.<a name=38:601></a> but if we allow the "<i>sin</i>" which is in us to develop itself in take shape of "<i>sins</i>," there must be confession, forgiveness, and cleansing, ere we can again eat of the flesh of the peace offering.<a name=38:602></a> The cutting off of the worshipper, because of ceremonial uncleanness, answers to the suspension of the believer's communion now, because of unconfessed sin.<a name=38:603></a> To attempt to have fellowship with God in our sins, would involve the blasphemous insinuation that He could walk in companionship with sin.<a name=38:604></a> "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth" (1 John 1: 6).<a name=38:605></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the light of the foregoing line of truth, we may easily see how much we err, when we imagine it to be a mark of spirituality to be occupied with our sins.<a name=38:606></a> Could sin or sins ever be the ground or material of our communion with God?<a name=38:607></a> Assuredly not.<a name=38:608></a> We have just seen that, so long as sin is the object before us, communion must be interrupted.<a name=38:609></a> Fellowship can only be "in the light;" and, undoubtedly, there is no sin in the light.<a name=38:610></a> There is nought to be seen there, save the blood which has put our sins away, and brought us nigh, and the Advocate which keeps us nigh.<a name=38:611></a> Sin has been for ever obliterated from that platform on which God and the worshipper stand in hallowed fellowship.<a name=38:612></a> What was it which constituted the material of communion between the Father and the prodigal?<a name=38:613></a> Was it the rags of the latter?<a name=38:614></a> Was it the husks of "the far country?<a name=38:615></a>" By no means.<a name=38:616></a> It was not anything that the prodigal brought with him.<a name=38:617></a> It was the rich provision of the Father's love -- "the fatted calf.<a name=38:618></a>" Thus it is with God and every true worshipper.<a name=38:619></a> They feed together, in holy and elevated communion, upon Him whose precious blood has brought them into everlasting association, in that light to which no sin can ever approach.<a name=38:620></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor need we, for an instant, suppose that true humility is either evidenced or promoted by looking at, or dwelling upon, our sins.<a name=38:621></a> An unhallowed and melancholy mopishness may, thus, be super induced; but the deepest humility springs from a totally different source.<a name=38:622></a> Whether was the prodigal an humbler man, "when he came to himself" in the far country, or when he came to the Father's bosom and the Father's house?<a name=38:623></a> Is it not evident that the grace which elevates us to the loftiest heights of fellowship with God, is that alone which leads us into the most' profound depths of a genuine humility Unquestionably.<a name=38:624></a> The humility which springs from the removal of our sins, must ever be deeper than that which springs from the discovery of them.<a name=38:625></a> The former connects us with God; the latter has to do with self.<a name=38:626></a> The way to be truly humble is to walk with God in the intelligence and power of the relationship in which He has set us.<a name=38:627></a> He has made us His children; and if only we walk as such, we shall be humble.<a name=38:628></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ere leaving this part of our subject, I would offer a remark as to the Lord's Supper, which, as being a prominent act of the Church's communion, may, with strict propriety, be looked at in connection with the doctrine of the peace offering.<a name=38:629></a> The intelligent celebration of the Lord's Supper must ever depend upon the recognition of its purely eucharistic or thanksgiving character.<a name=38:630></a> It is, very especially, a feast of thanksgiving -- thanksgiving for an accomplished redemption.<a name=38:631></a> "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?<a name=38:632></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=38:633></a>" (1 Corinthians 10: 16) Hence, a soul, bowed down under the heavy burden of sin, cannot, with spiritual intelligence, eat the Lord's Supper, inasmuch as that feast is expressive of the complete removal of sin by the death of Christ.<a name=38:634></a> Ye do show the Lord's death till he come.<a name=38:635></a>" (1 Corinthians 11) in the death of Christ, faith sees the end of everything that pertained to our old-creation standing; and, seeing that the Lord's Supper" shows forth" that death, it is to be viewed as the memento of the glorious fact that the believer's burden of sin was borne by One who put it away for ever.<a name=38:636></a> It declares that the chain of our sins, which once tied and bound us, has been eternally snapped by the death of Christ, and can never tie and bind us again.<a name=38:637></a> We gather round the Lord's table in all the joy of conquerors.<a name=38:638></a> We look back to the cross where the battle was fought and won; and we look forward to the glory where we shall enter into the full and eternal results of the victory.<a name=38:639></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		True, we have "leaven" <i>in</i> us; but we have no "uncleanness" <i>on</i> us.<a name=38:640></a> We are not to gaze upon our sins; but upon Him who bore them on the cross, and put them away for ever.<a name=38:641></a> We are not to "deceive ourselves" by the vain notion "that we have no sin" in us; nor are we to deny the truth of God's word, and the efficacy of Christ's blood, by refusing to rejoice in the precious truth that we have no sin on us, for "the blood Of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=38:642></a> It is truly deplorable to observe the heavy cloud that gathers round the Supper of the Lord, in the judgement of so many professing Christians.<a name=38:643></a> It tends, as much as anything else, to reveal the immense amount of misapprehension which obtains, in reference to the very elementary truths of the gospel.<a name=38:644></a> In fact, we know that when the Lord's Supper is resorted to on any ground save that of known salvation -- enjoyed forgiveness -- conscious deliverance, the soul becomes wrapped up in thicker and darker clouds than ever.<a name=38:645></a> That which is only a memorial of Christ is used to displace Him.<a name=38:646></a> That which celebrates an accomplished redemption is used as a stepping-stone thereto.<a name=38:647></a> It is thus that the ordinances are abused, and souls plunged in darkness, confusion, and error.<a name=38:648></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How different from this is the beautiful ordinance of the peace offering!<a name=38:649></a> In this latter, looked at in its typical import, we see that the moment the blood was shed, God and the worshipper could feed in happy, peaceful fellowship.<a name=38:650></a> Nothing more was needed.<a name=38:651></a> Peace was established by the blood; and, on that ground, the communion proceeded.<a name=38:652></a> A single question as to the establishment of peace must be the death-blow to communion.<a name=38:653></a> If we are to be occupied with the vain attempt to make peace with God, we must be total strangers to either communion or worship.<a name=38:654></a> If the blood of the peace offering has not been shed, it is impossible that we can feed upon "the wave breast" or "the heave shoulder.<a name=38:655></a>" But if, on the other hand, the blood has been shed, then peace is made already.<a name=38:656></a> God Himself has made it, and this is enough for faith; and, therefore, by faith, we have fellowship with God, in the intelligence and joy of accomplished redemption.<a name=38:657></a> We taste the freshness of God's own joy in that which He has wrought.<a name=38:658></a> We feed upon Christ, in all the fullness and blessedness of God's presence.<a name=38:659></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This latter point is connected with, and based upon, another leading truth laid down in "the law of the peace offering.<a name=38:660></a>" "And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered: he shall not leave any of it until the morning.<a name=38:661></a>" That is to say, the communion of the worshipper must never be separated from the sacrifice on which that communion is founded.<a name=38:662></a> So long as one has spiritual energy to maintain the connection, the worship and communion are also maintained, in freshness and acceptableness; but no longer.<a name=38:663></a> <i>We must keep close to the sacrifice</i>, in the spirit of our minds, the affections of our hearts, and the experience of our souls.<a name=38:664></a> This will impart power and permanency to our worship.<a name=38:665></a> We may commence some act or expression of worship, with our hearts in immediate occupation with Christ; and, ere we reach the close, we may become occupied with what we are doing or saying, or with the persons who are listening to us; and, in this way, fall into what may be termed "iniquity in our holy things.<a name=38:666></a>" This is deeply solemn, and should make us very watchful.<a name=38:667></a> We may begin our worship in the Spirit and end in the flesh.<a name=38:668></a> Our care should ever be, not to suffer ourselves to proceed for a single moment beyond the energy of the Spirit, at the time, for the Spirit will always keep us occupied directly with Christ.<a name=38:669></a> If the Holy Ghost produces "five words" of worship or thanksgiving, let us utter the five and have done.<a name=38:670></a> If we proceed further, we are eating the flesh of our sacrifice beyond the time; and, so far from its being "accepted," it is, really, "an abomination.<a name=38:671></a>" Let us remember this, and be watchful.<a name=38:672></a> It need not alarm us.<a name=38:673></a> God would have us led by the Spirit, and so filled with Christ in all our worship.<a name=38:674></a> He can only accept of that which is divine; and, therefore, He would have us presenting that only which is divine.<a name=38:675></a>

		"But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: <i>and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten</i>.<a name=38:676></a>" (Leviticus 7: 16) When the soul goes forth to God in a voluntary act of worship, such worship will be the result of a larger measure of spiritual energy than where it merely springs from some special mercy experienced at the time.<a name=38:677></a> If one has been visited with some marked favour from the Lord's own hand, the soul, at once, ascends in thanksgiving.<a name=38:678></a> In this case, the worship is awakened by, and connected with, that favour or mercy, whatever it may happen to be, and there it ends.<a name=38:679></a> But, where the heart is led forth by the Holy Ghost in some voluntary or deliberate expression of praise, it will be of a more enduring character.<a name=38:680></a> But spiritual worship will always connect itself with the precious sacrifice of Christ.<a name=38:681></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice, on the third day, shall be burnt with fire.<a name=38:682></a> And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.<a name=38:683></a>" Nothing is of any value, in the judgement of God, which is not immediately connected with Christ.<a name=38:684></a> There may be a great deal of what looks like worship, which is, after all, the mere excitement and outgoing of natural feeling.<a name=38:685></a> There may be much apparent devotion, which is, merely, fleshly pietism.<a name=38:686></a> Nature may be acted upon, in a religious way, by a variety of things, such as pomp, ceremony, and parade, tones and attitudes, robes and vestments, an eloquent liturgy, all the varied attractions of a splendid ritualism, while there may be a total absence of spiritual worship.<a name=38:687></a> Yea, it not infrequently happens that the very same tastes and tendencies which are called forth and gratified by the splendid appliances of so-called religious worship, would find most suited aliment at the opera or in the concert room.<a name=38:688></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this has to be watched against by those who desire to remember that "God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.<a name=38:689></a>" (John 4) Religion, so called, is, at this moment, decking herself with her most powerful charms.<a name=38:690></a> Casting off the grossness of the middle ages, she is calling to her aid all the resources of refined taste, and of a cultivated and enlightened age.<a name=38:691></a> Sculpture, music, and painting, are pouring their rich treasures into her lap, in order that she may, therewith, prepare a powerful opiate to lull the thoughtless multitude into a slumber, which shall only be broken in upon by the unutterable horrors of death, judgement, and the lake of fire.<a name=38:692></a> She, too, can say, "I have <i>peace offerings</i> with me; this day have I paid my <i>vows</i> .<a name=38:693></a>.<a name=38:694></a>.<a name=38:695></a> .<a name=38:696></a>.<a name=38:697></a>.<a name=38:698></a> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.<a name=38:699></a> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<a name=38:700></a>" (Proverbs 7) Thus does corrupt religion allure, by her powerful influence, those who will not hearken to wisdom's heavenly voice.<a name=38:701></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, beware of all this.<a name=38:702></a> See that your worship stands inseparably connected with the work of the cross.<a name=38:703></a> See that Christ is the ground, Christ the material, and the Holy Ghost the power of your worship.<a name=38:704></a> Take care that your outward act of worship does not stretch itself beyond the inward power.<a name=38:705></a> It demands much watchfulness to keep clear of this evil.<a name=38:706></a> Its incipient workings are most difficult to be detected and counteracted.<a name=38:707></a> We may commence a hymn in the true spirit of worship, and, through lack of spiritual power, we may, ere we reach the close, fall into the evil which answers to the ceremonial act of eating the flesh of the peace offering on the third day.<a name=38:708></a> Our only security is in keeping close to Jesus.<a name=38:709></a> If we lift up our hearts in "thanksgiving," for some special mercy, let us do so in the power of the name and sacrifice of Christ.<a name=38:710></a> If our souls go forth in "voluntary" worship, let it be in the energy of the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:711></a> In this way shall our worship exhibit that freshness, that fragrance, that depth of tone, that moral elevation, which must result from having the Father as the object, the Son as the ground, and the Holy Ghost as the power of our worship.<a name=38:712></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having Considered the "sweet savour" Offerings, We now approach the "sacrifices for sin.<a name=38:728></a>" These were divided into two classes, namely, sin offerings and trespass offerings.<a name=38:729></a> Of the former, there were three grades; first, the offering for "the priest that is anointed," and for "the whole congregation.<a name=38:730></a>" These two were the same in their rites and ceremonies.<a name=38:731></a> (Compare.<a name=38:732></a> verse 3-12, with verse 13-21) It was the same in result, whether it were the representative of the assembly, or the assembly itself, that sinned.<a name=38:733></a> In either case there were three things involved: God's dwelling-place in the assembly, the worship of the assembly, and individual conscience.<a name=38:734></a> Now, inasmuch as all three depended upon the blood, we find, in the first grade of sin offering, there were three things done with the blood.<a name=38:735></a> It was sprinkled "seven times before the Lord, <i>before the veil of the sanctuary</i>.<a name=38:736></a>" This secured Jehovah's relationship with the people, and His dwelling in their midst.<a name=38:737></a> Again, we read, "The priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=38:738></a>" This secured the worship of the assembly.<a name=38:739></a> By putting the blood upon "the golden altar," the true basis of worship was preserved; so that the flame of the incense and the fragrance thereof might continually ascend.<a name=38:740></a> Finally, "He shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=38:741></a>" Here we have the claims of individual conscience fully answered; for the brazen altar was the place of individual approach.<a name=38:742></a> It was the place where God met the sinner.<a name=38:743></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the two remaining grades, for "a ruler" or "one of the common people: it was merely a question of individual conscience; and, therefore, there was only one thing done with the blood.<a name=38:744></a> It was all poured "at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.<a name=38:745></a>" (Comp.<a name=38:746></a> verse 7 with verse 25, 30) There is divine precision in all this, which demands the close attention of my reader, if only he desires to enter into the marvellous detail of this type.<a name=38:747></a><a href="#38:f6"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f6"><sup>++++++</sup></a>There is this difference between the offering for "a ruler," and for "one of the common people:" in the former, it was "a male without blemish;" in the latter, "a female without blemish." The sin of a ruler would, necessarily, exert a wider influence than that of a common person; and, therefore, a more powerful application of the value of the blood was needed. In Leviticus 5: 13, we find cases demanding a still lower application of the sin offering -- cases of swearing and of touching any uncleanness, in which "the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour "was admitted as a sin offering. (See Leviticus 5: 11-13) What a contrast between the view of atonement presented by a ruler's bullock, and a poor man's handful of flour! And yet, in the latter, just as truly as in the former, we read, "it shall be forgiven him." <p>The reader will observe that Leviticus 5: 1-13, forms a part of Leviticus 6. Both are comprehended under one head, and present the doctrine of sin offering, in all its applications, from the bullock to the handful of flour. Each class of offering is introduced by the words, "And the Lord spake unto Moses." Thus, for example, the sweet savour offerings (Leviticus 1 - 3) are introduced by the words, "The Lord called unto Moses." These words are not repeated until Leviticus 4: 1, where they introduce the sin offering. They occur again at Leviticus 5: 14, where they introduce the trespass offering for wrongs done "in the holy things of the Lord;" and again at Leviticus 6: 1, where they introduce the trespass offering for wrong done to one's neighbour. <p>This classification is beautifully simple, and will help the reader to understand the different classes: of offering. As to the different grades in each class, whether "a bullock," "a ram," "a female," "a bird," "or "a handful of flour: they would seem to be so many varied applications of the same grand truth.

		Having said thus much as to the three grades of sin offering, we shall proceed to examine, in detail, the principles unfolded in the first of these.<a name=38:760></a> In so doing, we shall be able to form, in some measure, a just conception of the principles of all.<a name=38:761></a> Before, however entering upon the direct comparison already proposed, I would call my reader's attention to a very prominent point set forth in the second verse of this fourth chapter.<a name=38:762></a> It is contained in the expression," If a soul shall sin through <i>ignorance</i>.<a name=38:763></a>" This presents a truth of the deepest blessedness, in connection with the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:764></a> In contemplating that atonement, we see infinitely more than the mere satisfaction of the claims of conscience, even though that conscience had reached the highest point of refined sensibility.<a name=38:765></a> It is our privilege to see, therein, that which has fully satisfied all the claims of divine holiness, divine justice, and divine majesty.<a name=38:766></a> The holiness of God's dwelling-place, and the ground of His association with His people, could never be regulated by the standard of man's conscience, no matter how high the standard might be.<a name=38:767></a> There are many things which man's conscience would pass over -- many things which might escape man's cognisance -- many things which his heart might deem all right, which God could not tolerate; and which, as a consequence, would interfere with man's approach to, his worship of, and his relationship with, God.<a name=38:768></a> Wherefore, if the atonement of Christ merely made provision for such sins as come within the compass of man's apprehension, we should find ourselves very far short of the true ground of peace.<a name=38:769></a> We need to understand that sin has been atoned for, according to God's measurement thereof-that the claims of His throne have been perfectly answered -- that sin, as seen in the light of His inflexible holiness, has been divinely judged.<a name=38:770></a> This is what gives settled peace to the soul.<a name=38:771></a> A full atonement has been made for the believer's sins of ignorance, as well as for his known sins.<a name=38:772></a> The sacrifice of Christ lays the foundation of his relationship and fellowship with God, according; to the divine estimate of the claims thereof.<a name=38:773></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A clear sense of this is of unspeakable value.<a name=38:774></a> Unless this feature of the atonement be laid hold of, there cannot be settled peace; nor can there be any just moral sense of the extent and fullness of the work of Christ, or of the true nature of the relationship founded thereon.<a name=38:775></a> God knew what was needed in order that man might be in His presence without a single misgiving; and He has made ample provision for it in the cross.<a name=38:776></a> Fellowship between God and man were utterly impossible if sin had not been disposed of, according to God's thoughts about it: for, albeit man's conscience were satisfied, the question would ever be suggesting itself, Has God been satisfied If this question could not be answered in the affirmative, fellowship could never subsist.<a name=38:777></a><a href="#38:f7"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++</sup></a> The thought would be continually intruding itself upon the heart, that things were manifesting themselves in the details of life, which divine holiness could not tolerate.<a name=38:778></a> True, we might be doing such things "through ignorance but this could not alter the matter before God, inasmuch as all is known to Him.<a name=38:779></a> Hence, there would be continual apprehension, doubt, and misgiving.<a name=38:780></a> All these things are divinely met by the fact that sin has been atoned for, not according to our "ignorance," but according to God's knowledge.<a name=38:781></a> The assurance of this gives great rest to the heart and conscience.<a name=38:782></a> All God's claims have been answered by His own work.<a name=38:783></a> He Himself has made the provision; and, therefore, the more refined the believer's conscience becomes, under the combined action of the word and Spirit of God, the more he grows in a divinely-adjusted sense of all that morally befits the sanctuary -- the more keenly alive he becomes to every thing which is unsuited to the divine presence, the fuller, clearer, deeper, and more vigorous will be his apprehension of the infinite value of that sin offering which has not only travelled beyond the utmost bounds of human conscience, but also met, in absolute perfection, all the requirements of divine holiness.<a name=38:784></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f7"><sup>+++++++</sup></a>I would desire it to be particularly remembered, that the point before us in the text is simply atonement. The Christian reader is fully aware, I doubt not, that the possession of "the divine nature, is essential to fellowship with God. I not only need a title to approach God: but a nature to enjoy Him. The soul that "believes in the name of the only-begotten Son of God" has both the one and the other (see John 12, John 13; John 3: 36; John 5: 24; John 20: 31; 1 John 5: 11-13).

		We shall now proceed to compare the sin offering with the burnt offering, in doing which, we shall find two very different aspects of Christ.<a name=38:804></a> But, although the aspects are different, it is one and the same Christ; and, hence, the sacrifice, in each case, was "without blemish.<a name=38:805></a>" This is easily understood.<a name=38:806></a> It matters not in what aspect we contemplate the Lord Jesus Christ, He must ever be seen as the same pure, spotless, holy, perfect One.<a name=38:807></a> True, He did, in His abounding grace, stoop to be the sin-bearer of His people; but it was a perfect, spotless Christ who did so; and it would be nothing short of diabolical wickedness to take occasion, from the depth of His humiliation, to tarnish the personal glory of the humbled One.<a name=38:808></a> The intrinsic excellence, the unsullied purity, and the divine glory of our blessed Lord appear in the sin offering, as fully as in the burnt offering.<a name=38:809></a> It matters not in what relationship He stands, what office He fills, what work He performs, what position He occupies, His personal glories shine out, in all their divine effulgence.<a name=38:810></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth of one and the same Christ, whether in the burnt offering, or in the sin offering, is seen, not only in the fact that, in each case, the offering was "without blemish," but, also, in "the Law of the sin offering," where we read, "this is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord: it is most holy.<a name=38:811></a>" (Leviticus 6: 25) Both types point to one and the same great Antitype, though they present Him in such contrasted aspects of His work.<a name=38:812></a> In the burnt offering, Christ is seen meeting the divine affections; in the sin offering, He is seen meeting the depths of human need.<a name=38:813></a> That presents Him to us as the Accomplisher of the will of God; this, as the Bearer of the sin of man.<a name=38:814></a> In the former, we are taught the preciousness of the sacrifice; in the latter, the hatefulness of sin.<a name=38:815></a> Thus much, as to the two offerings, in the main.<a name=38:816></a> The most minute examination of the details will only tend to establish the mind in the truth of this general statement.<a name=38:817></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, when considering the burnt offering, we observed that it was a voluntary offering.<a name=38:818></a> "He shall offer it of his own voluntary will.<a name=38:819></a>"<a href="#38:f8"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++++</sup></a> Now, the word "voluntary" does not occur in the sin offering.<a name=38:820></a> This is precisely what we might expect.<a name=38:821></a> It is in full keeping with the specific object of the Holy Ghost, in the burnt offering, to set it forth as a free-will offering.<a name=38:822></a> It was Christ's meat and drink to do the will of God, whatever that will might be.<a name=38:823></a> He never thought of inquiring what ingredients were in the cup which the Father was putting into His hand.<a name=38:824></a> It was quite sufficient for Him that the Father had mingled it.<a name=38:825></a> Thus it was with the Lord Jesus as foreshadowed by the burnt offering.<a name=38:826></a> But, in the sin offering, we have quite a different line of truth unfolded.<a name=38:827></a> This type introduces Christ to our thoughts, not as the "voluntary" Accomplisher of the will of God, but as the Bearer of that terrible thing called "sin," and the Endurer of all its appalling consequences, of which the most appalling, to Him, was the hiding of God's countenance.<a name=38:828></a> Hence, the word "voluntary" would not harmonise with the object of the Spirit, in the sin offering.<a name=38:829></a> It would be as completely out of place, in that type, as it is divinely in place, in the burnt offering.<a name=38:830></a> Its presence and its absence are alike divine; and both alike exhibit the perfect, the divine precision of the types of Leviticus.<a name=38:831></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f8"><sup>++++++++</sup></a>some may find difficulty in the fact that the word "voluntary" has reference to the worshipper and not to the sacrifice; but this can, in no wise, affect the doctrine put forward in the text, which is founded upon the fact that a special word used in the burnt offering is omitted in the sin offering. The contrast holds good, whether we think of the offerer or the offering.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the point of contrast which we have been considering, explains, or rather harmonises, two expressions used by our Lord.<a name=38:832></a> He says, on one occasion, "the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=38:833></a>" And, again, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.<a name=38:834></a>" The former of these expressions was the full carrying out of the words with which He entered upon His course, namely, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God;" and, moreover, it is the utterance of Christ, as the burnt offering.<a name=38:835></a> The latter, on the other hand, is the utterance of Christ, when contemplating the place which He was about to occupy, as the sin offering.<a name=38:836></a> What that place was, and what was involved to Him, in taking it, we shall see, as we proceed; but it is interesting and instructive to find the entire doctrine of the two offerings involved, as it were, in the fact that a single word introduced in the one is omitted in the other.<a name=38:837></a> If, in the burnt offering, we find the perfect readiness of heart with which Christ offered Himself for the accomplishment of the will of God; then, in the sin offering, we find how perfectly He entered into all the consequences of man's sin, and how He travelled into the most remote distance of man's position as regards God.<a name=38:838></a> He delighted to do the will of God; He shrank from losing, for a moment, the light of His blessed countenance.<a name=38:839></a> No one offering could have foreshadowed Him in both these phases.<a name=38:840></a> We needed a type to present Him to us as One delighting to do the will of God; and we needed a type to present Him to us as One whose holy nature shrank from the consequences of imputed sin.<a name=38:841></a> Blessed be God, we have both.<a name=38:842></a> The burnt offering furnishes the one, the sin offering the other.<a name=38:843></a> Wherefore, the more fully we enter into the devotion of Christ's heart to God, the more fully we shall apprehend His abhorrence of sin; and <i>vice versa</i>.<a name=38:844></a> Each throws the other into relief; end the use of the word "voluntary" in the one, and not in the other, fixes the leading import of each.<a name=38:845></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, it may be said, "Was it not the will of God that Christ should offer Himself as an atonement for sin?<a name=38:846></a> And, if so, how could there be ought of shrinking from the accomplishment of that will?<a name=38:847></a>" Assuredly, it was "the determinate counsel" of God that Christ should suffer; and, moreover, it was Christ's joy to do the will of God.<a name=38:848></a> But how are we to understand the expression, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me?<a name=38:849></a>" Is it not the utterance of Christ?<a name=38:850></a> And is there no express type of the Utterer thereof?<a name=38:851></a> Unquestionably There would be a serious blank among the types of the Mosaic economy, were there not one to reflect the Lord Jesus in the exact attitude in which the above expression presents Him.<a name=38:852></a> But the burnt offering does not thus reflect Him.<a name=38:853></a> There is not a single circumstance connected with that offering which would correspond with such language.<a name=38:854></a> The sin offering alone furnishes the fitting type of the Lord Jesus as the One who poured forth those accents of intense agony, for in it alone do we find the circumstances which evoked such accents from the depths of His spotless soul.<a name=38:855></a> The awful shadow of the cross, with its shame, its curse, and its exclusion from the light of God's countenance, was passing across His spirit, and He could not even contemplate it without an "If it be possible let this cup pass from me.<a name=38:856></a>" But, no sooner had He uttered these words, than His profound subjection manifests itself in, "thy Will be done.<a name=38:857></a>" What a bitter cup" it must have been to elicit, from a perfectly subject heart, the words," let it pass from me!<a name=38:858></a>" What perfect subjection there must have been when, in the presence of so bitter a cup, the heart could breathe forth," thy will be done!<a name=38:859></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now consider the, typical act of "laying on of hands.<a name=38:860></a>" This act was common both to the burnt offering and the sin offering; but, in the case of the former, it identified the offerer with an unblemished offering in the case of the latter, it involved the transfer of the sin of the offerer to the head of the offering.<a name=38:861></a> Thus it was in the type; and, when we look at the Antitype, we learn a truth of the most comforting and edifying nature -- a truth which, were it more clearly understood, and fully experienced, would impart a far more settled peace than is ordinarily possessed.<a name=38:862></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, then, is the doctrine set forth in the laying on of hands?<a name=38:863></a> It is this: Christ was "made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=38:864></a>" (2 Corinthians 5) He took our position with all its consequences, in order that we might get His position with all its consequences.<a name=38:865></a> He was treated as sin, upon the cross, that we might be treated as righteousness, in the presence of infinite Holiness.<a name=38:866></a> He was cast out of God's presence because He had sin upon Him, by imputation, that we might be received into God's house and into His bosom, because we have a perfect righteousness by imputation.<a name=38:867></a> He had to endure the hiding of God's countenance, that we might bask in the light of that countenance.<a name=38:868></a> He had to pass through three hours' darkness, that we might walk in everlasting light.<a name=38:869></a> He was forsaken of God, for a time, that we might enjoy His presence for ever.<a name=38:870></a> all that was due to us, as ruined sinners, was laid upon Him, in order that all that was due to Him, as the Accomplisher of redemption, might be ours.<a name=38:871></a> There was everything against Him When He hung upon the cursed tree, in order that there might be nothing against us He was identified with us, in the reality of death and judgement, in order that we might be identified with Him, in the reality of life and righteousness.<a name=38:872></a> He drank the cup of wrath, -- the cup of trembling, that we might drink the cup of salvation -- the cup of infinite favour.<a name=38:873></a> He was treated according to our deserts, that we might be treated according to His.<a name=38:874></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the wondrous truth illustrated by the ceremonial act of imposition of hands.<a name=38:875></a> When the worshipper had laid his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, it ceased to be a question as to what he was, or what he deserved, and became entirely a question of what the offering was in the judgement of Jehovah.<a name=38:876></a> If the offering was without blemish, so was the offerer; if the offering was accepted, so was the offerer.<a name=38:877></a> They are perfectly identified.<a name=38:878></a> The act of laying on of hands constituted them one, in God's view.<a name=38:879></a> He looked at the offerer through the medium of the offering.<a name=38:880></a> Thus it was, in the case of the burnt offering.<a name=38:881></a> But, in the sin offering, when the offerer had laid his hand upon the head of the offering, it became a question of what the offerer was, and what he deserved.<a name=38:882></a> The offering was treated according to the deserts of the offerer.<a name=38:883></a> They were perfectly identified.<a name=38:884></a> The act of laying on of hands constituted them one, in the judgement of God.<a name=38:885></a> The sin of the offerer was dealt with in the sin offering; the person of the offerer: was accepted in the burnt offering.<a name=38:886></a> This made a vast difference.<a name=38:887></a> Hence, though the act of laying on of hands was common to both types, and, moreover, though it was expressive, in the case of each, of identification, yet here the consequences as different as possible.<a name=38:888></a> The just treated as the unjust; the unjust accepted in the just.<a name=38:889></a> "Christ hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.<a name=38:890></a>" This is the doctrine.<a name=38:891></a> Our sins brought Christ to the cross; but He brings us to God.<a name=38:892></a> And, if He brings us to God, it is in His own acceptableness, as risen from the dead, having put away our sins, according to the perfectness of His own work.<a name=38:893></a> He bore away our sins far from the sanctuary of God, in order that He might bring us nigh, even into the holiest of all, in full confidence of heart, having the conscience purged by His precious blood from every stain of sin.<a name=38:894></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the more minutely we compare all the details of the burnt offering and the sin offering, the more clearly shall we apprehend the truth of what has been above stated, in reference to the laying on of hands, and the results thereof, in each case.<a name=38:895></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first chapter of this volume, we noticed the fact that "the sons of Aaron" are introduced in the burnt offering, but not in the sin offering.<a name=38:896></a> As priests they were privileged to stand around the altar, and behold the flame of an acceptable sacrifice ascending to the Lord.<a name=38:897></a> But in the sin offering, in its primary aspect, it was a question of the solemn judgement of sin, and not of priestly worship or admiration; and, therefore, the sons of Aaron do not appear.<a name=38:898></a> It is as convicted sinners that we have to do with Christ, as the Antitype of the sin offering.<a name=38:899></a> It is as worshipping priests, clothed in garments of salvation, that we contemplate Christ, as the Antitype of the burnt offering.<a name=38:900></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, my reader may observe that the burnt offering was "flayed," the sin offering was not.<a name=38:901></a> The burnt offerings was "cut into his pieces," the sin offering was not.<a name=38:902></a> "The inwards and the legs" of the burnt offering were "washed in water," which act was entirely omitted in the sin offering.<a name=38:903></a> Lastly, the burnt offering was burnt upon the altar, the sin offering was burnt without the camp.<a name=38:904></a> These are weighty points of difference arising simply out of the distinctive character of the offerings.<a name=38:905></a> We know there is nothing in the word of God without its own special meaning; and every intelligent and careful student of Scripture will notice the above points of difference; and, when he notices them, he will, naturally, seek to ascertain their real import.<a name=38:906></a> <i>Ignorance</i> of this import there may be; but <i>indifference</i> to it there should not.<a name=38:907></a> In any section of inspiration, but especially one so rich as that which lies before us, to pass over a single point, would be to offer dishonour to the Divine Author, and to deprive our own souls of much profit.<a name=38:908></a> We should hang over the most minute details, either to adore God's wisdom in them, or to confess our own ignorance of them.<a name=38:909></a> To pass them by, in a spirit of indifference, is to imply that the Holy Ghost has taken the trouble to write what we do not deem worthy of the desire to understand.<a name=38:910></a> This is what no right-minded Christian would presume to think.<a name=38:911></a> If the Spirit, in writing upon the ordinance of the sin offering, has omitted the various rites above alluded to -- rites which get a prominent place in the ordinance of the burnt offering, there must, assuredly, be some good reason for, and some important meaning in, His doing so.<a name=38:912></a> These we would seek to apprehend; and, no doubt, they arise out of the special design of the divine mind in each offering.<a name=38:913></a> The sin offering sets forth that aspect of Christ's work in which He is seen taking, judicially, the place which belonged to us morally.<a name=38:914></a> For this reason we could not look for that intense expression of what He was, in all His secret springs of action, as unfolded in the typical act of "flaying.<a name=38:915></a>" Neither could there be that enlarged exhibition of what He was, not merely as a whole, but in the most minute features of His character, as seen in the act of "cutting it into his pieces.<a name=38:916></a>" Nor, yet, could there be that manifestation of what He was, personally, practically, and intrinsically, as set forth in the significant act of "washing the inwards and legs in water.<a name=38:917></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things belonged to the burnt-offering phase of our blessed Lord, and to that alone, because, in it, we see Him offering Himself to the eye, to the heart, and to the altar of Jehovah, without any question of imputed sin, of wrath, or of judgement.<a name=38:918></a> In the sin offering, on the contrary, instead of having, as the great prominent idea, what Christ is, we have what sin is.<a name=38:919></a> Instead of the preciousness of Jesus, we have the odiousness of sin.<a name=38:920></a> In the burnt offering, inasmuch as it is Christ Himself offered to, and accepted by, God, we have every thing done that could possibly make manifest what He was, in every respect.<a name=38:921></a> In the sin offering, because it is sin, as judged By God, the very reverse is the case.<a name=38:922></a> All this is so plain as to need no effort of the mind to understand it.<a name=38:923></a> It naturally flows out of the distinctive character of the type.<a name=38:924></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, although the leading object in the sin offering, is to shadow forth what Christ became for as, and not what He was in Himself; there is, nevertheless, one rite connected with this type, which most fully expresses His personal acceptableness to Jehovah.<a name=38:925></a> This rite is laid down in the following words, "And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offering; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.<a name=38:926></a>" (Leviticus 4: 8-10) Thus, the intrinsic excellency of Christ is not omitted, even in the sin-offering.<a name=38:927></a> The fat burnt upon the altar is the apt expression of the divine appreciation of the preciousness of Christ's Person, no matter what place He might, in perfect grace, take, on our behalf or in our stead; He was made sin for us, and the sin offering is the divinely-appointed shadow of Him, in this respect.<a name=38:928></a> But, inasmuch as it was the Lord Jesus Christ, God's elect, His Holy One, His pure, His spotless, His eternal Son that was made sin, therefore the fat of the sin offering was burnt upon the altar, as a proper material for that fire which was the impressive exhibition of divine holiness.<a name=38:929></a>

		But, even in this very point, we see what a contrast there is between the sin offering and the burnt offering.<a name=38:930></a> In the case of the latter, it was not merely the fat, but the whole sacrifice that was burnt upon the altar, because it was Christ, without any question of sin-bearing whatever.<a name=38:931></a> in the case of the former, there was nothing but the fat to be burnt upon the altar, because it was a question of sin-bearing, though Christ was the sin bearer.<a name=38:932></a> The divine glories of Christ's Person shine out, even from amid the darkest shades of that cursed tree to which He consented to be nailed as a curse for us.<a name=38:933></a> the hatefulness of that with which, in the exercise of divine love, He connected His blessed Person, on the cross, could not prevent the sweet odour of His preciousness from ascending to the throne of God.<a name=38:934></a> Thus, have we unfolded to us the profound mystery of God's face hidden from that which Christ became, and God's heart refreshed by what Christ was.<a name=38:935></a> This imparts a peculiar charm to the sin offering.<a name=38:936></a> The bright beams of Christ's Personal glory shining out from amid the awful gloom of Calvary -- His Personal worth set forth, in the very deepest depths of His humiliation -- God's delight in the One from whom He had, in vindication of His inflexible justice and holiness, to hide His face -- all this is set forth in the fact that the fat of the sin offering was burnt upon the altar.<a name=38:937></a>

		Having, thus, endeavoured to point out, in the first place, what was done with "the blood;" and, in the second place, what was done with "the fat;" we have, now, to consider what was done with "the flesh.<a name=38:938></a>" "And the skin of the bullock, and <i>all his flesh</i>.<a name=38:939></a>.<a name=38:940></a> even <i>the whole bullock</i> shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him On the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.<a name=38:941></a>" (verse 11, 12) In this act, we have the main feature of the sin offering-that which distinguished it both from the burnt offering and the peace offering.<a name=38:942></a> Its flesh was not burnt upon the altar, as in the burnt offering; neither was it eaten by the priest or the worshipper, as in the peace offering.<a name=38:943></a> It was wholly burnt without the camp.<a name=38:944></a><a href="#38:f9"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++</sup></a> "No sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation, to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.<a name=38:945></a>" (Leviticus 6: 30) "For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought unto the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.<a name=38:946></a> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.<a name=38:947></a>" (Hebrews 13: 11, 12)

		Now, in comparing what was done with the "blood" with what was done with the "flesh" or "body" of the sacrifice, two great branches of truth present themselves to our view, namely, worship and discipleship.<a name=38:948></a> The blood brought into the sanctuary is the foundation of the former.<a name=38:949></a> The body burnt outside the camp is the foundation of the latter.<a name=38:950></a> Before ever we can worship, in Peace of conscience, and liberty of heart, we must know, on the authority of the word, and by the power of the Spirit, that the entire question of <i>sin</i> has been for ever settled by the blood of the divine sin offering-that His blood has been sprinkled, perfectly, before the Lord -- that all God's claims, and all our necessities, as ruined and guilty sinners, have been, for ever, answered.<a name=38:951></a> This gives perfect peace; and, in the enjoyment of this peace, we worship God.<a name=38:952></a> When an Israelite, of old, had offered his sin offering, his conscience was set at rest, in so far as the offering was capable of imparting rest.<a name=38:953></a> True, it was but a temporary rest, being the fruit of a temporary sacrifice.<a name=38:954></a> But, clearly, whatever kind of rest the offering was fitted to impart, that the offerer might enjoy.<a name=38:955></a> Hence, therefore, our Sacrifice being divine and eternal, our rest is divine and eternal also.<a name=38:956></a> As is the sacrifice such is the rest which is founded thereon.<a name=38:957></a> A Jew never had an eternally purged conscience, simply because he had not an eternally efficacious sacrifice.<a name=38:958></a> He might in a certain way, have his conscience purged for a day, a month, or a year; but he could not have it purged for ever.<a name=38:959></a> "But Christ being come, an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained <i>eternal</i> redemption.<a name=38:960></a> For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<a name=38:961></a>" (Hebrews 11: 11-14).<a name=38:962></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, we have the full, explicit statement of the doctrine.<a name=38:963></a> The blood of goats and calves procured a temporary redemption; the blood of Christ procures eternal redemption.<a name=38:964></a> The former purified outwardly; the latter, inwardly.<a name=38:965></a> that purged the flesh, for a time; this, the conscience, for ever.<a name=38:966></a> The whole question hinges, not upon the character or condition of the offerer, but upon the value of the offering.<a name=38:967></a> The question is not, by any means, whether a Christian is a better man than a Jew, but whether the blood of Christ is better than the blood of a bullock.<a name=38:968></a> Assuredly, it is better.<a name=38:969></a> How much better?<a name=38:970></a> Infinitely better.<a name=38:971></a> The Son of God imparts all the dignity of His own divine Person to the sacrifice which He offered; and, if the blood of a bullock purified the flesh for a year, "how much more" shall the blood of the Son of God purge the conscience for ever?<a name=38:972></a> If that took away <i>some</i> sin, how much more shall this take away "<i>all</i>?<a name=38:973></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, why was the mind of a Jew set at rest, for the time being, when he had offered his sin offering?<a name=38:974></a> How did he know that the special sin for which he had brought his sacrifice was forgiven?<a name=38:975></a> Because God had said, "it shall be forgiven him.<a name=38:976></a>" His peace of heart, in reference to that particular sin, rested upon the testimony of the God of Israel, and the blood of the victim.<a name=38:977></a> So, now, the peace of the believer, in reference to "all SIN," rests upon the authority of God's word, and "the precious blood of Christ.<a name=38:978></a>" If a Jew had sinned, and neglected to bring his sin offering, he should have been "Cut Off from among his people;" but when he took his place as a sinner -- when he laid his hand upon the head of a sin offering, then, the offering was "Cut Off" instead of him, and he was free, so far.<a name=38:979></a> The offering was treated as the offerer deserved; and, hence, for him not to know that his sin was forgiven him, would have been to make God a liar, and to treat the blood of the divinely-appointed sin offering as nothing.<a name=38:980></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, if this were true, in reference to one who had only the blood of a goat to rest upon, "how much more" powerfully does it apply to one, who has the precious blood of Christ to rest upon?<a name=38:981></a> The believer sees in Christ One who has been judged for all his sin -- One who, when He hung upon the cross, sustained the entire burden of his sin -- One who, having made Himself responsible for that sin, could not be where He now is, if the whole question of sin had not been settled, according to all the claims of infinite justice.<a name=38:982></a> So absolutely did Christ take the believer's place on the cross -- so entirely was he identified with Him -- so completely was all the believer's sin imputed to Him, there and then, that all question of the believer's liability -- all thought of his guilt all idea of his exposure to judgement and wrath, is eternally set aside.<a name=38:983></a><a href="#38:f10"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++++++</sup></a> It was all settled on the cursed tree, between Divine Justice and the Spotless Victim.<a name=38:984></a> And now the believer is as absolutely identified with Christ, on the throne, as Christ was identified with him on the tree.<a name=38:985></a> Justice has no charge to bring against the believer, because it has no charge to bring against Christ.<a name=38:986></a> Thus it stands for ever.<a name=38:987></a> If a charge could be preferred against the believer, it would be calling in question the reality of Christ's identification with him, on the cross, and the perfectness of Christ's work, on his behalf.<a name=38:988></a> If, when the worshipper, of old, was on his way back, after having offered his sin offering, any one had charged him with that special sin for which his sacrifice had bled, what would have been His reply?<a name=38:989></a> Just this: "the sin has been rolled away, by the blood of the victim, and Jehovah has pronounced the words, 'It shall be forgiven him.<a name=38:990></a>'" The victim had died instead of him; and he lived instead of the victim.<a name=38:991></a>

		Such was the type.<a name=38:992></a> And, as to the Antitype, when the eye of faith rests on Christ as the sin offering, it beholds Him as One who, having assumed a Perfect human life, gave up that life on the cross, because sin was, there and then, attached to it by imputation.<a name=38:993></a> But, it beholds Him, also, As One who, having, in Himself, the power of divine and eternal life, rose from the tomb therein, and who now imparts this, His risen, His divine, His eternal life to all who believe in His name.<a name=38:994></a> The sin is gone, because the life to which it was attached is gone, and now, instead of the life to which sin was attached, all true believers possess the life to which righteousness attaches.<a name=38:995></a> The question of sin can never once be raised, in reference to the risen and victorious life of Christ; but this is the life which believers possess.<a name=38:996></a> There is no other life.<a name=38:997></a> All beside is death, because all beside is under the power of sin.<a name=38:998></a> "He that hath the Son hath life;" and he that hath life, hath righteousness also.<a name=38:999></a> The two things are inseparable, because Christ is both the one and the other.<a name=38:1000></a> If the judgement and death of Christ, upon the cross, were realities, then, the life and righteousness of the believer are realities.<a name=38:1001></a> If imputed sin was a reality to Christ, imputed righteousness is a reality to the believer.<a name=38:1002></a> The one is as real as the other; for, if not, Christ would have died in vain.<a name=38:1003></a> The true and irrefragable ground of peace is this -- that the claims of God's nature have been perfectly met, as to sin.<a name=38:1004></a> The death of Jesus has satisfied them all -- satisfied them of the awakened conscience?<a name=38:1005></a> The great fact of resurrection.<a name=38:1006></a> A risen Christ declares the full deliverance of the believer -- his perfect discharge from every possible demand.<a name=38:1007></a> "He was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification" (Romans 4: 25) For a Christian not to know that his sin is gone, and gone for ever, is to cast slight upon the blood of his divine sin offering.<a name=38:1008></a> It is to deny that there has been the perfect presentation -- the sevenfold sprinkling of the blood before the Lord.<a name=38:1009></a>

		And now, ere turning from this fundamental point which has been occupying us, I would desire to make an earnest and a most solemn appeal to my reader's heart and conscience Let me ask you, dear friend, have you been led to repose on this holy and happy foundation?<a name=38:1010></a> Do you know that the question of your sin has been for ever disposed of?<a name=38:1011></a> Have you laid your hand, by faith, on the head of the sin offering?<a name=38:1012></a> Have you seen the atoning blood of Jesus rolling away all your guilt, and carrying it into the mighty waters of God's forgetfulness?<a name=38:1013></a> Has Divine Justice anything against you?<a name=38:1014></a> Are you free from the unutterable horrors of a guilty conscience?<a name=38:1015></a> Do not, I pray you, rest satisfied until you can give a joyous answer to these enquiries.<a name=38:1016></a> Be assured of it, it is the happy privilege of the feeblest babe in Christ to rejoice in full and everlasting remission of sins, on the ground of finished atonement; and, hence, for any to teach otherwise, is to lower the sacrifice of Christ to the level of "goats and calves.<a name=38:1017></a>" If we cannot know that our sins are forgiven, then, where are the good tidings of the gospel?<a name=38:1018></a> Is a Christian in no wise better off in the matter of a sin offering, than a Jew?<a name=38:1019></a> The latter was privileged to know that his matters were set straight for a year, by the blood of an annual sacrifice.<a name=38:1020></a> Can the former not have any certainty at all?<a name=38:1021></a> Unquestionably.<a name=38:1022></a> Well, then, if there is any certainty, it must be eternal, inasmuch as it rests on an eternal sacrifice.<a name=38:1023></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, and this alone, is the basis of worship.<a name=38:1024></a> The full assurance of sin put away, ministers, not to a spirit of self-confidence, but to a spirit of promise, thankfulness, and worship.<a name=38:1025></a> It produces, not a spirit of self-complacency, but of Christ-complacency, which, blessed be God, is the spirit which shall characterise the redeemed throughout eternity.<a name=38:1026></a> It does not lead one to think little of sin, but to think much of the grace which has perfectly pardoned it, and of the blood which has perfectly cancelled it.<a name=38:1027></a> It is impossible that any one can gaze on the cross -- can see the place which Christ took -- can meditate upon the sufferings which He endured -- can ponder on those three terrible hours of darkness, and, at the same time, think lightly of sin.<a name=38:1028></a> When all these things are entered into, in the power of the Holy Ghost, there are two results which must follow, namely, an abhorrence of sin, in all its forms, and a genuine love to Christ, His people, and His cause.<a name=38:1029></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now consider what was done with the "flesh" or "body" of the sacrifice, in which, as has been stated, we have the true ground of discipleship.<a name=38:1030></a> "The whole bullock shall he carry forth, <i>without the camp</i>, unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire.<a name=38:1031></a>" (Leviticus 4: 12) This act is to be viewed in a double way; first, as expressing the place which the Lord Jesus took for us, as bearing sin; secondly, as expressing the place into which He was cast, by a world which had rejected Him.<a name=38:1032></a> It is to this latter point that I would here call my reader's attention.<a name=38:1033></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The use which the apostle, in Hebrews 13, makes of Christ's having "suffered without the gate," is deeply practical.<a name=38:1034></a> "Let us go forth, therefore, <i>unto him</i>, without the camp, <i>bearing his reproach</i>.<a name=38:1035></a>" If the sufferings of Christ have secured us an entrance into heaven, the place where He suffered expresses our rejection from earth.<a name=38:1036></a> His death has procured us a city on high; the place where He died divests us of a city below.<a name=38:1037></a><a href="#38:f11"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++++</sup></a> "He suffered without the gate," and, in so doing, He set aside Jerusalem as the present centre of divine operation.<a name=38:1038></a> There is no such thing, now, as a consecrated spot on the earth.<a name=38:1039></a> Christ has taken His place, as a suffering One, outside the range of this world's religion -- its politics, and all that pertains to it.<a name=38:1040></a> The world hated Him, and cast Him out.<a name=38:1041></a> Wherefore, the word is, "<i>go forth</i>.<a name=38:1042></a>" This is the motto, as regards every thing that men would set up here, in the form of a "camp," no matter what that camp may be.<a name=38:1043></a> If men set up "a holy city," you must look for a rejected Christ "without the gate.<a name=38:1044></a>" If men set up a religious camp, call it by what name you please, you must "go forth" out of it, in order to find a rejected Christ.<a name=38:1045></a> It is not that blind superstition will not grope amid the ruins of Jerusalem, in search of relics of Christ.<a name=38:1046></a> It assuredly will do so, and has done so.<a name=38:1047></a> It will affect to find out, and do honour to, the site of His cross, and to His sepulchre.<a name=38:1048></a> Nature's covetousness, too, taking advantage of nature's superstition, has carried on, for ages, a lucrative traffic, under the crafty plea of doing honour to the so-called sacred localities of antiquity.<a name=38:1049></a> But a single ray of light from Revelation's heavenly lamp, is sufficient to enable us to say that you must "go forth" of all these things, in order to find and enjoy communion with a rejected Christ.<a name=38:1050></a>

		However, my reader will need to remember that there is far more involved in the soul-stirring call to "go forth," than a mere escape from the gross absurdities of an ignorant superstition, or the designs of a crafty covetousness.<a name=38:1051></a> There are many who can, powerfully and eloquently, expose all such things, who are very far indeed from any thought of responding to the apostolic summons.<a name=38:1052></a> When men set up a "camp," and rally round a standard on which is emblazoned some important dogma of truth, or some valuable institution -- when they can appeal to an orthodox creed -- an advanced and enlightened scheme of doctrine -- a splendid ritual, capable of satisfying the most ardent aspirations of man's devotional nature -- when any or all of these things exist, it demands much spiritual intelligence to discern the real force and proper application of the words, "Let us go forth," and much spiritual energy and decision to act upon them.<a name=38:1053></a> They should, however, be discerned and acted upon, for it is perfectly certain that the atmosphere of a camp, let its ground or standard be what it may, is destructive of personal communion with a rejected Christ; and no so-called religious advantage can ever make up for the loss of that communion.<a name=38:1054></a> It is the tendency of our hearts to drop into cold stereotyped forms.<a name=38:1055></a> This has ever been the case in the professing church.<a name=38:1056></a> These forms may have originated in real power.<a name=38:1057></a> They may have resulted from positive visitations of the Spirit of God.<a name=38:1058></a> The temptation is to stereotype the form when the spirit and power have all departed.<a name=38:1059></a> This is, in principle, to set up a camp.<a name=38:1060></a> The Jewish system could boast a divine origin.<a name=38:1061></a> A Jew could triumphantly point to the temple, with its splendid system of worship, its priesthood, its sacrifices, its entire furniture, and show that it had all been handed down from the God of Israel.<a name=38:1062></a> He could give chapter and verse, as we say, for everything connected with the system to which he was attached.<a name=38:1063></a> Where is the system, ancient, mediaeval, or modern, that could put forth such lofty and powerful pretensions, or come down upon the heart with such an overwhelming weight of authority?<a name=38:1064></a> And yet, the command was to "GO FORTH.<a name=38:1065></a>"

		The same law in reference to "the fifth part" obtained in the case of a trespass committed against a man, as we read, "If a soul sin, and commit a trespass <i>against the Lord</i>,<a href="#38:f12"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++++++++</sup></a> and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or have deceived his neighbour, or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found, or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offerings) (Leviticus 6: 2-5)
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f12"><sup>++++++++++++</sup></a>There is a fine principle invoked in the expression, "against the Lord." Although the matter in question was a wrong done to one's neighbour, yet the Lord looked upon it as a trespass against himself. Everything must be viewed in reference to the Lord. It matters not who may be affected, Jehovah must get the first place. Thus, when David's conscience was pierced by the arrow of conviction, in reference to his treatment of Uriah, he exclaims, "I have sinned *against the Lord*." (2 Samuel 12: 13) This principle does not, in the least, interfere with the injured man's claim.

		Thus, whether we think of the injured, or the injurer, in any given case, we are equally struck with the glorious triumphs of redemption, and the mighty practical results which flow from that gospel which fills the soul with the happy assurance, that "all trespasses" are "forgiven," And that the root from whence those trespasses have sprung, has been judged "The gospel of the glory of the blessed God" is that which alone can send forth a man into the midst of a scene which has been the witness of his sins, his trespasses, and his injurious ways -- can send him back to all who, in anywise, have been sufferers by his evil doings, furnished with grace, not only to repair the wrongs, but, far more, to allow the full tide of practical benevolence to flow forth in all his ways, yea, to love his enemies, to do good to them that hate him, and to pray for them that despitefully use him and persecute him.<a name=38:1166></a> Such is the precious grace of God, that acts in confession with our great Trespass Offering.<a name=38:1167></a> -- such are its rich, rare, and refreshing fruits!<a name=38:1168></a>

		What a triumphant answer to the caviller who could say, "Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?<a name=38:1169></a>" Grace not merely cuts up sin by the roots, but transforms the sinner from a curse into a blessing; from a moral plague, into a channel of divine mercy; from an emissary of Satan, into a messenger of God; from a child of darkness, into a son of the light; from a self-indulgent pleasure-hunter, into a self-denying lover of God; from a slave of vile, selfish lusts, into a willing-hearted servant of Christ; from a cold, narrow-hearted miser, into a benevolent minister to the need of his fellow-man.<a name=38:1170></a> Away, then, with the oft repeated taunts, "Are we to do nothing?<a name=38:1171></a>" -- "That is a marvellously easy way to be saved" -- "According to this Gospel we may live as we list.<a name=38:1172></a>" Let all who utter such language behold yonder thief transformed into a liberal donor, and let them be silent for ever.<a name=38:1173></a> (See Ephesians 4: 28) They know not what grace means.<a name=38:1174></a> They have never felt its sanctifying and elevating influences.<a name=38:1175></a> They forget that, while the blood of the trespass offering cleanses the conscience, the law of that offering sends the trespasser back to the one whom he has wronged, with" the principal" and "the fifth" in his hand.<a name=38:1176></a> Noble testimony this, both to the grace and righteousness of the God of Israel!<a name=38:1177></a> Beauteous exhibition of the results of that marvellous scheme of redemption, whereby the injurer is forgiven, and the injured becomes the actual gainer!<a name=38:1178></a> The conscience has been set to rights, by the blood of the cross, in reference to the claims of God, the conduct must be set to rights, by the holiness of the cross, in reference to the claims of practical righteousness.<a name=38:1179></a> These things must never be separated.<a name=38:1180></a> God has joined them together, and let not man put them asunder.<a name=38:1181></a> The hallowed union will never be dissolved by any mind which is governed by pure gospel morality.<a name=38:1182></a> Alas!<a name=38:1183></a> it is easy to profess the principles of grace, while the practice and power thereof are completely denied.<a name=38:1184></a> It is easy to talk of resting in the blood of the trespass offering, while "the principal" and "the fifth" are not forthcoming.<a name=38:1185></a> This is vain, and worse than vain.<a name=38:1186></a> "He that doeth not righteousness is not of God" (1 John 3: 10).<a name=38:1187></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now proceed to compare the two classes of trespass offering; namely, the offering on account of trespass "in the holy things of the Lord," and that which had reference to a trespass committed in the common transactions and relations of human life.<a name=38:1202></a> In so doing, we shall find one or two points which demand our attentive consideration.<a name=38:1203></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, first, the expression, "if a soul sin through ignorance," which occurs in the former, is omitted in the latter.<a name=38:1204></a> The reason of this is obvious.<a name=38:1205></a> The claims which stand connected with the holy things of the Lord, must pass, infinitely, beyond the reach of the most elevated human sensibility.<a name=38:1206></a> Those claims may be, continually, interfered with -- continually trespassed upon, and the trespasser not be aware of the fact.<a name=38:1207></a> A man's consciousness can never be the regulator in the sanctuary of God.<a name=38:1208></a> This is an unspeakable mercy.<a name=38:1209></a> God's holiness alone must fix the standard, when God's rights are in question.<a name=38:1210></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh the other hand, the human conscience can readily grasp the full amount of a human claim, and can readily take cognisance of any interference with such claim.<a name=38:1211></a> How often may we have wronged God, in His holy things, without ever taking a note of it in the tablet of conscience -- yea without having the competency to detect it.<a name=38:1212></a> (See Malachi 3: 8) Not so, however, when man's rights are in question.<a name=38:1213></a> The wrong which the human eye can see, and the human heart feel, the human conscience can take notice of.<a name=38:1214></a> A man, "through ignorance" of the laws which governed the sanctuary of old, might commit a trespass against those laws, without being aware of it, until a higher light had shone in upon his conscience.<a name=38:1215></a> But a man could not, "through ignorance," tell a lie, swear falsely, commit an act of violence, deceive his neighbour, or find a lost thing and deny it.<a name=38:1216></a> These were all plain and palpable acts, lying within the range of the most sluggish sensibility.<a name=38:1217></a> Hence it is that the expression, "through ignorance" is introduced, in reference to "the holy things of the Lord," and omitted, in reference to the common affairs of men.<a name=38:1218></a> How blessed it is to know that the precious blood of Christ has settled all questions whether with respect to God or man -- our sins of ignorance or our known sins!<a name=38:1219></a> Here lies the deep and settled foundation of the believer's peace.<a name=38:1220></a> The cross has divinely met ALL.<a name=38:1221></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, when it was a question of trespass "in the holy things of the Lord," the unblemished sacrifice was first introduced; and, afterward "the principal" and "the fifth.<a name=38:1222></a>" This order was reversed when it was a question of the common affairs of life.<a name=38:1223></a> (Comp.<a name=38:1224></a> Leviticus 5: 15, 16 with Leviticus 6: 4-7) The reason of this is equally obvious.<a name=38:1225></a> When the divine rights were infringed, the blood of atonement was made the great prominent matter.<a name=38:1226></a> Whereas, when human rights were interfered with, restitution would naturally assume the leading place in the mind.<a name=38:1227></a> But, inasmuch as the latter involved the question of the soul's relation with God, as well as the former, therefore the sacrifice is introduced, though it be last in order.<a name=38:1228></a> If I wrong my fellow man, that wrong will, undoubtedly, interfere with my communion with God; and that communion can only be restored on the ground of atonement.<a name=38:1229></a> Mere restitution would not avail.<a name=38:1230></a> It might satisfy the injured man, but it could not form the basis of restored communion with God.<a name=38:1231></a> I might restore "the principal" and add "the fifth," ten thousand times over, and yet my sin remain, for "Without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=38:1232></a>" (Hebrews 9: 22) Still, if it be a question of injury done to my neighbour, then restitution must first be made.<a name=38:1233></a> "If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<a name=38:1234></a>" (Matthew 5: 23, 24)<a href="#38:f13"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++++++</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f13"><sup>+++++++++++++</sup></a>From a comparison of Matthew 5.23, 24 with Matthew 18. 21, 22, we may learn a fine principle, as to the way in which wrongs and injuries are to be settled between two brothers. The injurer is sent back from the altar, in order to have his matters set straight with the injured one; for there can be no communion with the Father so long as my brother "hath ought against me" But, then, mark the beauteous way in which the injured one is taught to receive the injurer. "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, until seven times; but, *until seventy times seven*." Such is the divine mode of settling all questions between brethren. "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye (Colossians 3: 13).

		Again, my reader should seek to apprehend the meaning of the expression, "all the males among the priests shall eat thereof.<a name=38:1284></a>" The ceremonial act of eating the sin offering, or the trespass offering, was expressive of full identification.<a name=38:1285></a> But, to eat the sin offering -- to make another's sin one's own, demanded a higher degree of priestly energy, such as was expressed in all the <i>males</i> among the priests.<a name=38:1286></a>" "And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and <i>to thy sons</i>, by an ordinance for ever.<a name=38:1287></a> This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for <i>thy sons</i>.<a name=38:1288></a> In the most Holy place shalt thou eat it; <i>every male</i> shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.<a name=38:1289></a> and this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons, and to <i>thy daughters</i> with thee, by a statute for ever: <i>every one that is clean</i> in thy house shall eat of it" (Numbers 18: 8-11).<a name=38:1290></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having considered the doctrine of sacrifice, as unfolded in the first seven chapters of this book, we now approach the subject of priesthood.<a name=38:1313></a> The two subjects are intimately connected.<a name=38:1314></a> The Sinner needs a <i>sacrifice</i>; the believer needs a <i>priest</i>.<a name=38:1315></a> We have both the one and the other in Christ, who, having offered Himself, without spot, to God, entered upon the sphere of His priestly ministry, in the sanctuary above.<a name=38:1316></a> We need no other sacrifice, no other priest.<a name=38:1317></a> Jesus is divinely sufficient.<a name=38:1318></a> He imparts the dignity and worth of His own Person to every office He sustains, and to every work He performs.<a name=38:1319></a> When we see Him as a sacrifice, we know that we have in Him all that a perfect sacrifice could be; and, when we see Him as a priest, we know that every function of the priesthood is perfectly discharged by Him.<a name=38:1320></a> As a sacrifice, He introduces His people into a settled relationship with God; and, as a priest, He maintains them therein, according to the perfectness of what He is.<a name=38:1321></a> Priesthood is designed for those who already stand in a certain relationship with God.<a name=38:1322></a> As sinners, by nature and by practice, we are all brought nigh to God by the blood of the cross.<a name=38:1323></a>" We are brought into an established relationship with Him.<a name=38:1324></a> We stand before Him as the fruit of His own work.<a name=38:1325></a> He has put away our sins, in such a manner as suits Himself, so that we might be before Him, to the praise of His name, as the exhibition of what He can accomplish through the power of death and resurrection.<a name=38:1326></a>

		But, though so fully delivered from every thing that could be against us; though so perfectly accepted in the Beloved; though so complete in Christ; though so highly exalted, yet are we, in ourselves, while down here, poor feeble creatures, ever prone to wander, ready to stumble, exposed to manifold temptations, trials, and snares.<a name=38:1327></a> As such, we need the ceaseless ministry of our "Great High Priest," whose very presence, in the sanctuary above, maintains us, in the full integrity of that place and relationship in which, through grace, we stand, "He ever liveth to make intercession for us.<a name=38:1328></a>" (Hebrews 7: 25) We could not stand, for a moment, down here, If He were not living for us, up there.<a name=38:1329></a> "Because I live, ye shall live also.<a name=38:1330></a>" (John 14: 19) "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<a name=38:1331></a>" (Romans 5: 10) The "death" and the "life "are inseparably connected, in the economy of grace.<a name=38:1332></a> But, be it observed, the life comes after the death.<a name=38:1333></a> It is Christ's life as risen from the dead, and not His life down here, that the apostle refers to, in the last-quoted passage.<a name=38:1334></a> This distinction is eminently worthy of my reader's attention.<a name=38:1335></a> The life of our blessed Lord Jesus, while down here, was, I need hardly remark, infinitely precious; but He did not enter upon His sphere of priestly service until He had accomplished the work of redemption.<a name=38:1336></a> Nor could He have done so, inasmuch as "it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.<a name=38:1337></a>" (Hebrews 7: 14) "For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.<a name=38:1338></a> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law.<a name=38:1339></a>" (Hebrews 8: 3, 4) "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption .<a name=38:1340></a>.<a name=38:1341></a>.<a name=38:1342></a> .<a name=38:1343></a>.<a name=38:1344></a> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us" (Hebrews 9: 11, 12, 24).<a name=38:1345></a>

		Heaven, not earth, is the sphere of Christ's Priestly ministry; and on that sphere He entered when He had offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=38:1346></a> He never appeared as a priest in the temple below.<a name=38:1347></a> He ofttimes went up to the temple to teach, but never to sacrifice or burn incense.<a name=38:1348></a> There never was any one ordained of God to discharge the functions of the priestly office on earth, save Aaron and his sons.<a name=38:1349></a> "If he were on earth, he should not be a priest.<a name=38:1350></a>" This is a point of much interest and value, in connection with the doctrine of priesthood.<a name=38:1351></a> Heaven is the sphere, and accomplished redemption the basis, of Christ's priesthood.<a name=38:1352></a> Save in the sense that all Believers are priests, (1 Peter 2: 5) there is no such thing as a priest upon earth.<a name=38:1353></a> Unless a man can show his descent from Aaron, unless he can trace his pedigree up to that ancient source, he has no right to exercise the priestly office.<a name=38:1354></a> Apostolic succession itself, could it be proved, would be of no possible value here, inasmuch as the Apostles themselves were not priests, save in the sense above referred to.<a name=38:1355></a> The feeblest member of the household of faith is as much a priest as the Apostle Peter himself.<a name=38:1356></a> He is a spiritual priest; he worships in a spiritual temple; he stands at a spiritual altar; he offers a spiritual sacrifice; he is clad in spiritual vestments.<a name=38:1357></a> "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<a name=38:1358></a>" (1 Peter 2: 5) "By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.<a name=38:1359></a> But to do good and to communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased" (Hebrews 13: 15, 16).<a name=38:1360></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If one of the direct descendants of the house of Aaron were converted to Christ, he would enter upon an entirely new character and ground of priestly service.<a name=38:1361></a> And be it observed, that the passages just quoted present the two great classes of spiritual sacrifice which the spiritual priest is privileged to offer.<a name=38:1362></a> There is the sacrifice of praise to God, and the sacrifice of benevolence to man.<a name=38:1363></a> There is a double stream continually going forth from the believer who is living in the realisation of his priestly place -- a stream of grateful praise ascending to the throne of God, and a stream of active benevolence flowing forth to a needy world.<a name=38:1364></a> The spiritual priest stands with one hand lifted up to God, in the presentation of the incense of grateful praise; and the other opened wide to minister, in genuine beneficence, to every form of human need.<a name=38:1365></a> Were these things more distinctly apprehended, what hallowed elevation, and what moral grace, would they not impart to the Christian character!<a name=38:1366></a> Elevation, inasmuch as the heart would ever be lifted up to the infinite Source of all that is capable of elevating -- moral grace, inasmuch as the heart would ever be kept open to all demands upon its sympathies.<a name=38:1367></a> The two things are inseparable.<a name=38:1368></a> Immediate occupation of heart with God must, of necessity, elevate and enlarge.<a name=38:1369></a> But, on the other hand, if one walks at a distance from God, the heart will become grovelling and contracted.<a name=38:1370></a> Intimacy of communion with God -- the habitual realisation of our priestly dignity, is the only effectual remedy for the downward and selfish tendencies of the old nature.<a name=38:1371></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said thus much on the subject of priesthood in general, both as to its primary and secondary aspects, we shall proceed to examine the contents of the eighth and ninth chapters of the Book of Leviticus.<a name=38:1372></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=38:1373></a> And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=38:1374></a>" There is special grace unfolded here.<a name=38:1375></a> The whole assembly is convened at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, in order that all might have the privilege of beholding the one who was about to be entrusted with the charge of their most important interests.<a name=38:1376></a> In Ex 28 and 29 we are taught the same general truth with respect to the vestments and sacrifices connected with the priestly office; but, in Leviticus, the congregation is introduced, and allowed to look on at every movement in the solemn and impressive Service of consecration.<a name=38:1377></a> The humblest member of the assembly had his own place.<a name=38:1378></a> Each one, the lowest as well as the highest, was permitted to gaze upon the person of the high priest, upon the sacrifice which he offered, and upon the robes which he wore.<a name=38:1379></a> Each one had his own peculiar need, and the God of Israel would have each to see and know that his need was fully provided for by the varied qualifications of the high priest who stood before him.<a name=38:1380></a> Of these qualifications the priestly robes were the apt typical expression.<a name=38:1381></a> Each portion of the dress was designed and adapted to put forth some special qualification in which the assembly as a whole, and each individual member, would, of necessity, be deeply interested.<a name=38:1382></a> The coat, the girdle, the robe, the ephod, the breastplate, the Urim and the Thummim, the mitre, the holy crown -- all told out the varied virtues, qualifications, and functions of the one who was to represent the congregation and maintain the interests thereof in the divine presence.<a name=38:1383></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is the believer can, with the eye of faith, behold his great High Priest, in the heavens, and see in Him the divine realities of which the Aaronic vestments were but the shadows.<a name=38:1384></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is the holy One, the anointed One, the mitred One, the girded One.<a name=38:1385></a> He is all these, not in virtue of outward garments to be put on or off, but in virtue of the divine and eternal graces of His Person, the changeless efficacy of His work, and the imperishable virtue of His sacred offices.<a name=38:1386></a> This is the special value of studying the types of the Mosaic economy.<a name=38:1387></a> The enlightened eye sees Christ in all.<a name=38:1388></a> The blood of the sacrifice and the robe of the high priest both point to Him -- both were designed of God to set Him forth.<a name=38:1389></a> If it be a question of conscience, the blood of the sacrifice meets it, according to the just claims of the sanctuary.<a name=38:1390></a> Grace has met the demand of holiness.<a name=38:1391></a> And, then, if it be a question of the need connected with the believer's position down here, he can see it all divinely answered in the official robes of the high priest.<a name=38:1392></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, here, let me say, there are two ways in which to contemplate the believer's position -- two ways in which that position is presented in the word, which must be taken into account ere the true idea of priesthood can be intelligently laid hold of.<a name=38:1393></a> The believer is represented as being part of a body of which Christ is the Head.<a name=38:1394></a> This body, with Christ its Head, is spoken of as forming one man, complete, in every respect.<a name=38:1395></a> It was quickened with Christ, raised with Christ, and seated with Christ, in the heavens.<a name=38:1396></a> It is one with Him, complete in Him, accepted in Him, possessing His life, and standing in His favour, before God.<a name=38:1397></a> All trespasses are blotted out.<a name=38:1398></a> There is no spot.<a name=38:1399></a> All is fair and lovely beneath the eye of God (see 1 Corinthians 12: 12, 13; Ephesians 2: 5-10; Colossians 2: 6-15; 1 John 4: 17).<a name=38:1400></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, the believer is contemplated as in the place of need, meekness, and dependence, down here, in this world.<a name=38:1401></a> He is ever exposed to temptation; prone to wander, liable to stumble and fall.<a name=38:1402></a> As such, he, continually, stands in need of the perfect sympathy and powerful ministrations of the High Priest, who ever appears in the presence of God, in the full value of His Person and work, and who represents the believer and maintains His cause before the throne.<a name=38:1403></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my reader should ponder both these aspects of the believer, in order that he may see, not only what a highly exalted and privileged place he occupies with Christ on high, but also what ample provision there is for him, in reference to his every need and weakness, here below.<a name=38:1404></a> This distinction might, further, be developed, in this way.<a name=38:1405></a> The believer is represented as being <i>of the church</i>, and in the <i>kingdom</i>.<a name=38:1406></a> As the former, heaven is his place, his home, his portion, the seat of his affections.<a name=38:1407></a> As the latter, he is on earth, in the place of trial, responsibility, and conflict.<a name=38:1408></a> Hence, therefore, priesthood is a divine provision for those who though being of the Church, and belonging to heaven, are, nevertheless, in the kingdom, and walking on the earth.<a name=38:1409></a> This distinction is a very simple one, and, when apprehended, explains a vast number of passages of Scripture in which many minds encounter considerable difficulty.<a name=38:1410></a><a href="#38:f14"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++++++++++</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f14"><sup>++++++++++++++</sup></a>A comparison of the Epistle to the Ephesians with the First Epistle of Peter will furnish the reader with much valuable instruction in reference to the double aspect of the believer's position, The former shows him as seated in heaven; the latter, as a pilgrim and a sufferer, on earth.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In looking into the contents of the chapters which lie open before us, we may remark three things put prominently forward, namely, the authority of the word, the value of the blood, the power of the Spirit.<a name=38:1411></a> These are weighty matters -- matters of unspeakable importance -- matters which must be regarded, by every Christian, as, unquestionably, vital and fundamental.<a name=38:1412></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, first, as to the authority of the word, it is of the deepest interest to see that, in the consecration of the priests, as well as in the entire range of the sacrifices, we are brought immediately under the authority of the word of God.<a name=38:1413></a> "And Moses said unto the congregation, <i>This is the thing which the Lord</i> commanded to be done.<a name=38:1414></a>" (Leviticus 8: 5) And, again, "Moses said, <i>This is the thing which the Lord</i> commanded that ye should do: <i>and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you</i>.<a name=38:1415></a>" (Leviticus 9: 6) Let these words sink down into our ears.<a name=38:1416></a> Let them be carefully and prayerfully pondered.<a name=38:1417></a> They are priceless words.<a name=38:1418></a> "<i>This</i> is <i>the</i> thing which <i>the Lord</i> commanded.<a name=38:1419></a>" He did not say, "This is the thing which is expedient, agreeable, or suitable.<a name=38:1420></a>" Neither did He say, "This is the thing which has been arranged by the voice of the fathers, the decree of the elders, or the opinion of the doctors.<a name=38:1421></a>" Moses knew nothing of such sources of authority.<a name=38:1422></a> To him there was one holy, elevated, paramount source of authority, and that was, the word of Jehovah, and he would bring every member of the assembly into direct contact with that blessed source.<a name=38:1423></a> This gave assurance to the heart, and fixedness to all the thoughts.<a name=38:1424></a> There was no room left for tradition, with its uncertain sound, or for man, with his doubtful disputations.<a name=38:1425></a> All was clear, conclusive, and authoritative.<a name=38:1426></a> Jehovah had spoken; and all that was needed was to hear what He had said, and obey.<a name=38:1427></a> Neither tradition nor expediency has any place in the heart that has learnt to prize, to reverence, and to obey the word of God.<a name=38:1428></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what was to be the result of this strict adherence to the word of God?<a name=38:1429></a> A truly blessed result, indeed.<a name=38:1430></a> "The glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.<a name=38:1431></a>" Had the word been disregarded, the glory would not have appeared.<a name=38:1432></a> The two things were intimately connected.<a name=38:1433></a> The slightest deviation from "thus saith Jehovah" would have prevented the beams of the divine glory from appearing to the congregation of Israel.<a name=38:1434></a> Had there been the introduction of a single rite or ceremony not enjoined by the word, or had there been the omission of ought which that word commanded, Jehovah would not have manifested His glory.<a name=38:1435></a> He could not sanction by the glory of His presence the neglect or rejection of His word.<a name=38:1436></a> He can bear with ignorance and infirmity, but He cannot sanction neglect or disobedience.<a name=38:1437></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=38:1438></a> that all this were more solemnly considered, in this day of tradition and expediency.<a name=38:1439></a> I would, in earnest affection, and in the deep sense of personal responsibility to my reader, exhort him to give diligent heed to the importance of close -- I had almost said severe -- adherence and reverent subjection to the word of God.<a name=38:1440></a> Let him try everything by that standard, and reject all that comes not up to it; let him weigh everything in that balance, and cast aside all that is not full weight; let him measure everything by that rule, and refuse all deviation.<a name=38:1441></a> If I could only be the means of awakening one soul to a proper sense of the place which belongs to the word of God, I should feel I had not written my book for nought or in vain.<a name=38:1442></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, pause, and, in the presence of the Searcher of hearts, ask yourself this plain, pointed question, "Am I sanctioning by my presence, or adopting in my practice, any departure from, or neglect of, the word of God?<a name=38:1443></a>" Make this a solemn, personal matter before the Lord.<a name=38:1444></a> Be assured of it, it is of the very deepest moment, the very last importance.<a name=38:1445></a> If you find that you have been, in any wise, connected with, or involved in, ought that wears not the distinct stamp of divine sanction, reject it at once and for ever.<a name=38:1446></a> Yes, reject it, though arrayed in the imposing vestments of antiquity, accredited by the voice of tradition, and putting forward the almost irresistible plea of expediency.<a name=38:1447></a> If you cannot say, in reference to everything with which you stand connected, "this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded," then away with it unhesitatingly, away with it for ever.<a name=38:1448></a> Remember these words," <i>as</i> he hath done this day, <i>so</i> the Lord hath commanded to do.<a name=38:1449></a>" Yes, remember the "as" and the "<i>so</i>;" see that you are connecting them in your ways and associations, and let them never be separated.<a name=38:1450></a>

		Now, all this was literally enacted at the consecration of Aaron and his sons.<a name=38:1457></a> And, moreover, all this was the result of strict adherence to the word of Jehovah.<a name=38:1458></a> But, ere I turn from this branch of the subject, let me remind the reader, that all that these chapters contain is but the shadow of good things to come.<a name=38:1459></a>" This, indeed, holds good in reference to the entire Mosaic economy.<a name=38:1460></a> (Heb 10: 1) Aaron and his sons, together, represent Christ and His priestly house.<a name=38:1461></a> Aaron alone represents Christ in His sacrificial and intercessory functions.<a name=38:1462></a> Moses and Aaron, together, represent Christ as King and Priest.<a name=38:1463></a> "The eighth day" represents the day of resurrection-glory, when the congregation of Israel shall see the Messiah, seated as Royal Priest upon His throne, and when the glory of Jehovah shall fill the whole earth, as the waters cover the sea.<a name=38:1464></a> these sublime truths are largely unfolded in the word, they glitter like gems of celestial brilliancy, all along the inspired page; but, lest they should, to any reader, wear the suspicious aspect of novelty, I shall refer him to the following direct scripture proofs; viz.<a name=38:1465></a>, Numbers 14: 21; Isaiah 9: 6, 7; Isaiah 11; Isaiah 25: 6-12; Isaiah 32: 1, 2; Isaiah 35; Isaiah 37: 31, 32; Isaiah 40: 1-5; Isaiah 54; Isaiah 59: 16-21; Isaiah 60 - 66; passim.<a name=38:1466></a> Jeremiah 23: 5-8; Jeremiah 30: 10-24; Jeremiah 33: 6-22; Ezra 48: 35; Daniel 7: 13, 14; Hosea 14: 4-9; Zephaniah 3: 14-20; Zechariah 3: 8-10; Zechariah 6: 12, 13; Zechariah 14.<a name=38:1467></a>

		Let us, now, consider the second point presented in our section, namely, the efficacy of the blood.<a name=38:1468></a> This is unfolded with great fullness, and put forward in great prominence.<a name=38:1469></a> Whether we contemplate the doctrine of sacrifice or the doctrine of priesthood, we find the shedding of blood gets the same important place.<a name=38:1470></a> "And he brought the bullock for the sin offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.<a name=38:1471></a> And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it" (Leviticus 8: 14, 15) "And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.<a name=38:1472></a> And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.<a name=38:1473></a>" (verse 18, 19) "and he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.<a name=38:1474></a> And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.<a name=38:1475></a> And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about" (verse 22-24).<a name=38:1476></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The import of the various sacrifices has been, in some degree, developed in the opening chapters of this volume; but the passages just quoted serve to show the prominent place which the blood occupies in the consecration of the priests.<a name=38:1477></a> A blood-stained <i>ear</i> was needed to hearken to the divine communications; a blood-stained <i>hand</i> was needed to execute the services of the sanctuary; and a blood-stained <i>foot</i> was needed to tread the courts of the Lord's house.<a name=38:1478></a> All this is perfect in its way.<a name=38:1479></a> The shedding of blood was the grand foundation of all sacrifice for sin; and it stood connected with all the vessels of the ministry, and with all the functions of the priesthood.<a name=38:1480></a> Throughout the entire range of Levitical service, we observe the value, the efficacy, the power, and the wide application of the blood.<a name=38:1481></a> "Almost all things are by the law purged with blood.<a name=38:1482></a>" (Hebrews 9: 22) Christ has entered, by His own blood, into heaven itself.<a name=38:1483></a> He appears on the throne of the majesty in the heavens, in the value of all that He has accomplished on the cross.<a name=38:1484></a> His presence on the throne attests the worth and acceptableness of His atoning blood.<a name=38:1485></a> He is there for us.<a name=38:1486></a> Blessed assurance!<a name=38:1487></a> He ever liveth.<a name=38:1488></a> He never changeth; and we are in Him, and as He is.<a name=38:1489></a> He presents us to the Father, in His own eternal perfectness; and the Father delights in us, as thus presented, even as He delights in the One who presents us.<a name=38:1490></a> This identification is typically set forth in "Aaron and his sons" laying their hands upon the head of each of the sacrifices.<a name=38:1491></a> They all stood before God, in the value of the same sacrifice.<a name=38:1492></a> Whether it were the "bullock for the sin offering," "the ram for the burnt offering," or "the ram of consecration," they jointly laid their hands on all.<a name=38:1493></a> True, Aaron alone was anointed before the blood was shed.<a name=38:1494></a> He was clad in his robes of office, and anointed with the holy oil, before ever his sons were clothed or anointed.<a name=38:1495></a> The reason of this is obvious.<a name=38:1496></a> Aaron, when spoken of by himself, typifies Christ in His own peerless excellency and dignity; And, as we know, Christ appeared in all His own personal worth and was anointed by the Holy Ghost, previous to the accomplishment of His atoning work.<a name=38:1497></a> In all things He has the pre-eminence.<a name=38:1498></a> (Colossians 1) Still, there is the fullest identification, afterwards, between Aaron and his sons, as there is the fullest identification between Christ and His people.<a name=38:1499></a> "The sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one.<a name=38:1500></a>" (Heb 2) The personal distinctness enhances the value of the mystic oneness.<a name=38:1501></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth of the distinctness and yet oneness of the Head and members leads us, naturally, to our third and last point, namely, the power of the Spirit.<a name=38:1502></a> We may remark how much takes place between the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons with him.<a name=38:1503></a> The blood is shed, the fat consumed on the altar, and the breast waved before the Lord.<a name=38:1504></a> In other words, the sacrifice is perfected, the sweet odour thereof ascends to God, and the One who offered it ascends in the power of resurrection, and takes His place on high.<a name=38:1505></a> All this comes in between the anointing of the Head and the anointing of the members.<a name=38:1506></a> Let us quote and compare the passages.<a name=38:1507></a> First, as to Aaron alone, we read, "And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.<a name=38:1508></a> And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.<a name=38:1509></a> And he put the mitre upon his head: and upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord commanded Moses.<a name=38:1510></a> And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.<a name=38:1511></a> And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.<a name=38:1512></a> And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him" (Leviticus 8: 7-12).<a name=38:1513></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have Aaron presented alone.<a name=38:1514></a> The anointing oil is poured upon his head, and that, too, in immediate connection with the anointing of all the vessels of the tabernacle.<a name=38:1515></a> The whole assembly was permitted to behold the high priest clothed in his official robes, mitred and anointed; and not only so, but as each garment was put on, as each act was performed, as each ceremony was enacted, it was seen to be immediately founded upon the authority of the word.<a name=38:1516></a> There was nothing vague, nothing arbitrary, nothing imaginative.<a name=38:1517></a> All was divinely stable.<a name=38:1518></a> The need of the congregation was fully met, and met in such a way as that it could be said, "This is the thing which Jehovah commended to be done.<a name=38:1519></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in Aaron anointed, alone, previous to the shedding of the blood, we have a type of Christ who, until He offered Himself upon the cross, stood entirely alone.<a name=38:1520></a> There could be no union between Him and His people, save on the ground of death and resurrection.<a name=38:1521></a> This all-important truth has already been referred to, and, in some measure, developed in connection with the subject of sacrifice; but it adds force and interest to it to see it so distinctly presented in connection with the question of priesthood.<a name=38:1522></a> Without shedding of blood there was no remission -- the sacrifice was not completed.<a name=38:1523></a> So, also, without shedding of blood Aaron and his sons could not be anointed together.<a name=38:1524></a> Let the reader note this fact.<a name=38:1525></a> Let him be assured of it, it is worthy of his deepest attention.<a name=38:1526></a> We must ever beware of passing lightly over any circumstance in the Levitical economy.<a name=38:1527></a> Everything has its own specific voice and meaning; and the One who designed and developed the order can expound to the heart and understanding what that order means.<a name=38:1528></a>

		"And Moses took of the anointing <i>oil</i>, and of the <i>blood</i> which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments <i>with him</i>"; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments <i>with Him</i>.<a name=38:1529></a>' (Leviticus 8: 30) Why were not Aaron's sons anointed with him at verse 12?<a name=38:1530></a> Simply because the blood had not been shed.<a name=38:1531></a> When "the blood" and "the oil" could be connected together, then Aaron and his sons could be "anointed" and "sanctified" together; but not until then.<a name=38:1532></a> "And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=38:1533></a>" (John 17: 19) The reader who could lightly pass over so marked a circumstance, or say it meant nothing, has yet to learn to value aright the types of the Old Testament Scriptures -- "the shadows of good things to come.<a name=38:1534></a>" And, on the other hand, the one who admits that it does mean something, but yet refuses to enquire and understand what that something is, is doing serious damage to his own soul, and manifesting but little interest in the precious oracles of God.<a name=38:1535></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f15"><sup>+++++++++++++++</sup></a>Lest any reader should be troubled with a difficulty in reference to the souls of Nadab, and Abihu, I would say that no such question ought ever to be raised. In such cases as Nadab and Abihu, in Leviticus 10; Korah and his company, in Numbers 16; the whole congregation, Joshua and Caleb excepted, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness, Numbers 14 and Hebrews 3; Achan and his family, Joshua 7; Ananias and Sapphira, Acts 5; those who were judged for abuses at the Lord's table, 1 Corinthians 11. In all such cases, the question of the soul's salvation is never raised. We are simply called to see, in them, the solemn actings of God, in government in the midst of His people. This relieves the mind from all difficulty. Jehovah dwelt, of old, between the Cherubim, to judge His people in everything; and God the Holy Ghost dwells, now, in the church, to order and govern, according to the perfection of His presence. He was so really and personally present that Ananias and Sapphira could lie to Him, and He could execute judgement upon them. It was as positive and as immediate an exhibition of His actings in government as we have in the matter of Nadab and Abihu, or Achan, or any other. <p>This is a great truth to get hold of. God is not only for His people, but with them, and in them. He is to be counted upon, for everything, whether it be great or small. He is present to comfort and help. He is there to chasten and judge. He is there "for exigence of every hour. He is sufficient. Let faith count upon Him. "Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I." (Matthew 18: 20) And, assuredly, where He is, we want no more.

But, be this as it may, we have to be thankful for a most valuable principle, in reference to our conduct, as spiritual priests. We are to refrain from everything which would produce the same effect upon our spiritual man, as strong drink produces upon the physical man. <p>It needs hardly to be remarked that the Christian should be *most jealous* over himself as to the use of wine or strong drink. Timothy, as we know, needed an apostolic recommendation to induce him even to touch it, for his health's sake. (1 Timothy 5) A beauteous proof of Timothy's habitual self-denial, and of the thoughtful love of the Spirit, in the apostle. I must confess that one's moral sense is offended by seeing Christians making use of strong drink in cases where it is, very manifestly, not medicinal. I rarely, if ever, see a spiritual person indulge in such a thing. One trembles to see a Christian the mere slave of a habit, whatever that habit may be. It proves that he is not keeping his body in subjection, and he is in great danger of being "disapproved" (1 Corinthians 9: 27).

		Let us, then, exercise a spirit of self-judgement -- a spirit of watchfulness over our habits, our ways, and our associations; and when we, by grace, discover ought that tends, in the smallest degree, to unfit us for the elevated exercises of the sanctuary, let us put it away from us, cost what it may.<a name=38:1815></a> Let us not suffer ourselves to be the slaves of a habit.<a name=38:1816></a> Communion with God should be dearer to our hearts than all beside; and just in proportion as we prize that communion, shall we watch and pray against anything that would rob us of it -- everything that would excite, ruffle, or unhinge.<a name=38:1817></a><a href="#38:f17"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++++++++++</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f17"><sup>+++++++++++++++++</sup></a>Some, perhaps, may think that the warning of Leviticus 10: 9 affords a warrant for *occasional* indulgence in those things which tend to excite the natural mind, inasmuch as it is said, "Do not drink wine nor strong drink ... .. when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation." To this we may reply, that the sanctuary is not a place which the Christian is, *occasionally*, to visit, but a place in which he is, *habitually*, to serve and worship. It is the sphere in which he should "live, and more, and have his being." The more we live in the presence of God, the less can we bear to be out of it; and no one who knows the deep joy of being there could lightly indulge in ought that would take or keep him Hence. There is not that object within the compass of earth which would, in the judgement of 3 spiritual mind, be an equivalent for one hour's fellowship with God.

		There are few things in which we are more prone to fail than in the maintenance of the divine standard, when human failure has set in.<a name=38:1819></a> Like David, when the Lord made a breach upon Uzza, because of his failure in putting his hand to the ark, "He was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?<a name=38:1820></a>" (1 Chr.<a name=38:1821></a> 13: 12) It is exceedingly difficult to bow to the divine judgement, and, at the same time, to hold fast the divine ground.<a name=38:1822></a> The temptation is to lower the standard, to come down from the lofty elevation, to take human ground.<a name=38:1823></a> We must ever carefully guard against this evil, which is all the more dangerous as wearing the garb of modesty, self-distrust, and humility.<a name=38:1824></a> Aaron and his sons, notwithstanding all that had occurred, were to eat the meat offering in the holy place.<a name=38:1825></a> They were to do so, not because all had gone on in perfect order, but "because it is thy due," and "so I am commanded.<a name=38:1826></a>" Though there had been failure, yet their place was in the tabernacle; and those who were there had certain "dues" founded upon the divine commandment.<a name=38:1827></a> Though man had failed ten thousand times over, the word of the Lord could not fail; and that word had secured certain privileges for all true priests, which it was their place to enjoy.<a name=38:1828></a> Were God's priests to have nothing to eat, no priestly food, because failure had set in?<a name=38:1829></a> Were those that were left to be allowed to starve, because Nadab and Abihu had offered "strange fire?<a name=38:1830></a>" This would never do.<a name=38:1831></a> God is faithful, and He can never allow any one to be empty in His blessed presence.<a name=38:1832></a> The prodigal may wander, and squander, and come to poverty; but it must ever hold good that "in my Father's house is bread enough and to spare.<a name=38:1833></a>"

		However, we must distinguish between those privileges which belonged to all the members of Aaron's family, "daughters" as well as "sons," and those which could only be enjoyed by the male portion of the family.<a name=38:1847></a> This point has already been referred to, in the notes on the offerings.<a name=38:1848></a> There are certain blessings which are the common portion of all believers, simply as such; and there are those which demand a higher measure of spiritual attainment and priestly energy to apprehend and enjoy.<a name=38:1849></a> Now, it is worse than vain, yea, it is impious, to set up for the enjoyment of this higher measure, when we really have it not.<a name=38:1850></a> It is one thing to hold fast the privileges which are "given" of God, and ran never be taken away, and quite another to assume a measure of spiritual capacity to which we have never attained.<a name=38:1851></a> No doubt, we ought to desire earnestly the very highest measure of priestly communion, the most elevated order of priestly privilege.<a name=38:1852></a> But, then, desiring a thing, and assuming to have it, are very different.<a name=38:1853></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This thought will throw light upon the closing paragraph of our chapter.<a name=38:1854></a> "And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left, saying, Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?<a name=38:1855></a> Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; and such things have befallen me; and if I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord And when Moses heard that, he was content.<a name=38:1856></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "daughters" of Aaron were not permitted to eat of "the sin offering.<a name=38:1857></a>" This high privilege belonged only to the "sons," and it was a type of the most elevated form of priestly service.<a name=38:1858></a> To eat of the sin offering was the expression of full identification with the offerer, and this demanded an amount of priestly capacity and energy which found its type in "the sons of Aaron.<a name=38:1859></a>" On the occasion before us, however, it is very evident that Aaron and his sons were not in a condition to rise to this high and holy ground.<a name=38:1860></a> They ought to have been, but they were not.<a name=38:1861></a> "Such things have befallen me," said Aaron.<a name=38:1862></a> This, no doubt, was to be deplored; but, yet, "when Moses heard it, he was content.<a name=38:1863></a>" It is far better to be real in the confession of our failure and shortcoming, than to put forth pretensions to spiritual power which are wholly without foundation.<a name=38:1864></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, then, Leviticus 10 opens with positive sin, and closes with negative failure.<a name=38:1865></a> Nadab and Abihu offered "strange fire;" and Eleazar and Ithamar were unable to eat the sin offering.<a name=38:1866></a> The former was met by divine judgement; the latter, by divine forbearance.<a name=38:1867></a> There could be no allowance for "strange fire.<a name=38:1868></a>" It was positively flying in the face of God's plain commandment.<a name=38:1869></a> There is, obviously, a wide difference between a deliberate rejection of a plain command, and mere inability to rise to the height of a divine privilege.<a name=38:1870></a> The former is open dishonour done to God; the latter is a forfeiture of one's own blessing.<a name=38:1871></a> There should be neither the one nor the other, but the difference between the two is easily traced.<a name=38:1872></a>

		LEVITICUS 11.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Leviticus may be termed "the priest's guide book.<a name=38:1882></a>" This is very much its character.<a name=38:1883></a> It is full of principles for the guidance of such as desire to live in the enjoyment of priestly nearness to God.<a name=38:1884></a> Had Israel gone on with Jehovah, according to the grace in which He had brought them up, out of the land of Egypt, they should have been to Him "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.<a name=38:1885></a>" (Exodus 19: 6) This, however, they failed to do.<a name=38:1886></a> They put themselves at a distance.<a name=38:1887></a> They got under law and failed to keep it.<a name=38:1888></a> Hence, Jehovah had to take up a certain tribe, and from that tribe a certain family, and from that family a certain man, and to him and to his house, was granted the high privilege of drawing nigh, as priests unto God.<a name=38:1889></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the privileges of such a position were immense; but it had its heavy responsibilities, likewise.<a name=38:1890></a> There would be the ever-recurring demand for the exercise of a discerning mind.<a name=38:1891></a> "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.<a name=38:1892></a>" (Malachi 2: 7) The priest was not only to bear the judgement of the congregation, before the Lord, but also to expound the ordinances of the Lord to the congregation.<a name=38:1893></a> He was to be the ever-ready medium of communication between Jehovah and the assembly.<a name=38:1894></a> He was not merely to know the mind of God, for himself, but be able also to interpret that mind to the people.<a name=38:1895></a> All this would demand, of necessity, constant watching, constant waiting, constant hanging over the page of inspiration, that he might drink in, to his very soul, all the precepts, the judgements, the statutes, the laws, the commandments, and the ordinances of the God of Israel, so as to be able to instruct the congregation, in reference to "those things which ought to be done.<a name=38:1896></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no room left for the play of fancy, the working of imagination, the introduction of man's plausible inferences, or the cunning devices of human expediency.<a name=38:1897></a> Everything was laid down, with the divine precision and commanding authority of a "thus saith the Lord.<a name=38:1898></a>" Minute and elaborate as was the detail of sacrifices, rites, and ceremonies, nothing was left for man's brain to originate.<a name=38:1899></a> He was not even permitted to decide upon the kind of sacrifice to be offered, upon any given occasion; nor yet as to the mode in which such sacrifice was to be presented.<a name=38:1900></a> Jehovah took care of everything.<a name=38:1901></a> Neither the congregation nor the priest had any authority whatsoever, to decree, enact, or suggest so much as a single item throughout all the vast array of ordinances in the Mosaic economy.<a name=38:1902></a> <i>The word of the Lord settled all</i>.<a name=38:1903></a> Man had <i>only to obey</i>.<a name=38:1904></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, to an obedient heart, was nothing short of an unspeakable mercy.<a name=38:1905></a> It is quite impossible to overestimate the privilege of being permitted to betake oneself to the oracles of God, and there find the most ample, guidance as to all the details of one's faith and service, day by day.<a name=38:1906></a> All that we need is a broken will, a mortified mind, a single eye.<a name=38:1907></a> The divine guide book is as full as we can possibly desire.<a name=38:1908></a> We want no more.<a name=38:1909></a> To imagine, for a moment, that ought is left for man's wisdom to supply, must be regarded as a flagrant insult offered to the sacred canon.<a name=38:1910></a> No one can read the Book of Leviticus, and not be struck with the extraordinary painstaking, on the part of Israel's God, to furnish His people with the most minute instruction upon every point connected with His service and worship.<a name=38:1911></a> The most cursory reader of the book might, at least, bear away with him this touching and interesting lesson.<a name=38:1912></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, truly, if ever there was a time when this self-same lesson needed to be read out in the ears of the professing church, this is the time.<a name=38:1913></a> On all hands, the divine sufficiency of Holy Scripture is called in question;.<a name=38:1914></a> In some cases this is openly and deliberately done; in others it is, with less frankness, hinted, insinuated, implied, and inferred.<a name=38:1915></a> The Christian mariner is told, directly, or indirectly, that the divine chart is insufficient for all the intricate details of his voyage that such changes have taken place in the ocean of life, since that chart was made, that, in many cases, it is entirely deficient for the purposes of modern navigation.<a name=38:1916></a> He is told that the currents, tides, coasts, strands, and shores of that ocean are quite different, now, from what they were from centuries ago, and that, as a necessary consequence, he must have recourse to the aids which modern navigation supplies, in order to make up for the deficiencies in the old chart, which is, as a matter of course, admitted to have been perfect at the time it was made.<a name=38:1917></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I earnestly desire that the Christian reader should be able, with clearness and decision, to meet this grievous dishonour done to the precious volume of inspiration, every line of which comes to him fresh from his Father's bosom, through the pen of God the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:1918></a> I desire that he should meet it, whether it comes before him in the shape of a bold and blasphemous statement, or a learned and plausible inference.<a name=38:1919></a> Whatever garb it wears, it owes its origin to the enemy of Christ, the enemy of the Bible, the enemy of the soul.<a name=38:1920></a> If, indeed, the Word of God be not sufficient, then where are we?<a name=38:1921></a> or whither shall we turn?<a name=38:1922></a> To whom shall we betake ourselves for aid, if our Father's book be, in any respect, defective?<a name=38:1923></a> God says that His book can "furnish us <i>thoroughly</i> to <i>all</i> good works.<a name=38:1924></a>" (2 Timothy 3: 17) Man says, no; there are many things about which the Bible is silent, which, nevertheless, we need to know.<a name=38:1925></a> Whom am I to believe?<a name=38:1926></a> God or man?<a name=38:1927></a> Our reply to any one who questions the divine sufficiency of Scripture, is just this, "either you are not a 'man of God,' or else that for which you want a warrant is not 'a good work,'" This is plain.<a name=38:1928></a> No one can possibly think otherwise, with his eye resting on 2 Timothy 3: 17.<a name=38:1929></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=38:1930></a> for a deeper sense of the fullness, majesty, and authority of the Word of God!<a name=38:1931></a> We very much need to be braced up on this point.<a name=38:1932></a> We want such a deep, bold, vigorous, influential, and abiding sense of the supreme authority of the divine canon, and of its absolute completeness for every age, every clime, every position, every department -- personal, social, and ecclesiastical, as shall enable us to withstand every attempt of the enemy to depreciate the value of that inestimable treasure.<a name=38:1933></a> May our hearts enter more into the spirit of those words of the Psalmist, "Thy word is true <i>from the beginning</i>: and every one of thy righteous judgements <i>endureth for ever</i>" (Psalm 119: 160).<a name=38:1934></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The foregoing train of thought is awakened by the perusal of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Leviticus.<a name=38:1935></a> Therein we find Jehovah entering, in most marvellous detail, into a description of beasts, birds, fishes, and reptiles, and furnishing His people with various marks by which they were to know what was clean and what was unclean.<a name=38:1936></a> We have the summing up of the entire contents of this remarkable chapter in the two closing verses.<a name=38:1937></a> "This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth; <i>to make a difference</i> between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.<a name=38:1938></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to beasts, two things were essential to render them clean, they should chew the cud and divide the hoof.<a name=38:1939></a> "Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven footed, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat.<a name=38:1940></a>" Either of these marks would, of itself, have been wholly insufficient to constitute ceremonial cleanness.<a name=38:1941></a> The two should go together.<a name=38:1942></a> Now, while these two marks were quite sufficient for the guidance of an Israelite, as to the cleanness or uncleanness of an animal, without any reference as to why or wherefore such marks were given, or what they meant, yet is the Christian permitted to enquire into the spiritual truth wrapped up in these ceremonial enactment's.<a name=38:1943></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, then, are we to learn from those two features in a clean animal?<a name=38:1944></a> The chewing of the cud expresses the natural process of "inwardly digesting" that which one eats; while the divided hoof sets forth the character of one's outward walk.<a name=38:1945></a> There is, as we know, an intimate connection between the two, in the christian life.<a name=38:1946></a> The one who feeds upon the green pastures of the Word of God, and inwardly digests what he takes in -- the one who is enabled to combine calm meditation with prayerful study, will, without doubt, manifest that character of outward walk which is to the praise of Him who has graciously given us His word to form our habits and govern our ways.<a name=38:1947></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be feared that many who <i>read the Bible</i> do not <i>digest the word</i>.<a name=38:1948></a> The two things are widely different.<a name=38:1949></a> One may read chapter after chapter, book after book, and not digest so much as a single line.<a name=38:1950></a> We may read the Bible as part of a dull and profitless routine; but, through lack of the ruminating powers -- the digestive organs, we derive no profit whatsoever.<a name=38:1951></a> This should be carefully looked into.<a name=38:1952></a> The cattle that browse on the green may teach us a wholesome lesson.<a name=38:1953></a> They, first, diligently gather up the refreshing pasture, and then calmly lie down to chew the cud.<a name=38:1954></a> Striking and beautiful picture of a Christian feeding upon and inwardly digesting the precious contents of the volume of inspiration.<a name=38:1955></a> Would that there were more of this amongst us Were we more accustomed to betake ourselves to the Word as the necessary pasture of our souls, we should, assuredly, be in a more vigorous and healthy condition.<a name=38:1956></a> Let us beware of reading the Bible as a dead form -- a cold duty -- a piece of religious routine.<a name=38:1957></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same caution is needful in reference to the public exposition of the Word.<a name=38:1958></a> Let those who expound Scripture to their fellows, first feed and digest for themselves.<a name=38:1959></a> Let them read and ruminate, in private, not merely for others, but for themselves.<a name=38:1960></a> It is a poor thing for a man to be continually occupied in procuring food for other people, And he himself dying of starvation.<a name=38:1961></a> Then, again, let those who attend upon the public ministry of the Word, see that they are not doing so mechanically, as by the force of mere religious habit, but with an earnest desire to "read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest" what they hear.<a name=38:1962></a> Then will both teachers and taught be well-conditioned, the spiritual life nourished and sustained, and the true character of outward walk exhibited.<a name=38:1963></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, be it remembered, that the chewing of the cud must never be separated from the divided hoof.<a name=38:1964></a> If one but partially acquainted with the priest's guide book -- unpractised in the divine ceremonial, happened to see an animal chewing the cud, he might hastily pronounce him clean.<a name=38:1965></a> This would have been a serious error.<a name=38:1966></a> A more careful reference to the divine directory would, at once, show that he must mark the animal's walk -- that he must note the impression made by each movement -- that he must look for the result of the divided hoof.<a name=38:1967></a> "Nevertheless, these shall ye not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you," etc.<a name=38:1968></a>, etc.<a name=38:1969></a> (verse 4-6).<a name=38:1970></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In like manner, the divided hoof was insufficient, if not accompanied by the chewing of the cud.<a name=38:1971></a> "The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.<a name=38:1972></a>" (verse 7) In a word, then, the two things were inseparable in the case of every clean animal; and, as to the spiritual application, it is of the very last importance, in a practical point of view.<a name=38:1973></a> The inward life and the outward walk must go together.<a name=38:1974></a> A man may profess to love and feed upon -- to study and ruminate over the Word of God -- the pasture of the soul; but, if his footprints along the pathway of life are not such as the Word requires, he is not clean.<a name=38:1975></a> And, on the other hand, a man may seem to walk with pharisaic blamelessness; but if his walk be not the result of the hidden life, it is worse than worthless.<a name=38:1976></a> There must be the divine principle within which feeds upon and digests the rich pasture of God's Word, else the impression of the footstep will be of no avail.<a name=38:1977></a> The value of each depends upon its inseparable connection with the other.<a name=38:1978></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are, here, forcibly reminded of a solemn passage in the First Epistle of John, in which the apostle furnishes us with the two marks whereby we may know those that are of God.<a name=38:1979></a> "In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever <i>doeth not righteousness</i>, is not of God, neither he that <i>loveth not his brother</i>.<a name=38:1980></a>" (1 John 3: 10) Here we have the two grand characteristics of the eternal life, of which all true believers are possessed, namely, "righteousness" and "love".<a name=38:1981></a> The outward and the inward.<a name=38:1982></a> Both must be combined.<a name=38:1983></a> Some professing Christians are all for love, so called; and some for righteousness.<a name=38:1984></a> Neither can exist, in a divine way, without the other.<a name=38:1985></a> If that which is called love exist without practical righteousness, it will, in reality, be but a lax, soft, easy-going habit of mind, which will tolerate all manner of error and evil.<a name=38:1986></a> And, if that which is called righteousness exist without love, it will be a stern, proud, pharisaic, self-sufficient temper of soul resting upon the miserable basis of personal reputation.<a name=38:1987></a> But where the divine life is in energy, there will ever be the inward charity combined with genuine practical righteousness.<a name=38:1988></a> The two elements are essential in the formation of true Christian character.<a name=38:1989></a> There must be the love that will express itself in reference to the very feeblest development of that which is of God; and, at the same time, the holiness that shrinks, with intense abhorrence, from all that is of Satan.<a name=38:1990></a>

		We shall now pass on to the consideration of that which the Levitical ceremonial taught with respect to "all that are in the waters.<a name=38:1991></a>" Here again, we find the double mark.<a name=38:1992></a> "These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.<a name=38:1993></a> And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you.<a name=38:1994></a>" (verse 9, 10) Two things were necessary to render a fish ceremonially clean, namely, "fins and scales," which, obviously, set forth a certain fitness for the sphere and element in which the creature had to move.<a name=38:1995></a>

		But, doubtless, there was more than this.<a name=38:1996></a> I believe it is our privilege to discern, in the natural properties with which God has endowed those creatures which move in the waters, certain spiritual qualities which belong to the Christian life.<a name=38:1997></a> If a fish needs a "fin" to enable him to move through the waters and "scales" to resist the action thereof, so does the believer need that spiritual capacity which enables him to move onward through the scene with which he is surrounded, and, at the same time, to resist its influence -- to prevent its penetrating -- to keep it out.<a name=38:1998></a> These are precious qualities.<a name=38:1999></a> The fin and the scale are pregnant with meaning -- full of practical instruction to the Christian.<a name=38:2000></a> They exhibit to us, in ceremonial garb, two things which we specially need, namely, spiritual energy to move onward through the element which surrounds us, and the power to preserve us from its action.<a name=38:2001></a> The one will not avail without the other.<a name=38:2002></a> It is of no use to possess a capacity to get on, through the world, if we are not proof against the world's influence; and though we may seem to be able to keep the world out, yet if He have not the motive power, we are defective.<a name=38:2003></a> The "fins" would not do without the "scales," nor the "scales" without the "fins" Both were required, to render a fish ceremonially clean; and we, in order to be properly equipped, require to be encased against the penetrating influence of an evil world; and, at the same time, to be furnished with a capacity to pass rapidly on.<a name=38:2004></a>

		The whole deportment of a Christian should declare him a pilgrim and a stranger here.<a name=38:2005></a> "<i>Onward</i>" must be his motto -- ever and only, onward.<a name=38:2006></a> Let his locality and his circumstances be what they may, he is to have his eye fixed on a home beyond this perishing, passing world.<a name=38:2007></a> He is furnished, by grace, with spiritual ability to go forward -- to penetrate, energetically, through all, and carry out the earnest aspirations of his heaven-born spirit.<a name=38:2008></a> And, while thus vigorously pushing his way onward -- while "forcing his passage to the skies," he is to keep his inward man fenced round about, and fast closed up against all external influences.<a name=38:2009></a>

		Nor was it as to the mere matter of <i>eating</i> ought that was unclean that the people of God were so jealously guarded.<a name=38:2042></a> Bare <i>contact</i> was forbidden.<a name=38:2043></a> (See verse 8, 24, 26-28, 31-41) It was impossible for a member of the Israel of God to touch that which was unclean without contracting defilement.<a name=38:2044></a> This is a principle largely unfolded, both in the law and the prophets.<a name=38:2045></a> "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, ask ye now the priests concerning the law, saying, if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?<a name=38:2046></a> And the priests answered and said, No.<a name=38:2047></a> Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?<a name=38:2048></a> And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.<a name=38:2049></a>" (Haggai 2: 11-13) Jehovah would have His people holy in all things.<a name=38:2050></a> They were neither to eat nor touch ought that was unclean.<a name=38:2051></a> "Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.<a name=38:2052></a>" Then follows the powerful reason for all this careful separation.<a name=38:2053></a> "<i>For I am The Lord your God</i>: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; <i>for I am holy</i>: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<a name=38:2054></a> For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be <i>your God</i>: ye shall therefore be holy, <i>for I am holy</i>" (verse 43-45).<a name=38:2055></a>

		It is well to see that the personal holiness of God's people -- their entire separation from all manner of uncleanness, flows out of their relationship to Him.<a name=38:2056></a> It is not upon the principle of "stand by thyself, I am holier than thou;' but simply this, "God is holy," and therefore all who are brought into association with Him must be holy, likewise.<a name=38:2057></a> It is, in every way, worthy of God that <i>His</i> people should be holy.<a name=38:2058></a> "Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, for ever.<a name=38:2059></a>" What else save holiness could become the house of such an One as Jehovah If any one had asked an Israelite, of old, "Why do you shrink so from that reptile which crawls along the path?<a name=38:2060></a>" He would have replied, "Jehovah is holy; and I belong to Him.<a name=38:2061></a> He has said' Touch not.<a name=38:2062></a>" So, also, now, if a Christian be asked why he walks apart from the ten thousand things in which the men of this world participate, his answer is simply to be, "<i>My Father is holy</i>.<a name=38:2063></a>" This is the true foundation of personal holiness.<a name=38:2064></a> The more we contemplate the divine character, and enter into the power of our relationship to God, in Christ, by the energy of the Holy Ghost, the holier we must, of necessity, be.<a name=38:2065></a> There can be no progress in the condition of holiness into which the believer is introduced; but there is, and ought to be, progress in the apprehension, experience, and practical exhibition of that holiness.<a name=38:2066></a> These things should never be confounded.<a name=38:2067></a> All believers are in the same condition of holiness or sanctification; but their practical measure may vary to any conceivable degree.<a name=38:2068></a> This is easily understood.<a name=38:2069></a> The condition arises out of our <i>being brought</i> nigh to God, by the blood of the cross; the practical measure will depend upon our <i>keeping</i> nigh, by the power of the Spirit.<a name=38:2070></a> It is not a man setting up for something superior in himself -- for a greater degree of personal sanctity than is ordinarily possessed -- for being, in any wise, better than his; neighbours.<a name=38:2071></a> All such pretensions are utterly contemptible, in the judgement of every right-thinking person.<a name=38:2072></a> But then, if God, in His exceeding grace, stoop down to our low estate, and lift us into the holy elevation of His blessed presence, in association with Christ, has He not a right to prescribe what our character is to be, as thus brought nigh?<a name=38:2073></a> Who could think of calling in question a truth so obvious And, further, are we not bound to aim at the maintenance of that character which He prescribes?<a name=38:2074></a> Are we to be accused of presumption for so doing Was it presumption in an Israelite to refuse to touch Nay, it would have been presumption of the most daring and dangerous character to have done so.<a name=38:2075></a> True, he might not have been able to make an uncircumcised stranger understand or appreciate the reason of his conduct; but this was not his province.<a name=38:2076></a> Jehovah had said, "Touch not," not because an Israelite was holier in himself than a stranger; but because Jehovah was holy, and Israel belonged to Him.<a name=38:2077></a> It needed the eye and the heart of a circumcised disciple of the law of God, in order to discern what was clean and what was not.<a name=38:2078></a> An alien knew no difference.<a name=38:2079></a> Thus it must ever be.<a name=38:2080></a> It is only Wisdom's children that can justify her and approve her heavenly ways.<a name=38:2081></a>

		Ere turning from Leviticus 11, my reader might, with much spiritual profit, compare it with the tenth chapter of Acts, verse 11-16.<a name=38:2082></a> How strange is must have appeared to one who had, from his earliest days, been taught in the principles of the Mosaic ritual, to see a vessel descending from heaven, "wherein were <i>all manner</i> of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and <i>creeping things</i>, and fowls of the air;" and not only to see such a vessel, so filled, but also to hear a voice, saying, "Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.<a name=38:2083></a>" How wonderful.<a name=38:2084></a> No examination of hoofs or habits!<a name=38:2085></a> There was no need of this.<a name=38:2086></a> The vessel and its contents had come from heaven.<a name=38:2087></a> This was enough.<a name=38:2088></a> The Jew might ensconce himself behind the narrow enclosures of the Jewish ritual, and exclaim, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean;" but, then, the tide of divine grace was rising, majestically, above all such enclosures, in order to embrace, in its mighty compass, "all manner" of objects, and bear them upward to heaven, in the power and on the authority of those precious words, "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.<a name=38:2089></a>" It mattered not what was in the vessel, if God had cleansed it.<a name=38:2090></a> The Author of the Book of Leviticus was about to raise the thoughts of His servant above the barriers which that book had erected, into all the magnificence of heaven's grace.<a name=38:2091></a> He would teach him that true cleanness -- the cleanness which heaven demanded, was no longer to consist in chewing the cud, dividing the hoof, or any such ceremonial marks, but in being washed in the blood of the Lamb, which cleanseth from all sin, and renders the believer clean enough to tread the sapphire pavement of the heavenly courts.<a name=38:2092></a>

		This was a noble lesson for a Jew to learn.<a name=38:2093></a> It was a divine lesson, before the light of which the shadows of the old economy must pass away.<a name=38:2094></a> The hand of sovereign grace has thrown open the door of the kingdom; but not to admit ought that is unclean.<a name=38:2095></a> This could not be.<a name=38:2096></a> Nothing unclean can enter heaven.<a name=38:2097></a> But, then, a cloven hoof was no longer to be the criterion; but "<i>what God hath cleansed</i>.<a name=38:2098></a>" When God cleanses a man, he must needs be clean.<a name=38:2099></a> Peter was about to be sent to open the kingdom to the Gentiles, as he had already opened it to the Jews; and his Jewish heart needed to be enlarged.<a name=38:2100></a> He needed to get above the dark shadows of a by-gone age, into the meridian light that was shining from an open heaven, in virtue of a completed sacrifice.<a name=38:2101></a> He needed to get out of the narrow current of Jewish prejudices, should be borne upon the bosom of that mighty tide of grace which was about to roll through the length and breadth of a lost world.<a name=38:2102></a> He had to learn, too, that the standard by which true cleanness must be regulated, was no longer carnal, ceremonial, and earthly, but spiritual, moral, and heavenly.<a name=38:2103></a> Assuredly, we may say, these were noble lessons for the apostle of the circumcision to learn upon the housetop of Simon the tanner.<a name=38:2104></a> They were eminently calculated to soften, to expand, and elevate a mind which had been trained amid the contracting influences of the Jewish system.<a name=38:2105></a> We bless the Lord for these precious lessons.<a name=38:2106></a> We bless Him for the large and wealthy place in which He has set us, by the blood of the cross.<a name=38:2107></a> We bless Him that we are no longer hemmed round about by "touch not this; taste not that; handle not the other thing; but that His Lord assures us that "every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer" (1 Timothy 4: 4, 5).<a name=38:2108></a>

		This brief section reads out to us, after its own peculiar fashion, the double lesson of "man's ruin and God's remedy.<a name=38:2109></a>" But though the fashion is peculiar, the lesson is most distinct and impressive.<a name=38:2110></a> It is, at once, deeply humbling and divinely comforting.<a name=38:2111></a> The effect of all scripture, when interpreted to one's own soul, directly, by the power of the Holy Ghost, is to lead us out of self to Christ.<a name=38:2112></a> wherever we see our fallen nature -- at whatever stage of its history we contemplate it, whether in its conception, at its birth, or at any point along its whole career, from the womb to the coffin, it wears the double stamp of iniquity and defilement.<a name=38:2113></a> This is, sometimes, forgotten amid the glitter and glare, the pomp and fashion, the wealth and splendour of human life.<a name=38:2114></a> The mind of man is fruitful in devices to cover his humiliation.<a name=38:2115></a> In various ways he seeks to ornament and gild, and put on an appearance of strength and glory; but it is all vain.<a name=38:2116></a> He has only to be seen as he enters this world, a poor helpless creature; or, as he passes away from it, to take his place with the clod of the valley, in order to have a most convincing proof of the hollowness of all his pride, the vanity of all his glory.<a name=38:2117></a> Those whose path through this world has been brightened by what man calls glory, have entered in nakedness and helplessness, and retreated amid disease and death.<a name=38:2118></a>

		The shadow of this cross passes before us in a double way in our chapter; first, in the circumcision of the "man child," whereby he became enrolled as a member of the Israel of God; and, secondly, in the burnt offering and sin offering, whereby the mother was restored from every defiling influence, rendered fit, once more, to approach the sanctuary, and to come in contact with holy things.<a name=38:2132></a> "And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle dove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest; who shall offer it before the Lord, and make, an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.<a name=38:2133></a> This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.<a name=38:2134></a>" (verse 6, 7) The death of Christ, in its two grand aspects, is here introduced to our thoughts, as the only thing which could possibly meet, and perfectly remove, the defilement connected with man's natural birth.<a name=38:2135></a> The burnt offering presents the death of Christ, according to the divine estimate thereof; the sin offering, on the other hand, presents the death of Christ, as bearing upon the sinner's need.<a name=38:2136></a>

		But, there is another invaluable lesson furnished by this twelfth chapter of Leviticus.<a name=38:2196></a> We not only read, herein, the grace of God to the poor, but, by comparing its closing verse with Luke 2: 24, we learn the amazing depth to which God stooped in order to manifest that grace.<a name=38:2197></a> The Lord Jesus Christ, God manifest in the flesh, the pure and spotless Lamb, the Holy One, who knew no Sin, was "made of a woman," and that woman -- wondrous mystery!<a name=38:2198></a> -- having borne in her womb, and brought forth, that pure and perfect, that holy and spotless human body, had to undergo the usual ceremonial, and accomplish the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses.<a name=38:2199></a> And not only do we read divine grace in the fact of her having thus to purify herself, but also the mode in which this was accomplished.<a name=38:2200></a> "And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, <i>a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons</i>.<a name=38:2201></a>" From this simple circumstance we learn that the reputed parents of our blessed Lord Jesus were so poor, as to be obliged to take advantage of the gracious provision made for those whose means did not afford "a lamb for a burnt offering.<a name=38:2202></a>" What a thought!<a name=38:2203></a> The Lord of Glory, the most High God, Possessor of heaven and earth, the One to whom pertained "the cattle upon a thousand hills" -- yea, the wealth of the universe -- appeared in the world which His hands had made, in the narrow circumstances of humble life.<a name=38:2204></a> The Levitical economy had made provision for the poor, and the mother of Jesus availed herself thereof.<a name=38:2205></a> Truly, there is a profound lesson in this for the human heart.<a name=38:2206></a> The Lord Jesus did not make his appearance, in this world, in connection with the great or the noble.<a name=38:2207></a> He was pre-eminently a poor man.<a name=38:2208></a> He took His place with the poor.<a name=38:2209></a> "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich" (2 Corinthians 8: 9).<a name=38:2210></a>

		May it ever be our joy to feed upon this precious grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which we have been made rich for time and for eternity.<a name=38:2211></a> He emptied Himself of all that love could give, that we might be filled.<a name=38:2212></a> He stripped Himself, that we might be clothed.<a name=38:2213></a> He died, that we might live.<a name=38:2214></a> He, in the greatness of His grace, travelled down from the height of divine wealth into the depth of human poverty, in order that we might be raised from the dunghill of nature's ruin, to take our place amid the princes of His people, for ever.<a name=38:2215></a> Oh!<a name=38:2216></a> that the sense of this grace, wrought in our hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost, may constrain us to a more unreserved surrender of ourselves to Him, to whom we owe our present and everlasting felicity, our riches, our life, our all!<a name=38:2217></a>

		LEVITICUS 13-14.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of all the functions which, according to the Mosaic ritual, the priest had to discharge, none demanded more patient attention, or more strict adherence to the divine guide-book, than the discernment and proper treatment of leprosy.<a name=38:2218></a> This fact must be obvious to every one who studies, with any measure of care, the very extensive and important section of our book at which we have now arrived.<a name=38:2219></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were two things which claimed the priest's vigilant care, namely, the purity of the assembly, and the grace which could not admit of the exclusion of any member, save on the most clearly-established grounds.<a name=38:2220></a> Holiness could not permit any one to remain in who ought to be out; and, on the other hand, grace would not have any one out who ought to be in.<a name=38:2221></a> Hence, therefore, there was the most urgent need, on the part of the priest, of watchfulness, calmness, wisdom, patience, tenderness, and enlarged experience.<a name=38:2222></a> Things might seem trifling which, in reality, were serious; and things might look like leprosy which were not it at all.<a name=38:2223></a> The greatest care and coolness were needed.<a name=38:2224></a> Judgement rashly formed, a conclusion hastily arrived at, might involve the most serious consequences, either as regards the assembly or some individual member thereof.<a name=38:2225></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This will account for the frequent occurrence of such expressions as the following, namely, "The priest shall look;" -- "The, priest shall shut up him that hath the plague <i>seven days</i>;" -- "And the priest shall look on him the seventh day;" -- "Then the priest shall shut him up <i>seven days more</i>" -- "And the priest <i>shall look on him again</i> the seventh day;" -- "And the priest shall <i>see him</i>;" -- "Then the priest shall <i>consider</i>.<a name=38:2226></a>" No case was to be hastily judged, or rashly decided.<a name=38:2227></a> No opinion was to be formed from mere hearsay.<a name=38:2228></a> Personal observation, priestly discernment, calm reflection, strict adherence to the written word -- the holy, infallible guide book -- all these things were imperatively demanded of the priest, if he would form a sound judgement of each case.<a name=38:2229></a> He was not to be guided by his own thoughts, his own feelings, his own wisdom, in any thing.<a name=38:2230></a> He had ample guidance in the word, if only he was subject thereto.<a name=38:2231></a> Every point, every feature, every movement, every variation, every shade and character, every peculiar symptom and affection -- all was provided for, with divine fullness and forethought; so that the priest only needed to be acquainted with, and subject to, the word in all things, in order to be preserved from ten thousand mistakes.<a name=38:2232></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to the priest and his holy responsibilities.<a name=38:2233></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now consider the disease of leprosy, as developed in a person, in a garment, or in a house.<a name=38:2234></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Looking at this disease in a physical point of view, nothing can possibly be more loathsome; and being, so far as man is concerned, totally incurable, it furnishes a most vivid and appalling picture of sin -- sin in one's natures -- in his circumstances -- sin in an assembly.<a name=38:2235></a> What a lesson for the soul in the fact that such a vile and humiliating disease should be used as a type of moral evil, whether in a member of God's assembly, in the circumstances of any member, or in the assembly itself!<a name=38:2236></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. And first, then, as to leprosy in a person; or, in other words, the working of moral evil, or of that which might seem to be evil, in any member of the assembly.<a name=38:2237></a> This is a matter of grave and solemn import -- a matter demanding the utmost vigilance and care on the part of all who are concerned in the good of souls and in the glory of God, as involved in the well-being and purity of His assembly as a whole, or of each individual member thereof.<a name=38:2238></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to see that, while the broad principles of leprosy and its cleansing apply, in a secondary sense, to any sinner, yet, in the scripture now before us, the matter is presented in connection with those who were God's recognised people.<a name=38:2239></a> The person who is here seen as the subject of priestly examination, is a member of the assembly of God.<a name=38:2240></a> It is well to apprehend this.<a name=38:2241></a> God's assembly must be kept pure, because it is His dwelling-place.<a name=38:2242></a> No leper can be allowed to remain within the hallowed precincts of Jehovah's habitation.<a name=38:2243></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, then, mark the care, the vigilance, the perfect patience, inculcated upon the priest, lest ought that was not leprosy might be treated as such, or lest ought that really was leprosy might be suffered to escape.<a name=38:2244></a> Many things might appear "in the skin" -- the place of manifestation" -- like the plague of leprosy," which, upon patient, priestly investigation, would be found to be merely superficial.<a name=38:2245></a> This was to be carefully attended to.<a name=38:2246></a> Some blemish might make its appearance, upon the surface, which, though demanding the jealous care of the one who had to act for God, was not, in reality, defiling.<a name=38:2247></a> And, yet, that which seemed but a superficial blemish might prove to be something deeper than the skin, something below the surface, something affecting the hidden springs of the constitution.<a name=38:2248></a> All this claimed the most intense care on the part of the priest.<a name=38:2249></a> (See verse 2-11) Some slight neglect, some trifling oversight, might lead to disastrous consequences.<a name=38:2250></a> It might lead to the defilement of the assembly, by the presence of a confirmed leper, or to the expulsion, for some superficial blemish, of a genuine member of the Israel of God.<a name=38:2251></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there is a rich fund of instruction in all this for the people of God.<a name=38:2252></a> There is a difference between personal infirmity and the positive energy of evil -- between mere defects and blemishes in the outward character, and the activity of sin in the members.<a name=38:2253></a> No doubt, it is important to watch against our infirmities; for, if not watched, judged, and guarded against, they may become the source of positive evil.<a name=38:2254></a> (See verse 14-25) Everything of nature must be judged and kept down.<a name=38:2255></a> We must not make any allowance for personal infirmity, <i>in ourselves</i>, though we should make ample allowance for it <i>in others</i>.<a name=38:2256></a> Take, for example, the matter of an irritable temper.<a name=38:2257></a> I should judge it in myself; I should make allowance for it in another.<a name=38:2258></a> It may, like "the burning boil," in the case of an Israelite, (verse 19, 20,) prove the source of real defilement -- the ground of exclusion from the assembly.<a name=38:2259></a> Every form of weakness must be watched, lest it become an occasion of sin.<a name=38:2260></a> "A bald forehead" was not leprosy, but it was that in which leprosy might appear, and, hence, it had to be watched.<a name=38:2261></a> There may be a hundred things which are not, in themselves, sinful, but which may become the occasion of sin, if not diligently looked after.<a name=38:2262></a> Nor is it merely a question of what, in our estimation, may be termed Blots, blemishes, and personal infirmities, but even of what our hearts might feel disposed to boast of.<a name=38:2263></a> Wit, humour, vivacity of spirit and temper; all these may become the source and centre of defilement.<a name=38:2264></a> Each one has something to guard against -- something to keep him ever upon the watch-tower.<a name=38:2265></a> How happy it is that we have a Father's heart to come to and count on, with respect to all such things We have the precious privilege of coming, at all times, into the presence of unrebuking, unupbraiding love, there to tell out all, and obtain grace to help in all, and full victory over all.<a name=38:2266></a> We need not be discouraged, so long as we see such a motto inscribed on the door of our Father's treasury, "He giveth more grace.<a name=38:2267></a>" Precious motto!<a name=38:2268></a> It has no limit.<a name=38:2269></a> It is bottomless and boundless.<a name=38:2270></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now proceed to inquire what was done in every case in which the plague of leprosy was unquestionably and unmistakably defined.<a name=38:2271></a> The God of Israel could bear with infirmity, blemish, and failure; but the moment it became a case of defilement, whether in the head, the beard, the forehead, or any other part, it could not be tolerated in the holy assembly.<a name=38:2272></a> "The leper, in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.<a name=38:2273></a> All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.<a name=38:2274></a>" (verse 45, 46) Here was the leper's condition -- the leper's occupation -- the leper's place.<a name=38:2275></a> With rent garments, bare head, and covered lip; crying, Unclean, unclean; and dwelling outside, in the dreary solitude, the dismal desert waste.<a name=38:2276></a> What could be more humiliating, what more depressing than this?<a name=38:2277></a> "He shall dwell alone.<a name=38:2278></a>" He was unfit for communion or companionship.<a name=38:2279></a> He was excluded from the only spot, in all the world, in which Jehovah's presence was known or enjoyed.<a name=38:2280></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, behold, in the poor, solitary leper, a vivid type of one in whom sin is working.<a name=38:2281></a> This is really what it means.<a name=38:2282></a> It is not, as we shall see presently, a helpless, ruined, guilty, convicted sinner, whose guilt and misery have come thoroughly out, and who is, therefore, a fit subject for the love of God, and the blood of Christ.<a name=38:2283></a> No; we see in the excluded leper, one in whom sin is actually working -- one in whom there is the positive energy of evil.<a name=38:2284></a> this is what defiles and shuts out from the enjoyment of the divine presence and the communion of saints.<a name=38:2285></a> So long as sin is working, there can be no fellowship with God, or with His people.<a name=38:2286></a> "He shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.<a name=38:2287></a>" How long?<a name=38:2288></a> "All the days wherein the <i>plague</i> shall be <i>in</i> him.<a name=38:2289></a>" This is a great practical truth.<a name=38:2290></a> The energy of evil is the death-blow to communion.<a name=38:2291></a> There may be the outward appearance, the mere form, the hollow profession; but communion there can be none, so long as the energy of evil is there.<a name=38:2292></a> It matters not what the character or amount of the evil may be, if it were but the weight of a feather, if it were but some foolish thought, so long as it continues to work, it must hinder communion, it must cause a suspension of fellowship.<a name=38:2293></a> It is when it rises to a head, when it comes to the surface, when it is brought thoroughly out, that it can be perfectly met and put away by the grace of God and by the blood of the Lamb.<a name=38:2294></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us to a deeply-interesting point in connection with the leper -- a point which must prove a complete paradox to all save those who understand God's mode of dealing with sinners.<a name=38:2295></a> "And if a leprosy break; out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague, from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; then the priest shall consider; and, behold, if the leprosy be covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.<a name=38:2296></a>" (Leviticus 13: 12, 13) The moment a sinner is in his true place before God, the whole question is settled.<a name=38:2297></a> Directly his real character is fully brought out, there is no further difficulty.<a name=38:2298></a> He may have to pass through much painful exercise, ere he reaches this point -- exercise consequent upon his refusal to take his true place -- to bring out "all the truth," with respect to what he is; but the moment he is brought to say, from his heart, "<i>just as I am</i>," the free grace of God flows down to him.<a name=38:2299></a> "When I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long.<a name=38:2300></a> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.<a name=38:2301></a>" (Psalm 32: 3, 4) How long did this painful exercise continue?<a name=38:2302></a> Until the whole truth was brought out -- until all that which was working inwardly came fully to the surface.<a name=38:2303></a> "I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin" (verse 5).<a name=38:2304></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is deeply interesting to mark the progress of the Lord's dealing with the leprous man, from the moment that the suspicion is raised, by certain features in the place of manifestation, until the disease covers the whole man, "from the crown of the head unto the sole of the foot.<a name=38:2305></a>" There was no haste, and no indifference.<a name=38:2306></a> God ever enters the place of judgement with a slow and measured pace; but when He does enter, He must act according to the claims of His nature.<a name=38:2307></a> He can patiently investigate.<a name=38:2308></a> He can wait for "seven days;" and should there be the slightest variation in the symptoms, He can wait for "seven days more;" but, the moment it is found to be the positive working of leprosy, there can be no toleration.<a name=38:2309></a> "Without the camp shall his habitation be.<a name=38:2310></a>" How long?<a name=38:2311></a> Until the disease comes fully to the surface.<a name=38:2312></a> "If the leprosy have covered <i>all</i> his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean.<a name=38:2313></a>" This is a most precious and interesting point.<a name=38:2314></a> The very smallest speck of leprosy was intolerable to God; and yet, when the whole man was covered, from head to foot, he was pronounced clean -- that is, he was a proper subject for the grace of God and the blood of atonement.<a name=38:2315></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus is it, in every case, with the sinner.<a name=38:2316></a> God is "Of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look upon iniquity;" (Habakkuk 1: 13;) and yet, the moment a sinner takes his true place, as one thoroughly lost guilty, and undone -- as one in whom there is not so much as a single point on which the eye of Infinite Holiness can rest with complacency -- as one who is so bad, that he cannot, possibly, be worse, there is an immediate, a perfect, a divine settlement of the entire matter.<a name=38:2317></a> The grace of God deals with sinners; and when I know myself to be a sinner, I know myself to be one whom Christ came to save.<a name=38:2318></a> The more clearly any one can prove me to be a sinner, the more clearly he establishes my title to the love of God, and the work of Christ.<a name=38:2319></a> "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.<a name=38:2320></a>" (1 Peter 3: 18) Now, if I am "unjust;" I am one of those very people for whom Christ died, and I am entitled to all the benefits of His death.<a name=38:2321></a> "There is not a just man upon earth;" and, inasmuch as I am "Upon earth," it is plain that I am "unjust;" and it is equally plain that Christ died for me -- that he suffered for my sins.<a name=38:2322></a> Since, therefore, Christ died for me, it is my happy privilege to enter into the immediate enjoyment of the fruits of His sacrifice.<a name=38:2323></a> This is as plain as plainness itself.<a name=38:2324></a> It demands no effort whatsoever.<a name=38:2325></a> I am not called to be anything but just what I am.<a name=38:2326></a> I am not called to feel, to experience, to realise anything.<a name=38:2327></a> The word of God assures me that Christ died for me just as I am; and if He died for me I am as safe as He is Himself.<a name=38:2328></a> There is nothing against me.<a name=38:2329></a> Christ met all.<a name=38:2330></a> He not only suffered for my "<i>sins</i>," but He "made an end of <i>sin</i>.<a name=38:2331></a>" He abolished the entire system in which, as a child of the first Adam, I stood, and He has introduced me into a new position, in association with Himself, and there I stand, before God, free from all charge of sin, and all fear of judgement.<a name=38:2332></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest: and the priest shall go forth out of the camp.<a name=38:2430></a>" (Leviticus 14: 1-3) We have already seen the place which the leper occupied.<a name=38:2431></a> He was outside the camp, in the place of moral distance from God -- from His sanctuary and His assembly.<a name=38:2432></a> Moreover, he dwelt in dreary solitude, in a condition of uncleanness.<a name=38:2433></a> He was beyond the reach of human aid; and, as for himself, he could only communicate defilement to every one and every thing he touched.<a name=38:2434></a> It was, therefore, obviously impossible that he could do ought to cleanse himself.<a name=38:2435></a> If, indeed, he could only defile by his very touch, how could he possibly cleanse himself How could he contribute towards, or co-operate in, his cleansing?<a name=38:2436></a> Impossible.<a name=38:2437></a> As an unclean leper, he could not do so much as a single thing for himself; <i>all</i> had to be done <i>for</i> him.<a name=38:2438></a> He could not make his way to God, but God could make His way to him.<a name=38:2439></a> He was shut up to God.<a name=38:2440></a> There was no help for him, either in himself or in his fellow-man.<a name=38:2441></a> It is clear that one leper could not cleanse another; and it is equally clear that if a leper touched a clean person he rendered him unclean.<a name=38:2442></a> His <i>only</i> resource was in God.<a name=38:2443></a> He was to be a debtor to grace for everything.<a name=38:2444></a>

		Hence we read, "The priest shall go forth out of the camp.<a name=38:2445></a> It is not said, "the leper shall go.<a name=38:2446></a>" this was wholly out of the question.<a name=38:2447></a> It was of no use talking to the leper about going or doing.<a name=38:2448></a> He was consigned to dreary solitude; whither could he go?<a name=38:2449></a> He was involved in helpless defilement; what could he do?<a name=38:2450></a> He might long for fellowship and long to be clean; but his longings were those of a lonely helpless leper.<a name=38:2451></a> He might make efforts after cleansing; but his efforts could but prove him unclean, and tend to spread defilement.<a name=38:2452></a> Before ever he could be pronounced "clean," a work; had to be wrought for him -- a work which he could neither do nor help to do -- a work which had to be wholly accomplished by another.<a name=38:2453></a> The leper was called to "stand still," and behold the priest doing a work in virtue of which the leprosy could be perfectly cleansed.<a name=38:2454></a> The priest accomplished <i>all</i>.<a name=38:2455></a> The leper did <i>nothing</i>.<a name=38:2456></a>

		"Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed, two birds, alive and clean, and cedarwood, and scarlet, and hyssop.<a name=38:2457></a> and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.<a name=38:2458></a>" In the priest going forth from the camp -- forth from God's dwelling place -- we behold the blessed Lord Jesus coming down from the bosom of the Father, His eternal dwelling-place, into this polluted world of ours, where He beheld us sunk in the polluting leprosy of sin.<a name=38:2459></a> He, like the good Samaritan, "came where we were.<a name=38:2460></a>" He did not come half-way, merely.<a name=38:2461></a> He did not come nine-tenths of the way.<a name=38:2462></a> He came all the way.<a name=38:2463></a> This was indispensable.<a name=38:2464></a> He could not, consistently with the holy claims of the throne of God, have bidden our leprosy to depart had He remained in the bosom.<a name=38:2465></a> He could call worlds into existence by the word of His mouth; but when leprous sinners had to be cleansed, something more was needed.<a name=38:2466></a> "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.<a name=38:2467></a>" When worlds were to be framed, God had but to speak, When sinners had to be saved, He had to give His Son.<a name=38:2468></a> "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.<a name=38:2469></a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4: 9, 10).<a name=38:2470></a>

		But there was far more to be accomplished than the mission and incarnation of the Son.<a name=38:2471></a> It would have availed the leper but little indeed, had the priest merely gone forth from the camp and looked upon his low and forlorn condition.<a name=38:2472></a> Blood shedding was essentially necessary ere leprosy could be removed.<a name=38:2473></a> The death of a spotless victim was needed.<a name=38:2474></a> "Without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=38:2475></a>" (Hebrews 9: 22) And, be it observed, that the shedding of blood was the real basis of the leper's cleansing.<a name=38:2476></a> It was not a mere circumstance which, in conjunction with others, contributed to the leper's cleansing.<a name=38:2477></a> By no means.<a name=38:2478></a> the giving up of the life was the grand and all-important fact.<a name=38:2479></a> when this was accomplished the way was open; every barrier was removed; God could deal in perfect grace with the leper.<a name=38:2480></a> this point should be distinctly laid hold of, if my reader would fully enter into the glorious doctrine of the blood.<a name=38:2481></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.<a name=38:2482></a>" Here we have the acknowledged type of the death of Christ, "who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God.<a name=38:2483></a>" "He was crucified in weakness.<a name=38:2484></a>" (Hebrews 9; 2 Corinthians 13) The greatest, the mightiest, the most glorious, the most momentous work that ever was accomplished, throughout the wide universe of God, was wrought "in weakness.<a name=38:2485></a>" Oh!<a name=38:2486></a> my reader, how terrible a thing must sin be, in the judgement of God, when His own beloved Son had to come down from heaven, and hang upon yonder cursed tree, a spectacle to men, to angels, and to devils, in order that you and I might be forgiven!<a name=38:2487></a> And what a type of sin have we in leprosy!<a name=38:2488></a> Who would have thought that that little "bright spot" appearing on the person of some member of the congregation was a matter of such grave consequence?<a name=38:2489></a> But, ah!<a name=38:2490></a> that little "bright spot" was nothing less than the energy of evil, in the place of manifestation.<a name=38:2491></a> It was the index of the dreadful working of sin in the nature; and ere that person could be fitted for a place in the assembly, or for the enjoyment of communion with a holy God, the Son of God had to leave those bright heavens, and descend into the lowest parts of the earth, in order to make a full atonement for that which exhibited itself merely in the form of a little "bright spot.<a name=38:2492></a>" Let us remember this.<a name=38:2493></a> Sin is a dreadful thing in the estimation of God.<a name=38:2494></a> He cannot tolerate so much as a single sinful thought.<a name=38:2495></a> Before one such thought could be forgiven, Christ had to die upon the cross.<a name=38:2496></a> The most trifling sin, if any sin can be called trifling, demanded nothing less than the death of God's Eternal and Co-equal Son.<a name=38:2497></a> But, eternal praise be to God, what sin demanded, redeeming love freely gave; and now God is infinitely more glorified in the forgiveness of sins than He could have been had Adam maintained his original innocency.<a name=38:2498></a> God is more glorified in the salvation, the pardon, the justification, the preservation, and final glorification of guilty man, than He could have been in maintaining an innocent man in the enjoyment of creation blessings.<a name=38:2499></a> Such is the precious mystery of redemption.<a name=38:2500></a> May our hearts enter, by the power of the Holy Ghost, into the living and profound depths of this wondrous mystery!<a name=38:2501></a>

		We could hardly have a more perfect type of the resurrection of Christ than that presented in "the living bird let loose into the open field.<a name=38:2510></a>" It was not let go until after the death of its companion; for the two birds typify one Christ, in two stages of His blessed work, namely, death and resurrection.<a name=38:2511></a> Ten thousand birds let loose would not have availed for the leper.<a name=38:2512></a> It was that living bird, mounting upward into the open heavens, bearing upon his wing that significant token of accomplished atonement -- it was that which told out the great fact that the work was done -- the ground cleared, the foundation laid.<a name=38:2513></a> Thus is it in reference to our blessed Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:2514></a> His resurrection declares the glorious triumph of redemption.<a name=38:2515></a> "He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.<a name=38:2516></a>" "He was raised again for our justification.<a name=38:2517></a>" It is this that sets the burdened heart free, and liberates the struggling conscience.<a name=38:2518></a> The scripture assures me that Jesus was nailed to the cross under the weight of my sins; but the same Scriptures assure me that He rose from the grave without one of those sins upon Him.<a name=38:2519></a> Nor is this all.<a name=38:2520></a> The same Scriptures assure me that all who put their trust in Jesus are as free from all charge of guilt as He is; that there is no more wrath or condemnation for them than for Him; that they are in Him, one with Him, accepted in Him; co-quickened, co-raised, co-seated with Him.<a name=38:2521></a> Such is the peace giving testimony of the Scriptures of truth -- such, the record of God who cannot lie (see Romans 6: 6-11; Romans 8: 1-4; 2 Cor, 5: 21; Ephesians 2: 5, 6; Colossians 2: 10-15, 1 John 4: 17).<a name=38:2522></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have another most important truth set before us in ver 6 of our chapter.<a name=38:2523></a> We not only see our full deliverance from guilt and condemnation, as beautifully exhibited in the living bird let loose, but we see also our entire deliverance from all the attractions of earth and all the influences of nature.<a name=38:2524></a> "The scarlet" would be the apt expression of the former, while "the cedar wood and hyssop" would set forth the latter.<a name=38:2525></a> The cross is the end of all this world's glory.<a name=38:2526></a> God presents it as such, and the believer recognises it as such.<a name=38:2527></a> "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world" (Galatians 6: 14).<a name=38:2528></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as to the "cedar wood and hyssop," they present to us, as it were, the two extremes of nature's wide range.<a name=38:2529></a> Solomon "spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall.<a name=38:2530></a>" (1 Kings 4: 33) From the lofty cedar which crowns the sides of Lebanon, down to the lowly hyssop -- the wide extremes and all that lies between -- nature, in all its departments, is brought under the power of the cross; so that the believer sees, in the death of Christ, the end of all his guilt, the end of all earth's glory, and the end of the whole system of nature -- the entire old creation.<a name=38:2531></a> And with what is he to be occupied?<a name=38:2532></a> With Him who is the Antitype of that living bird, with blood-stained feathers, ascending into the open heavens.<a name=38:2533></a> Precious, glorious, soul-satisfying object!<a name=38:2534></a> A risen, ascended, triumphant, glorified Christ, who has passed into the heavens, bearing in His sacred Person the marks of an accomplished atonement.<a name=38:2535></a> It is with Him we have to do.<a name=38:2536></a> We are shut up to Him.<a name=38:2537></a> He is God's exclusive object.<a name=38:2538></a> He is the centre of heaven's joy, the theme of angels' song.<a name=38:2539></a> We want none of earth's glory, none of nature's attractions.<a name=38:2540></a> We can behold them all, together with our sin and guilt, for ever set aside by the death of Christ.<a name=38:2541></a> We can well afford to dispense with earth and nature, inasmuch as we have gotten, instead thereof "the unsearchable riches of Christ.<a name=38:2542></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy, seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the bird loose into the open field.<a name=38:2543></a>" The more deeply we ponder over the contents of Leviticus 13 the more clearly we shall see how utterly impossible it was for the leper to do ought towards his own cleansing.<a name=38:2544></a> All he could do was to "put a covering upon his upper lip;" and all he could say was, "Unclean, unclean.<a name=38:2545></a>" It belonged to God, and to Him alone, to devise and accomplish a work whereby the leprosy could be perfectly cleansed; and, further, it belonged to God, and to Him alone, to pronounce the leper "clean.<a name=38:2546></a>" Hence it is written," the priest shall sprinkle;" and "he shall pronounce him clean.<a name=38:2547></a>" It is not said, "the leper shall sprinkle, and pronounce, or imagine himself, clean.<a name=38:2548></a>" This would never do.<a name=38:2549></a> God was the Judge -- God was the Healer -- God was the Cleanser.<a name=38:2550></a> He alone knew what leprosy was, how it could be put away, and when to pronounce the leper clean.<a name=38:2551></a> The leper might have gone on all his days covered with leprosy, and yet be wholly ignorant of what was wrong with him.<a name=38:2552></a> It was the word of God -- the Scriptures of truth -- the divine Record, that declared the full truth as to leprosy; and nothing short of the self-same authority could pronounce the leper clean, and that, moreover, only, on the solid and indisputable ground of death and resurrection.<a name=38:2553></a> There is the most precious connection between the three things in verse 7: the blood is sprinkled, the leper pronounced clean, and the living bird let loose.<a name=38:2554></a> There is not so much as a single syllable about what the leper was to do, to say, to think, or to feel.<a name=38:2555></a> It was enough that he was a leper; a fully revealed, a thoroughly judged leper, covered from head to foot.<a name=38:2556></a> this sufficed for him; all the rest pertained to God.<a name=38:2557></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of all importance, for the anxious inquirer after peace, to enter into the truth unfolded in this branch of our subject.<a name=38:2558></a> So many are tried by the question of <i>feeling, realising</i>, and <i>appropriating</i>, instead of seeing, as in the leper's case, that the sprinkling of the blood was as independent and as divine as the shedding of it.<a name=38:2559></a> It is not said, "The leper shall apply, appropriate, or realise, and then he shall be clean.<a name=38:2560></a>" By no means.<a name=38:2561></a> The plan of deliverance was divine; the provision of the sacrifice was divine; the shedding of the blood was divine; the sprinkling of the blood as divine; the record as to the result was divine: in short, it was all divine.<a name=38:2562></a>

		It is not that we should undervalue realisation, or, to speak more correctly, communion, through the Holy Ghost, with all the precious results of Christ's work for as.<a name=38:2563></a> Far from it: we shall see, presently, the place assigned thereto, in the divine economy.<a name=38:2564></a> But then, we are no more saved by realisation, than the leper was cleansed by it.<a name=38:2565></a> The gospel, by which we are saved, is that "Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.<a name=38:2566></a>" There is nothing about realisation here.<a name=38:2567></a> No doubt, it is happy to realise.<a name=38:2568></a> It is a very happy thing for one, who was just on the point of being drowned, to realise himself in a life-boat; but, clearly, he is saved by the boat and not by his realisation.<a name=38:2569></a> So it is with the sinner that believes on the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:2570></a> He is saved by death and resurrection.<a name=38:2571></a> Is it because he realises it?<a name=38:2572></a> No; but because God says it.<a name=38:2573></a> It is "according to the Scriptures.<a name=38:2574></a>" Christ died and rose again; and, on that ground, God pronounces him clean.<a name=38:2575></a>

The reader will observe, that a case of leprosy, in a person, or in a garment, might occur in the wilderness; but, in the matter of a house, it was, of necessity, confined to the land of Canaan.<a name=38:2775></a> "When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession, .<a name=38:2776></a>.<a name=38:2777></a>.<a name=38:2778></a> .<a name=38:2779></a>.<a name=38:2780></a>then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house.<a name=38:2781></a> And he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall; then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.<a name=38:2782></a>"

		Looking at the house as the type of an assembly, we have some weighty principles presented to us as to the divine method of dealing with moral evil, or suspicion of evil, in a congregation.<a name=38:2783></a> We observe the same holy calmness and perfect patience with respect to the house, as we have already seen, in reference to the person or the garment.<a name=38:2784></a> There was no haste, and no indifference, either as regards the house, the garment, or the individual.<a name=38:2785></a> The man who had an interest in the house was not to treat with indifference any suspicious symptoms appearing in the wall thereof; neither was he to pronounce judgement himself upon such symptoms.<a name=38:2786></a> It belonged to the priest to investigate and to judge.<a name=38:2787></a> The moment that ought of a questionable nature made its appearance, the priest assumed a judicial attitude with respect to the house.<a name=38:2788></a> The house was under judgement, though not condemned.<a name=38:2789></a> The perfect period was to be allowed to run its course, ere any decision could be arrived at.<a name=38:2790></a> The symptoms might prove to be merely superficial, in which case there would be no demand for any action whatever.<a name=38:2791></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, as to the moral of all this.<a name=38:2809></a> It is, at once, interesting, solemn, and practical.<a name=38:2810></a> Look, for example, at the church at Corinth.<a name=38:2811></a> It was a spiritual house, composed of spiritual stones; but, alas!<a name=38:2812></a> the eagle eye of the apostle discerned upon its walls certain symptoms of a most suspicious nature.<a name=38:2813></a> Was he indifferent?<a name=38:2814></a> Surely not.<a name=38:2815></a> He had imbibed far too much of the spirit of the Master of the house to admit, for one moment, of any such thing.<a name=38:2816></a> But he was no more hasty than indifferent.<a name=38:2817></a> He commanded the leprous stone to be removed, and gave the house a thorough scraping.<a name=38:2818></a> Having acted thus faithfully, he patiently awaited the result.<a name=38:2819></a> And what was that result?<a name=38:2820></a> All that the heart could desire.<a name=38:2821></a> "Nevertheless, God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; and not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more <i> .<a name=38:2822></a>.<a name=38:2823></a>.<a name=38:2824></a> .<a name=38:2825></a>.<a name=38:2826></a>.<a name=38:2827></a> .<a name=38:2828></a> In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter</i>.<a name=38:2829></a>" (Comp.<a name=38:2830></a> 1 Corinthians 5 with 2 Corinthians 7: 11) This is a lovely instance.<a name=38:2831></a> The zealous care of the apostle was amply rewarded; the plague was stayed, and the assembly delivered from the defiling influence of unjudged moral evil.<a name=38:2832></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take another solemn example.<a name=38:2833></a> "And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: These things saith he that hath the sharp sword with two edges; I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.<a name=38:2834></a> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.<a name=38:2835></a> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, Which thing I hate.<a name=38:2836></a> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.<a name=38:2837></a>" (Revelation 2: 12-16.<a name=38:2838></a>) Here the divine Priest stands in a judicial attitude with respect to His house at Pergamos.<a name=38:2839></a> He could not be indifferent to symptoms so alarming; but He patiently and graciously gives time to repent.<a name=38:2840></a> If reproof or warning, and discipline, prove unavailing, judgement must take its course.<a name=38:2841></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things are full of practical teaching as to the doctrine of the assembly.<a name=38:2842></a> The seven churches of Asia afford various striking illustrations of the house under priestly judgement.<a name=38:2843></a> We should ponder them deeply and prayerfully.<a name=38:2844></a> They are of immense value.<a name=38:2845></a> We should never sit down, at ease, so long as ought of a suspicious nature is making its appearance in the assembly.<a name=38:2846></a> We may be tempted to say, "It is none of my business;" but it is the business of every one who loves the Master of the house to have a jealous, godly care, for the purity of that house; and if we shrink; from the due exercise of this care, it will not be for our honour or profit, in the day of the Lord.<a name=38:2847></a>

		I shall not pursue this subject any further in these pages and shall merely remark, in closing this section, that I do not doubt, in the least, that this whole subject of leprosy has a great dispensational bearing, not only upon the house of Israel, but also upon the professing church.<a name=38:2848></a>

		LEVITICUS 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter treats of a variety of ceremonial uncleannesses of a much less serious nature than leprosy.<a name=38:2849></a> This latter would seem to be presented as the expression of the deep-seated energy of nature's evil; whereas, chapter 15 details a number of things which are merely unavoidable infirmities, but which, as being, in any measure the outflow of nature, were defiling, and needed the provisions of divine grace.<a name=38:2850></a> The divine presence in the assembly demanded a high order of holiness and moral purity.<a name=38:2851></a> Every movement of nature had to be counteracted.<a name=38:2852></a> Even things which, so far as man was concerned, might seem to be unavoidable weaknesses, had a defiling influence, and required cleaning, because Jehovah was in the camp.<a name=38:2853></a> Nothing offensive, nothing unsightly, nothing in any way uncomely, should be suffered within the pure, unsullied and sacred precincts of the presence of the God of Israel.<a name=38:2854></a> The uncircumcised nations around would have understood nothing of such holy ordinances; but Jehovah would have Israel holy, because He was Israel's God.<a name=38:2855></a> If they were to be privileged and distinguished by having the presence of a holy God, they would need to be a holy people.<a name=38:2856></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more calculated to elicit the soul's admiration than the jealous care of Jehovah over all the habits and practices of His people.<a name=38:2857></a> At home and abroad, asleep and awake, by day and by night, He guarded them.<a name=38:2858></a> He attended to their food, He attended to their clothing, He attended to their most minute and private concerns.<a name=38:2859></a> If some trifling spot appeared upon the person, it had to be instantly and carefully looked into.<a name=38:2860></a> In a word, nothing was overlooked which could, in any wise, affect the well-being or purity of those with whom Jehovah had associated Himself, and in whose midst He dwelt.<a name=38:2861></a> He took an interest in their most trivial affairs.<a name=38:2862></a> He carefully attended to everything connected with them, whether publicly, socially, or privately.<a name=38:2863></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, to an uncircumcised person, would have proved an intolerable burden.<a name=38:2864></a> For such an one to have a God of infinite holiness about his path, by day, and about his bed, by night, would have involved an amount of restraint beyond all power of endurance; but to a true lover of holiness, a lover of God, nothing; could be more delightful.<a name=38:2865></a> Such an one rejoices in the sweet assurance that God is always near; and he delights in the holiness which is, at once, demanded and secured by the presence of God.<a name=38:2866></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, say, is it thus with you?<a name=38:2867></a> Do you love the divine presence and the holiness which that presence demands?<a name=38:2868></a> are you indulging in anything incompatible with the holiness of God's presence?<a name=38:2869></a> Are your habits of thought, feeling, and action, such as comport with the purity and elevation of the sanctuary?<a name=38:2870></a> remember, when you read this fifteenth chapter of Leviticus, that it was written for your learning.<a name=38:2871></a> You are to read it in the Spirit, for to you it has a spiritual application.<a name=38:2872></a> To read it in any other way is to wrest it to your own destruction, or, to use a ceremonial phrase, "to seethe a kid in its mother's milk.<a name=38:2873></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you ask, "what am I to learn from such a section of Scripture?<a name=38:2874></a> What is its application to me?<a name=38:2875></a>' In the first place, let me ask, do you not admit that it was written for your learning?<a name=38:2876></a> This, I imagine, you will not question, seeing the inspired apostle so expressly declare that, "whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning.<a name=38:2877></a>" (Romans15: 4) Many seem to forget this important statement, at least, in so far as the book of Leviticus is concerned.<a name=38:2878></a> They cannot conceive it possible, that they are to learn ought from the rites and ceremonies of a by-gone age, and particularly from such rites and ceremonies as the fifteenth of Leviticus records.<a name=38:2879></a> But, when we remember, that God the Holy Ghost has written this very chapter -- that every paragraph, every verse, every line of it "is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable," it should lead us to inquire what it means.<a name=38:2880></a> Surely, what God has written His child should read.<a name=38:2881></a> No doubt, there is need of spiritual power to know <i>how</i>, and spiritual wisdom to know <i>when</i>, to read such a chapter; but the same holds good with respect to any chapter.<a name=38:2882></a> One thing is certain, if we were sufficiently spiritual, sufficiently heavenly, sufficiently abstracted from nature, and elevated above earth, we should deduce nought but purely spiritual principles and ideas from this and kindred chapters.<a name=38:2883></a> If an angel from heaven were to read such sections, how should he regard them?<a name=38:2884></a> Only in a spiritual and heavenly light; only as the depositories of the purest and highest morality.<a name=38:2885></a> And why should not we do the same?<a name=38:2886></a> I believe we are not aware of what positive contempt we pour upon the sacred Volume by suffering any portion of it to be so grossly neglected as the book of Leviticus has been.<a name=38:2887></a> If this book ought not to be read, surely it ought not to have been written.<a name=38:2888></a> If it be not "profitable," surely it ought not to have had a place assigned it in the canon of divine inspiration; but, inasmuch as it hath pleased "the only wise God" to write this book, it surely ought to please His children to read it.<a name=38:2889></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt, spiritual wisdom, holy discernment, and that refined moral sense, which only communion with God can impart -- all these things would be needed in order to form a judgement as to when such scripture ought to be read.<a name=38:2890></a> We should feel strongly disposed to question the sound judgement and refined taste of a man, who could stand up and read the fifteenth of Leviticus, in the midst of an ordinary congregation.<a name=38:2891></a> But why?<a name=38:2892></a> Is it because it is not "divinely inspired," and, as such, "profitable?<a name=38:2893></a>" By no means; but because the generality of persons are not sufficiently spiritual to enter into its pure and holy lessons.<a name=38:2894></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, then, are we to learn from the chapter before us?<a name=38:2895></a> In the first place, we learn to watch, with holy jealousy, everything that emanates from nature.<a name=38:2896></a> Every movement of, and every emanation from, nature is defiling.<a name=38:2897></a> Fallen human nature is an impure fountain, and all its streams are polluting.<a name=38:2898></a> It cannot send forth ought that is pure, holy, or good.<a name=38:2899></a> This is a lesson frequently inculcated in the Book of Leviticus, and it is impressively taught in this chapter.<a name=38:2900></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed be the grace that has made such ample provision for nature's defilement!<a name=38:2901></a> This provision is presented under two distinct forms, throughout the entire of the book of God, and throughout this section of it in particular -- namely, "water and blood.<a name=38:2902></a>" Both these are founded upon the death of Christ.<a name=38:2903></a> The blood that expiates and the water that cleanses flowed from the pierced side of a crucified Christ.<a name=38:2904></a> (Comp.<a name=38:2905></a> John 19: 34, with 1 John 5: 6) "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<a name=38:2906></a>" (1 John 1: 7) And the word of God cleanseth our practical habits and ways.<a name=38:2907></a> (Psalm119: 9; Ephesians5: 26) Thus, we are maintained in fitness for communion and worship, though passing through a scene where all is defiling, and carrying with us a nature, every movement of which leaves a soil behind.<a name=38:2908></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been already remarked that our chapter treats of a class of ceremonial defilement's less serious than leprosy.<a name=38:2909></a> This will account for the fact that atonement is here foreshadowed, not by a bullock or a lamb, but by the lowest order of sacrifice -- namely, "two turtle doves.<a name=38:2910></a>" But, on the other hand, the cleansing virtue of the Word is continually introduced, in the ceremonial actions of "washing," "bathing," and "rinsing.<a name=38:2911></a>" "Wherewithal shall a young man <i>cleanse</i> his way?<a name=38:2912></a> By taking heed thereto according to thy <i>word</i>.<a name=38:2913></a>" "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it; that he might <i>sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word</i>.<a name=38:2914></a>" Water held a most important place in the Levitical system of purification, and, as a type of the Word, nothing can be more interesting or instructive.<a name=38:2915></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we can gather up the most valuable points from this fifteenth chapter of Leviticus.<a name=38:2916></a> We learn, in a very striking manner, the intense holiness of the divine presence.<a name=38:2917></a> Not a soil, not a stain, not a speck can be tolerated, for a moment, in that thrice-hallowed region.<a name=38:2918></a> "Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them" (verse 31).<a name=38:2919></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, we learn that human nature is the overflowing fountain of uncleanness.<a name=38:2920></a> It is hopelessly defiled; and not only defiled, but defiling.<a name=38:2921></a> Awake or asleep, sitting, standing, or lying, nature is defiled and defiling.<a name=38:2922></a> Its very touch conveys pollution.<a name=38:2923></a> This is a deeply-humbling lesson for proud humanity; but thus it is.<a name=38:2924></a> The Book of Leviticus holds up a, faithful mirror to nature.<a name=38:2925></a> It leaves "flesh" nothing to glory in.<a name=38:2926></a> Men may boast of their refinement, their moral sense, their dignity.<a name=38:2927></a> Let them study the third book of Moses, and there they will see what it is all really worth, in God's estimation.<a name=38:2928></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, we learn, afresh, the expiatory value of the blood of Christ, and the cleansing, purifying, sanctifying virtues of the precious word of God.<a name=38:2929></a> When we think of the unsullied purity of the sanctuary, and then reflect upon nature's irremediable defilement, and ask the question, "However can we enter and dwell there?<a name=38:2930></a>" the answer is found in" the blood and water" which flowed from the side of a crucified Christ -- a Christ who gave up His life unto death for us, that we might live by Him.<a name=38:2931></a> "There are three that bear record in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and," blessed be God," these three agree in one.<a name=38:2932></a>" The Spirit does not convey to our ears a message diverse from that which we find in the Word; and both the Word and the Spirit declare to us the preciousness and efficacy of the blood.<a name=38:2933></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Can we not, therefore, say that the fifteenth chapter of Leviticus was "written for our learning?<a name=38:2934></a>" Has it not its own distinct place in the divine canon Assuredly.<a name=38:2935></a> There would be a blank were it omitted.<a name=38:2936></a> We learn in it what we could not learn in the same way, anywhere else.<a name=38:2937></a> True, all Scripture teaches us the holiness of God, the vileness of nature, the efficacy of the blood, the value of the Word but the chapter upon which we have been pondering presents these great truths to our notice, and presses them upon our hearts in a manner quite peculiar to itself.<a name=38:2938></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May <i>every section</i> of our Father's Volume be precious to our hearts.<a name=38:2939></a> May <i>every one</i> of His testimonies be sweeter to us than honey and the honeycomb, and may "<i>every one</i> of his righteous judgements" have its due place in our souls.<a name=38:2940></a>

		LEVITICUS 16.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter unfolds some of the weightiest principles of truth which can possibly engage the renewed mind.<a name=38:2941></a> It presents the doctrine of atonement with uncommon fullness and power.<a name=38:2942></a> In short, we must rank the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus amongst the most precious and important sections of Inspiration; if indeed it be allowable to make comparisons where all is divine.<a name=38:2943></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Looking at this chapter, historically, it furnished a record of the transactions of the great day of atonement in Israel, whereby Jehovah's relationship with the assembly was established and maintained, and all the sins, failures, and infirmities of the people fully atoned for, so that the Lord God might dwell among them.<a name=38:2944></a> The blood which was shed upon this solemn day formed the basis of Jehovah's throne in the midst of the congregation.<a name=38:2945></a> In virtue of it, a holy God could take up His abode in the midst of the people, notwithstanding all their uncleanness.<a name=38:2946></a> "The tenth day of the seventh month" was a unique day in Israel.<a name=38:2947></a> There was no other day in the year like it.<a name=38:2948></a> The sacrifices of this one day formed the ground of God's dealing in grace, mercy, patience, and forbearance.<a name=38:2949></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Furthermore, we learn from this portion of inspired history," that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest.<a name=38:2950></a>" God was hidden behind a veil and man was at a distance.<a name=38:2951></a> "And the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord, and died; and the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times unto the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark, that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.<a name=38:2952></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way was not open for man to approach, at all times, into the divine presence, nor was there any provision, in the entire range of the Mosaic ritual, for his abiding there continually.<a name=38:2953></a> God was shut in from man; and man was shut out from God, nor could "the blood of bulls and goats" open a permanent meeting place; "A sacrifice of nobler name and richer blood" was needed to accomplish this.<a name=38:2954></a> "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.<a name=38:2955></a> For then would they not have ceased to be offered?<a name=38:2956></a> Because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.<a name=38:2957></a> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.<a name=38:2958></a> For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.<a name=38:2959></a>" (Hebrews 10: 1-4) Neither the Levitical priesthood nor the Levitical sacrifices, could yield perfection.<a name=38:2960></a> Insufficiency was stamped on the latter, infirmity on the former, imperfection on both.<a name=38:2961></a> An imperfect man could not be a perfect priest; nor could an imperfect sacrifice give a perfect conscience.<a name=38:2962></a> Aaron was not competent or entitled to take his seat within the veil, nor could the sacrifices which he offered rend that veil.<a name=38:2963></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to our chapter, historically.<a name=38:2964></a> Let us now look at it typically.<a name=38:2965></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a <i>sin</i> offering, and a ram for a <i>burnt</i> offering.<a name=38:2966></a>" (verse 3) Here, we have the two grand aspects of Christ's atoning work, as that which perfectly maintains the divine glory, and perfectly meets man's deepest need.<a name=38:2967></a> There is no mention, throughout all the services of this unique and solemn day, of a meat offering, or a peace offering.<a name=38:2968></a> The perfect human life of our blessed Lord is not foreshadowed, here, nor is the communion of the soul with God, consequent upon His accomplished work, unfolded.<a name=38:2969></a> In a word, the one grand subject is "atonement," and that in a double way namely, first, as meeting all the claims of God -- the claims of His nature -- the claims of His character -- the claims of His throne; and, secondly, as perfectly meeting all man's guilt and all his necessities.<a name=38:2970></a> We must bear these two points in mind, if we would have a clear understanding of the truth presented in this chapter, or of the doctrine of the great day of atonement.<a name=38:2971></a> "Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place," with atonement, as securing the glory of God, in every possible way, whether as respects His counsels of redeeming love toward the church, toward Israel, and toward the whole creation, or in reference to all the claims of His moral administration; and with atonement as fully meeting man's guilty and needy condition.<a name=38:2972></a> These two aspects of the atonement will continually present themselves to our view as we ponder the precious contents of our chapter.<a name=38:2973></a> Their importance cannot possibly be overestimated.<a name=38:2974></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f18"><sup>++++++++++++++++++</sup></a>The reader will observe, in the above passage, that the words "the sins of" are introduced by the translators, and are not inspired. The divine accuracy of the passage is completely lost by retaining those uninspired words. The doctrine laid down is surely this -- in the first clause of the verse Christ is set forth as the propitiation For His people's actual sins; but in the last clause, it is not a question of *sins* or of *persons* at all, but of *sin* and the *world* in general. In fact, the whole verse presents Christ as the Antitype of the two goats, as the One who has borne His people's sins; and, also. as the One who has perfectly glorified God with respect to sin in general, and made provision for dealing in grace with the world at large, and for the final deliverance and blessing of the whole creation.

		I would desire to call my reader's earnest attention to the precious and vital doctrine of the blood.<a name=38:3333></a> I am anxious that he should see its true place.<a name=38:3334></a> The blood of Christ is the foundation of everything.<a name=38:3335></a> It is the ground of God's righteousness in justifying an ungodly sinner that believes on the name of the Son of God; and it is the ground of the sinner's confidence in drawing nigh to a holy God who is of purer eyes than to behold evil.<a name=38:3336></a> God would be just in the condemnation of the sinner; but, through the death of Christ, He can be just And the justifier of him that believeth -- a just God and a Saviour.<a name=38:3337></a> The righteousness of God is His consistency with Himself -- His acting in harmony with His revealed character.<a name=38:3338></a> Hence, were it not for the cross, His consistency with Himself would, of necessity, demand the death and judgement of the sinner; but in the cross that death and judgement were borne by the sinner's Surety, so that the same divine consistency is perfectly maintained while a holy God justifies an ungodly sinner through faith.<a name=38:3339></a> <i>It is all through the blood of Jesus</i> -- nothing less -- nothing more -- nothing different.<a name=38:3340></a> "It is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.<a name=38:3341></a> This is conclusive.<a name=38:3342></a> This is God's simple plan of justification.<a name=38:3343></a> Man's plan is much more cumbrous, much more roundabout.<a name=38:3344></a> And not only is it cumbrous and roundabout, but it attributes righteousness to something quite different from what I find in the word.<a name=38:3345></a> If I look from Genesis 3 down to the close of Revelation, I find the blood of Christ put forward as the alone ground of righteousness.<a name=38:3346></a> We get pardon, peace, life, righteousness, all by the blood, and nothing but the blood.<a name=38:3347></a> The entire book of Leviticus, and particularly the chapter upon which we have just been meditating, is a commentary upon the doctrine of the blood.<a name=38:3348></a> It seems strange to have to insist upon a fact so obvious to every dispassionate teachable student of holy Scripture.<a name=38:3349></a> Yet so it is.<a name=38:3350></a> Our minds are prone to slip away from the plain testimony of the word.<a name=38:3351></a> We are ready to adopt opinions without ever calmly investigating them in the light of the divine testimonies.<a name=38:3352></a> In this way we get into confusion, darkness, and error.<a name=38:3353></a>

		This is the true principle of holiness for the people of God in all ages.<a name=38:3368></a> They are to be governed and characterised by the revelation which He has made of Himself.<a name=38:3369></a> Their conduct is to be founded upon what He is, not upon what they are in themselves.<a name=38:3370></a> This entirely sets aside the principle expressed in the words, "Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou;" a principle so justly repudiated by every sensitive mind.<a name=38:3371></a> It is not a comparison of one man with another; but a simple statement of the line of conduct which God looks for in those who belong to Him.<a name=38:3372></a> "after the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.<a name=38:3373></a>" The Egyptians and the Canaanites were all wrong.<a name=38:3374></a> How was Israel to know this?<a name=38:3375></a> Who told them?<a name=38:3376></a> How came they to be right, and all besides wrong?<a name=38:3377></a> These are interesting inquiries; and the answer is as simple as the questions are interesting.<a name=38:3378></a> Jehovah's word was the standard by which all questions of right and wrong were to be definitely settled in the judgement of every member of the Israel of God.<a name=38:3379></a> It was not, by any means, the judgement of an Israelite in opposition to the judgement of an Egyptian or of a Canaanite; but it was the judgement of God above <i>all</i>.<a name=38:3380></a> Egypt might have her practices and her opinions, and so might Canaan; but Israel were to have the opinions and practices laid down in the word of God.<a name=38:3381></a> "Ye shall do my judgements, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the Lord your God.<a name=38:3382></a> Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgements; which, if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.<a name=38:3383></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be well for my reader to get a clear, deep, full, practical sense of this truth.<a name=38:3384></a> The word of God must settle every question and govern every conscience.<a name=38:3385></a> There must be no appeal from its solemn and weighty decision.<a name=38:3386></a> When God speaks, every heart must bow.<a name=38:3387></a> Men may form and hold their opinions; they may adopt and defend their practices; but one of the finest traits in the character of "the Israel of God" is profound reverence for, and implicit subjection to, "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord.<a name=38:3388></a>" The exhibition of this valuable feature may, perhaps, lay them open to the charge of dogmatism, superciliousness, and self-sufficiency, on the part of those who have never duly weighed the matter; but, in truth, nothing can be more unlike dogmatism than simple subjection to the plain truth of God; nothing more unlike superciliousness than reverence for the statements of inspiration; nothing more unlike self-sufficiency than subjection to the divine authority of holy scripture.<a name=38:3389></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		True, there will ever be the need of carefulness as to the tone and manner in which we set forth the authority for our convictions and our conduct.<a name=38:3390></a> It must be made manifest, so far as it may be, that we are wholly governed, not by our own opinions, but by the word of God.<a name=38:3391></a> There is great danger of attaching an importance to an opinion merely because we have adopted it.<a name=38:3392></a> This must be carefully guarded against.<a name=38:3393></a> <i>Self</i> may creep in and display its deformity in the defence of our opinions as much as in anything else; but we must disallow it, in every shape and form, and be governed, in all things, by "Thus saith the Lord.<a name=38:3394></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, then, we are not to expect that everyone will be ready to admit the full force of the divine statutes and judgements.<a name=38:3395></a> It is as persons walk in the integrity and energy of the divine nature that the word of God will be owned, appreciated, and reverenced.<a name=38:3396></a> An Egyptian or a Canaanite would have been wholly unable to enter into the meaning or estimate the value of these statutes and judgements, which were to govern the conduct of the circumcised people of God; but that did not, in any wise, affect the question of Israel's obedience.<a name=38:3397></a> They were brought into a certain relationship with Jehovah, and that relationship had its distinctive privileges and responsibilities.<a name=38:3398></a> "I am the Lord <i>your</i> God.<a name=38:3399></a>" This was to be the ground of their conduct.<a name=38:3400></a> They were to act in a way worthy of the One who had become <i>their</i> God, and made them <i>His</i> people.<a name=38:3401></a> It was not that they were a whit better than other people.<a name=38:3402></a> By no means.<a name=38:3403></a> The Egyptians or Canaanites might have considered that the Israelites were setting themselves up as something superior in refusing to adopt the habits of either nation.<a name=38:3404></a> But, no; the foundation of their peculiar line of conduct and tone of morality was laid in these words, "<i>I</i> am the Lord <i>your God</i>.<a name=38:3405></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this great and practically-important fact, Jehovah set before His people a ground of conduct which was immovable, and a standard of morality which was as elevated, and as enduring, as the eternal throne itself.<a name=38:3406></a> The moment He entered into a relationship with a people, their ethics were to assume a character and tone worthy of Him.<a name=38:3407></a> It was no longer a question as to what they were, either in themselves or in comparison with others; but of what God was in comparison with all.<a name=38:3408></a> This makes a material difference.<a name=38:3409></a> To make <i>self</i> the ground of action or the standard of ethics is not only presumptuous folly, but it is sure to set one upon a descending scale of action.<a name=38:3410></a> If self be my object, I must, of necessity, sink lower and lower every day; but if, on the other hand, I set the Lord before me, I shall rise higher and higher as, by the power of the Holy Ghost, I grow in conformity to that perfect model which is unfolded to the gaze of faith in the sacred pages of inspiration.<a name=38:3411></a> I shall, undoubtedly, have to prostrate myself in the dust, under a sense of how infinitely short I come of the mark set before me; but, then, I can never consent to the setting up of a lower standard, nor can I ever be satisfied until I am conformed in all things to Him who was my substitute on the cross, and is my Model in the glory.<a name=38:3412></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said thus much on the main principle of the section before us -- a principle of unspeakable importance to Christians, in a practical point of view -- I feel it needless to enter into anything like a detailed exposition of statutes which speak for themselves in most obvious terms.<a name=38:3413></a> I would merely remark that those statutes range themselves under two distinct heads, namely, first, those which set forth the shameful enormities which the human heart is capable of devising; and, secondly, those which exhibit the exquisite tenderness and considerate care of the God of Israel.<a name=38:3414></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first, it is manifest that the Spirit of God could never enact laws for the purpose of preventing evils that have no existence.<a name=38:3415></a> He does not construct a dam where there is no flood to be resisted.<a name=38:3416></a> He does not deal with abstract ideas, but with positive realities.<a name=38:3417></a> Man is, in very deed, capable of perpetrating each and every one of the shameful crimes referred to in this most faithful section of the book of Leviticus.<a name=38:3418></a> If he were not, Why should he be told not to do so.<a name=38:3419></a> Such a code would be wholly unsuitable for angels, inasmuch as they are incapable of committing the sins referred to; but it suits man, because he has gotten the seeds of those sins in his nature.<a name=38:3420></a> This is deeply humbling.<a name=38:3421></a> It is a fresh declaration of the truth that man is a total wreck.<a name=38:3422></a> From the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, there is not so much as a single speck of moral soundness, as looked at in the light of the divine presence.<a name=38:3423></a> The being for whom Jehovah thought it needful to write Leviticus 18 - 20 must be a vile sinner; but that being is man -- the writer and reader of these lines.<a name=38:3424></a> How plain it is, therefore, that "they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=38:3425></a>" (Romans 8) Thank God, the believer is "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.<a name=38:3426></a>" He has been taken completely out of his old creation standing, and introduced into the new creation, in which the moral evils aimed at in this our section can have no existence.<a name=38:3427></a> True, he has gotten the old nature; but it is his happy privilege to "reckon" it as a dead thing, and to walk in the abiding power of the new creation, wherein "all things are of God.<a name=38:3428></a>" This is Christian liberty -- even liberty to walk up and down in that fair creation where no trace of evil can ever be found; hallowed liberty to walk in holiness and purity before God and man; liberty to tread those lofty walks of personal sanctity whereon the beams of the divine countenance ever pour themselves in living lustre.<a name=38:3429></a> Reader, this is Christian liberty.<a name=38:3430></a> It is liberty, not to commit sin, but to taste the celestial sweets of a life of true holiness and moral elevation.<a name=38:3431></a> May we prize more highly than we have ever done this precious boon of heaven -- Christian liberty!<a name=38:3432></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, one word as to the second class of statutes contained in our section -- namely, those which so touchingly bring out divine tenderness and care.<a name=38:3433></a> Take the following: "and when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.<a name=38:3434></a> And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; <i>thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger</i>: I am the Lord your God.<a name=38:3435></a>" (Leviticus 19: 9, 10) This ordinance will meet us again in Leviticus 23, but there we shall see it in its dispensational bearing.<a name=38:3436></a> Here, we contemplate it morally, as unfolding the precious grace of Israel's God.<a name=38:3437></a> He would think of "the poor and stranger;" and He would have His people think of them likewise.<a name=38:3438></a> When the golden sheaves were being reaped, and the mellow clusters gathered, "the poor and stranger" were to be remembered by the Israel of God, because Jehovah was the God of Israel.<a name=38:3439></a> The reaper and the grape-gatherer were not to be governed by a spirit of grasping covetousness, which would bare the corners of the field and strip the branches of the vine, but rather by a spirit of large-hearted, genuine benevolence, which would leave a sheaf and a cluster "for the poor and stranger," that they, too, might rejoice in the unbounded goodness of Him whose paths drop fatness, and on whose open hand all the sons of want may confidently wait.<a name=38:3440></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Ruth furnishes a fine example of one who fully acted out this most benevolent statute.<a name=38:3441></a> "And Boaz said unto her, (Ruth,) At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.<a name=38:3442></a> And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed and left.<a name=38:3443></a> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.<a name=38:3444></a>" (Ruth 2: 14-16) Most touching and beautiful grace!<a name=38:3445></a> Truly, it is good for our poor selfish hearts to be brought in contact with such principles and such practices.<a name=38:3446></a> Nothing can surpass the exquisite refinement of the words, "<i>let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her</i>.<a name=38:3447></a>" It was, evidently, the desire of this noble Israelite that "the stranger" might have abundance, and have it, too, rather as the fruit of her own gleaning than of his benevolence.<a name=38:3448></a> This was the very essence of refinement.<a name=38:3449></a> It was putting her in immediate connection with, and dependence upon, the God of Israel, who had fully recognised and provided for "the gleaner.<a name=38:3450></a>" Boaz was merely acting out that gracious ordinance of which Ruth was reaping the benefit.<a name=38:3451></a> The same grace that had given him the field gave her the gleanings.<a name=38:3452></a> They were both debtors to grace.<a name=38:3453></a> She was the happy recipient of Jehovah's goodness.<a name=38:3454></a> He was the honoured exponent of Jehovah's most gracious institution.<a name=38:3455></a> All was in most lovely moral order.<a name=38:3456></a> The creature was blessed and God was glorified.<a name=38:3457></a> Who would not own that it is good for us to 'be allowed to breathe such an atmosphere?<a name=38:3458></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now turn to another statute of our section.<a name=38:3459></a> "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob Him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.<a name=38:3460></a>" (Leviticus 19: 13) What tender care is here!<a name=38:3461></a> The High and Mighty One that inhabiteth eternity can take knowledge of the thoughts and feelings that spring up in the heart of a poor labourer.<a name=38:3462></a> He knows and takes into account the expectations of such an one in reference to the fruit of his day's toil.<a name=38:3463></a> The wages will, naturally, be looked for.<a name=38:3464></a> The labourer's heart counts upon them; the family meal depends upon them.<a name=38:3465></a> Oh!<a name=38:3466></a> let them not be held back.<a name=38:3467></a> Send not the labourer home with a heavy heart, to make the heart of his wife and family heavy likewise.<a name=38:3468></a> By all means, give him that for which He has wrought, to which he has a right, and on which his heart is set.<a name=38:3469></a> He is a husband, he is a father; and he has borne the burden and heat of the day that his wife and children may not go hungry to bed.<a name=38:3470></a> Disappoint him not.<a name=38:3471></a> Give him his due.<a name=38:3472></a> Thus does our God take notice of the very throbbings of the labourer's heart, And make provision for his rising expectations.<a name=38:3473></a> Precious grace!<a name=38:3474></a> Most tender, thoughtful, touching, condescending love!<a name=38:3475></a> The bare contemplation of such statutes is sufficient to throw one into a flood of tenderness.<a name=38:3476></a> Could any one read such passages and not be melted?<a name=38:3477></a> Could any one read them and thoughtlessly dismiss a poor labourer, not knowing whether he and his family have wherewithal to meet the cravings of hunger?<a name=38:3478></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more painful to a tender heart than the lack of kindly consideration for the poor, so often manifested by the rich.<a name=38:3479></a> These latter can sit down to their sumptuous repast after dismissing from their door some poor industrious creature who had come seeking the just reward of his honest labour.<a name=38:3480></a> They think not of the aching heart with which that man returns to his family, to tell them of the disappointment to himself and to them.<a name=38:3481></a> Oh!<a name=38:3482></a> it is terrible.<a name=38:3483></a> It is most offensive to God, and to all who have drunk, in any measure, into His grace.<a name=38:3484></a> If we would know what God thinks of such acting, we have only to hearken to the following accents of holy indignation: "Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them that have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.<a name=38:3485></a>" (James 5: 4) "The Lord of Sabaoth" hears the cry of the aggrieved and disappointed labourer.<a name=38:3486></a> His tender love tells itself forth in the institutions of His moral government; and even though the heart should not be melted by the grace of those institutions, the conduct should, at least, be governed by the righteousness thereof.<a name=38:3487></a> God will not suffer the claims of the poor to be heartlessly tossed aside by those who are so hardened by the influence of wealth as to be insensible to the appeals of tenderness, and who are so far removed beyond the region of personal need as to be incapable of feeling for those whose lot it is to spend their days amid exhausting toil or pinching poverty.<a name=38:3488></a> The poor are the special objects of God's care.<a name=38:3489></a> Again and again He makes provision for them in the statutes of His moral administration; and it is particularly declared of Him who shall, ere long, assume, in manifested glory, the reins of government, that "He shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.<a name=38:3490></a> He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.<a name=38:3491></a> He shall redeem their souls from deceit and violence; and precious shall their blood be in his sight" (Psalm 72: 12-14).<a name=38:3492></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May we profit by the review of those precious and deeply practical truths!<a name=38:3493></a> May our hearts be affected, and our conduct influenced by them.<a name=38:3494></a> We live in a heartless world; and there is a vast amount of selfishness in our own hearts.<a name=38:3495></a> We are not sufficiently affected by the thought of the need of others.<a name=38:3496></a> We are apt to forget the poor in the midst of our abundance.<a name=38:3497></a> We often forget that the very persons whose labour ministers to our personal comfort are living, it may be, in the deepest poverty.<a name=38:3498></a> Let us think of these things.<a name=38:3499></a> Let us beware of "grinding the faces of the poor.<a name=38:3500></a>" If the Jews of old were taught by the statutes and ordinances of the Mosaic economy, to entertain kindly feelings toward the poor, and to deal tenderly and graciously with the sons of toil, how much more ought the higher and more spiritual ethics of the Gospel dispensation produce in the hearts and lives of Christians a large-hearted benevolence toward every form of human need.<a name=38:3501></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		True, there in urgent need of prudence and caution, lest we take a man out of the honourable position in which he was designed and fitted to move -- namely, a position of dependence upon the fruits, the precious and fragrant fruits, of honest industry.<a name=38:3502></a> This would be a grievous injury instead of a benefit.<a name=38:3503></a> The example of Boaz should instruct in this matter.<a name=38:3504></a> He allowed Ruth to glean; but he took care to make her gleaning profitable.<a name=38:3505></a> This is a very safe and a very simple principle.<a name=38:3506></a> God intends that man should work at something or another, and we run counter to Him when we draw our fellow out of the place of dependence upon the results of patient industry, into that of dependence upon the results of false benevolence.<a name=38:3507></a> The former is as honourable and elevating as the latter is contemptible and demoralising.<a name=38:3508></a> There is no bread so sweet to the taste as that which is nobly earned; but then those who earn their bread should get enough.<a name=38:3509></a> A man will feed and care his horses; how much more his fellow, who yields him the labour of his hands from Monday morning till Saturday night.<a name=38:3510></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, some will say, "There are two sides to this question.<a name=38:3511></a>" Unquestionably there are; and, no doubt, one meets with a great deal amongst the poor which is calculated to, dry up the springs of benevolence and genuine sympathy.<a name=38:3512></a> There is much which tends to steel the heart, and close the hand; but, one thing is certain -- it is better to be deceived in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred than to shut up the bowels of compassion against a single worthy object.<a name=38:3513></a> Your heavenly Father causes His sun to shine upon the evil and on the good; and sendeth rain upon the just and upon the unjust.<a name=38:3514></a> The sure sunbeams that gladden the heart of some devoted servant of Christ are poured upon the path of some ungodly sinner; and the self-same shower that falls upon the tillage of a true believer, enriches also the furrows of some blaspheming infidel.<a name=38:3515></a> This is to be our model.<a name=38:3516></a> "Be ye, therefore, perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<a name=38:3517></a>" (Matthew 5: 48) It is only as we set the Lord before us, and walk in the power of His grace, that we shall be able to go on, from day to day, meeting with a tender heart and an open hand every possible form of human misery.<a name=38:3518></a> It is only as we ourselves are drinking at the exhaustless fountain of divine love and tenderness, that we shall be able to go on ministering to human need unchecked by the oft-repeated manifestation of human depravity.<a name=38:3519></a> Our tiny springs would soon be dried up were they not maintained in unbroken connection with that ever-gushing source.<a name=38:3520></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The statute which next presents itself for our consideration, exemplifies, most touchingly, the tender care of the God of Israel.<a name=38:3521></a> "Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord.<a name=38:3522></a>" (verse 14) Here, a barrier is erected to stem the rising tide of irritability with which uncontrolled nature would be almost sure to meet the personal infirmity of deafness.<a name=38:3523></a> How well we can understand this!<a name=38:3524></a> Nature does not like to be called upon to repeat its words, again and again, in order to meet the deaf man's infirmity.<a name=38:3525></a> Jehovah thought of this, and provided for it.<a name=38:3526></a> And what is the provision?<a name=38:3527></a> "Thou shalt fear thy God.<a name=38:3528></a>" When tried by a deaf person, remember the Lord, and look to Him for Grace to enable you to govern your temper.<a name=38:3529></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second part of this statute reveals a most humiliating amount of wickedness in human nature.<a name=38:3530></a> The idea of laying a stumbling-block in the way of the blind, is about the most wanton cruelty imaginable; and yet man is capable of it, else he world not be warned against it.<a name=38:3531></a> No doubt, this, as well as many other statutes, admits of a spiritual application; but that in nowise interferes with the plain literal principle set forth in it.<a name=38:3532></a> Man is capable of placing a stumbling block in the way of a fellow-creature afflicted with blindness.<a name=38:3533></a> Such is man!<a name=38:3534></a> Truly, the Lord knew what was in man when He wrote the statutes and judgements of the Book of Leviticus.<a name=38:3535></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall leave my reader to meditate alone upon the remainder of our section.<a name=38:3536></a> He will find that each statute teaches a double lesson -- namely, a lesson with respect to nature's evil tendencies, and also a lesson as to Jehovah's tender care.<a name=38:3537></a><a href="#38:f19"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++++++++++++</sup></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#38:f19"><sup>+++++++++++++++++++</sup></a>Verses 16 and 17 demand special attention. "Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people." This is a most seasonable admonition for the people of God, in every age. A talebearer is sure to do incalculable mischief. It has been well remarked that a talebearer injures three persons -- he injures himself, he injures his hearer, and he injures the subject of his tale. this he does directly; and as to the indirect consequences, who can recount them? Let us carefully guard against this horrible evil. May we never suffer a tale to, pass our lips; and let us never stand to hearken to a talebearer. May we always know how to drive away a backbiting tongue with an angry countenance, as the north wind driveth away rain. <p>In verse 17, we learn what ought to take the place of tale bearing. "thou shalt in anywise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him." In place of carrying to another a tale about my neighbour, I am called upon to go directly to himself and rebuke him, if there is anything wrong. This is the divine method. Satan's method is to act the talebearer.

		This distinction is easily understood in the case of the sons of Aaron, and, hence, it will serve to illustrate, in a very simple manner, the truth as to the members of the true priestly house over which our Great High Priest presides, and to which all true believers belong.<a name=38:3549></a> (Hebrews 3: 6) Every child of God is a priest.<a name=38:3550></a> He is enrolled as a member of Christ's priestly house.<a name=38:3551></a> He may be very ignorant; but his position, as a priest, is not founded upon knowledge, but upon life.<a name=38:3552></a> His experience may be very shallow; but his place as a priest does not depend upon experience, but upon life.<a name=38:3553></a> His capacity may be very limited; but his relationship as a priest does not rest upon an enlarged capacity, but upon life.<a name=38:3554></a> He was born into the position and relationship of a priest.<a name=38:3555></a> He did not work himself thereinto.<a name=38:3556></a> It was not by any efforts of his own that he became a priest.<a name=38:3557></a> He became a priest by birth.<a name=38:3558></a> The spiritual priesthood, together with all the spiritual functions attaching thereunto, is the necessary appendage to spiritual birth.<a name=38:3559></a> The capacity to enjoy the privileges and to discharge the functions of a position must not be confounded with the position itself.<a name=38:3560></a> They must ever be kept distinct.<a name=38:3561></a> relationship is one thing; capacity is quite another.<a name=38:3562></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Furthermore, in looking at the family of Aaron, we see that nothing could break the relationship between him and his sons.<a name=38:3563></a> There were many things which would interfere with the full enjoyment of the privileges attaching to the relationship, A son of Aaron might "defile himself by the dead.<a name=38:3564></a>" He might defile himself by forming an unholy alliance.<a name=38:3565></a> He might have some bodily "blemish.<a name=38:3566></a>" He might be "blind or lame.<a name=38:3567></a>"' He might be "a dwarf.<a name=38:3568></a>" Any of these things would have interfered, very materially, with his enjoyment of the privileges, and his discharge of the functions pertaining to his relationship, as we read, "No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire: he hath a blemish: he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.<a name=38:3569></a> He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and the holy; only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the Lord do sanctify them.<a name=38:3570></a>" (Leviticus 21: 21-23) But none of these things could possibly touch the fact of a relationship founded upon the established principles of human nature.<a name=38:3571></a> Though a son of Aaron were a dwarf, that dwarf was a son of Aaron.<a name=38:3572></a> True, he was, as a dwarf, shorn of many precious privileges and lofty dignities pertaining to the priesthood; but he was a son of Aaron all the while.<a name=38:3573></a> He could neither enjoy the same measure or character of communion, nor yet discharge the same elevated functions of priestly Service, as one who had reached to manhood's appointed stature; but he was a member of the priestly house, and, as such, permitted to "eat the bread of his God.<a name=38:3574></a>" The relationship was genuine, though the development was so defective.<a name=38:3575></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spiritual application of all this is as simple as it is practical.<a name=38:3576></a> To be a child of God, is one thing; to be in the enjoyment of priestly communion and priestly worship, is quite another.<a name=38:3577></a> The latter is, alas!<a name=38:3578></a> interfered with by many things.<a name=38:3579></a> Circumstances and associations are allowed to act upon us by their defiling influence.<a name=38:3580></a> We are not to suppose that all Christians enjoy the same elevation of walk, the same intimacy of fellowship, the same felt nearness to Christ.<a name=38:3581></a> Alas!<a name=38:3582></a> alas!<a name=38:3583></a> they do not.<a name=38:3584></a> Many of us have to mourn over our spiritual defects.<a name=38:3585></a> There is lameness of walk, defective vision, stunted growth; or we show ourselves to be defiled by contact with evil, and to be weakened and hindered by unhallowed associations.<a name=38:3586></a> In a word, as the sons of Aaron, though being priests by birth, were, nevertheless, deprived of many privileges through ceremonial defilement and physical defects; so we, though being priests unto God, by spiritual birth, are deprived of many of the high and holy privileges of our position, by moral defilement and spiritual defects.<a name=38:3587></a> We are shorn of many of our dignities through defective spiritual development.<a name=38:3588></a> We lack; singleness of eye, spiritual vigour, whole-hearted devotedness.<a name=38:3589></a> Saved we are, through the free grace of God, on the ground of Christ's perfect sacrifice.<a name=38:3590></a> "We are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus;" but, then, salvation is one thing; communion is quite another.<a name=38:3591></a> Sonship is one thing; obedience is quite another.<a name=38:3592></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things should be carefully distinguished.<a name=38:3593></a> The section before us illustrates the distinction with great force and clearness.<a name=38:3594></a> If one of the sons of Aaron happened to be "broken-footed, or broken-handed," was he deprived of his sonship?<a name=38:3595></a> Assuredly not.<a name=38:3596></a> Was he deprived of his priestly position?<a name=38:3597></a> By no means.<a name=38:3598></a> It was distinctly declared, "He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy.<a name=38:3599></a>" What, then, did he lose by his physical blemish?<a name=38:3600></a> He was forbidden to tread some of the higher walks of priestly service and worship.<a name=38:3601></a> "Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar.<a name=38:3602></a>" These were very serious privations; and though it may be objected that a man could not help many of these physical defects, that did not alter the matter.<a name=38:3603></a> Jehovah could not have a blemished priest at His altar, or a blemished sacrifice thereon.<a name=38:3604></a> Both the priest and the sacrifice should be perfect.<a name=38:3605></a> "No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire.<a name=38:3606></a>" (Leviticus 21: 22) "But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer; for it shall not be acceptable for you" (Leviticus 22: 20).<a name=38:3607></a>

		Now, we have both the perfect priest, and the perfect sacrifice, in the Person of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=38:3608></a> He, having "offered himself without spot to God," passed into the heavens, as our great High Priest, where He ever liveth to make intercession for us.<a name=38:3609></a> The Epistle to the Hebrews dwells elaborately upon these two points.<a name=38:3610></a> It throws into vivid contrast the sacrifice and priesthood of the Mosaic system and the Sacrifice and Priesthood of Christ.<a name=38:3611></a> In Him we have divine perfectness, whether as the Victim or as the Priest.<a name=38:3612></a> We have all that God could require, and all that man could need.<a name=38:3613></a> His precious blood has put away all our sins; and His all-prevailing intercession ever maintains us in all the perfectness of the place into which His blood has introduced us.<a name=38:3614></a> "We are complete in him;" (Colossians 2); and yet, so feeble and so faltering are we in ourselves; so full of failure and infirmity; so prone to err and stumble in our onward way, that we could not stand for a moment, were it not that "He ever lives to make intercession for us.<a name=38:3615></a>" These things have been dwelt upon in the earlier chapters of this volume; and it is, therefore, needless to enter further upon them here.<a name=38:3616></a> Those who have anything like correct apprehensions of the grand foundation truths of Christianity, and any measure of experience in the Christian life, will be able to understand how it is that, though "complete in him who is the head of all principality and power, they, nevertheless, need, while down here amid the infirmities, conflicts, and buffetings of earth, the powerful advocacy of their adorable and divine High Priest.<a name=38:3617></a> The believer is "washed, sanctified, and justified.<a name=38:3618></a> (1 Corinthians 6) He is "accepted in the beloved.<a name=38:3619></a>" (Ephesians 1.<a name=38:3620></a> 6) He can never come into judgement, as regards his person.<a name=38:3621></a> (See John 5: 24, where the word is <i>krisin</i> and not <i>katakrisin</i>) Death and judgement are behind him, because he is united to Christ who has passed through them both, on his behalf and in his stead.<a name=38:3622></a> All these things are divinely true of the very weakest, most unlettered, and inexperienced member of the family of God; but yet, inasmuch as he caries about with him a nature so incorrigibly bad, and so irremediably ruined, that no discipline can correct it, and no medicine cure it, inasmuch as he is the tenant of a body of sin and death -- as he is surrounded, on all sides, by hostile influences -- as he is called to cope, perpetually, with the combined forces of the world, the flesh, and the devil -- he could never keep his ground, much less make progress, were he not upheld by the all-prevailing intercession of his great High Priest, who bears the names of His people upon His breast and upon His shoulder.<a name=38:3623></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some, I am aware, have found great difficulty in reconciling the idea of the believer's perfect standing in Christ with the need of priesthood.<a name=38:3624></a> "If," it is argued, "he is perfect, what need has he of a priest?<a name=38:3625></a>" The two things are as distinctly taught in the word as they are compatible one with another, and understood in the experience of every rightly-instructed Christian.<a name=38:3626></a> It is of the very last importance to apprehend, with clearness and accuracy, the perfect harmony between these two points.<a name=38:3627></a> The believer is perfect in Christ; but, in himself, he is a poor feeble creature, ever liable to fall.<a name=38:3628></a> Hence, the unspeakable blessedness of having One who can manage all his affairs for him, at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens -- One who upholds him continually by the right hand of His righteousness -- One who will never let him go -- One who is able to save to the uttermost -- One who is "the same yesterday, today, and for ever" -- One who will bear him triumphantly through all the difficulties and dangers which surround him; and, finally, "present him faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.<a name=38:3629></a>" Blessed for ever be the grace that has made such ample provision for all our need in the blood of a Spotless Victim and the intercession of a divine High Priest!<a name=38:3630></a>

		Dear christian reader, let it be our care so to walk, so to "keep ourselves unspotted from the world," so to stand apart from all unhallowed associations, that we may enjoy the highest privileges and discharge the most elevated functions of our position as members of the priestly house of which Christ is the Head.<a name=38:3631></a> We have "boldness to enter into the holiest, through the blood of Jesus" -- "we have a great High Priest over the house of God.<a name=38:3632></a>" (Hebrews 10) Nothing can ever rob us of these privileges.<a name=38:3633></a> But, then, our communion may be marred -- our worship may be hindered -- our holy functions may remain undischarged.<a name=38:3634></a> Those ceremonial matters against which the sons of Aaron were warned, in the section before us, have their antitypes in the Christian economy.<a name=38:3635></a> Had they to be warned against unholy contact?<a name=38:3636></a> So have we.<a name=38:3637></a> Had they to be warned against unholy alliance?<a name=38:3638></a> So have we.<a name=38:3639></a> Had they to be warned against all manner of ceremonial uncleanness?<a name=38:3640></a> So have we to be warned against "all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.<a name=38:3641></a>" (1 Corinthians 7) Were they shorn of many of their loftiest priestly privileges by bodily blemish and imperfect natural growth!<a name=38:3642></a> So are we, by moral blemish, and imperfect spiritual growth.<a name=38:3643></a>

		Looking at the feasts separately, we have the Sabbath, the Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, the first-fruits, Pentecost, the feast of trumpets, the day of atonement, and the feast of tabernacles.<a name=38:3658></a> This would make eight, altogether; but it is very obvious that the Sabbath occupies quite a unique and independent place.<a name=38:3659></a> It is first presented, and its proper characteristics and attendant circumstances fully set forth; and then, we read "These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.<a name=38:3660></a>" (verse 4) so that, strictly speaking, as the attentive reader will observe, Israel's <i>first</i> great feast was the Passover, and their <i>seventh</i> was the feast of tabernacles.<a name=38:3661></a> That is to say, divesting them of their typical dress, we have, full, redemption; and, last of all, we have the millennial glory.<a name=38:3662></a> The paschal lamb typified the death of Christ; (1 Corinthians 5: 7;) and the feast of tabernacles typified "the times of the restitution of all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the world began" (Acts 3: 21).<a name=38:3663></a>

		"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the <i>firstfruits</i> of them that slept.<a name=38:3739></a>" (1 Corinthians 15: 20) The beautiful ordinance of the presentation of the sheaf of first fruits typify the resurrection of Christ, who, "at the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week," rose triumphant from the tomb, having accomplished the glorious work of redemption.<a name=38:3740></a> His was a "resurrection <i>from among</i> the dead;" and, in it, we have, at once, the earnest and the type of the resurrection of His people.<a name=38:3741></a> "Christ the first fruits; afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming.<a name=38:3742></a>" When Christ comes, His people will be raised from among the dead;" (<i>ek nekron</i>) that is those of them that sleep in Jesus.<a name=38:3743></a> "But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.<a name=38:3744></a>" (Revelation 20: 5) When, immediately after the transfiguration, our blessed Lord spoke of His rising "<i>from among the dead</i>," the disciples questioned among themselves what that could mean.<a name=38:3745></a> (See Mark 9) Every orthodox Jew believed in the doctrine of the "resurrection of the dead," (<i>anastasis nekron</i>) But the idea of a "resurrection from among the dead," (<i>anastasis ek nekron</i>) was what the disciples were unable to grasp and, no doubt, many disciples since then have felt considerable difficulty with respect to a mystery so profound.<a name=38:3746></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, if my reader will prayerfully study and compare 1 Corinthians 15 with 1 Thessalonians 4: 13-18, he will get much precious instruction upon this most interesting and practical truth.<a name=38:3747></a> He can also look at Romans 8: 11, in connection.<a name=38:3748></a> "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead (<i>ek nekron</i>) dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<a name=38:3749></a>" From all these passages it will be seen that the resurrection of the Church will be upon precisely the same principle as the resurrection of Christ.<a name=38:3750></a> Both the Head and the body are shown to be raised "from among the dead.<a name=38:3751></a>" The first sheaf and all the sheaves that follow after are morally connected.<a name=38:3752></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must be evident to any one who carefully ponders the subject, in the light of scripture, that there is a very material difference between the resurrection of the believer and the resurrection of the unbeliever.<a name=38:3753></a> Both shall be raised; but Revelation 20: 5, proves that there will be a thousand years between the two, so that they differ both as to the principle, and as to the time.<a name=38:3754></a> Some have found difficulty, in reference to this subject, from the fact that, in John 5: 28, our Lord speaks of "the <i>hour</i> in the which <i>all</i> that are in the graves shall hear his voice.<a name=38:3755></a>" "How," it may be asked, "can there be a thousand years between the two resurrections when both are spoken of as occurring in an 'hour'?<a name=38:3756></a>" The answer is very simple.<a name=38:3757></a> In verse 28, the quickening of dead souls is spoken of as occurring in an "hour;" and this work has been going on for over eighteen hundred years.<a name=38:3758></a> Now, if a period of nearly two thousand years can be represented by the word "hour," what objection can there be to the idea of one thousand years being represented in the same way?<a name=38:3759></a> Surely, none whatever, especially when it is expressly stated that "the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.<a name=38:3760></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, furthermore, when we find mention made of "a <i>first</i> resurrection," is it not evident that all are not to be raised together?<a name=38:3761></a> Why speak of a "first" if there is but the one?<a name=38:3762></a> It may be said that "the first resurrection" refers to the soul; but where is the scripture warrant for such a statement?<a name=38:3763></a> The solemn fact is this: when the "shout of the archangel and the trump of God" shall be heard, the redeemed who sleep in Jesus will be raised to meet Him in the glory.<a name=38:3764></a> The wicked dead, whoever they be, from the days of Cain down, will remain in their graves, during the thousand years of millennial blessedness; and, at the close of that bright and blissful period, they shall come forth and stand before "the great white throne," there to be "judged every man according to his works," and to pass from the throne of judgement into the lake of fire.<a name=38:3765></a> Appalling thought!<a name=38:3766></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=38:3767></a> reader, how is it in reference to your precious soul Have you seen, by the eye of faith, the blood of the paschal Lamb shed to screen you from this terrible hour?<a name=38:3768></a> Have you seen the precious sheaf of firstfruits reaped and gathered into the heavenly garner, as the earnest of your being gathered in due time?<a name=38:3769></a> These are solemn questions, deeply solemn.<a name=38:3770></a> Do not put them aside.<a name=38:3771></a> See that you are, now, under the cover of the blood of Jesus.<a name=38:3772></a> Remember, you cannot glean so much as a single ear in the fields of redemption until you have seen the true sheaf waved before the Lord.<a name=38:3773></a> "Ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until <i>the self-same day</i> that ye have brought an offering unto your God.<a name=38:3774></a>" The harvest could not be touched until the sheaf of first fruits had been presented, and, with the sheaf, a burnt offering and a meat offering.<a name=38:3775></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall be complete: even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord.<a name=38:3776></a> Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves, of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken <i>with leaven</i>; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord.<a name=38:3777></a>" (verse 15-17) This is the feast of Pentecost -- the type of God's people, gathered by the Holy Ghost, and presented before Him, in connection with all the preciousness of Christ.<a name=38:3778></a> In the Passover, we have the death of Christ; in the sheaf of first fruits, we have the resurrection of Christ; and in the feast of Pentecost, we have the descent of the Holy Ghost to form the Church.<a name=38:3779></a> All this is divinely perfect.<a name=38:3780></a> The death and resurrection of Christ had to be accomplished, ere the Church could be formed.<a name=38:3781></a> The sheaf was offered and then the loaves were baked.<a name=38:3782></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, observe, "They shall be baken <i>with leaven</i>.<a name=38:3783></a>" Why was this?<a name=38:3784></a> Because they were intended to foreshadow those who, though filled with the Holy Ghost, and adorned with His gifts and graces, had, nevertheless, <i>evil</i> dwelling in them.<a name=38:3785></a> The assembly, on the day of Pentecost, stood in the full value of the blood of Christ, was crowned with the gifts of the Holy ghost; but there was leaven there also.<a name=38:3786></a> No power of the Spirit could do away with the fact that there was evil dwelling in the people of God.<a name=38:3787></a> It might be suppressed and kept out of view; but it was there.<a name=38:3788></a> This fact is foreshadowed in the type, by the leaven in the two loaves; and it is set forth in the actual history of the Church; for, albeit God the Holy Ghost was present in the assembly, the flesh was there likewise to lie unto Him.<a name=38:3789></a> Flesh is flesh, nor can it ever be made ought else than flesh.<a name=38:3790></a> The Holy Ghost did not come down, on the day of Pentecost, to improve nature or do away with the fact of its incurable evil, but to baptise believers into one body, and connect them with their living Head in heaven.<a name=38:3791></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allusion has already been made, in the chapter on the peace offering, to the fact that leaven was permitted in connection therewith.<a name=38:3792></a> It was the divine recognition of the evil in the worshipper.<a name=38:3793></a> Thus is it also in the ordinance of the "two wave loaves;" they were to be "baken with <i>leaven</i>," because of the <i>evil</i> in the antitype.<a name=38:3794></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed be God, the evil which was divinely recognised was divinely provided for.<a name=38:3795></a> This gives great rest and comfort to the heart.<a name=38:3796></a> It is a comfort to be assured that God knows the worst of us; and, moreover, that He has made provision according to <i>His</i> knowledge, and not merely according to <i>ours</i>.<a name=38:3797></a> "And ye shall offer <i>with the bread</i>, seven lambs <i>without blemish</i>, of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.<a name=38:3798></a> (verse 18) Here, then, we have, in immediate connection with the leavened loaves, the presentation of an unblemished sacrifice, typifying the great and all-important truth that it is Christ's perfectness and not our sinfulness that is ever before the view of God.<a name=38:3799></a> Observe, particularly, the words, "ye shall offer <i>with the bread</i>, seven lambs <i>without blemish</i>.<a name=38:3800></a>" Precious truth!<a name=38:3801></a> Deeply precious, though clothed in typical dress!<a name=38:3802></a> May the reader be enabled to enter into it, to make his own of it, to stay his conscience upon it, to feed and refresh his heart with it, to delight his whole soul in it.<a name=38:3803></a> Not I, but Christ.<a name=38:3804></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may, however, be objected that the fact of Christ's being a spotless lamb is not sufficient to roll the burden of guilt from a sin-stained conscience -- a sweet-savour offering would not, of itself, avail for a guilty sinner.<a name=38:3805></a> This objection might be urged; but our type fully meets and entirely removes it.<a name=38:3806></a> It is quite true that a burnt offering would not have been sufficient where "leaven "was in question; and hence we read, "Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a <i>sin offering</i>, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.<a name=38:3807></a>" (verse 19) The "sin offering" was the answer to the "leaven" in the loaves -- "peace" was established, so that communion could be enjoyed, and all went up in immediate connection with the "sweet savour" of the "burnt offering" unto the Lord.<a name=38:3808></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, on the day of Pentecost, the church was presented, in all the value and excellency of Christ, through the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:3809></a> Though having in itself the leaven of the old nature, that leaven was not reckoned, because the divine Sin Offering had perfectly answered for it.<a name=38:3810></a> The power of the Holy Ghost did not remove the leaven, but the blood of the Lamb had atoned for it.<a name=38:3811></a> This is a most interesting and important distinction.<a name=38:3812></a> The work of the Spirit in the believer does not remove indwelling evil.<a name=38:3813></a> It enables him to detect, judge, and subdue the evil; but no amount of spiritual power can do away with the fact that the evil is there -- though, blessed be God, the conscience is at perfect ease, inasmuch as the blood of our Sin Offering has eternally settled the whole question; and, therefore, instead of our evil being under the eye of God, it has been put out of sight for ever, and we are accepted in all the acceptableness of Christ, who offered Himself to God as a sweet-smelling sacrifice, that He might perfectly glorify Him in all things, and be the food of His people for ever.<a name=38:3814></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to Pentecost -- after which a long; period is entered to roll on ere we have any movement amongst the people.<a name=38:3815></a> there is, however, the notice of "the poor and stranger" in that beautiful ordinance which has already been referred to in its moral aspect.<a name=38:3816></a> Here we may look at it in a dispensational point of view.<a name=38:3817></a> "And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God.<a name=38:3818></a>" (verse 22) Provision is here made for the stranger to glean in Israel's fields.<a name=38:3819></a> The Gentile is to be brought in to participate in the overflowing goodness of God.<a name=38:3820></a> When Israel's storehouse and winepress have been fully furnished, there will be precious sheaves and rich clusters for the Gentile to gather.<a name=38:3821></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not, however, to suppose that the spiritual blessings with which the Church is endowed in the heavenlies with Christ are set forth under the figure of a stranger gleaning in Israel's fields.<a name=38:3822></a> These blessings are as new to the seed of Abraham as they are to the Gentile.<a name=38:3823></a> They are not the gleanings of Canaan, but the glories of heaven -- the glories of Christ.<a name=38:3824></a> The Church is not merely blessed by Christ, but with and in Christ.<a name=38:3825></a> The bride of Christ will not be sent forth to gather up, as a stranger, the sheaves and clusters in the corners of Israel's fields, and from the branches of Israel's vines.<a name=38:3826></a> No; she tastes of higher blessings, richer joys, nobler dignities, than ought that Israel ever knew.<a name=38:3827></a> She is not to glean as a stranger on earth, but to enjoy her own wealthy and happy home in heaven to which she belongs.<a name=38:3828></a> This is the "better thing" which God hath, in His manifold wisdom and grace, "reserved" for her.<a name=38:3829></a> No doubt, it will be a gracious privilege for "the stranger" to be permitted to glean after Israel's harvest is reaped; but the church's portion is incomparably higher, even to be the bride of Israel's king, the partner of His throne, the sharer of His joys, His dignities, and His glories; to be like Him, and with Him, for ever.<a name=38:3830></a> The eternal mansions of the Father's house on high, and not the ungleaned corners of Israel's fields below, are to be the church's portion.<a name=38:3831></a> May we ever bear this in mind, and live, in some small degree, worthy of such a holy and elevated destination!<a name=38:3832></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a Sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.<a name=38:3833></a> Ye shall do no servile work; but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.<a name=38:3834></a>" (verse 23-25) A new subject is introduced here, by the words, "the Lord spake unto Moses," which, let me remark in passing, affords an interesting help in classifying the subjects of the entire chapter.<a name=38:3835></a> Thus, the Sabbath, the Passover, and the feast of unleavened bread, are given under the first communication.<a name=38:3836></a> The wave sheaf, the wave loaves, and the ungleaned corners, are given under the second; after which we have a long unnoticed interval, and then comes the soul-stirring feast of trumpets, on the first day of the seventh month.<a name=38:3837></a> This ordinance leads us on to the time, now fast approaching, when the remnant of Israel shall "blow up the trumpet" for a memorial, calling to remembrance their long-lost glory, and stirring up themselves to seek the Lord.<a name=38:3838></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The feast of trumpets is intimately connected with another great solemnity, namely, "the day of atonement.<a name=38:3839></a>" "<i>Also</i> on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.<a name=38:3840></a> And ye shall do no work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God .<a name=38:3841></a>.<a name=38:3842></a>.<a name=38:3843></a> .<a name=38:3844></a>.<a name=38:3845></a> it shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.<a name=38:3846></a>" (verse 27-32) Thus, after the blowing of the trumpets, an interval of eight days elapses, and then we have the day of atonement, with which these things are connected, namely, affliction of soul, atonement for sin, and rest from labour.<a name=38:3847></a> All these things will find their due place in the experience of the Jewish remnant, by and by.<a name=38:3848></a> "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.<a name=38:3849></a>" (Jeremiah 8: 20) such will be the pathetic lament of the remnant when the Spirit of God shall have begun to touch their heart and conscience.<a name=38:3850></a> "And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall Be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for her firstborn.<a name=38:3851></a> In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.<a name=38:3852></a> And the land shall mourn, every family apart," etc.<a name=38:3853></a> (Zechariah 12: 10-14).<a name=38:3854></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What deep mourning, what intense affliction, what genuine penitence there will be, when, under the mighty action of the Holy Ghost, the conscience of the remnant shall recall the sins of the past, the neglect of the Sabbath, the breach of the law, the stoning of the prophets, the piercing of the Son, the resistance of the Spirit!<a name=38:3855></a> All these things will come in array on the tablets of an enlightened and exercised conscience, and produce keen affliction of soul.<a name=38:3856></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the blood of atonement will meet all.<a name=38:3857></a> "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.<a name=38:3858></a>" (Zechariah 13: 1) They will be made to feel their guilt and be afflicted, and they will also be led to see the efficacy of the blood and perfect peace -- a sabbath of rest unto their souls.<a name=38:3859></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when such results shall have been reached, in the experience of Israel, in the latter day, for what should we look?<a name=38:3860></a> Surely, THE GLORY.<a name=38:3861></a> When the "blindness" is removed, and The veil is taken away, when the heart of the remnant is turned to Jehovah, then shall the bright beams of the "Sun of righteousness" fall, in healing, restoring, and saving power upon a truly penitent, afflicted, and poor people.<a name=38:3862></a> To enter elaborately upon this subject would demand a volume in itself.<a name=38:3863></a> The exercises, the experiences, the conflicts, the trials, the difficulties, and the ultimate blessings of the Jewish remnant are fully detailed throughout the Psalms and Prophets.<a name=38:3864></a> The existence of such a body must be clearly seen, ere the Psalms and Prophets can be studied with intelligence and satisfaction.<a name=38:3865></a> Not but that we may learn much from those portions of inspiration, for "all scripture is profitable.<a name=38:3866></a>" But the surest way to make a right use of any portion of the Word of God, is to understand its primary application.<a name=38:3867></a>.<a name=38:3868></a> If, then, we apply scriptures to the Church or heavenly body which belong, strictly speaking, to the Jewish remnant or earthly body, we must be involved in serious error as to both the one and the other.<a name=38:3869></a> In point of fact, it happens, in many cases, that the existence of such a body as the remnant is completely ignored, and the true position and hope of the Church are entirely lost sight of.<a name=38:3870></a> These are grave errors which my reader should sedulously seek to avoid.<a name=38:3871></a> Let him not suppose, for a moment, that they are mere speculations fitted only to engage the attention of the curious, and possessing no practical power whatever.<a name=38:3872></a> There could not be a more erroneous supposition.<a name=38:3873></a> What!<a name=38:3874></a> is it of no practical value to us to know whether we belong to earth or heaven?<a name=38:3875></a> Is it of no real moment to us to know whether we shall be at rest in the mansions above, or passing through the apocalyptic judgements down here?<a name=38:3876></a> Who could admit ought so unreasonable?<a name=38:3877></a> The truth is, it would be difficult to fix on any line of truth more practical than that which unfolds the distinctive destinies of the earthly remnant and the heavenly Church.<a name=38:3878></a> I shall not pursue the subject further, here; but the reader will find it well worthy of his calm and prayerful study.<a name=38:3879></a> We shall close this section with a view of the feast of tabernacles -- the last solemnity of the Jewish year.<a name=38:3880></a>

		This feast points us forward to the time of Israel's glory in the latter day, and, therefore, it forms a most lovely and appropriate close to the whole series of feasts.<a name=38:3891></a> The harvest was gathered in, all was done, the storehouses were amply furnished, and Jehovah would have His people to give expression to their festive joy.<a name=38:3892></a> But, alas!<a name=38:3893></a> they seem to have had but little heart to enter into the divine thought in reference to this most delightful ordinance.<a name=38:3894></a> They lost sight of the fact that they had been strangers and pilgrims, and hence their long neglect of this feast.<a name=38:3895></a> From the days of Joshua down to the time of Nehemiah, the feast of tabernacles had never once been celebrated.<a name=38:3896></a> It was reserved for the feeble remnant that returned from the Babylonish captivity to do what had not been done even in the bright days of Solomon.<a name=38:3897></a> "And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun, unto that day, had not the children of Israel done so.<a name=38:3898></a> and there was very great gladness.<a name=38:3899></a>" (Nehemiah 8: 17) How refreshing it must have been to those who had hung their harps on the willows of Babylon, to find themselves beneath the shade of the willows of Canaan!<a name=38:3900></a> It was a sweet foretaste of that time of which the feast of tabernacles was the type, when Israel's restored tribes shall repose within those millennial bowers which the faithful hand of Jehovah will erect for them in the land which He sware to give unto Abraham and to his seed for ever.<a name=38:3901></a> Thrice happy moment when the heavenly and the earthly shall meet, as intimated, in "the first day" and "the eighth day" of the feast of tabernacles!<a name=38:3902></a> "The heavens shall hear the earth, and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine, and the oil, and they shall hear Jezreel.<a name=38:3903></a>"

		There is a fine passage in the last chapter of Zechariah which goes to prove, very distinctly, that the true celebration of the feast of tabernacles belongs to the glory of the latter day.<a name=38:3904></a> "And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.<a name=38:3905></a>" (Leviticus 14: 16) What a scene!<a name=38:3906></a> Who would seek to rob it of its characteristic beauty by a vague system of interpretation falsely called spiritualizing?<a name=38:3907></a> Surely, Jerusalem means Jerusalem; nations mean nations; and the feast of tabernacles means the feast of tabernacles.<a name=38:3908></a> Is there anything incredible in this?<a name=38:3909></a> Surely, nothing save to man's reason which rejects all that lies beyond its narrow range.<a name=38:3910></a> The feast of tabernacles shall yet be celebrated in the land of Canaan, and the nations of the saved shall go up thither to participate in its glorious and hallowed festivities.<a name=38:3911></a> Jerusalem's warfare shall then be accomplished, the roar of battle shall cease.<a name=38:3912></a> The sword and the spear shall be transformed into the implements of peaceful agriculture; Israel shall repose beneath the refreshing shade of their vines and fig-trees; and all the earth shall rejoice in the government of "the Prince of Peace.<a name=38:3913></a>" Such is the prospect presented in the unerring pages of inspiration.<a name=38:3914></a> The types foreshadow it; the prophets prophesy of it; faith believes it; and hope anticipates it.<a name=38:3915></a>

		NOTE.<a name=38:3916></a> -- At the close of our chapter we read, "And Moses declared unto the children of Israel <i>the feasts of the Lord</i>.<a name=38:3917></a>" This was their true character, their original title; but in the Gospel of John, they are called "<i>feasts of the Jews</i>.<a name=38:3918></a>" They had long ceased to be Jehovah's feasts.<a name=38:3919></a> He was shut out.<a name=38:3920></a> They did not want Him; and, hence, in John 7, when Jesus was asked to go up to "<i>the Jews' feast of tabernacles</i>," He answered," My time is not yet come;" and when He did go up it was "privately," to take His place outside of the whole thing, and to call upon every thirsty soul to come unto Him and drink.<a name=38:3921></a> There is a solemn lesson in this.<a name=38:3922></a> Divine institutions are speedily marred in the hands of man; but, oh!<a name=38:3923></a> how deeply blessed to know that the thirsty soul that feels the barrenness and drought connected with a scene of empty religious formality, has only to flee to Jesus and drink freely of His exhaustless springs, and so become a channel of blessing to others.<a name=38:3924></a>

		There is very much to interest the spiritual mind in this brief section.<a name=38:3925></a> We have seen in chapter 23.<a name=38:3926></a> the history of the dealings of God with Israel, from the offering up of the Pascal Lamb, until the rest and glory of the millennial Kingdom.<a name=38:3927></a> In the chapter now before us, we have two grand ideas -- namely, first, the unfailing record and memorial of the twelve tribes, maintained before God, by the power of the Spirit, and the efficacy of Christ's priesthood; and, secondly, the apostasy of Israel after the flesh, and divine judgement executed thereon.<a name=38:3928></a> It is the clear apprehension of the former that will enable us to contemplate the latter.<a name=38:3929></a>

		But, further, we read, "And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two-tenth deals shall be in one cake.<a name=38:3943></a> And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the Lord.<a name=38:3944></a> And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord.<a name=38:3945></a> Every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord <i>continually</i>, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.<a name=38:3946></a> And it shall be Aaron's and his sons; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, by a perpetual statute.<a name=38:3947></a>" (verse 5-9) There is no mention of leaven in these loaves.<a name=38:3948></a> They represent, I doubt not, Christ in immediate connection with "the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=38:3949></a>" They were laid up in the sanctuary before the Lord, on the pure table, for seven days, after which they became the food of Aaron and his sons, furnishing another striking figure of Israel's condition in the view of Jehovah, whatever might be their outward aspect.<a name=38:3950></a> The twelve tribes are ever before Him.<a name=38:3951></a> Their memorial can never perish.<a name=38:3952></a> They are ranged in divine order in the sanctuary, covered with the fragrant incense of Christ, and reflected from the pure table whereon they rest beneath the bright beams of that golden lamp which shines, with undimmed lustre, through the darkest hour of the nation's moral night.<a name=38:3953></a>

		Now, it is well to see that we are not sacrificing sound judgement or divine truth on the altar of fancy, when we venture to interpret, after such a fashion, the mystic furniture of the sanctuary.<a name=38:3954></a> We are taught, in Hebrews 9, that all these things were "the patterns of things in the heavens;" and again, in Hebrews 10: 1, that they were" a shadow of good things to come.<a name=38:3955></a>" We are, therefore, warranted in believing that there are "things in the heavens" answering to the" patterns" -- that there is a substance answering to the "shadow".<a name=38:3956></a> In a word, we are warranted in believing that there is that "in the heavens" which answers to "the seven lamps," "the pure table," and the "twelve loaves.<a name=38:3957></a>" This is not human imagination, but divine truth on which faith has fed, in all ages.<a name=38:3958></a> What was the meaning of Elijah's altar of "twelve stones," on the top of Carmel?<a name=38:3959></a> It was nothing else than the expression of his faith in that truth of which the "twelve loaves" were "the pattern" or "the shadow.<a name=38:3960></a>" He believed in the unbroken unity of the nation, maintained before God in the eternal stability of the promise made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whatever might be the external condition of the nation.<a name=38:3961></a> Man might look in vain for the manifested unity of the twelve tribes; but faith could always look within the hallowed enclosure of the sanctuary, and there see the twelve loaves, covered with pure frankincense, ranged in divine order on the pure table; and even though all without were wrapped in midnight's gloomy shades, yet could faith discern, by the light of the seven golden lamps, the same grand truth foreshadowed -- namely, the indissoluble unity of Israel's twelve tribes.<a name=38:3962></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The peculiar place assigned by the inspired penman to this narrative is striking and interesting.<a name=38:4011></a> I have no doubt whatever but that it is designed to give us the opposite side of the picture presented in the opening verses of the chapter.<a name=38:4012></a> Israel after the flesh has grievously failed and sinned against Jehovah.<a name=38:4013></a> The name of the Lord has been blasphemed amongst the Gentiles.<a name=38:4014></a> Wrath has come upon the nation.<a name=38:4015></a> The judgements of an offended God have fallen upon them.<a name=38:4016></a> But the day is coming when the dark and heavy cloud of judgement shall roll away; and then shall the twelve tribes, in their unbroken unity, stand forth before all the nations as the amazing monument of Jehovah's faithfulness and loving-kindness, "And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.<a name=38:4017></a> Behold, God is my salvation: I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song, he also is become my salvation.<a name=38:4018></a> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.<a name=38:4019></a> And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call Upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.<a name=38:4020></a> Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.<a name=38:4021></a> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.<a name=38:4022></a>" (Isaiah 12) "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.<a name=38:4023></a> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<a name=38:4024></a> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.<a name=38:4025></a> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.<a name=38:4026></a> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=38:4027></a> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet hare now obtained mercy through their unbelief: even so have these also now not believed in your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.<a name=38:4028></a> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.<a name=38:4029></a> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=38:4030></a> How unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways past finding out!<a name=38:4031></a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord?<a name=38:4032></a> or who hath been his counsellor?<a name=38:4033></a> Or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?<a name=38:4034></a> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.<a name=38:4035></a> Amen" (Romans 11: 25-36).<a name=38:4036></a>

		Passages might be multiplied to prove that though Israel is suffering the divine judgement because of sin, yet "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance" -- that though the blasphemer is being stoned without the camp, the twelve loaves are undisturbed within the sanctuary.<a name=38:4037></a> "The voices of the prophets" declare, and the voices of apostles re-echo the glorious truth that "all Israel shall be saved;" not because they have not sinned, but because "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=38:4038></a>" Let Christians beware how they tamper with "the promises made unto the fathers.<a name=38:4039></a>" If these promises be explained away or misapplied, it must, necessarily, weaken our moral sense of the divine integrity and accuracy of Scripture, as a whole.<a name=38:4040></a> If one part may be explained away, so may another.<a name=38:4041></a>

		The intelligent reader will discern a strong moral link between this and the preceding chapter.<a name=38:4044></a> In Leviticus 24 we learn that the house of Israel is preserved for the land of Canaan.<a name=38:4045></a> In chapter 25 we learn that the land of Canaan is preserved for the house of Israel.<a name=38:4046></a> Taking both together, we have the record of a truth which no power of earth or hell can obliterate.<a name=38:4047></a> "All Israel shall be saved," and "the land shall not be sold forever.<a name=38:4048></a>" The former of these statements enunciates a principle which has stood like a rock amid the ocean of conflicting interpretations; while the latter declares a fact which many nations of the uncircumcised have sought in vain to ignore.<a name=38:4049></a>

		The reader will, I doubt not, observe the peculiar way in which our chapter opens.<a name=38:4050></a> "And!<a name=38:4051></a> the Lord spake unto Moses in <i>Mount Sinai</i>.<a name=38:4052></a>" The principal part of the communications contained in the Book of Leviticus is characterised by the fact of its emanating "from the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=38:4053></a>" This is easily accounted for.<a name=38:4054></a> Those communications have special reference to the service, communion, and worship of the priests, or to the moral condition of the people, and hence they are issued, as might be expected, from "the tabernacle of the congregation," that grand centre of all that appertained, in any way, to priestly service.<a name=38:4055></a> Here, however, the communication is made from quite a different point.<a name=38:4056></a> "The Lord spake unto Moses in <i>Mount Sinai</i>.<a name=38:4057></a>" Now, we know that every expression in Scripture has its own special meaning, and we are justified in expecting a different line of communication from "mount Sinai" from that which reaches us from "the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=38:4058></a>" And so it is.<a name=38:4059></a> The chapter at which we have now arrived treats of Jehovah's claims as Lord of all the earth.<a name=38:4060></a> It is not the worship and communion of a priestly house, or the internal ordering of the nation; but the claims of God in government, His right to give a certain portion of the earth to a certain people to hold as tenants under Him.<a name=38:4061></a> In a word, it is not to Jehovah in "the tabernacle" -- the place of <i>worship</i>; but Jehovah in "Mount Sinai" -- the place of <i>government</i>.<a name=38:4062></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount Sinai, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.<a name=38:4063></a> Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land, a Sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.<a name=38:4064></a> That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.<a name=38:4065></a> And the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee, and for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat" (verse 1-7).<a name=38:4066></a>

		Here, then, we have the special feature of the Lord's land.<a name=38:4067></a> He would have it to enjoy a sabbatical year, and in that year there was to be the evidence of the rich profusion with which He would bless those who held as tenants under Him.<a name=38:4068></a> Happy, highly privileged tenantry!<a name=38:4069></a> What an honour to hold immediately under Jehovah!<a name=38:4070></a> No rent!<a name=38:4071></a> No taxes!<a name=38:4072></a> No burdens!<a name=38:4073></a> Well might it be said, "Happy is the people that is in such a case; yea, happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah.<a name=38:4074></a>" We know, alas!<a name=38:4075></a> that Israel failed to take full possession of that wealthy land of which Jehovah made them a present, He had given it <i>all</i>.<a name=38:4076></a> He had given it <i>forever</i>.<a name=38:4077></a> They took but <i>a part</i>, and that for <i>a time</i>.<a name=38:4078></a> Still, there it is, The property is there, though the tenants are ejected for the present.<a name=38:4079></a> "the land shall not be sold <i>for ever</i>: for <i>the land is mine</i>; for ye are strangers and sojourners <i>with me</i>.<a name=38:4080></a>" What does this mean, but that Canaan belongs specially to Jehovah, and that He will hold it through the tribes of Israel?<a name=38:4081></a> True, "the earth is the Lord's," but that is quite another thing.<a name=38:4082></a> It is plain that He has been pleased, for His own unsearchable purposes, to take special possession of the land of Canaan, and to submit that land to a peculiar line of treatment, to mark it off from all other lands, by calling it His own, and to distinguish it by judgements, and ordinances, and periodical solemnities, the mere contemplation of which enlightens the understanding: and affects the heart.<a name=38:4083></a> Where, throughout all the earth, do we read of a land enjoying a year of unbroken repose -- a year of richest abundance?<a name=38:4084></a> The rationalist may ask, "How can these things be" The sceptic may doubt if they could be; but faith finds a satisfying answer from the lips of Jehovah: "And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?<a name=38:4085></a> behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.<a name=38:4086></a> And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.<a name=38:4087></a>" (verse 20-22) Nature might say, "What shall we do for <i>our sowing</i>?<a name=38:4088></a>" Gods answer is, "I will command <i>My blessing</i>.<a name=38:4089></a>" God's "blessing" is better far than man's "sowing.<a name=38:4090></a>" He was not going to let them starve in His sabbatic year.<a name=38:4091></a> They were to feed upon the fruits of His blessing, while they celebrated His year of rest -- a year which pointed forward to that eternal Sabbath that remains for the people of God.<a name=38:4092></a>

		There is no spot in all the earth like unto the land of Canaan in the divine estimation.<a name=38:4126></a> There Jehovah set up His throne and His sanctuary; there His priests stood to minister continually before Him; there the voices of His prophets were heard testifying of present ruin and future restoration and glory; there the Baptist began, continued, and ended his career as the forerunner of the Messiah; there the Blessed One was born of a woman; there He was baptised; there He preached and taught; there He laboured and died; from there He ascended in triumph to the right hand of God; thither God the Holy Ghost descended, in Pentecostal power; from thence the overflowing tide of gospel testimony emanated to the ends of the earth; thither the Lord of glory will descend, ere long, and plant His foot "on the mount of Olives;" there His throne will be re-established and His worship restored.<a name=38:4127></a> In a word, His eyes and His heart are there continually; its dust is precious in His sight; it is the centre of all His thoughts and operations, as touching this earth; and it is His purpose to make it an eternal excellency, the joy of many generations.<a name=38:4128></a>

		It is, then, I repeat, immensely important to get a firm hold of this interesting line of truth with respect to the land of Canaan.<a name=38:4129></a> Of that land Jehovah hath said, "IT IS MINE.<a name=38:4130></a>" Who shall take it from Him?<a name=38:4131></a> Where is the king or the emperor, where the power, human or diabolical, that can wrest "the pleasant land out of Jehovah's omnipotent grasp?<a name=38:4132></a> True, it has been a bone of contention, an apple of discord to the nations.<a name=38:4133></a> It has been, and it will yet be, the scene and centre of cruel war and bloodshed.<a name=38:4134></a> But far above all the din of battle and the strife of nations, these words fall with divine clearness, fullness, and power, upon the ear of faith -- "<i>the land is mine</i>!<a name=38:4135></a>" Jehovah can never give up that land, nor those "twelve tribes," through whom He is to inherit it for ever.<a name=38:4136></a> Let my reader think of this.<a name=38:4137></a> Let him ponder it deeply.<a name=38:4138></a> Let him guard against all looseness of thought and vagueness of interpretation, as to this subject.<a name=38:4139></a> God hath not cast away His people, or the land which He sware to give unto them for an everlasting possession.<a name=38:4140></a> "The twelve loaves" of Leviticus 24 bear witness to the former; and "the jubilee" of Leviticus 25 bears witness to the latter.<a name=38:4141></a> The memorial of the "twelve tribes of Israel" is ever before the Lord; and the moment is rapidly approaching when the trump of jubilee shall be heard upon the mountains of Palestine.<a name=38:4142></a> Then, in reality, the captive shall cast off the ignominious chain which, for ages, has bound him.<a name=38:4143></a> Then shall the exile return to that happy home from which he has so long been banished.<a name=38:4144></a> Then shall every debt be cancelled, every burden removed, and every tear wiped away.<a name=38:4145></a> "For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her (Jerusalem) like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.<a name=38:4146></a> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.<a name=38:4147></a> And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.<a name=38:4148></a> For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<a name=38:4149></a> For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many .<a name=38:4150></a>.<a name=38:4151></a>.<a name=38:4152></a> .<a name=38:4153></a>.<a name=38:4154></a>.<a name=38:4155></a> .<a name=38:4156></a>.<a name=38:4157></a> For I know their works and their thoughts; it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory, And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.<a name=38:4158></a> And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord, out of all nations, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.<a name=38:4159></a> And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord.<a name=38:4160></a> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain.<a name=38:4161></a> And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord" (Isaiah 66: 12-23).<a name=38:4162></a>

		And, now, let us look for a moment at the practical effect of the jubilee -- its influence upon the transactions between man and man.<a name=38:4163></a> "And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another.<a name=38:4164></a> according to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee.<a name=38:4165></a>" The scale of prices was to be regulated by the jubilee.<a name=38:4166></a> If that glorious event were at hand, the price was low; if far off, the price was high.<a name=38:4167></a> All human compacts as to land were broken up the moment the trump of jubilee was heard, for the land was Jehovah's; and the jubilee brought all back to its normal condition.<a name=38:4168></a>

		But, alas!<a name=38:4198></a> Israel failed altogether.<a name=38:4199></a> Notwithstanding the solemn and appalling picture placed before their eyes, in verses 14-33 of this chapter, they forsook the Lord and served other gods, and thus brought upon themselves the sore judgements threatened in this section, the bare record of which is sufficient to make the ears tingle.<a name=38:4200></a> Under the heavy weight of these judgements they are suffering at this very hour.<a name=38:4201></a> Scattered and peeled, wasted and outcast, they are the monuments of Jehovah's inflexible truth and justice.<a name=38:4202></a> They read aloud, to all the nations of the earth, a most impressive lesson on the subject of the moral government of God -- a lesson which it would be profitable for these nations to study deeply, yea, and a lesson which it would be salutary for our own hearts to ponder likewise.<a name=38:4203></a>

		We are very prone to confound two things which are clearly distinguished in the word, namely, God's government and God's <i>grace</i>.<a name=38:4204></a> The evils which result from this confusion are various.<a name=38:4205></a> It is sure to lead to an enfeebled sense of the dignity and solemnity of government, and of the purity, fullness, and elevation of grace.<a name=38:4206></a> It is quite true that God in government reserves to Himself the sovereign right to act in patience, long-suffering, and mercy; but the exercise of these attributes, in connection with His throne of government, must never be confounded with the unconditional actings of pure and absolute grace.<a name=38:4207></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter before us is a record of divine government, and yet, in it we find such clauses as the following: "If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me; and that also they have walked contrary unto me, and that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.<a name=38:4208></a> The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her Sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgements, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.<a name=38:4209></a> And yet, for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.<a name=38:4210></a> But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord" (verse 40-45).<a name=38:4211></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we find God in government, meeting, in long-suffering mercy, the very earliest and faintest breathings of a broken and penitent spirit.<a name=38:4212></a> The history of the judges and of the kings presents many instances of the exercise of this blessed attribute of the divine government.<a name=38:4213></a> Again and again, the soul of Jehovah was grieved for Israel, (Judges 10: 16,) and He sent them one deliverer after another, until at length there remained no hope, and the righteous claims of His throne demanded their expulsion from that land which they were wholly incompetent to keep.<a name=38:4214></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is <i>government</i>.<a name=38:4215></a> But, by and by, Israel will be brought into possession of the land of Canaan on the ground of unqualified and unchangeable <i>grace</i> -- grace exercised in divine righteousness through the blood of the cross.<a name=38:4216></a> It will not be by works of law; nor yet by the institutions of an evanescent economy, but by that grace which "reigns through righteousness, by Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=38:4217></a>" Wherefore, they Shall never again be driven forth from their possession.<a name=38:4218></a> No enemy shall ever molest them.<a name=38:4219></a> They shall enjoy undisturbed repose behind the shield of Jehovah's favour.<a name=38:4220></a> Their tenure of the land will be according to the eternal stability of divine grace, and the efficacy of the blood of the everlasting covenant.<a name=38:4221></a> "They shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation.<a name=38:4222></a>"

		LEVITICUS 27
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This closing section of our book treats of the "singular vow," or the voluntary act whereby a person devoted himself or his property unto the Lord.<a name=38:4224></a> "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation.<a name=38:4225></a> And thy estimation shall be .<a name=38:4226></a>.<a name=38:4227></a>.<a name=38:4228></a> .<a name=38:4229></a>.<a name=38:4230></a>.<a name=38:4231></a> after the shekel of the sanctuary.<a name=38:4232></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the case of a person devoting himself, or his beast, his house, or his field, unto the Lord, it was obviously a question of capacity or worth; and, hence, there was a certain scale of valuation, according to age.<a name=38:4233></a> Moses, as the representative of the claims of God, was called upon to estimate, in each case, according to the standard of the sanctuary.<a name=38:4234></a> If a man undertakes to Make a vow, he must be tried by the standard of righteousness; and, moreover, in all cases, we are called upon to recognise the difference between capacity and title.<a name=38:4235></a> In Exodus 30: 15, we read, in reference to the atonement money, "The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.<a name=38:4236></a>" In the matter of atonement all stood upon one common level.<a name=38:4237></a> Thus it must ever be.<a name=38:4238></a> High and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, old and young, all have one common title.<a name=38:4239></a> "There is no difference.<a name=38:4240></a>" All stand alike on the ground of the infinite preciousness of the blood of Christ.<a name=38:4241></a> There may be a vast difference as to capacity, as to title there is none.<a name=38:4242></a> There may be a vast difference as to experience -- as to title there is none.<a name=38:4243></a> There may be a vast difference as to knowledge, gift, and fruitfulness -- as to title there is none.<a name=38:4244></a> The sapling and the tree, the babe and the father, the convert of yesterday and the matured believer, are all on the same ground.<a name=38:4245></a> "The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less.<a name=38:4246></a>" Nothing more could be given, nothing less could be taken.<a name=38:4247></a> "We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=38:4248></a>" This is our title to enter.<a name=38:4249></a> Our capacity to worship, when we have entered, will depend upon our spiritual energy.<a name=38:4250></a> Christ is our title.<a name=38:4251></a> The Holy Ghost is our capacity.<a name=38:4252></a> Self has nothing to do with either the one or the other.<a name=38:4253></a> What a mercy!<a name=38:4254></a> We get in by the blood of Jesus; we enjoy what we find there by the Holy Ghost.<a name=38:4255></a> The blood of Jesus opens the door; the Holy Ghost conducts us through the house.<a name=38:4256></a> The blood of Jesus opens the casket; the Holy Ghost unfolds the precious contents.<a name=38:4257></a> The blood of Jesus makes the casket ours; the Holy Ghost enables us to appreciate its rare and costly gems.<a name=38:4258></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in Leviticus 27, it is entirely a question of ability, capacity, or worth.<a name=38:4259></a> Moses had a certain standard from which he could not possibly descend.<a name=38:4260></a> He had a certain rule from which he could not possibly swerve.<a name=38:4261></a> If any one could come up to that well; if not, he had to take his place accordingly.<a name=38:4262></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, then, was to be done in reference to the person who was unable to rise to the height of the claims set forth by the representative of divine righteousness?<a name=38:4263></a> Hear the consolatory answer: "But if he be <i>poorer</i> than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before <i>the priest</i>, and the priest shall value him; <i>according to, his ability</i> that vowed shall the priest value him.<a name=38:4264></a>" (verse 8) In other words, if it be a question of man's undertaking to meet the claims of <i>righteousness</i>, then he must meet them.<a name=38:4265></a> But if, on the other hand, a man feels himself wholly unable to meet those claims, he has only to fall back upon grace, which will take him up, just as he is.<a name=38:4266></a> Moses is the representative of the claims of divine righteousness.<a name=38:4267></a> The priest is the exponent of the provisions of divine grace.<a name=38:4268></a> The poor man who was unable to stand before Moses fell back into the arms of the priest.<a name=38:4269></a> Thus it is ever.<a name=38:4270></a> If we cannot "<i>dig</i>" we can "<i>beg</i>;" and directly we take the place of a beggar, it is no longer a question of what we are able to <i>earn</i>, but of what God is pleased to <i>give</i>.<a name=38:4271></a> "Grace all the work shall crown, through everlasting days.<a name=38:4272></a>" How happy it is to be debtors to grace!<a name=38:4273></a> How happy to take when God is glorified in giving!<a name=38:4274></a> When man is in question, it is infinitely better to dig than to beg; but when God is in question, the case is the very reverse.<a name=38:4275></a>

		I would just add, that I believe this entire chapter bears, in an especial manner, upon the nation of Israel.<a name=38:4276></a> It is intimately connected with the two preceding chapters.<a name=38:4277></a> Israel made "a singular vow" at the foot of Mount Horeb; but were quite unable to meet the claims of law -- they were far "poorer than Moses' estimation.<a name=38:4278></a>'' But, blessed be God, they will come in under the rich provisions of divine grace.<a name=38:4279></a> Having learnt their total inability "to dig," they will not be "ashamed to beg;" and, hence, they shall experience the deep blessedness of being cast upon the sovereign mercy of Jehovah, which stretches, like a golden chain, "from everlasting to everlasting.<a name=38:4280></a>" It is well to be poor, when the knowledge of our poverty serves but to unfold to us the exhaustless riches of divine grace.<a name=38:4281></a> That grace can never suffer any one to go empty away.<a name=38:4282></a> It can never tell any one that he is too poor.<a name=38:4283></a> It can meet the very deepest human need; and not only so but it is glorified in meeting it.<a name=38:4284></a> This holds good in every case.<a name=38:4285></a> It is true of any individual sinner; and it is true with respect to Israel, who, having been valued by the Lawgiver, have proved "poorer than his estimation.<a name=38:4286></a>" Grace is the grand and only resource for all.<a name=38:4287></a> It is the basis of our salvation; the basis of a life of practical godliness; and the basis of those imperishable hopes which animate us amid the trials and conflicts of this sin-stricken world.<a name=38:4288></a> May we cherish a deeper sense of grace, and more ardent desire for the glory!<a name=38:4289></a>
