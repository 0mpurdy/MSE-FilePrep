		We now enter upon the study of the fourth grand division of the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses; and we shall find the leading characteristic of this book quite as strongly marked as that of any of the three books which have already engaged our attention.<a name=1:1></a> In the Book of Genesis, after the record of creation, the deluge, and the Babel dispersion, we have God's election of the seed of Abraham.<a name=1:2></a> In the book of Exodus, we have redemption.<a name=1:3></a> Leviticus gives us priestly worship and communion.<a name=1:4></a> In Numbers we have the walk and warfare of the wilderness.<a name=1:5></a> Such are the prominent subjects of these most precious sections of inspiration, while, as might be expected, many other points of deepest interest are collaterally introduced.<a name=1:6></a> the Lord, in His great mercy, has led us through the study of Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus; and we can reckon on Him, with confidence, to conduct as through the Book of Numbers.<a name=1:7></a> May His Spirit lead the thoughts, and guide the pen, so that not a sentence may be committed to writing that is not in strict accordance with His holy mind!<a name=1:8></a> May every page and every paragraph bear the stamp of His approval, and be, at once, conducive to His glory, and the permanent profit of the reader!<a name=1:9></a>

		"And the Lord spake unto Moses <i>in the wilderness</i> of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls; From twenty years old and upward, all that are <i>able to go forth to war</i> in Israel; thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies" Numbers 1: 1-3.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we find ourselves, at once, "in the wilderness, where those only are to be taken account of who are "able to go forth to war".<a name=1:11></a> This is strongly marked.<a name=1:12></a> In the book of Genesis the seed of Israel were in the loins of their father Abraham.<a name=1:13></a> In the Book of Exodus they were in the brick-kilns of Egypt.<a name=1:14></a> In Leviticus they were gathered round the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:15></a> In Numbers they are seen in the wilderness.<a name=1:16></a> Then, again, in full keeping with the above, and in confirmation thereof, in Genesis we hearken to the call of God in election; in Exodus we gaze upon the blood of the Lamb in redemption; in Leviticus we are almost entirely occupied with the worship, and service of the sanctuary.<a name=1:17></a> But no sooner have we opened the book of Numbers than we read of men of war, of armies, of standards, of camps, and trumpets sounding alarm.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is highly characteristic, and marks off the book on which we are now entering as one of special interest, value, and importance to the Christian.<a name=1:19></a> Each book of the Bible, each section of the inspired canon, has its own distinct place and object.<a name=1:20></a> Each has its own niche assigned to it by its divine Author.<a name=1:21></a> We must not entertain, for a moment, the thought of instituting any comparison in point of intrinsic value, interest, and importance.<a name=1:22></a> all is divine, and therefore perfect.<a name=1:23></a> The Christian reader fully and heartily believes this.<a name=1:24></a> He reverently sets his seal to the truth of the plenary inspiration of holy scripture -- of all scripture, and of the Pentateuch amongst the rest; nor is he to be moved, one hairs breadth, from this by the bold and impious attacks of infidels, ancient, medieval, or modern.<a name=1:25></a> Infidels and rationalists may traffic in their unhallowed reasonings.<a name=1:26></a> They may exhibit their enmity against the book and its author; but the pious "Christian rests, not withstanding all, in the simple and happy belief that "All scripture is given by inspiration God".<a name=1:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while we must utterly reject the idea of any comparison as to authority and value, we may, with, much profit, compare the contents, design, and scope of the various books of the Bible.<a name=1:28></a> And the more profoundly we meditate upon these, the more forcibly shall we be struck with the exquisite beauty, infinite wisdom, and wonderful precision of the volume a whole, and of each distinct division the thereof.<a name=1:29></a> The inspired writer never swerves from the direct object of the book, whatever that object may be.<a name=1:30></a> You will never find anything in any one book of the Bible which is not in the most perfect harmony with the main design of that book;.<a name=1:31></a> To prove and illustrate this statement would lead us through the entire canon of holy scripture, and hence we shall not attempt it.<a name=1:32></a> The intelligent Christian does not need the proof, however much he might be interested in the illustration.<a name=1:33></a> He takes his stand upon the great fact that the book, as a whole, and in all its parts, is from God; and His heart reposes in the conclusion, that in that whole, and in each of those parts, there is not a jot or a tittle which is not in every way worthy of the divine Author.<a name=1:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hear the following words from the pen of one who expresses himself as "deeply convinced of the divine inspiration of the scriptures, given to us of God, and confirmed in this conviction by daily and growing discoveries of their fullness, depth, and perfectness, ever more sensible, through grace, of the admirable perfection of the parts, and the wonderful connection of the whole".<a name=1:35></a> "The scriptures," says this writer, "have a living source, and living power has pervaded their composition: hence their infiniteness of bearing, and the impossibility of separating any one part from the whole, because one God is the living centre from which all flows; one Christ the living centre round which all its truth circles, and to which it refers, though in various glory; and one Spirit the divine sap which carries its power from its source in God to the minutest branches of the all-uniting truth, testifying of the glory, the grace, and the truth of Him whom God sets forth as the object, and centre, and head of all that is in connection with Himself, of Him who is, withal, God over all, blessed for evermore .<a name=1:36></a>.<a name=1:37></a>.<a name=1:38></a> .<a name=1:39></a>.<a name=1:40></a>.<a name=1:41></a> The more -- beginning from the utmost leaves and branches of this revelation of the mind of God, by which we have been reached when far from Him -- we have traced it up towards its centre, and thence looked down again towards its extent and diversity, the more we learn its infiniteness, and our own feebleness of apprehension.<a name=1:42></a> We learn, blessed be God, this, that the love which is its source is found in unmingled perfectness and fullest display of those manifestations of it which have reached us even in our ruined state.<a name=1:43></a> The same perfect God of love is in it all.<a name=1:44></a> But the unfoldings of divine wisdom in the counsels in which God has displayed Himself remain ever to us a subject of research, in which every new discovery, by increasing our spiritual intelligence, makes the infiniteness of the whole, and the way in which it surpasses all our thoughts, only more and more clear to us".<a name=1:45></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is truly refreshing to transcribe such lines from the pen of one who has been a profound student of scripture for forty years.<a name=1:46></a> They are of unspeakable value, of a moment when so many are ready to cast a slight upon the sacred volume.<a name=1:47></a> Not that we are, in any wise, dependent upon human testimony in forming our conclusions as to the divine origin of the Bible, inasmuch as these conclusions rest upon a foundation furnished by the Bible itself.<a name=1:48></a> God's word, as well as His work, speaks for itself; it carries its own credentials with it; it speaks to the heart; it reaches down to the great moral roots of our being; it penetrates the very innermost chambers of the soul; it shows us what we are; it speaks to us as no other book can speak; and, as the woman of Sychar argued that Jesus must be the Christ because He told her all things that ever she did, so may we say in reference to the Bible, It tells us all that ever we did, is not this the word of God?<a name=1:49></a> No doubt it is only by the Spirit's teaching that we can discern and appreciate the evidence and credentials with which holy scripture presents itself before us; but still it does speak for itself, and needs not human testimony to make it of value to the soul.<a name=1:50></a> We should no more think of having our faith in the Bible established upon man's testimony in its favour than we should think of having it shaken by his testimony against it.<a name=1:51></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the very last possible importance, at all times, but more especially at a moment like the present, to have the heart and mind established in the sound truth of the divine authority of holy scripture - its plenary inspiration -- its all-sufficiency for all purposes, for all people, at all times.<a name=1:52></a> There are two hostile influences abroad, namely, infidelity, on the one hand, and superstition, on the other.<a name=1:53></a> The former denies that God has spoken to us in His word.<a name=1:54></a> The latter admits that He has spoken, but it denies that we can understand what He says, save by the interpretation of the Church.<a name=1:55></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, while there are very many who recoil with horror from the impiety and audacity of infidelity, they do not see that superstition, just as completely, deprives them of the scriptures.<a name=1:56></a> For wherein, let us ask, lies the difference between denying that God has spoken, and denying that we can understand what He says?<a name=1:57></a> In either case: are we not deprived of the word of God?<a name=1:58></a> Unquestionably.<a name=1:59></a> If God cannot make me understand what He says -- if He cannot give me the assurance that it is He Himself who speaks, I am, in no wise, better off than if He had not spoken at all.<a name=1:60></a> If God's word is not sufficient, without human interpretation, then it cannot be God's word at all.<a name=1:61></a> That which is insufficient is not God's word.<a name=1:62></a> We must admit either of two things, namely, that God has not spoken at all, or if He has spoken, His word is perfect.<a name=1:63></a> There is no neutral ground in reference to this question.<a name=1:64></a> Has God given us a revelation?<a name=1:65></a> Infidelity says, "No".<a name=1:66></a> superstition says, "Yes, but you cannot understand it without human authority.<a name=1:67></a>" Thus are we, in the one case as well as in the other, deprived of the priceless treasure of God's own precious word; and thus, too, infidelity and superstition, though apparently so unlike, meet in the one point of depriving us of a divine revelation.<a name=1:68></a> But, blessed be God, He has given us a revelation.<a name=1:69></a> He has spoken, and His word is able to teach the heart and the understanding also.<a name=1:70></a> God is able to give the certainty that it is He who speaks, and we do not want any human authority to intervene.<a name=1:71></a> We do not want a poor rush-light to enable us to see that the sun is shining.<a name=1:72></a> The beams of that glorious Luminary are quite enough without any such miserable addition.<a name=1:73></a> All we want is to stand in the sunshine and we shall be convinced that the sun shines.<a name=1:74></a> If we retire into a vault or into a tunnel, we shall not feel his influence; and just so is it with regard to scripture, if we place ourselves beneath the chilling and darkening influences of superstition or infidelity, we shall not experience the genial and enlightening power of that divine revelation.<a name=1:75></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said thus much as to the divine volume as a whole, we shall now proceed to consider the contents of the section which lies open before us.<a name=1:76></a> In Numbers 1 we have the declaration of the <i>pedigree</i>;" and in Numbers 2, the recognition of the "<i>standard</i>.<a name=1:77></a>" "And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names: and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and <i>they declared their pedigrees</i> after their families, by the house of their fathers; according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.<a name=1:78></a> as the Lord commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.<a name=1:79></a>" Numbers 1: 17-19.<a name=1:80></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Has this any voice for us?<a name=1:81></a> Does it convey any great spiritual lesson to our understanding?<a name=1:82></a> assuredly it does.<a name=1:83></a> In the first place, it suggests this important question to the reader, "Can I declare my pedigree?<a name=1:84></a>" It is greatly to be feared there are hundreds, if not thousands, of professing Christians who are wholly incompetent to do so.<a name=1:85></a> They cannot say with clearness and decision, "<i>Now are</i> we the sons of God.<a name=1:86></a>" (1 John 3: 2) "We are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=1:87></a>" " And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<a name=1:88></a>" (Galatians 3: 26, 29) " For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God .<a name=1:89></a>.<a name=1:90></a>.<a name=1:91></a> .<a name=1:92></a>.<a name=1:93></a>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we <i>are</i> the sons of God.<a name=1:94></a>" Romans 8: 14, 16.<a name=1:95></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the Christian's "pedigree," and it is his privilege to be able to "declare" it.<a name=1:96></a> He is born from above -- born again -- born of water and the spirit, i.<a name=1:97></a>e.<a name=1:98></a>, by the word and by the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:99></a> (Compare, diligently, John 3: 5; James 1: 18; 1 Peter 1: 23; Ephesians 5: 26) The believer traces his pedigree directly up to a risen Christ in glory.<a name=1:100></a> This is Christian genealogy.<a name=1:101></a> So far as our natural pedigree is concerned, if we trace it up to its source, and then declare it honestly, we must see and admit that we are sprung from a ruined stock.<a name=1:102></a> Ours is a fallen family.<a name=1:103></a> Our fortunes are gone; our very blood attainted; we are irrecoverably ruined; we can never regain our original position; our former status and the inheritance which belonged to it are irretrievably lost.<a name=1:104></a> A man may be able to trace his genealogical line throughout a race Of nobles, of princes, or of kings; but is he is finally to "declare his pedigree," he cannot stop short of a fallen, ruined, outcast head.<a name=1:105></a> We must get to the source of a thing to know what it really is.<a name=1:106></a> It is thus God looks at and judges of things, and we must think with Him if we would think aright.<a name=1:107></a> His judgement of men and things must be dominant for ever.<a name=1:108></a> Man's judgement is only ephemeral, it lasts but for a day; and hence, according to faith's estimate, the estimate of sound sense, "It is a small thing to be judged of man's day.<a name=1:109></a>" (1 Corinthians 4: 3) Oh!<a name=1:110></a> how small!<a name=1:111></a> Would that we felt more deeply how small a thing it is to be judged of man's judgement, or, as the margin reads it, of man's day!<a name=1:112></a> Would that we walked, habitually, in the real sense of the smallness thereof!<a name=1:113></a> It would impart a calm elevation and a holy dignity which would lift us above the influence of the scene through which we are passing.<a name=1:114></a> what is rank in this life?<a name=1:115></a> What importance can attach to a pedigree which, if honestly traced, and faithfully declared, is derived from a ruined stock?<a name=1:116></a> A man can only be proud of his birth when he stops short of his real Origin: as born in sin and shapen in iniquity.<a name=1:117></a>" Such is man's origin -- such his birth.<a name=1:118></a> Who can think of being proud of such a birth, of such an origin?<a name=1:119></a> Who but one whose mind the god of this world hath blinded?<a name=1:120></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how different with the Christian!<a name=1:121></a> His pedigree is heavenly.<a name=1:122></a> His "genealogical tree strikes its roots into the soil of the new creation.<a name=1:123></a> Death can never break the line, inasmuch as it is formed in resurrection.<a name=1:124></a> We cannot be too simple as to this.<a name=1:125></a> It is of the utmost importance that the reader should be thoroughly clear on this foundation point.<a name=1:126></a> We can easily see from this first chapter of Numbers, how, essential it was that every member of the congregation of Israel should be able to declare his pedigree Uncertainty, on this point, would have proved disastrous; it would have produced hopeless confusion.<a name=1:127></a> We can hardly imagine an Israelite, when called to declare his pedigree, expressing himself in the doubtful manner adopted by many Christians now-a-days.<a name=1:128></a> We cannot conceive his saying, well, I am not quite sure.<a name=1:129></a> Sometimes I cherish the hope that I am of the stock of Israel, but at other times, I am full of fear that I do not belong to the congregation Of the Lord at all.<a name=1:130></a> I am all in uncertainty and darkness.<a name=1:131></a> Can we conceive of such language.<a name=1:132></a> Assuredly not.<a name=1:133></a> Much less could we imagine anyone maintaining the monstrous notion that no one could possibly be sure as to whether he was a true Israelite or not until the day of judgement.<a name=1:134></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All such ideas and reasonings -- all such doubts, fears, and questions, we may rest assured, were foreign to the mind of the Israelite.<a name=1:135></a> Every member of the congregation was called to declare his pedigree, ere taking his place in the ranks as a man of war.<a name=1:136></a> Each one was able to say, like Saul of Tarsus, "Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel," etc.<a name=1:137></a> All was settled and clear, and necessarily so if there was to be any real entrance upon the walk and warfare of the wilderness.<a name=1:138></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, may we not legitimately ask, "If a Jew could be certain as to his pedigree, why may not a Christian be certain as to his?<a name=1:139></a> Reader, weigh this question, and if you are one of that large class of persons who are never able to arrive at the blessed certainty of their heavenly lineage, their spiritual birth, pause, we beseech you, and let us reason with you on this momentous point.<a name=1:140></a> It may be you are disposed to ask, "How can I be sure that I am, really and truly, a child of God, a member of Christ, born of the word and Spirit of God?<a name=1:141></a> I would give worlds, were they mine, to be certain as to this most weighty question.<a name=1:142></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, then, we would earnestly desire to help you in this matter.<a name=1:143></a> Indeed one special object before us in penning these "Notes" is to assist anxious souls, by answering, as the Lord may enable us, their questions, solving their difficulties, and removing the stumbling-blocks out of their way.<a name=1:144></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, first of all, let as point out one special feature which belongs to all the children of God, without exception.<a name=1:145></a> It is a very simple, but a very blessed feature.<a name=1:146></a> If we do not possess it, in some degree, it is most certain we are not of the heavenly race; but if we do possess it, it is just as certain that we are, and we may, therefore, without any difficulty or reserve, "declare our pedigree.<a name=1:147></a>" now what is this feature?<a name=1:148></a> What is this great family characteristic?<a name=1:149></a> Our Lord Jesus Christ supplies the answer.<a name=1:150></a> He tells as that "Wisdom is justified of <i>all</i> her children.<a name=1:151></a>" (Luke 7: 35; Matthew 11: 19) all the children of Wisdom, from the days of Abel down to the present moment, have been marked by this great family trait.<a name=1:152></a> There is not so much as a single exception.<a name=1:153></a> All God's children -- all the sons of Wisdom have always exhibited, in some degree, this moral feature -- they have justified God.<a name=1:154></a> Let the reader consider this.<a name=1:155></a> It may be he finds it hard to understand what is meant by justifying God; but a passage or two of holy scripture will, we trust, make it quite plain.<a name=1:156></a> We read in Luke 7 that "all the people that heard Jesus, and the publicans, justified God, being baptised with the baptism of John.<a name=1:157></a> But, the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptised of him.<a name=1:158></a>" (verse 29, 30) Here we have the two generations brought, as it were, face to face.<a name=1:159></a> The publicans justified God and condemned themselves.<a name=1:160></a> The Pharisees justified themselves and judged God.<a name=1:161></a> The former submitted to the baptism of John -- the baptism of repentance.<a name=1:162></a> The latter refused that baptism -- refused to repent -- refused to humble and to judge themselves.<a name=1:163></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the two great classes into which the whole human family has been divided, from the days of Abel and Cain down to the present day; and here, too, we have the simplest possible test by which to try our "pedigree.<a name=1:164></a>" Have we taken the place of self-condemnation?<a name=1:165></a> Have we bowed in true repentance before God?<a name=1:166></a> This is to justify God.<a name=1:167></a> The two things go together -- yea, they are one and the same.<a name=1:168></a> The man who condemns himself justifies God; and the man who justifies God condemns himself.<a name=1:169></a> On the other hand, the man who justifies himself judges God; and the man who judges God justifies himself.<a name=1:170></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it stands in every case.<a name=1:171></a> And be it observed that the very moment we take the ground of repentance and self judgement, God takes the ground of a Justifier.<a name=1:172></a> God always justifies those who condemn themselves.<a name=1:173></a> All His children justify Him, and He justifies all His children.<a name=1:174></a> The moment David said, "I have sinned against the Lord," the answer was, "the Lord hath put away thy sin.<a name=1:175></a>" Divine forgiveness follows, with the most intense rapidity, human confession.<a name=1:176></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence it follows that nothing can be more foolish than for any one to justify himself, inasmuch as God must be justified in His sayings, and overcome when He is judged.<a name=1:177></a> (Comp.<a name=1:178></a> Psalm 51: 4; Romans 3: 4) God must have the upper hand in the end, and then all self justification shall be seen in its true light.<a name=1:179></a> The wisest thing therefore is to condemn ourselves.<a name=1:180></a> This is what all the children of wisdom do.<a name=1:181></a> Nothing is more characteristic of the true members of wisdom's family then the habit and spirit of self-judgement.<a name=1:182></a> Whereas, on the other hand, nothing so marks all those who are not of this family as a spirit of self-vindication.<a name=1:183></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things are worthy of our most earnest attention.<a name=1:184></a> Nature will blame anything and everything, any one and every one but itself.<a name=1:185></a> But where grace is at work, there is ever a readiness to judge self, and take the lowly place.<a name=1:186></a> This is the true secret of blessing and peace.<a name=1:187></a> All God's children have stood on this blessed ground, exhibited this lovely moral trait, and reached this grand result.<a name=1:188></a> we cannot find so much as a single exception in the entire history of Wisdom's happy family; and we may safely say, that if the reader has been led, in truth and reality, to own himself lost -- to condemn himself -- to take the place of true repentance-then is he, in very deed, one of the children of Wisdom, and he may therefore, with boldness and decision, "declare his pedigree.<a name=1:189></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We would urge this point at the outset.<a name=1:190></a> It is impossible for any one to recognise and rally round the proper "standard" unless he can declare his "pedigree.<a name=1:191></a>" In short, it is impossible to take up a true position in the wilderness so long as there is any uncertainty as to this great question.<a name=1:192></a> How could an Israelite of old have taken his place in the assembly -- how could he have stood in the ranks -- how could he expect to make any progress through the wilderness, if he could not distinctly declare his pedigree?<a name=1:193></a> Impossible.<a name=1:194></a> Just so is it with Christians now.<a name=1:195></a> Progress in wilderness life -- success in spiritual warfare, is out of the question if there be any uncertainty as to the spiritual pedigree.<a name=1:196></a> We must be able to say, "<i>we know</i> that we have passed from death unto life" -- "<i>We know</i> that we are of God" -- "We believe and are sure, ere there can be any real advance in the life and walk of a Christian.<a name=1:197></a>

		Reader, say, can you declare your pedigree?<a name=1:198></a> Is this a thoroughly settled point with you?<a name=1:199></a> Are you clear as to this in the very depths of your soul?<a name=1:200></a> When you are all alone with God, is it a perfectly settled question between you and Him?<a name=1:201></a> Search and see.<a name=1:202></a> Make sure work of it.<a name=1:203></a> Do not slur the matter over.<a name=1:204></a> Build not upon mere profession.<a name=1:205></a> Say not "I am a member of such a church; I receive the Lord's supper; I hold such and such doctrines; I have been religiously brought up I live a moral life; I have done nobody any harm; I read the Bible and say my prayers; I have family worship in my house; I give largely in the cause of philanthropy and religion.<a name=1:206></a>" All this may be perfectly true of you, and yet you may not have a single pulse of divine life, a single ray of divine light.<a name=1:207></a> Not one of these things, not all of them put together, could be accepted as a declaration of spiritual pedigree.<a name=1:208></a> There must be the witness of the spirit that you are a child of God, and this witness always accompanies simple faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:209></a> "He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness in himself.<a name=1:210></a>" (1 John 5: 10) It is not, by any means, a question of looking into your own heart for evidences.<a name=1:211></a> It is not a building upon frames, feelings, and experiences.<a name=1:212></a> Nothing of the sort.<a name=1:213></a> It is a childlike faith in Christ.<a name=1:214></a> It is having eternal life in the Son of God.<a name=1:215></a> It is the imperishable record of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:216></a> It is taking God at His word.<a name=1:217></a> "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, <i>hath</i> everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement (<i>krisin</i>), but <i>is passed</i> from death unto life.<a name=1:218></a>" John 5: 24.<a name=1:219></a>

		This is the true way to declare your pedigree; and be assured of it, you must be able to declare it ere you can "go forth to war.<a name=1:220></a>" We do not mean to say you cannot be saved without this.<a name=1:221></a> God forbid we should say any such thing.<a name=1:222></a> We believe there are hundreds of the true Spiritual Israel who are not able to declare their pedigree.<a name=1:223></a> But we ask, Are such able to go forth to war?<a name=1:224></a> Are they vigorous military men?<a name=1:225></a> Far from it.<a name=1:226></a> They cannot even know what true conflict is; on the contrary, persons of this class mistake their doubts and fears, their dark and cloudy seasons, for true Christian conflict This is a most serious mistake; but alas!<a name=1:227></a> a very common one.<a name=1:228></a> We continually find a, low, dark, legal condition of soul defended on the ground of Christian conflict, whereas, according to the New Testament, true Christian conflict or warfare is carried on in a region were doubts and fears are unknown.<a name=1:229></a> It is when we stand in the clear daylight of God's full salvation-salvation in a risen Christ -- that we really enter upon the warfare proper to us as Christians.<a name=1:230></a> Are we to suppose, for a moment, that our legal struggles, our culpable unbelief, our refusal to submit to the righteousness of God, our questionings and reasonings, can be viewed as Christian conflict?<a name=1:231></a> By no means.<a name=1:232></a> All these things must be regarded as conflict with God; whereas Christian conflict is carried on with Satan.<a name=1:233></a> "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places.<a name=1:234></a>" Ephesians 6: 12.<a name=1:235></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is Christian conflict.<a name=1:236></a> But can such conflict be waged by those who are continually doubting whether they are Christians or not?<a name=1:237></a> We do not believe it.<a name=1:238></a> Could we imagine an Israelite in conflict with Amalek in the wilderness, or with the Canaanites in the land of promise, while yet unable to "declare his pedigree" or recognise his "standard?<a name=1:239></a>" The thing is inconceivable.<a name=1:240></a> No, no; every member of the congregation, who was able to go forth to war was perfectly clear and settled as to those two points.<a name=1:241></a> Indeed he could not go forth if he were not so.<a name=1:242></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, while on the important subject of Christian conflict, it may be well to call the reader's attention to the three portions of New Testament scripture in which we have three distinct characters of conflict presented, namely, Romans 7: 7-24; Galatians verse 17; Ephesians 6: 10-17.<a name=1:243></a> If the reader will just turn, for a moment, to the above scriptures, we shall seek to point out the true character of each.<a name=1:244></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans 7: 7-24 we have the struggle of a soul quickened but not emancipated -- a regenerated soul under the law.<a name=1:245></a> The proof that we have before us, here, a quickened soul is found in such utterances as these, "That which I do, I allow not" -- "to will is present with me" -- "<i>I delight in the law of God after the inward man</i>.<a name=1:246></a>" None but a regenerated soul could speak thus.<a name=1:247></a> The disallowance of the wrong, the will to do right, the inward delight in the law of God -- all these are the distinct marks of the new life -- the precious fruits of regeneration.<a name=1:248></a> No unconverted person could truthfully use such language.<a name=1:249></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, the proofs that we have before us, in this scripture, a soul not fully emancipated, not in the joy of known deliverance, not in the full consciousness of victory, not in the assured possession of spiritual power -- the plain proofs of all this we have in such utterances as the following, "I am carnal, sold under sin" -- "what I would that do I not; but what I hate that do I" -- "O wretched man that I am!<a name=1:250></a> who shall deliver me?<a name=1:251></a>" Now, we know that a Christian is not "carnal," but spiritual; he is not "sold under sin," but redeemed from its power; he is not a "wretched man" sighing for deliverance, but a happy man who knows himself delivered.<a name=1:252></a> He is not an impotent slave, unable to do the right thing, and ever compelled to do the wrong; he is a free man!<a name=1:253></a> endowed with power in the Holy Ghost, and able to say, "I can do <i>all</i> things through Christ that strengtheneth me.<a name=1:254></a>" Philippians 4.<a name=1:255></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot here attempt to enter upon a full exposition of this most important scripture; we merely offer a suggestion or two which may help the reader to seize its scope and import.<a name=1:256></a> We are fully aware that many Christians differ widely as to the interpretation of this chapter.<a name=1:257></a> Some deny that it presents the exercises of a quickened soul; others maintain that it sets forth the experiences proper to a Christian.<a name=1:258></a> We cannot accept either conclusion.<a name=1:259></a> We believe it exhibits to our view the exercises of a truly regenerated soul, but of a soul not set free by the knowledge of its union with a risen Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:260></a> Hundreds of Christians are actually in the seventh of Romans but their proper place is in the eighth.<a name=1:261></a> They are, as to their experience, under the law.<a name=1:262></a> They do not know themselves as sealed by the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:263></a> They are not in possession of full victory in a risen and glorified Christ.<a name=1:264></a> They have doubts and fears, and are ever disposed to cry out "O wretched man that I am!<a name=1:265></a> Who shall deliver we?<a name=1:266></a> But is not a Christian delivered?<a name=1:267></a> Is he not saved?<a name=1:268></a> Is he not accepted in the Beloved?<a name=1:269></a> Is he not sealed by that Holy Spirit of promise?<a name=1:270></a> Is he not united to Christ?<a name=1:271></a> Ought he not to know and enjoy, and to confess all this?<a name=1:272></a> Unquestionably.<a name=1:273></a> Well then he is no longer, as to his standing, in the seventh of Romans.<a name=1:274></a> It is his privilege to sing the song of victory at heaven's side of the empty tomb of Jesus, and to walk in the holy liberty wherewith Christ makes His people free.<a name=1:275></a> The seventh of Romans is not liberty at all, but bondage, except indeed at the very close, where the soul is able to say, "I thank God.<a name=1:276></a>" No doubt, it may be a very wholesome exercise to pass through all that is here detailed for us with such marvellous vividness and power; and, furthermore, we must declare that we should vastly prefer being honestly in the seventh of Romans to being falsely in the eighth.<a name=1:277></a> But all this leaves wholly untouched the question as to the proper application of this profoundly interesting passage of scripture.<a name=1:278></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now glance, for a moment, at the conflict in Galatians 5: 17 we shall quote the passage.<a name=1:279></a> "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<a name=1:280></a><a href="#1:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This passage is often quoted to account for continual <i>defeat</i>, whereas it really contains the secret of perpetual victory.<a name=1:281></a> In verse 16 we read, "This I say, then, walk in the Spirit, and <i>ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh</i>.<a name=1:282></a>" This makes it all so clear.<a name=1:283></a> The presence of the Holy Ghost secures power.<a name=1:284></a> We are assured that God is stronger than the flesh, and therefore, where He is in conflict the triumph is secured.<a name=1:285></a> And be it carefully noted that Galatians 5: 17 does not speak of the conflict between the Two natures, the old and the new, but between the Holy Ghost and the flesh.<a name=1:286></a> This is the reason why it is added, "In order that ye may not do the things that ye would.<a name=1:287></a>" If the Holy Ghost were not dwelling in us, we should be sure to fulfil the lust of the flesh; but, inasmuch as He is in us to carry on the warfare, we are no longer obliged to do wrong, but blessedly enabled to do right.<a name=1:288></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>We ought, perhaps, to inform the reader that many able scholars render the last clause of Galatians 5: 17 thus, "In order that we may not do the things that we would." We assuredly believe this rendering.. to be in full keeping with the spirit of the context; though we are, each day, more convinced of the unrivalled excellence of our precious English Bible.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this precisely marks the point of difference between Romans 7: 14, 15 and Galatians 5.<a name=1:289></a>17.<a name=1:290></a> In the former we have the new nature, but not the power of the indwelling Spirit.<a name=1:291></a> In the latter, we have not only the new nature, but also the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:292></a> we must ever bear in mind that the new nature in a believer is dependent.<a name=1:293></a> It is dependent upon the Spirit for power, and upon the word for guidance.<a name=1:294></a> But, clearly, where God The Holy Ghost is, there must be power.<a name=1:295></a> He may be grieved and hindered; but Galatians 5: 16 distinctly teaches that if we walk in the Spirit, we shall have sure and constant victory over the flesh.<a name=1:296></a> Hence, therefore, it would be a very serious mistake indeed to quote Galatians 5: 17 as a reason for a low and carnal walk.<a name=1:297></a> Its teaching is designed to produce the direct opposite.<a name=1:298></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now one word on Ephesians 6: 10-17.<a name=1:299></a> where we have the conflict between the Christian and wicked spirits in heavenly places.<a name=1:300></a> The Church belongs to heaven, and should ever maintain a heavenly walk and conversation.<a name=1:301></a> It should be our constant aim to make good our heavenly standing -- to plant the foot firmly upon our heavenly inheritance, and keep it there.<a name=1:302></a> This the devil seeks to hinder, in every possible way, and hence the conflict; hence too "the whole armour of God," by which alone we can stand against our powerful spiritual foe.<a name=1:303></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not our purpose to dwell upon the armour, as we here merely called the reader's attention to the above three scriptures in order that he may have the subject of conflict, in all its phases, fully before his mind, in connection with the opening lines of the Book of Numbers.<a name=1:304></a> Nothing can be more interesting; nor can we possibly over estimate the importance of being clear as to the real nature and ground of Christian conflict.<a name=1:305></a> If we go forth to war without knowing what the war is about, and in a state of uncertainty as to whether our "pedigree" is all right, we shall not make much headway against the enemy.<a name=1:306></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as has been already remarked, there was another thing quite as necessary for the man of war as the clear declaration of his pedigree, and that was the distinct recognition of his standard.<a name=1:307></a> The two things were essential for the walk and warfare of the wilderness.<a name=1:308></a> Moreover, they were inseparable.<a name=1:309></a> If a man did not know his pedigree, he could not recognise his standard, and thus all would have been plunged in hopeless confusion.<a name=1:310></a> In place of keeping rank, and making steady progress, they would have been in each other's way, and treading one upon another.<a name=1:311></a> Each had to know his post and keep it -- to know his standard and abide by it.<a name=1:312></a> Thus they moved on together; thus progress was made, work done.<a name=1:313></a> and warfare carried on.<a name=1:314></a> The Benjaminite had his post, and the Ephraimite had his, and neither was to interfere with, or cross the path of, the other.<a name=1:315></a> Thus with all the tribes, throughout the camp of the Israel of God.<a name=1:316></a> Each had his pedigree, and each had his post; and neither the one nor the other was according to their own thoughts; all was of God.<a name=1:317></a> He gave the pedigree, and He assigned the standard.<a name=1:318></a> Nor was there any need of comparing one with another, or any ground of jealousy one of another; each had his place to fill, and his work to do, and there was work enough and room enough for all.<a name=1:319></a> There was the greatest possible variety, and yet the most perfect unity.<a name=1:320></a> "Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house.<a name=1:321></a>" "and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers" (Numbers 2: 2, 34).<a name=1:322></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in the camp of old, as well as in the Church now, we learn that "God is not the author of confusion.<a name=1:323></a>" Nothing could be more exquisitely arranged than the four camps, of three tribes each, forming a perfect square, each side of the square exhibiting its own specific standard.<a name=1:324></a> "Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: over against the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.<a name=1:325></a>" The God of the armies of Israel knew how to marshal His hosts.<a name=1:326></a> It would be a great mistake to suppose that God's warriors were not ordered according to the most perfect system of military tactics.<a name=1:327></a> We may plume ourselves upon our progress in arts and sciences, and we may fancy that the host of Israel presented a spectacle of rude disorder and wild confusion, compared with what may be seen in modern times.<a name=1:328></a> But this would be an empty conceit.<a name=1:329></a> We may rest assured that the camp of Israel was ordered and furnished in the most perfect manner, for the simplest and most conclusive of all reasons, namely, that it was ordered and furnished by the hand of God.<a name=1:330></a> Grant us but this, that God has done anything, and we argue, with the most perfect confidence, that it has been perfectly done.<a name=1:331></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This in a very simple, but a very blessed principle.<a name=1:332></a> Of course it would not satisfy an infidel or a sceptic; what would?<a name=1:333></a> It is the province and prerogative of a sceptic to doubt everything, to believe nothing.<a name=1:334></a> He measures everything by his own standard, and rejects whatever he cannot reconcile with his own notions.<a name=1:335></a> He lays down, with marvellous coolness, his own premises, and then proceeds to draw his own conclusions.<a name=1:336></a> But if the premises are false, the conclusions must be false likewise.<a name=1:337></a> And there is this invariable feature attaching to the premises of all sceptics, rationalists, and infidels, <i>they always leave out God</i>; and hence all their conclusion's must be fatally false.<a name=1:338></a> On the other hand, the humble believer starts with this great first principle, that God Is; and not only that He is, but that He has to do with His creatures; that He interests Himself in, and occupies Himself about, the affairs of men.<a name=1:339></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What consolation for the Christian!<a name=1:340></a> But infidelity will not allow this at all.<a name=1:341></a> To bring God in is to upset all the reasonings of the sceptic, for they are based upon the thorough exclusion of God.<a name=1:342></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, we are not now writing in order to meet infidels, but the edification of believers, and it is sometimes well to call attention to the thorough rottenness of the whole system of infidelity; and surely in no way can this be more clearly or forcibly shown than by the fact that it rests entirely upon the exclusion of God.<a name=1:343></a> Let this fact be seized, and the whole system crumbles into dust at our feet.<a name=1:344></a> If we believe that God is, then, assuredly, everything must be wicked in relation to Him.<a name=1:345></a> We must look at all from His point of view.<a name=1:346></a> Nor is this all.<a name=1:347></a> If we believe that God is, then we must see that man cannot judge Him.<a name=1:348></a> God must be the judge of right or wrong, of what is and what is not worthy of Himself.<a name=1:349></a> So also in reference to God's word.<a name=1:350></a> If it be true that God is, and that He has spoken to us, He has given us a revelation, then, assuredly, that revelation is not to be judged by man's reason.<a name=1:351></a> It is above and beyond any such tribunal.<a name=1:352></a> Only think of measuring God's word by the rules of human arithmetic!<a name=1:353></a> and yet this is precisely what has been done in our own day, with this blessed Book of Numbers with which we are now engaged, and with which we shall proceed, leaving infidelity and its arithmetic aside.<a name=1:354></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We feel it very needful, in our notes and reflections on this book, as well as on every other book, to remember two things, namely, first, the <i>book</i>; and secondly, the <i>soul</i>: the book and its contents the soul and its necessities.<a name=1:355></a> There is a danger of becoming so occupied with the former as to forget the latter.<a name=1:356></a> And, on the other hand, there is the danger of becoming so wholly engrossed with the latter as to forget the former.<a name=1:357></a> Both must be attended to.<a name=1:358></a> And we may say that what constitutes an efficient ministry, whether written or oral, is the proper adjustment of these two things.<a name=1:359></a> There are some ministers who study the word very diligently, and, it may be, very profoundly.<a name=1:360></a> They are well versed in biblical knowledge; they have drunk; deeply at the fountain of inspiration.<a name=1:361></a> All this is of the utmost importance, and of the very highest value.<a name=1:362></a> A ministry without this will be barren indeed.<a name=1:363></a> If a man does not study his Bible diligently and prayerfully, he will have little to give to his readers or his hearers; at least little worth their having.<a name=1:364></a> Those who minister in the word must dig for themselves, and "<i>dig deep</i>.<a name=1:365></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the <i>soul</i> must be considered -- its condition anticipated, and its necessities met.<a name=1:366></a> If this be lost sight of, the ministry will lack point, pungency, and power.<a name=1:367></a> It will be inefficient and unfruitful.<a name=1:368></a> In short, the two things must be combined and properly adjusted.<a name=1:369></a> A man who merely studies the <i>book</i> will be unpractical, a man who merely studies the <i>soul</i> will be unfurnished.<a name=1:370></a> A man who duly studies <i>both</i> will be a good minister of Jesus Christ.<a name=1:371></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we desire, in our measure, to be this to the reader; and hence as we travel, in his company, through the marvellous book which lies open before us, we would not only seek to point out its moral beauties, and unfold its holy lessons, but we would also feel it to be our bounden duty to put an occasional question to him or her, as to how far those lessons are being learnt, and those beauties appreciated.<a name=1:372></a> We trust the reader will not object to this, and hence, ere we close this our first section, we would ask him a question or two thereon.<a name=1:373></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And first, then, dear friend, art thou clear and settled as to thy "pedigree?<a name=1:374></a>" Is it a settled thing that thou art on the Lord's side?<a name=1:375></a> Do not, we beseech thee, leave this grand question unsettled.<a name=1:376></a> We have asked it before, and we ask it again.<a name=1:377></a> Dost thou know -- canst thou declare thy spiritual pedigree?<a name=1:378></a> It is the first thing for God's warrior.<a name=1:379></a> It is of no use to think of entering the militant host so long as you are unsettled as to this point.<a name=1:380></a> We say not that a man cannot be saved without this.<a name=1:381></a> Far be the thought.<a name=1:382></a> But he cannot take rank as a man of war.<a name=1:383></a> He cannot do battle with the world, the flesh, and the devil, so long as he is filled with doubts and fears as to whether he belongs to the true spiritual stock.<a name=1:384></a> If there is to be any progress, if there is to be that decision, so essential to a spiritual warrior, we must be able to say, "We <i>know</i> that we have passed from death unto life" -- "We <i>know</i> that we are of God.<a name=1:385></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the proper language of a man of war.<a name=1:386></a> Not one of that mighty host that mustered "over against the tabernacle of the congregation" would have understood such a thing as a single doubt, or shadow of a doubt as to <i>his own very pedigree</i>.<a name=1:387></a> Doubtless, he would have smiled, had any one raised a question on the subject.<a name=1:388></a> Each one of the six hundred thousand knew well whence he had sprung, and, therefore, where he was to take his stand.<a name=1:389></a> And just so with God's militant host now.<a name=1:390></a> Each member thereof will need to possess the most unclouded confidence as to his relationship, else he will not be able to stand in the battle.<a name=1:391></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God dwelt in the midst of His people Israel.<a name=1:456></a> He came down from heaven, not only to redeem them out of the land of Egypt, but to be their travelling companion through the wilderness.<a name=1:457></a> What a thought!<a name=1:458></a> The most High God taking up His abode on the sand of the desert, and in the very bosom of His redeemed congregation!<a name=1:459></a> Truly there was nothing like that throughout the wide, wide world.<a name=1:460></a> There was that host of six hundred thousand men, beside women and children, in a sterile desert, where there was not a blade of grass, not a drop of water -- no visible source of subsistence.<a name=1:461></a> How were they to be fed?<a name=1:462></a> God was there!<a name=1:463></a> How were they to be kept in order God was there!<a name=1:464></a> How were they to track their way through a howling wilderness where there was no way?<a name=1:465></a> God was there!<a name=1:466></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, God's presence secured everything.<a name=1:467></a> Unbelief might say, "What!<a name=1:468></a> are three millions of people to be fed on air?<a name=1:469></a> Who has charge of the commissariat?<a name=1:470></a> Where are the military stores?<a name=1:471></a> Where is the baggage?<a name=1:472></a> Who is to attend to the clothing?<a name=1:473></a>" Faith alone could answer, and its answer brief, and conclusive:" God was there!<a name=1:474></a>" And that was quite sufficient.<a name=1:475></a> All is comprehended in that one sentence.<a name=1:476></a> In faith's arithmetic, God is the only significant figure, and, having Him, you may add as many ciphers as you please.<a name=1:477></a> If all your springs are in the living God, it ceases to be a question of your need, and resolves itself into a question of His sufficiency.<a name=1:478></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What were six hundred thousand footmen to the Almighty God?<a name=1:479></a> What the varied necessities of their wives and children?<a name=1:480></a> In man's estimation, these things might seem overwhelming.<a name=1:481></a> England has just sent out ten thousand troops to Abyssinia; but only think of the enormous expense and labour; think of the number of transports required to convey provisions and other necessaries for that small army.<a name=1:482></a> But imagine an army sixty times the size, together with the women and children.<a name=1:483></a> Conceive this enormous host entering upon a march that was to extend over the space of forty years, through "a great and terrible wilderness," in which there was no corn, no grass, no water-spring.<a name=1:484></a> How were they to be sustained?<a name=1:485></a> No supplies with them -- no arrangements entered into with friendly nations to forward supplies -- no transports despatched to meet them at various points along their route -- in short, not a single visible source of supply -- nothing that nature would consider available.<a name=1:486></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is something worth pondering.<a name=1:487></a> But we must ponder it in the divine presence.<a name=1:488></a> It is of no possible use for reason to sit down and try to solve this mighty problem by human arithmetic.<a name=1:489></a> No, reader; it is only faith that can solve it, and that, moreover, by the word of the living God.<a name=1:490></a> Here lies the precious solution.<a name=1:491></a> Bring God in, and you want no other factors to work out your answer.<a name=1:492></a> Leave Him out, and the more powerful your reason, and the more profound your arithmetic, the more hopeless must be your perplexity.<a name=1:493></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is that faith settles the question.<a name=1:494></a> God was in the midst of His people.<a name=1:495></a> He was there in all the fullness of His grace and mercy -- there in His perfect knowledge of His people's wants, and of the difficulties of their path -- there in His almighty power and boundless resources, to meet these difficulties and supply these wants.<a name=1:496></a> And so fully did He enter into all these things, that He was able, at the close of their long wilderness wanderings, to appeal to their hearts in the following touching accents, "for the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand; he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; <i>thou hast lacked nothing</i>.<a name=1:497></a>" And again, "Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.<a name=1:498></a>" Deuteronomy 2: 7; Deuteronomy 8: 4.<a name=1:499></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in all these things, the camp of Israel was a type -- a vivid, striking type.<a name=1:500></a> A type of what?<a name=1:501></a> A type of the Church of God passing through this world.<a name=1:502></a> The testimony of scripture is so distinct on this point, as to leave no room and no demand for the exercise of imagination.<a name=1:503></a> "all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.<a name=1:504></a>" 1 Corinthians 10: 11.<a name=1:505></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, therefore, we may draw near and gaze, with intense interest upon that marvellous spectacle, and seek to gather up the precious lessons which it is so eminently fitted to teach.<a name=1:506></a> and, oh, what lessons!<a name=1:507></a> Who can duly estimate them?<a name=1:508></a> Look at that mysterious camp in the desert, composed, as we have said, of warriors, workers, and worshippers!<a name=1:509></a> what separation from all the nations of the world!<a name=1:510></a> What utter helplessness!<a name=1:511></a> What exposure!<a name=1:512></a> What absolute dependence upon God!<a name=1:513></a> They had nothing -- could do nothing -- could know nothing.<a name=1:514></a> They had not a morsel of food, nor a drop of water, but as they received it day by day from the immediate hand of God.<a name=1:515></a> When they retired to rest at night, there was not a single atom of provision for the morrow.<a name=1:516></a> There was no storehouse, no larder, no visible source of supply, nothing that nature could take any account of.<a name=1:517></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God was there, and that, in the judgement of faith, was quite enough.<a name=1:518></a> <i>They were shut up to God</i>.<a name=1:519></a> This is the one grand reality.<a name=1:520></a> Faith owns nothing real, nothing solid, nothing true, but the one true, living, eternal God.<a name=1:521></a> Nature might cast a longing look at the granaries of Egypt, and see something tangible, something substantial there.<a name=1:522></a> Faith looks up to heaven and finds <i>all</i> its springs there.<a name=1:523></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it was with the camp in the desert; and thus it is with the Church in the world.<a name=1:524></a> There was not a single exigency, not a single contingency, not a single need of any sort whatsoever, for which the Divine Presence was not an all-sufficient answer.<a name=1:525></a> The nations of the uncircumcised might look on and marvel.<a name=1:526></a> They might, in the bewilderment of blind unbelief, raise many a question as to how such a host could ever be fed, clothed, and kept in order.<a name=1:527></a> Most certainly they had no eyes to <i>see</i> how- it could be done.<a name=1:528></a> They knew not Jehovah, the Lord God of the Hebrews; and therefore to tell them that He was going to undertake for that vast assembly would indeed seem like idle tales.<a name=1:529></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it is now, in reference to the assembly of God, in this world, which may truly be termed a moral wilderness.<a name=1:530></a> Looked at from God's point of view, that assembly is not of the world; it is in complete separation.<a name=1:531></a> It is as thoroughly apart from the world, as the camp of Israel was apart from Egypt.<a name=1:532></a> The waters of the Red Sea rolled between that camp and Egypt; and the deeper and darker waters of the death of Christ roll between the Church of God and this present evil world.<a name=1:533></a> It is impossible to conceive separation more complete.<a name=1:534></a> "They," says our Lord Christ, "are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<a name=1:535></a>" John 17.<a name=1:536></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as to entire dependence; what can be more dependent than the church of God in this world?<a name=1:537></a> She has nothing in or of herself.<a name=1:538></a> She is set down in the midst of a moral desert, a dreary waste, a vast howling wilderness, in the which there is literally nothing on which she can live.<a name=1:539></a> There is not one drop of water, not a single morsel of suited food for the Church of God, throughout the entire compass of this world.<a name=1:540></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also as to the matter of exposure to all sorts of hostile influences.<a name=1:541></a> Nothing can exceed it.<a name=1:542></a> There is not so much as one friendly influence.<a name=1:543></a> All is against her.<a name=1:544></a> She is in the midst of this world like an exotic plant belonging to a foreign clime, and set down in a sphere where both the soil and the atmosphere are uncongenial.<a name=1:545></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the Church of God in the world -- a separated -- dependent -- defenceless thing, wholly cast upon the living God.<a name=1:546></a> It is calculated to give great vividness, force, and clearness to our thoughts about the Church, to view it as the antitype of the camp in the desert; and that it is in no wise fanciful or far-fetched to view it thus, 1 Corinthians 10: 11 does most clearly show.<a name=1:547></a> We are fully warranted in saying that what the camp of Israel was literally, that the Church is morally and spiritually.<a name=1:548></a> And, farther, that what the wilderness was literally to Israel, that the world is, morally and spiritually, to the Church of God.<a name=1:549></a> The wilderness was the sphere of Israel's toil and danger, not of their supplies or their enjoyment; and the world is the sphere of the Church's toil and danger, not of its supplies or its enjoyment.<a name=1:550></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to seize this fact, in all its moral power.<a name=1:551></a> The assembly of God in the world, like "the congregation in the wilderness," is wholly cast upon the living God.<a name=1:552></a> we speak, be it remembered, from the divine standpoint -- of what the Church is in God's sight.<a name=1:553></a> Looked at from man's point of view -- looked at as she is, in her own actual practical state, it is, alas!<a name=1:554></a> another thing.<a name=1:555></a> We are now only occupied with the normal, the true, the divine idea of God's assembly is this world.<a name=1:556></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And let it not be forgotten, for one moment, that, as truly as there was a camp in the desert, of old -- a congregation in the wilderness -- so truly is there the Church of God, the body of Christ, in the world now.<a name=1:557></a> Doubtless, the nations of the world knew little, and cared less, about that congregation of old; but that did not weaken or touch the great living fact.<a name=1:558></a> So now, the men of the world know little and care less about the assembly of God -- the body of Christ; but that, in no wise, touches the grand living truth that there is such a thing actually existing in this world, and has been ever since the Holy Ghost descended on the day of Pentecost.<a name=1:559></a> True, the congregation, of old, had its trials, its conflicts, its sorrows, its temptations, its strifes, its controversies -- its internal commotions -- its numberless and nameless difficulties, calling for the varied resources that were in God -- the precious ministrations of prophet, priest, and king which God had provided; for, as we know, Moses was there as "king in Jeshurun," and as the prophet raised up of God; and Aaron was there to exercise all the priestly functions.<a name=1:560></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in spite of all these things that we have named -- in spite of the weakness, the failure, the sin, the rebellion, the strife -- still there was the striking fact, to be taken cognisance of by men, by devils, and by angels, namely, a vast congregation, amounting to something like three millions of people (according to the usual mode of computation) journeying through a wilderness, wholly dependent upon an unseen arm, guided and cared for by the eternal God, whose eye was never for one moment withdrawn from that mysterious typical host; yea, He dwelt in their midst, and never left them, in all their unbelief, their forgetfulness, their ingratitude, and rebellion.<a name=1:561></a> God was there to sustain and guide, to guard and keep them day and night.<a name=1:562></a> He fed them with bread from heaven, day by day; and He brought them forth water out of the flinty rock.<a name=1:563></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, assuredly, was a stupendous fact -- a profound mystery.<a name=1:564></a> God had a congregation in the wilderness -- apart from the nations around, shut up to Himself.<a name=1:565></a> It may be the nations of the world knew nothing, cared nothing, thought nothing, about this assembly.<a name=1:566></a> It is certain the desert yielded nothing in the way of sustenance or refreshment.<a name=1:567></a> There were serpents and scorpions -- there were snares and dangers -- drought, barrenness, and desolation.<a name=1:568></a> But there was that wonderful assembly maintained in a manner that baffled and confounded human reason.<a name=1:569></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, reader, remember this was a type.<a name=1:570></a> A type of what?<a name=1:571></a> a type of something that has been in existence for over eighteen centuries; is in existence still; and shall be in existence until the moment that our Lord Christ rises from His present position, and descends into the air.<a name=1:572></a> In one word, a type of the Church of God in the world.<a name=1:573></a> How important to recognise this fact!<a name=1:574></a> How sadly it has been lost sight of!<a name=1:575></a> How little understood even now!<a name=1:576></a> and yet every Christian is solemnly responsible to recognise, and practically to confess it.<a name=1:577></a> There is no escaping it.<a name=1:578></a> Is it true that there is something in this world, at this very moment, answering to the camp in the desert?<a name=1:579></a> Yes, verily; there is, in very truth, the Church in the wilderness.<a name=1:580></a> There is an assembly passing through this world, just as the literal Israel passed through the literal desert and, moreover, the world is, morally and spiritually, to that Church what the desert was, literally and practically, to Israel of old.<a name=1:581></a> Israel found no springs in the desert; and the Church of God should find no springs in the world.<a name=1:582></a> If she does, she proves false to her Lord.<a name=1:583></a> Israel was not of the desert, but passing through it; and the Church of God is not of the world, but passing through it.<a name=1:584></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If this be thoroughly entered into by the reader, it will show him the place of complete separation which belongs to the Church of God as a whole, and to each individual member thereof.<a name=1:585></a> The Church, <i>in God's view of her</i>, is as thoroughly marked off from this present world, as the camp of Israel was marked off from.<a name=1:586></a> the surrounding desert.<a name=1:587></a> There is as little in common between the Church and the world, as there was between Israel and the sand of the desert.<a name=1:588></a> The most brilliant attractions and bewitching fascinations of the world are to the Church of God what the serpents and scorpions, and the ten thousand other dangers of the wilderness, were to Israel.<a name=1:589></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the divine idea, of the Church; and it is with this idea that we are now occupied.<a name=1:590></a> Alas!<a name=1:591></a> alas!<a name=1:592></a> how different it is with that which calls itself the Church!<a name=1:593></a> But we want the reader to dwell, for the present, on the true thing.<a name=1:594></a> We want him to place himself, by faith, at God's standpoint, and view the Church from thence.<a name=1:595></a> It is only by so doing that he can have anything like a true idea of what the Church is, or of his own personal responsibility with respect to it.<a name=1:596></a> God has a Church in the world.<a name=1:597></a> There is a body now on the earth, indwelt by God the Spirit, and united to Christ the Head.<a name=1:598></a> This Church -- this body -- is composed of all those who truly believe on the Son of God, and who are united by the grand fact of the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:599></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, be it observed, this is not a matter of opinion - a certain thing which we may take up or lay down at pleasure.<a name=1:600></a> It is a divine fact.<a name=1:601></a> It is a grand truth, whether we will hear or whether we will forbear.<a name=1:602></a> The Church is an existing thing, and we, if believers, are members thereof.<a name=1:603></a> We cannot avoid this.<a name=1:604></a> We cannot ignore it.<a name=1:605></a> We are actually in the relationship -- baptised into it by the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:606></a> It is as real and as positive a thing as the birth of a child into a family.<a name=1:607></a> The birth has taken place, the relationship is formed, and we have only to recognise it, and walk in the sense of it, from day to day.<a name=1:608></a> The very moment in the which a soul is born again -- born from above, and sealed by the Holy Ghost -- he is incorporated into the body of Christ.<a name=1:609></a> He can no longer view himself as a solitary individual -- an independent person -- an isolated atom; he is a member of a body, just as the hand or the foot is a member of the human body.<a name=1:610></a> He is a member of <i>the</i> Church of God, and cannot, properly or truly, be a member of anything else.<a name=1:611></a> How could my arm be a member of any other body?<a name=1:612></a> And, on the same principle, we may ask, how could a member of the body of Christ be a member of any other body?<a name=1:613></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a glorious truth is this respecting the Church of God -- the antitype of the camp in the desert, "the congregation in the wilderness!<a name=1:614></a>" What a fact to be governed by!<a name=1:615></a> There is such a thing as the Church of God, amid all the ruin and the wreck, the strife and the discord, the confusion and division, the sects and parties.<a name=1:616></a> This surely is a most precious truth.<a name=1:617></a> But not only is it most precious, it is also most practical and formative.<a name=1:618></a> We are as bound to recognise, by faith, this Church in the world, as the Israelite was bound to recognise, by sight, the camp in the desert.<a name=1:619></a> There was one camp, one congregation, and the true Israelite belonged thereto; there is one Church -- one body, and the true Christian belongs to it.<a name=1:620></a>

		It may, however, be said that "Things are not as they were in apostolic times.<a name=1:640></a> the professing church has failed; Pentecostal gifts have ceased; the palmy days of the Church's first love have passed away; and therefore we must adopt the best means in our power for the organisation and maintenance of our churches.<a name=1:641></a>" To all this we reply, "God has not failed.<a name=1:642></a> Christ the Head of the Church has not failed.<a name=1:643></a> The Holy Spirit has not failed.<a name=1:644></a> Not one jot or tittle of God's word has failed.<a name=1:645></a>" This is the true ground of faith.<a name=1:646></a> "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=1:647></a>" He has said, "Lo, I am with you.<a name=1:648></a>" How long!<a name=1:649></a> During the days of first love?<a name=1:650></a> during apostolic times?<a name=1:651></a> so long as the Church shall continue faithful?<a name=1:652></a> No; "I am with you <i>always</i>, even unto the end of the age.<a name=1:653></a>" (Matthew 28) So also, at an earlier moment when, for the first time in the whole canon of scripture, the Church, properly so called, is named, we have those memorable words," On this rock [the Son of the living God] I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<a name=1:654></a>" Matthew 16.<a name=1:655></a>

		Oh!<a name=1:726></a> Christian reader, we call upon you, by every argument which ought to weigh with your heart, to give your cordial assent and consent to this one eternal truth, namely, <i>The all-sufficiency of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the assembly of God, in every possible condition in which it can be found, throughout its entire history</i><a href="#1:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> We call upon you not merely to hold this as a true theory, but, to confess it practically and then, assuredly, you will taste the deep blessedness of the presence of Jesus in the outside place -- a blessedness which must be tasted in order to be known; But, when once really tasted, it can never be forgotten or surrendered for anything beside.<a name=1:727></a>

		But we had no intention of pursuing the foregoing line of thought so far, or of penning such a lengthened introduction to the section of our book which lies open before us, and to which we shall now invite the reader's particular attention.<a name=1:728></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On looking attentively at "the congregation in the wilderness" (Acts 7: 38), we find it composed of three distinct elements, namely, <i>warriors, workers, and worshippers</i>.<a name=1:729></a> There was a <i>nation</i> of warriors, a tribe of <i>workers</i>, a <i>family</i> of worshippers or priests.<a name=1:730></a> We have glanced at the first of these and seen each one according to his "pedigree," taking up his position by his "standard," according to the direct appointment of Jehovah; and we shall now dwell for a few moments on the second, and see each one at his work and service, according to the same appointment.<a name=1:731></a> we have considered the warriors; let us meditate on the workers.<a name=1:732></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Levites were distinctly marked off from all the other tribes, and called to a very specific place and service.<a name=1:733></a> Thus we read of them, "But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.<a name=1:734></a> For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying, Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel.<a name=1:735></a> But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.<a name=1:736></a> And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.<a name=1:737></a> and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.<a name=1:738></a> But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=1:739></a>" (Numbers 1: 47-53.<a name=1:740></a>) And again we read, "But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel, as the Lord commanded Moses.<a name=1:741></a>" Numbers 2: 33.<a name=1:742></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But why the Levites?<a name=1:743></a> why was this tribe specially marked off from all the others, and set apart for so holy and elevated a service?<a name=1:744></a> Was there any special sanctity or goodness about them to account for their being so distinguished?<a name=1:745></a> Not by nature, certainly, nor yet by practice, as we may see by the following words "Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.<a name=1:746></a> O, my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for <i>in their anger they slew a man</i>, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.<a name=1:747></a> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.<a name=1:748></a>" Genesis 49.<a name=1:749></a>Such was Levi by nature and by practice -- self-willed, fierce, and cruel.<a name=1:750></a> How remarkable that such an one should be singled out and brought into a place of such high and holy privilege!<a name=1:751></a> Surely we may say it was grace from first to last.<a name=1:752></a> It is the way of grace to take up the very worst cases.<a name=1:753></a> It stoops to the lowest depths and gathers up its brightest trophies from thence.<a name=1:754></a> "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.<a name=1:755></a>" (2 Timothy 1: 16) "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.<a name=1:756></a>" Ephesians 3.<a name=1:757></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how striking the language, "O, my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united.<a name=1:758></a>" God is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity.<a name=1:759></a> God could not come into Levi's secret, or be united unto his assembly.<a name=1:760></a> That was impossible.<a name=1:761></a> God could have nought to do with self-will, fierceness, and cruelty.<a name=1:762></a> But yet He could bring Levi into His secret, and unite him to His assembly.<a name=1:763></a> He could take him out of his habitation, wherein were instruments of cruelty, and bring him into the tabernacle to be occupied with the holy instruments and vessels that were there.<a name=1:764></a> This was grace -- free, sovereign grace; and herein must be sought the basis of all Levi's blessed and elevated service.<a name=1:765></a> So far as he was personally concerned there was an immeasurable distance between him and a holy God -- a chasm which no human art or power could bridge.<a name=1:766></a> A holy God could have nothing to do with self-will fierceness, and cruelty; but a God of grace could have to do with Levi.<a name=1:767></a> He could visit such an one in sovereign mercy, and raise him up from the depths of his moral degradation, and bring him into a place of nearness to Himself.<a name=1:768></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And oh what a marvellous contrast between Levi's position by nature, and his position by grace!<a name=1:769></a> between the instruments of cruelty and the vessels of the sanctuary!<a name=1:770></a> between Levi in Genesis 34 and Levi in Numbers 3 and 4.<a name=1:771></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us look at the mode of God's dealing with Levi -- the ground on which he was brought into such a place of blessing.<a name=1:772></a> In doing this, it will be needful for us to refer to Numbers 8, and there we are let into the secret of the whole matter.<a name=1:773></a> We shall see that there was, and could be, no allowance of anything that belonged to Levi, no sanction of any of his ways; and yet there was the most perfect display of grace -- grace reigning through righteousness.<a name=1:774></a> We speak of the type and its significance.<a name=1:775></a> We do so in view of that statement already referred to: "Now all these things happened unto them for types.<a name=1:776></a>" It is not a question of how far the Levites saw through these things.<a name=1:777></a> This is not at all the point.<a name=1:778></a> We are not to ask, What did the Levites see in God's dealings with them?<a name=1:779></a> But, What do we learn?<a name=1:780></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.<a name=1:781></a> And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.<a name=1:782></a>" Numbers 8: 5-7.<a name=1:783></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have, in type, the only divine principle of cleansing.<a name=1:784></a> It is the application of death to nature and all its habits.<a name=1:785></a> It is the word of God brought to bear upon the heart and conscience, in a living way.<a name=1:786></a> Nothing can be more expressive than the double action presented in the above passage.<a name=1:787></a> Moses was to sprinkle water of purifying upon them; and then they were to shave off all their hair, and wash their garments.<a name=1:788></a> There is great beauty and precision here.<a name=1:789></a> Moses, as representing the claims of God, cleanses the Levites according to those claims; and they, being cleansed, are able to bring the sharp razor to bear upon all that was the mere growth of nature, and to wash their garments, which expresses, in typical form, the cleansing their habits according to the word of God.<a name=1:790></a> This was God's way of meeting all that appertained to Levi's natural state -- the self-will, the fierceness, and the cruelty.<a name=1:791></a> the pure water and the sharp razor were called into action-the washing and shaving had to go on, ere Levi was fit to approach the vessels of the sanctuary.<a name=1:792></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is in every case.<a name=1:793></a> There is, there can be, no allowance of nature among God's workers.<a name=1:794></a> There never was a more fatal mistake than to attempt to enlist nature in the service of God.<a name=1:795></a> It matters not how you may endeavour to improve or regulate it.<a name=1:796></a> It is not improvement, but death that will avail.<a name=1:797></a> It is of the very last possible importance for the reader to lay hold, with clearness and force, of this great practical truth.<a name=1:798></a> Man has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.<a name=1:799></a> The plummet has been applied to him, and he has been found crooked.<a name=1:800></a> It is of no possible use seeking to reform.<a name=1:801></a> Nothing will do save the water and the razor.<a name=1:802></a> God has closed up man's history.<a name=1:803></a> He has brought to an end in the death of Christ.<a name=1:804></a> The first grand fact that the Holy Ghost presses upon the human conscience is, that God has delivered His solemn verdict upon human nature, and that each one must accept that verdict against himself personally.<a name=1:805></a> It is not a matter of opinion, or a matter of feeling.<a name=1:806></a> A person may say, "I do not see, or I do not feel, that I am so bad as you seem to make out.<a name=1:807></a>" We reply, That does not affect the question in the least.<a name=1:808></a> God has declared His judgement about us, and it is man's first duty to fall in with, and bow to that.<a name=1:809></a> Of what use would it have been for Levi to say that he did not agree with what God's word had said about him Would that -- could that, have altered the question as to him?<a name=1:810></a> In no wise.<a name=1:811></a> The divine record remained the same whether Levi felt it or not; but clearly, it was the first step in wisdom's pathway to bow down under the weight of that record.<a name=1:812></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is expressed, in type, in the "water" and the "razor'' the "washing" and the "shaving.<a name=1:813></a>" Nothing could be more significant or impressive.<a name=1:814></a> These acts set forth the solemn truth of the sentence of death upon nature, and the execution of judgement upon all that nature produces.<a name=1:815></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what, let us ask, is the meaning of the initiatory act of Christianity -- the act of baptism?<a name=1:816></a> Does it not set forth the blessed fact that "our old man" -- our fallen nature -- is completely set aside, and that we are introduced into an entirely new position Truly so.<a name=1:817></a> And how do we use the razor?<a name=1:818></a> By rigid self-judgment, day by day; by the stern disallowance of all that is of nature's growth.<a name=1:819></a> This is the true path for all God's workers in the wilderness.<a name=1:820></a> When we look at Levi's conduct at Shechem, in Genesis 34, and the record concerning him in Genesis 49, we may ask, How can such an one ever be allowed to carry the vessels of the sanctuary?<a name=1:821></a> The answer is, Grace shines in Levi's call; and holiness shines in Levi's cleansing.<a name=1:822></a> He was called to the work, according to the riches of divine grace; but he was fitted for the work according to the claims of divine holiness.<a name=1:823></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it must be with all God's workers.<a name=1:824></a> We are most thoroughly convinced that we are fit for God's work just so far as nature is brought under the power of the cross, and the sharp razor of self-judgment.<a name=1:825></a> Self-will can never be made available in the service of God; nay, it must be set aside, if we would know what true service is.<a name=1:826></a> There is, alas!<a name=1:827></a> A large amount of what which passes for service which, if judged in the light of the divine presence, would be seen to be but the fruit of a restless will.<a name=1:828></a> This is most solemn, and demands our most earnest attention.<a name=1:829></a> We cannot exercise too severe a censorship over ourselves, in this very thing.<a name=1:830></a> The heart is so deceitful that we may be led to imagine that we are doing the Lord's work, when, in reality, we are only pleasing ourselves.<a name=1:831></a> But, if we would tread the path of true service, we must seek to be, more and more, apart from nature.<a name=1:832></a> The self-willed Levi must pass through the typical process of washing and shaving, ere he can be employed in that elevated service assigned him by the direct appointment of the God of Israel.<a name=1:833></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, ere proceeding to examine particularly the work and service of the Levites, we must look for a moment at a scene in Exodus 32, in which they act a very prominent and a very remarkable part.<a name=1:834></a> We allude, as the reader will at once perceive, to the golden calf.<a name=1:835></a> During the absence of Moses, the people so completely lost sight of God and His claims as to set up a molten calf and bow down thereto.<a name=1:836></a> This terrible act called for summary judgement.<a name=1:837></a> "And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:) then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=1:838></a> let him come unto me.<a name=1:839></a> And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<a name=1:840></a> and he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<a name=1:841></a> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.<a name=1:842></a> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.<a name=1:843></a>" Exodus 32: 25-29.<a name=1:844></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was a testing moment.<a name=1:845></a> It could not be otherwise, when this great question was pressed home upon the heart and conscience, "<i>Who is on the Lord's side</i>?<a name=1:846></a>" nothing could be more searching.<a name=1:847></a> The question was not, "Who is willing to work?<a name=1:848></a>' No!<a name=1:849></a> it was a far deeper and more searching question.<a name=1:850></a> It was not who will go here or there -- do this or that?<a name=1:851></a> There might be a vast amount of doing and going, and, all the while, it might be but the impulse of an unbroken will which, acting upon religious nature, gave an appearance of devotedness and piety imminently calculated to deceive oneself and others.<a name=1:852></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to be "on the Lord's side" implies the surrender of one's own will -- yea, the surrender of oneself, and this is essential to the true servant -- the real workman.<a name=1:853></a> Saul of Tarsus was on this ground when he exclaimed, "Lord, what wilt <i>thou</i> have <i>me</i> to do?<a name=1:854></a>" What words, from the self-willed, fierce, and cruel persecutor of the Church of God!<a name=1:855></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=1:856></a>" Reader, art thou?<a name=1:857></a> Search and see.<a name=1:858></a> Examine thyself closely.<a name=1:859></a> Remember, the question is not at all "What art thou doing?<a name=1:860></a>' No; it is far deeper.<a name=1:861></a> If thou art on the Lord's side, thou art ready for anything and everything.<a name=1:862></a> Thou art ready to stand still, or ready to go forward; ready to go to the right or to the left; ready to be active, and ready to be quiet; ready to stand on thy feet, and ready to lie on thy back.<a name=1:863></a> the grand point is this, namely, the surrender of thyself to the claims of another, and that other the Lord Christ.<a name=1:864></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is an immense point.<a name=1:865></a> Indeed we know of nothing more important, at the present moment, than this searching question," Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=1:866></a>" We live in days of immense self-will.<a name=1:867></a> Man exults in his liberty.<a name=1:868></a> And this comes out, very prominently, in religious matters.<a name=1:869></a> Just as it was in the camp of Israel, in the days of the thirty-second of Exodus -- the days of The golden calf.<a name=1:870></a> Moses was out of sight, and the human will was at work; the graving tool was called into operation.<a name=1:871></a> And what was the result?<a name=1:872></a> The molten calf; and when Moses returned, he found the people in idolatry and nakedness.<a name=1:873></a> Then came forth the solemn and testing question, "Who is on the Lord's side" This brought things to an issue, or rather it put people to the test.<a name=1:874></a> Nor is it other wise now.<a name=1:875></a> Man's will is rampant, and that too in matters of religion.<a name=1:876></a> Man boasts of his lights, of the freedom of his will, the freedom of his judgement.<a name=1:877></a> There is the denial of the Lordship of Christ; and therefore it behoves us to look well to it, and see that we really are taking sides with the Lord against ourselves; that we are in the attitude of simple subjection to His authority.<a name=1:878></a> Then we shall not be occupied with the amount or character of our service; it will be our one object to do the will of our Lord.<a name=1:879></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to act thus under the Lord may often give an appearance of narrowness to our sphere of action; but with this we have nothing whatever to do.<a name=1:880></a> If a master tells his servant to stand in the hall, and not to stir until he rings the bell, what is the servant's duty?<a name=1:881></a> Clearly to stand still; nor should he be moved from this position or this attitude, even though his fellow-servants should find fault with his apparent inactivity and good-for-nothingness; he may rest assured his Master will approve and vindicate.<a name=1:882></a> This is enough for any true-hearted servant, whose one desire will ever be not so much to do a great deal, as to do the will of his Lord.<a name=1:883></a>

		In a word, then, the question for the camp of Israel, in the day of the golden calf, and the question for the Church, in this day of human will, is this, "Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=1:884></a>" Momentous question!<a name=1:885></a> It is not, Who is on the side of religiousness, philanthropy, or moral reform?<a name=1:886></a> There may be a large amount of any or all of these things, and yet the will be thoroughly unbroken.<a name=1:887></a> Let us not forget this; nay, rather we should say, let us continually bear it in mind.<a name=1:888></a> We may be very zealous in promoting all the various schemes of philanthropy, religiousness, and moral reform, and, all the while, be ministering to self, and feeding self-will.<a name=1:889></a> This is a most solemn and weighty consideration; and it behoves us to give earnest heed to it.<a name=1:890></a> We are passing through a moment in the which man's will is being pampered with unparalleled diligence.<a name=1:891></a> We believe, most assuredly, that the true remedy for this evil will be found wrapped up in this one weighty question, "Who is on the Lord's side" There is immense practical power in this question.<a name=1:892></a> To be really on <i>the Lord's side</i> is to be ready for anything to which He may see fit to call us, no matter what.<a name=1:893></a> If the soul is brought to say, in real truth, "<i>Lord</i>, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=1:894></a>" "Speak, <i>Lord</i>, for <i>thy servant heareth</i>," then we are ready for everything.<a name=1:895></a> Hence, in the case of the Levites, they were called to "slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<a name=1:896></a>" This was terrible work for flesh and blood.<a name=1:897></a> But the moment demanded it.<a name=1:898></a> God's claims had been openly and grossly dishonoured.<a name=1:899></a> Human invention had been at work, with the graving tool, and a calf had been set up.<a name=1:900></a> The glory of God had been changed into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass; and therefore all who were on the Lord's side were called to gird on the sword.<a name=1:901></a> Nature might say, "No; let us be tender, and gentle, and gracious.<a name=1:902></a> We shall accomplish more by kindness than by severity.<a name=1:903></a> It can do no good to wound people.<a name=1:904></a> There is far more power in love than in harshness.<a name=1:905></a> Let us love one another.<a name=1:906></a>" Thus might nature throw out its suggestions -- thus it might reason and argue.<a name=1:907></a> But the command was distinct and decisive: "Put every man his sword by his side.<a name=1:908></a>" The sword was the only thing when the golden calf was there.<a name=1:909></a> To talk of love at such a moment, would be to fling over-board the just claims of the God of Israel.<a name=1:910></a> It belongs to the true spirit of obedience to render the very service which suits the occasion.<a name=1:911></a> A servant has no business to reason, he is simply to do as he is bid.<a name=1:912></a> To raise a question, or put forth a demur, is to abandon our place as a servant.<a name=1:913></a> It might seem most dreadful work to have to slay a brother, a companion, or a neighbour; but the word of the Lord was imperative.<a name=1:914></a> It left no room for evasion; and the Levites, through grace, yielded a full and ready obedience.<a name=1:915></a> "The children of Levi did according to the word of Moses.<a name=1:916></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the only true path for those who will be God's workers, and Christ's servants in this world where self-will is dominant.<a name=1:917></a> It is immensely important to have the truth of the Lordship of Christ deeply engraved upon the heart.<a name=1:918></a> It is the only regulator of the course and conduct.<a name=1:919></a> It settles a thousand questions.<a name=1:920></a> If the heart be really subject to the authority of Christ, it is in readiness for anything and everything to which He calls us, be it to stand still or to go forward, to do little or much, to be active or passive.<a name=1:921></a> To a really obedient heart, the question is not at all," What am I doing?<a name=1:922></a> or where am I going?<a name=1:923></a>" It is simply, "am I doing the will of my Lord?<a name=1:924></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such was the ground occupied by Levi.<a name=1:925></a> And mark: the divine comment on this, as given in Malachi.<a name=1:926></a> "And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.<a name=1:927></a> My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.<a name=1:928></a> The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.<a name=1:929></a>" (Malachi 2: 4-6.<a name=1:930></a>) Mark also the blessing pronounced by the lips of Moses, "And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children; for they have observed thy word and kept thy covenant.<a name=1:931></a> They shall teach Jacob thy judgements, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.<a name=1:932></a> Bless, Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again" (Deuteronomy 33: 8-11).<a name=1:933></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It might have appeared unwarrantably harsh and severe in Levi not to have seen his parents or known or acknowledged his brethren.<a name=1:934></a> But God's claims are paramount; and our Lord Christ hath declared these solemn words, "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.<a name=1:935></a>" Luke 14: 26.<a name=1:936></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are plain words; and they let us into the secret of what it is which lies at the bottom of all true service.<a name=1:937></a> Let no one imagine that we are to be without natural affection.<a name=1:938></a> Far be the thought.<a name=1:939></a> To be so would be to connect us, morally, with the apostasy of the last days.<a name=1:940></a> (See 2 Timothy 3: 3) But when the claims of natural affection are allowed to stand in the way of our whole-hearted service to Christ, and when the so-called love of our brethren receives a higher place than faithfulness to Christ, then are we unfit for His service and unworthy of the name of His servants.<a name=1:941></a> Let it be carefully noted that what formed the moral ground of Levi's title to be employed in the Lord's service was the fact that he did not see his parents, acknowledge his brethren, or know his children.<a name=1:942></a> In a word, he was enabled to set the claims of nature completely aside, and to give the claims of Jehovah the paramount place in his heart.<a name=1:943></a> This, we repeat, is the only true basis of the servant's character.<a name=1:944></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a most weighty consideration, and one which demands the most serious attention of the Christian reader.<a name=1:945></a> There may be a vast amount of what looks like service -- a great deal of activity, of coming and going, of doing and saying -- and, all the while, there may not be a single atom of true Levite service, yea, it may, in God's estimation, be only the restless activity of the will.<a name=1:946></a> "What," it may be said, "can the will show itself in the service of God -- in matters of religion?<a name=1:947></a>" Alas, alas, it can and does.<a name=1:948></a> And very often the apparent energy and fruitfulness in work and service is just in proportion to the energy of the will.<a name=1:949></a> This is peculiarly solemn.<a name=1:950></a> It calls for the most rigid self-judgment, in the light of the divine presence.<a name=1:951></a> True service doth not consist in great activity, but in profound subjection to the will of our Lord, and where this exists there will be the readiness to sink the claims of parents, brethren, and children, in order to carry out the will of Him whom we own as Lord.<a name=1:952></a> True, we should love our parents, our brethren, and our children.<a name=1:953></a> It is not that we should love these less, but we should love Christ more.<a name=1:954></a> He and His claims must ever have the paramount place in the heart, if we would be true workers for God, true servants of Christ, true Levites in the wilderness.<a name=1:955></a> It was this that marked the actings of Levi, on the occasion to which we are referring.<a name=1:956></a> God's claims were in question, and hence the claims of nature were not to be entertained for a moment.<a name=1:957></a> Parents, brethren, and children, how dear soever these might be, were not to stand in the way when the glory of the God of Israel had been changed into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.<a name=1:958></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here lies the whole question, in all its weight and magnitude.<a name=1:959></a> The ties of natural relationship, with all the claims, duties, and responsibilities arising out of such ties, Will ever get their proper place, their due respect, from those whose hearts, and minds, and consciences have been brought under the adjusting power of the truth of God.<a name=1:960></a> Nought save what is really due to God and His Christ should ever be suffered to infringe those rights which are founded upon natural relationship.<a name=1:961></a> This is a most necessary and wholesome consideration, and one which we would particularly press upon the young Christian reader.<a name=1:962></a> We have ever to be on our guard against a spirit of self-will and self-pleasing which is never so dangerous as when it clothes itself in the garb of religious service, and work so called.<a name=1:963></a> It behoves us to be very sure indeed that we are directly and simply governed by the claims of God when we disregard the claims of natural relationship.<a name=1:964></a> In Levi's case, the matter was as clear as a sunbeam, and hence the "<i>sword</i>" of judgement, not the kiss of affection, befitted the critical moment.<a name=1:965></a> So, also, in our history, there are moments in which it would be open disloyalty to our Lord Christ to hearken, for one instant, to the voice of natural relationship.<a name=1:966></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The above remarks may help the reader to understand the actings of the Levites to Exodus 32, and the words of our Lord in Luke 14: 26.<a name=1:967></a> May God's Spirit enable us to realise and exhibit the adjusting power of truth!<a name=1:968></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now dwell, for a few moments, on the consecration of the Levites, in Numbers 8, in order that we may have the whole subject before our minds.<a name=1:969></a> Truly it is a theme full of instruction for all who desire to be workers for God.<a name=1:970></a>

		After the ceremonial acts of "washing" and "shaving" already referred to, we read, "Then let them (i.<a name=1:971></a>e.<a name=1:972></a>, the Levites) take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.<a name=1:973></a> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly or the children of Israel together.<a name=1:974></a> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites.<a name=1:975></a> And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the Lord.<a name=1:976></a> And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks; and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the Lord, to make an atonement for the Levites.<a name=1:977></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have presented to us, in type, the two grand aspects of the death of Christ.<a name=1:978></a> The sin offering furnishes the one; the burnt offering furnishes the other.<a name=1:979></a> Into the details of those offerings we do not enter here, having sought to do so in the opening chapters of our "Notes on Leviticus.<a name=1:980></a>" We would merely observe here, that, in the sin offering, we see Christ bearing sin in His own body on the tree, and enduring the wrath of God against sin.<a name=1:981></a> In the burnt offering, we see Christ glorifying God even in the very matter of making atonement for sin.<a name=1:982></a> Atonement is made in both; but in the former, it is atonement according to the depth of the sinner's need; in the latter, it is atonement according to the measure of Christ's devotedness to God.<a name=1:983></a> In that, we see the hatefulness of sin; in this, the preciousness of Christ.<a name=1:984></a> It is, we need hardly say, the same atoning death of Christ, but presented in two distinct aspects.<a name=1:985></a><a href="#1:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a>

		Now, the Levites laid their hands on both the sin offering and the burnt offering; and this act of the imposition of hands expressed the simple fact of identification.<a name=1:986></a> But how different the result in each case When Levi laid his hands on the head of the sin offering, it involved the transfer of all his sins, of all his guilt, of all his fierceness, cruelty, and self-will to the victim.<a name=1:987></a> And on the other hand, when he laid his hands on the head of the burnt offering, it involved the transfer of all the acceptableness of the sacrifice, of all its perfectness, to Levi.<a name=1:988></a> Of course, we speak of what the type set forth.<a name=1:989></a> We do not undertake to state anything as to Levi's intelligent entrance into these things; we merely seek to unfold the meaning of the ceremonial figure; and, most assuredly, no figure could be more expressive than the imposition of hands, whether we view it in the case of the sin offering, or in the case of the burnt offering.<a name=1:990></a> The doctrine of all this is embodied in that most weighty passage at the close of 2 Corinthians 5, "He hath made him [Christ] to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.<a name=1:991></a>" "And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the Lord.<a name=1:992></a> Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine, and after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.<a name=1:993></a> For they are wholly given unto ME from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.<a name=1:994></a> For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them For myself.<a name=1:995></a> And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.<a name=1:996></a> And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.<a name=1:997></a> And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.<a name=1:998></a>" Numbers 8: 13-20.<a name=1:999></a>

		How forcibly are we reminded, by the foregoing lines, of the words of our Lord in John 17, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word .<a name=1:1000></a>.<a name=1:1001></a>.<a name=1:1002></a> .<a name=1:1003></a> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.<a name=1:1004></a> And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.<a name=1:1005></a>" Verses 6-10.<a name=1:1006></a>

		The Levites were a separated people -- God's special possession.<a name=1:1007></a> They took the place of all the firstborn in Israel -- of those who were saved from the sword of the destroyer by the blood of the lamb.<a name=1:1008></a> They were, typically, a dead and risen people, set apart to God, and by Him presented as a gift to Aaron the high priest, to do the service of the tabernacle.<a name=1:1009></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all this the Levites were a striking type of God's people now.<a name=1:1014></a> These latter have been lifted from the depths of their degradation and ruin as sinners.<a name=1:1015></a> They are washed in the precious blood of Christ, purified by the application of the word, and called to the exercise of habitual and rigid self-judgment, Thus are they fitted for that holy service to the which they are called.<a name=1:1016></a> God has given them to His Son in order that they may be His workers in this world.<a name=1:1017></a> "Thine they were and thou gavest them me.<a name=1:1018></a>" Wondrous thought!<a name=1:1019></a> To think that such as we could be thus spoken of!<a name=1:1020></a> To think of our being God's property and God's gift to His Son!<a name=1:1021></a> Well may we say it surpasses all human thought.<a name=1:1022></a> It is not merely that we are saved from hell; that is true.<a name=1:1023></a> It is not, merely that we are pardoned, justified, and accepted; all this is true; but we are called to the high and holy work of bearing through this world the Name, the testimony, the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:1024></a> This is our work as true Levites.<a name=1:1025></a> As men of war, we are called to fight; as priests, we are privileged to worship; but as Levites, we are responsible to serve, and our service is to carry through this dreary desert scene the antitype of the tabernacle, and that tabernacle was the figure of Christ.<a name=1:1026></a> This is our distinct line of service.<a name=1:1027></a> To this we are called -- to this we are set apart.<a name=1:1028></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will, we doubt not, notice, with interest, the fact that it is in this book of Numbers, and here alone, that we are furnished with all the precious and deeply instructive details respecting the Levites.<a name=1:1029></a> In this we have a fresh illustration of the character of our book.<a name=1:1030></a> It is from a wilderness standpoint that we get a full and proper view of God's workers as well as of God's warriors.<a name=1:1031></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, now, let us examine for a few moments, the service of the Levites, as detailed in Numbers 3 and 4.<a name=1:1032></a> "and the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.<a name=1:1033></a> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.<a name=1:1034></a> And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.<a name=1:1035></a> And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.<a name=1:1036></a>" Numbers 3: 5-9.<a name=1:1037></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Levites represented the whole congregation of Israel, and acted on their behalf.<a name=1:1038></a> This appears from the fact that the children of Israel laid their hands on the heads of the Levites, just as the Levites laid their hands on the heads of the sacrifices.<a name=1:1039></a> (See Numbers 8: 10) The act of imposition expressed identification, so that, according to this, the Levites furnish a distinct view of' the people of God in the wilderness.<a name=1:1040></a> They present them to us as a company of earnest workers, and that too, be it noted, not as mere desultory labourers, running to and fro, and doing each one what seemed right in his own eyes.<a name=1:1041></a> Nothing of the sort.<a name=1:1042></a> If the men of war had their pedigree to show and their standard to adhere to, so had the Levites their centre to gather round and their work to do.<a name=1:1043></a> All was as clear, distinct, and defined as God could make it; and, moreover, all was under the immediate authority and direction of the high priest.<a name=1:1044></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most needful for all who would be true Levites, proper workmen, intelligent servants, to weigh, with all seriousness, this point.<a name=1:1045></a> Levite service was to be regulated by the appointment of the priest.<a name=1:1046></a> There was no more room for the exercise of self-will in the service of the Levites, that there was the position of the men of war.<a name=1:1047></a> All was divinely settled; and this was a signal mercy to all whose hearts were in a right condition.<a name=1:1048></a> To one whose will was unbroken it might seem a hardship and a most irksome task to be obliged to occupy the same position, or to be engaged in precisely the same line of work.<a name=1:1049></a> Such an one might sigh for something fresh -- some variety in his work.<a name=1:1050></a> But, on the contrary, where the will was subdued, and the heart adjusted, each one would say, "my path is perfectly plain; I have only to obey.<a name=1:1051></a>" This is ever the business of the true servant.<a name=1:1052></a> It was pre-eminently so with Him Who was the only perfect servant that ever trod the earth.<a name=1:1053></a> He could say, "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me.<a name=1:1054></a>" And again, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<a name=1:1055></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another fact which claims our attention, in reference to the Levites; and that is, their service had exclusively to do with the tabernacle and its belongings.<a name=1:1056></a> They had nothing else to do.<a name=1:1057></a> For a Levite to think of putting his hand to anything beside would have been to deny his calling, to abandon his divinely appointed work, and to fly in the face of God's commandments.<a name=1:1058></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just so is it with Christians now.<a name=1:1059></a> Their exclusive business -- their one grand work -- their absorbing service, is Christ and His belongings.<a name=1:1060></a> They have nothing else to do.<a name=1:1061></a> For a Christian to think of putting his hand to anything beside is to deny his calling, to abandon his divinely-appointed work, and fly in the face of the divine commandments.<a name=1:1062></a> A true Levite of old could say, "To me to live is the tabernacle;" and a true Christian, now, can say, "To me to live is Christ.<a name=1:1063></a>" The grand question, in every matter which may present itself before the Christian, is this, "Can I connect Christ with it?<a name=1:1064></a>" If not, I have nothing whatsoever to do with it.<a name=1:1065></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the true way to look at things.<a name=1:1066></a> It is not a question as to the right or wrong of this or that.<a name=1:1067></a> No; it is simply a question as to how far it concerns the name and glory of Christ.<a name=1:1068></a> This simplifies everything amazingly.<a name=1:1069></a> It answers a thousand questions, solves a thousand difficulties, and makes the path of the true and earnest Christian as clear as a sunbeam.<a name=1:1070></a> A Levite had no difficulty as to his work.<a name=1:1071></a> It was all settled for him with divine precision.<a name=1:1072></a> The burden that each had to carry, and the work that each had to do, was laid down with a clearness which left no room for the questionings of the heart.<a name=1:1073></a> Each man could know his own work and do it; and let us add the work was done by each one discharging his own specific functions.<a name=1:1074></a> It was not by running hither and thither, and doing this or that; but by each man sedulously adhering to his own particular calling, that the service of the tabernacle was duly discharged.<a name=1:1075></a>

		"And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.<a name=1:1099></a> and Moses numbered them <i>according to the word of the Lord, as He was commanded</i>.<a name=1:1100></a> And these were the sons of Levi by their names, Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.<a name=1:1101></a> And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.<a name=1:1102></a> And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.<a name=1:1103></a> And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.<a name=1:1104></a> These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.<a name=1:1105></a> Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.<a name=1:1106></a> Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.<a name=1:1107></a> The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward.<a name=1:1108></a> And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.<a name=1:1109></a> And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.<a name=1:1110></a>" (Numbers 3: 14-26.<a name=1:1111></a>) and again, we read, "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families; from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:1112></a> This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens: and they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve.<a name=1:1113></a> At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.<a name=1:1114></a> This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.<a name=1:1115></a>" Numbers 4: 21-28.<a name=1:1116></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to Gershon and his work.<a name=1:1117></a> He, with his brother Merari, had to carry "the tabernacle whereas Kohath was called to bear "the sanctuary," as we read in Numbers 10 "And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon, and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing <i>the tabernacle</i> .<a name=1:1118></a>.<a name=1:1119></a>.<a name=1:1120></a> .<a name=1:1121></a>.<a name=1:1122></a> And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the <i>sanctuary</i>: and the other (i.<a name=1:1123></a>e.<a name=1:1124></a>, the Gershonites and the Merarites) did set up the tabernacle against they came.<a name=1:1125></a>" (verse 17, 21.<a name=1:1126></a>) There was a strong moral link connecting Gershon and Merari in their service, although their work was perfectly distinct, as we shall see from the following passage.<a name=1:1127></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers; from thirty years old and upward, even unto fifty years old, shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:1128></a> And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof, and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden.<a name=1:1129></a> This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service to the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.<a name=1:1130></a>" Numbers 4: 29-33.<a name=1:1131></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this was clear and distinct.<a name=1:1132></a> Gershon had nothing to do with the boards and pins; and Merari had nothing to do with the curtains or the coverings.<a name=1:1133></a> And yet they were very intimately connected, as they were mutually dependent.<a name=1:1134></a> "The boards and sockets" would not do without "the curtains;" and the curtains would not do without the boards and sockets.<a name=1:1135></a> And as to "the <i>pins</i>," though apparently so insignificant, who could estimate their importance in keeping things together, and maintaining the visible unity of the whole?<a name=1:1136></a> Thus all worked together to one common end, and that end was gained by each attending to his own special line.<a name=1:1137></a> If a Gershonite had taken it into his head to abandon "the curtains" and address himself to "the pins," he would have left his own work undone and interfered with the work; of the Merarite.<a name=1:1138></a> This would never do.<a name=1:1139></a> It would have thrown everything into hopeless confusion;.<a name=1:1140></a> whereas by adhering to the divine rule, all was maintained in the most exquisite order.<a name=1:1141></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must have been perfectly beautiful to mark God's workers in the wilderness.<a name=1:1142></a> Each one was at his post, and each moved in his divinely appointed sphere.<a name=1:1143></a> Hence, the moment the cloud was lifted up, and the order issued to strike, every man knew what he had to do, and he addressed himself to that and to nothing else .<a name=1:1144></a> No man had any right to think for himself.<a name=1:1145></a> Jehovah thought for all.<a name=1:1146></a> The Levites had declared themselves "on the Lord's side;" they had yielded themselves to His authority; and this fact lay at the very base of all their wilderness work and service.<a name=1:1147></a> looked at in this light it would be deemed a matter of total indifference whether a man had to carry a pin, a curtain, or a golden candlestick.<a name=1:1148></a> The grand question for each and for all was simply, "Is this my work?<a name=1:1149></a> Is his what the Lord has given we to do?<a name=1:1150></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This settled everything.<a name=1:1151></a> Had it been left to human thinking or human choosing, one man might like this; another might like that; and a third might like something else.<a name=1:1152></a> How then could the tabernacle ever be borne along through the wilderness, or set up in its place?<a name=1:1153></a> Impossible!<a name=1:1154></a> There could be but one supreme authority, namely Jehovah Himself.<a name=1:1155></a> He arranged for all, and all had to submit to Him.<a name=1:1156></a> There was no room at all for the exercise of the human will.<a name=1:1157></a> This was a signal mercy.<a name=1:1158></a> It prevented a world of strife and confusion.<a name=1:1159></a> There must be subjection -- there must be a broken will -- there must be a cordial yielding to divine authority, otherwise it will turn out to be like the book of Judges, "Every man doing that which is right in his own eyes.<a name=1:1160></a>" A Merarite might say, or think if he did not say it, "what!<a name=1:1161></a> am I to spend the very best portion of my life upon earth -- the days of my prime and vigour -- in looking after a few pins?<a name=1:1162></a> Was this the end for which I was born?<a name=1:1163></a> Am I to have nothing higher before me as an object in life?<a name=1:1164></a> Is this to be my occupation from the age of thirty to fifty?<a name=1:1165></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To such questions there was a twofold reply.<a name=1:1166></a> In the first place, it was enough for the Merarite to know that Jehovah had assigned him his work.<a name=1:1167></a> This was sufficient to impart dignity to what nature might esteem the smallest and meanest matter.<a name=1:1168></a> It does not matter what we are doing, provided always we are doing our divinely appointed work.<a name=1:1169></a> a man may pursue what his fellows would deem a most brilliant career he may spend his energies, his time, his talents, his fortune, in pursuits which the men of this world esteem grand and glorious, and, all the while, his life may prove to be but a splendid bubble.<a name=1:1170></a> But, on the other hand, the man that simply does the will of God.<a name=1:1171></a> whatever that may be -- the man who executes his Lord's commands, whatever such commands may enjoin -- that is the man whose path is illuminated by the beams of divine approbation, and whose work shall be remembered!<a name=1:1172></a> when the most splendid schemes of the children of this world have sunk in eternal oblivion.<a name=1:1173></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, besides the moral worth attaching always to the act of doing what we are told to do, there was also a special dignity belonging to the work of a Merarite, even though that work was merely attending to a few "pins" or "sockets.<a name=1:1174></a>" Everything connected with the tabernacle was of the very deepest interest and highest value.<a name=1:1175></a> There was not, in the whole world, anything to be compared with that boarded tent with all its mystic belongings.<a name=1:1176></a> It was a holy dignity and privilege to be allowed to touch the smallest pin that formed a part of that wonderful tabernacle in the wilderness.<a name=1:1177></a> It was more glorious, by far, to be a Merarite looking after the pins of the tabernacle, than to wield the sceptre of Egypt or Assyria.<a name=1:1178></a> True, that Merarite, according to the import of his name, might seem a poor sorrowful, labouring man; but oh!<a name=1:1179></a> his labour stood connected with the dwelling-place of the Most High God, the possessor of heaven and earth.<a name=1:1180></a> His hands handled the things which were the patterns of things in the heavens.<a name=1:1181></a> Every pin, every socket; every curtain, and every covering was a shadow of good things to come -- a foreshadowing of Christ.<a name=1:1182></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not mean to assert that the poor labouring Merarite or Gershonite understood these things.<a name=1:1183></a> This is not, by any means, the point.<a name=1:1184></a> We can understand them.<a name=1:1185></a> It is our privilege to bring all these things-the tabernacle and its mystic furniture -- under the brilliant light of the New Testament, and there read Christ in all.<a name=1:1186></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While, therefore, we predicate nothing as to the measure of intelligence possessed by the Levites, in their respective work; we at the same time, may say, with confidence, that it was a very precious privilege to be allowed to touch and handle, and bear through the wilderness, the earthly shadows of heavenly realities.<a name=1:1187></a> Moreover, it was a special mercy to have the authority of a "Thus saith the Lord" for everything they put their hand to.<a name=1:1188></a> Who can estimate such a mercy -- such a privilege?<a name=1:1189></a> Each member of that marvellous tribe of workers had his own particular line of things marked out by God's hand, and superintended by God's priest.<a name=1:1190></a> It was not each doing what he liked himself, nor one man running in the wake of another, but all bowing to the authority of God, and doing precisely what they were told to do.<a name=1:1191></a> This was the secret of order throughout the eight thousand five hundred and eighty workers.<a name=1:1192></a> (Numbers 4: 48) and, we may say, with all possible confidence, it is the only true secret of order still.<a name=1:1193></a> Why is it that we have so much confusion in the professing church?<a name=1:1194></a> Why such conflicting thoughts, feelings, and opinions?<a name=1:1195></a> why such clashing one with another?<a name=1:1196></a> Why such crossing of each other's path?<a name=1:1197></a> Simply from the lack of entire and absolute submission to the word of God.<a name=1:1198></a> Our <i>will</i> is at work, we choose our own ways, instead of allowing God to choose for us.<a name=1:1199></a> We want that attitude and temper of soul in the which all human thoughts, our own amongst them, shall be put down at what they are really worth; and God's thoughts shall rise into full unqualified dominion.<a name=1:1200></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, we feel persuaded, is the grand desideratum -- the crying want of the day in which our lot is cast Man's will is everywhere gaining the ascendant.<a name=1:1201></a> It is rising like a mighty tide and bearing away those ancient barriers which have, in some measure, kept it in check.<a name=1:1202></a> Many an old and time-honoured institution is, at this moment, giving way before the rushing torrent.<a name=1:1203></a> Many an edifice, whose foundations, as we supposed, were laid deep down in the fond and reverent affections of the people, is giving way beneath the battering ram of popular feeling.<a name=1:1204></a> "Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.<a name=1:1205></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is, pre-eminently, the spirit of the age.<a name=1:1206></a> What is the antidote?<a name=1:1207></a> <i>Subjection</i>!<a name=1:1208></a> Subjection to what?<a name=1:1209></a> Is it to what is called the authority of the Church?<a name=1:1210></a> Is it to the voice of tradition?<a name=1:1211></a> Is it to the commandments and doctrines of men?<a name=1:1212></a> No; blessed be God, it is not to any of these things, nor to all of them put together.<a name=1:1213></a> To what then?<a name=1:1214></a> To the voice of the living God -- the voice of holy scripture.<a name=1:1215></a> This is the grand remedy for self-will, on the one hand, and submission to human authority, on the other.<a name=1:1216></a> "we must <i>obey</i>.<a name=1:1217></a>" This is the answer to self-will.<a name=1:1218></a> "We must obey <i>God</i>.<a name=1:1219></a>" This is the answer to mere bowing down to human authority.<a name=1:1220></a> we see these two elements all around us.<a name=1:1221></a> The former, self-will, resolves itself into infidelity.<a name=1:1222></a> The latter, subjection to man, resolves itself into superstition.<a name=1:1223></a> These two will bear sway over the whole civilized world.<a name=1:1224></a> They will carry away all save those who are divinely taught to say, and feel, and act upon, that immortal sentence, "We must obey God rather than man.<a name=1:1225></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was this that enabled the Gershonite, in the wilderness, to look after those rough unattractive looking "badger skins;" and that enabled the Merarite to look after these, apparently, insignificant "pins.<a name=1:1226></a>" Yes, and it is this which will enable the Christian, now, to address himself to that special line of service to which his Lord may see fit to call him.<a name=1:1227></a> What, though, to human eyes, it seems rough and unattractive, mean and insignificant: it is enough for us that our Lord has assigned us our post, and given us our work; and that our work has direct reference to the Person and glory of Him who is the chiefest among ten thousand, and altogether lovely.<a name=1:1228></a> We, too, may have to confine ourselves to the antitype of the rough unsightly badger skin, or the insignificant pin.<a name=1:1229></a> But let us remember that whatever has reference to Christ -- His name -- His Person -- His cause, in the world, is unspeakably precious to God.<a name=1:1230></a> It may be very small, in man's account; but what of that?<a name=1:1231></a> we must look at things from God's point of view, we must measure them by His standard, and that is Christ.<a name=1:1232></a> God measures everything by Christ.<a name=1:1233></a> Whatever has even the very smallest reference to Christ is interesting and important in God's account.<a name=1:1234></a> Whereas the most splendid undertakings, the most gigantic schemes, the most astonishing enterprises of the men of this world, all pass away like the morning cloud and the early dew.<a name=1:1235></a> Man makes <i>self</i> his centre, his object, his standard.<a name=1:1236></a> He values things according to the measure in which they exalt himself, and further his interests.<a name=1:1237></a> Even religion itself, so called, is taken up in the same way, and made a pedestal on which to display himself.<a name=1:1238></a> Everything, in short, is marked up as capital for self, and used as a reflector to throw light upon, and call attention to, that one object.<a name=1:1239></a> Thus there is a mighty gulf between God's thoughts: and man's thoughts; and the shores of that gulf are as far apart as <i>Christ</i> and <i>self</i>.<a name=1:1240></a> All that belongs to Christ is of eternal interest and moment.<a name=1:1241></a> All that belongs to self shall pass away and be forgotten.<a name=1:1242></a> Hence, therefore, the most fatal mistake into which any man can fall is to make <i>self</i> his object.<a name=1:1243></a> It must issue in everlasting disappointment.<a name=1:1244></a> But, on the other hand, the very wisest, safest, best thing that any man can do, is to make Christ his one absorbing object.<a name=1:1245></a> This must, infallibly, issue in everlasting blessedness and glory.<a name=1:1246></a>

		Here we see what precious mysteries were committed to the charge of the Kohathites.<a name=1:1282></a> The ark, the golden table, the golden candlestick, the golden altar, and the altar of burnt offering -- all these were shadows of good things to come -- the patterns of things in the heavens-the figures of the true -- the types of Christ, is His Person, His work, and His offices, as we have sought to show in our "Notes on Exodus.<a name=1:1283></a>" (Exodus 24 - 30) They are here presented in the wilderness, and, if we may be allowed the expression, in their travelling dress.<a name=1:1284></a> With the exception of the ark of the covenant, all these things presented the one unvarying appearance to the human eye, namely, the rough covering of the badgers skins.<a name=1:1285></a> With the ark there was this difference, that above the badgers' skins there was "a cloth wholly Of blue," setting forth, doubtless, the entirely heavenly character of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His own divine Person.<a name=1:1286></a> That which was essentially heavenly in Him lay upon the very surface of His blessed life here below.<a name=1:1287></a> He was ever the entirely heavenly man -- "the Lord from heaven.<a name=1:1288></a>" Underneath this covering of blue were the badger' skins, which may be viewed as the expression of that which protects from all evil.<a name=1:1289></a> The ark was the only thing that was covered in this peculiar manner.<a name=1:1290></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to "the table of showbread," which was a type of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His connection with the twelve tribes of Israel, there was first "a cloth of <i>blue</i>," and then a cloth of <i>scarlet</i>;" and over all, the badgers' skins.<a name=1:1291></a> In other words, there was that which is essentially heavenly; then that which expresses human splendour; and above all, that which protects from evil.<a name=1:1292></a> It is the purpose of God that Israel's twelve tribes shall be pre-eminent in the earth -- that in them the very highest type of human splendour shall be exhibited.<a name=1:1293></a> Hence the appropriateness of the "scarlet" covering on the table of showbread.<a name=1:1294></a> The twelve loaves evidently point to the twelve tribes; and as to the scarlet colour, the reader has only to look through scripture in order to see that it sets forth that which man considers splendid.<a name=1:1295></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The coverings of the golden candlestick and of the golden altar were identical, namely, first the heavenly covering; and then the external badgers' skin.<a name=1:1296></a> In the candlestick we see our Lord Christ, in connection with the work of the Holy Ghost in light and testimony.<a name=1:1297></a> The golden altar shows us Christ and the preciousness of His intercession -- the fragrance and value of what He is before God.<a name=1:1298></a> Both these, when passing along the sand of the desert, were wrapped up in that which was heavenly, and protected above by the badgers' skins.<a name=1:1299></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, in reference to the brazen altar, we observe marked distinction.<a name=1:1300></a> It was covered with "purple" instead of "blue," or "scarlet.<a name=1:1301></a>" Why was this?<a name=1:1302></a> Doubtless because the brazen altar prefigured Christ as the one who "<i>suffered</i> for sins," and who shall therefore wield the sceptre of royalty.<a name=1:1303></a> "Purple" is the royal colour.<a name=1:1304></a> The One who suffered in this world, shall reign.<a name=1:1305></a> The One who wore the crown of thorns, shall wear the crown of glory.<a name=1:1306></a> Hence the moral fitness of the "purple'' covering on the brazen altar -- for on that altar the victim was offered.<a name=1:1307></a> We know there is nothing in scripture without its own divine meaning, and it is our privilege as well as our duty to seek to know the meaning of all that our God has graciously written for our learning.<a name=1:1308></a> This, we believe, can only be reached by humble, patient, prayerful waiting upon Him.<a name=1:1309></a> The One who has penned the Book knows perfectly the scope and object of the book as a whole, and of each division of the book in particular.<a name=1:1310></a> This will have the effect of checking the unhallowed flights of the imagination.<a name=1:1311></a> The Spirit of God alone can open scripture to our souls.<a name=1:1312></a> "God is His own interpreter" in revelation, as well as in providence, and the more we lean on Him, in true self-emptiness, the deeper insight we shall have both into His word and His ways.<a name=1:1313></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We would therefore say to the Christian reader, Take the first fifteen verses of Numbers 4 and read them in the presence of God.<a name=1:1314></a> Ask Him to explain to thee the meaning of each clause -- the meaning of the ark, and why it alone was covered with "a cloth wholly of blue.<a name=1:1315></a>" And so of all the rest.<a name=1:1316></a> We have ventured, we trust in humility of mind, to suggest the meaning, but we earnestly desire that thou shouldst get it directly from God, for thyself, and not accept it merely from man.<a name=1:1317></a> We confess we are terribly afraid of imagination; and we know not that we have ever sat down to write on sacred scripture with a deeper sense of this that none but the Holy Ghost can really explain it.<a name=1:1318></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thou wilt say, then, "Why sit down to write at all?<a name=1:1319></a>" Well, it is with the fond hope of being permitted, in some feeble manner, to help the earnest student of scripture to catch sight of the rare and exquisite gems that lie scattered along the inspired page, so that he may pick them up for Himself.<a name=1:1320></a> Thousands of readers might read, again and again, the fourth of Numbers, and not even perceive the fact that the ark was the only part of the mystic furniture of the tabernacle that did not exhibit the badger skin.<a name=1:1321></a> And if the simple fact be not laid hold of, how can its import be seen?<a name=1:1322></a> So also, as to the brazen altar, how many have failed to notice that it alone put on the "purple?<a name=1:1323></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we may rest assured that both these facts are full of spiritual meaning.<a name=1:1324></a> The ark was the very highest manifestation of God, and, therefore, we may understand why it should exhibit, at first sight, that which was purely heavenly.<a name=1:1325></a> The brazen altar was the place where sin was judged -- it typified Christ in His work as a sin bearer it set forth that most distant place to which He travelled for us; and yet that brazen altar was the only thing that was wrapped in royal covering.<a name=1:1326></a> Can anything be more exquisite than the teaching here?<a name=1:1327></a> What infinite wisdom in all these fine distinctions!<a name=1:1328></a> The ark conducts us to the very highest point in heaven.<a name=1:1329></a> The brazen altar conducts us to the lowest point on earth.<a name=1:1330></a> They stood at extreme points in the tabernacle.<a name=1:1331></a> In the former, we see the One who magnified the law; in the latter, we see the One who was made sin.<a name=1:1332></a> In the one, that which was heavenly was seen at the first sight; and it was only when you looked deeper, you saw the badger skin; and deeper still, that mysterious veil, the type of Christ's flesh.<a name=1:1333></a> But, in the other, the first thing you saw was the badger skin, and deeper down we see the royal covering.<a name=1:1334></a> Christ in each, though in a different aspect.<a name=1:1335></a> In the ark, we have Christ maintaining the glory of God, In the brazen altar, we have Christ meeting the sinner's need.<a name=1:1336></a> blessed combination for us!<a name=1:1337></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further, has the reader noticed that in the entire of this marvellous passage to which we have been calling his particular attention, there is no mention of a certain piece of furniture which we know, from Exodus 30 and other scriptures, occupied a, very important place in the tabernacle?<a name=1:1338></a> We allude to the brazen laver.<a name=1:1339></a> Why is this omitted in Numbers 4?<a name=1:1340></a> It is more than probable that some of our keen-eyed rationalists would find here what they would pronounce an error -- a defect -- a discrepancy.<a name=1:1341></a> But is it so?<a name=1:1342></a> No, thank God!<a name=1:1343></a> The devout Christian student knows full well that such things are wholly incompatible with the volume of God.<a name=1:1344></a> He knows and confesses this, even though he may not be able to account for the absence of this or the presence of that particular thing in any given passage.<a name=1:1345></a> But just in so far as we are enabled, through the mercy of God, to see the spiritual reason of things, do we always find that where the rationalist, sees, or affects to see flaws, the pious student sees brilliant gems.<a name=1:1346></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is, we doubt not, in reference to the omission of the brazen laver from the catalogue in Numbers 4.<a name=1:1347></a> It is only one of the ten thousand illustrations of the beauty and perfectness of the inspired volume.<a name=1:1348></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, the reader may enquire, "Why is the laver omitted?<a name=1:1349></a>" The reason may be found is the double fact of what that laver was made from, and what it was made for.<a name=1:1350></a> This double fact we have noticed in Exodus.<a name=1:1351></a> The laver was made of the looking-glasses of the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:1352></a> (Exodus 38: 8) This was its material.<a name=1:1353></a> And, as to its object, it was provided as a means of purification for man.<a name=1:1354></a> Now, in all those things which formed the special burden and charge of the Kohathites, we see only the varied manifestations of God in Christ, from the ark in the holiest of all, to the brazen altar in the court of the tabernacle; and, inasmuch as the laver was not a manifestation of God, But a purification for man, it is therefore not found in the custody and charge of the Kohathites.<a name=1:1355></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must now leave the reader to meditate alone on this most profound section of our book, (Numbers 3 - 4) It is really inexhaustible.<a name=1:1356></a> We might go on expatiating upon it until we had filled volumes instead of pages, and, after all, we should feel as though we had barely penetrated the surface of a mine whose depth never can be sounded -- whose treasures never can be exhausted.<a name=1:1357></a> What human pen can bring out the marvellous instruction contained in the inspired account of the tribe of Levi?<a name=1:1358></a> who can attempt to unfold that sovereign grace which shines in the fact that the self-willed Levi should be the very first to respond to that soul-stirring call," Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=1:1359></a>" Who can speak aright of that rich, abounding, distinguishing mercy illustrated in the fact that those whose hands had been embued in blood should be permitted to handle the vessels of the sanctuary; and that those into whose assembly God's Spirit could not enter should be brought into the very bosom of the congregation of God, there to be occupied with that which was so precious to Him?<a name=1:1360></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then those three divisions of workers, Merarites, Gershonites, and Kohathites!<a name=1:1361></a> What instruction is here!<a name=1:1362></a> what a type of the various members of the Church of God, in their various service!<a name=1:1363></a> What depth of mysterious wisdom in all this?<a name=1:1364></a> Is it speaking too strongly -- is it too much to say that nothing, at this moment, so deeply impresses us as the sense of the utter feebleness and poverty of all that we have advanced on one of the very richest sections of the inspired volume!<a name=1:1365></a> Still we have conducted the reader to a mine of infinite depth and richness, and we must leave him to penetrate thereinto by the gracious aid of Him to whom the mine belongs and who alone is able to evolve its wealth.<a name=1:1366></a> All that man can write or say on any portion of God's word can, at best, be but suggestive; to speak of it as exhaustive would be to cast a slight upon the sacred cannon.<a name=1:1367></a> may we tread the holy place with unshod feet, and be as those who inquire in the temple, and whose studies are perfumed by the spirit of worship.<a name=1:1368></a><a href="#1:f4"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a>

		NUMBERS 5.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		''And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, <i>in the midst whereof I dwell</i>.<a name=1:1369></a> And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.<a name=1:1370></a>" Numbers 5: 1-4.<a name=1:1371></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have unfolded to us, in few words, the great foundation principle on which the discipline of the assembly is founded -- a principle, we may say, of the very last importance, though, alas!<a name=1:1372></a> so little understood or attended to.<a name=1:1373></a> It was the presence of God in the midst of His people Israel that demanded holiness on their part.<a name=1:1374></a> "That they defile not their camps in the midst of which I dwell.<a name=1:1375></a>" The place where the Holy one dwells must be holy.<a name=1:1376></a> This is a plain and a necessary truth.<a name=1:1377></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already remarked that <i>redemption</i> was the <i>basis</i> of God's dwelling in the midst of His people.<a name=1:1378></a> But we must remember that <i>discipline</i> was essential to His continuance amongst them.<a name=1:1379></a> He could not dwell where evil was deliberately and avowedly sanctioned.<a name=1:1380></a> Blessed be His name, He can and does bear with weakness; but He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity.<a name=1:1381></a> Evil cannot dwell with Him, nor can He have fellowship with it.<a name=1:1382></a> It would involve a denial of His very nature; and He cannot deny Himself.<a name=1:1383></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may, however, be said, in reply, "Does not God the Holy Ghost dwell in the individual believer, and yet there is much evil in him?<a name=1:1384></a>" True, the Holy Ghost dwells in the believer, on the ground of accomplished redemption.<a name=1:1385></a> He is there, not as the sanction of what is of nature, But as the seal of what is of Christ: and His presence and fellowship are enjoyed just in proportion as the evil in us is habitually judged.<a name=1:1386></a> Will any one assert that we can realise and delight in the Spirit's indwelling while allowing our indwelling pravity, and indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind?<a name=1:1387></a> Far away be the impious thought!<a name=1:1388></a> No; we must judge ourselves, and put away everything inconsistent with the holiness of the One who dwells in us.<a name=1:1389></a> Our "old man" is not recognised at all.<a name=1:1390></a> It has no existence before God.<a name=1:1391></a> It has been condemned, utterly, in the cross of Christ.<a name=1:1392></a> we feel its workings, alas!<a name=1:1393></a> and have to mourn over them, and judge ourselves on account of them; but God sees us in Christ -- in the Spirit -- in the new creation.<a name=1:1394></a> And, moreover, the Holy Ghost dwells in the body of the believer, on the ground of the blood of Christ; and His indwelling demands the judgement of evil in every shape and form.<a name=1:1395></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also, in reference to the assembly.<a name=1:1396></a> No doubt, there is evil there -- evil in each individual member, and therefore evil in the body corporate.<a name=1:1397></a> But it must be judged; and, if judged, it is not allowed to act, it is rendered null.<a name=1:1398></a> But to say that an assembly is not to judge evil is nothing more or less than corporate antinomianism.<a name=1:1399></a> What should we say to a professing Christian who maintained that He was not solemnly responsible to judge evil, in himself and in His ways?<a name=1:1400></a> we should, with great decision, pronounce him an antinomian.<a name=1:1401></a> And if it be wrong for a single individual to take such ground, must it not be proportionally wrong for an assembly?<a name=1:1402></a> We cannot see how this can be called in question.<a name=1:1403></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What would have been the result, had Israel refused to obey the peremptory "command" given at the opening of the chapter before us?<a name=1:1404></a> Supposing they had said, "We are not responsible to judge evil; and we do not feel that it becomes poor, failing, erring mortals such as we to judge anybody.<a name=1:1405></a> These people with the leprosy, and the issue, and so forth, are as much Israelites as we are, and have as good a right to all the blessings and privileges of the camp as we have; we do not therefore feel it would be right for us to put them out.<a name=1:1406></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what, we ask, would have been God's rejoinder to such a reply?<a name=1:1407></a> If the reader will just turn for an instant to Joshua 7 he will find as solemn an answer as could well be given.<a name=1:1408></a> Let him draw near and carefully inspect that "great heap of stones" in the valley of Achor.<a name=1:1409></a> Let him read the inscription thereon.<a name=1:1410></a> What is it?<a name=1:1411></a> "God in greatly to be feared in the assembly of his: saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are round about him.<a name=1:1412></a>" "<i>Our</i> God is a consuming fire.<a name=1:1413></a>" What is the meaning of all this?<a name=1:1414></a> Let us hear it and consider it!<a name=1:1415></a> Lust had conceived in the heart of one member of the congregation, and brought forth sin.<a name=1:1416></a> What then?<a name=1:1417></a> Did this involve the whole congregation?<a name=1:1418></a> Yes, verily, this is the solemn truth, "<i>Israel</i> (not merely Achan) hath sinned, and <i>they</i> have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for <i>they</i> have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.<a name=1:1419></a> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: <i>neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed thing from among you</i>.<a name=1:1420></a>" Joshua 7: 11, 12.<a name=1:1421></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is peculiarly solemn and searching.<a name=1:1422></a> It, most assuredly, utters a loud voice in our ears, and conveys a holy lesson to our hearts.<a name=1:1423></a> There were, so far as the narrative informs us, many hundreds of thousands throughout the camp of Israel as ignorant, as Joshua himself seems to have been, of the fact of Achan's sin and yet the word was, "<i>Israel</i> hath sinned -- transgressed -- taken the accursed thing -- stolen and dissembled.<a name=1:1424></a>" How was this?<a name=1:1425></a> The assembly was one.<a name=1:1426></a> God's presence in the midst of the congregation constituted it one, so one, that the sin of each was the sin of all.<a name=1:1427></a> "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.<a name=1:1428></a>" Human reason may demur to this, as it is sure to demur to everything that lies beyond its narrow range.<a name=1:1429></a> But God says it, and this is enough for the believing mind.<a name=1:1430></a> It doth not become us to ask," Why?<a name=1:1431></a> how?<a name=1:1432></a> or wherefore?<a name=1:1433></a>" The testimony of God settles everything, and we have only to believe and obey.<a name=1:1434></a> It is enough for us to know that the fact of God's presence demands holiness, purity, and the judgement of evil.<a name=1:1435></a> Let us remember this.<a name=1:1436></a> It is not upon the principle so justly repudiated by every lowly mind, "Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou.<a name=1:1437></a>" No, no; it is entirely on the ground of what God is.<a name=1:1438></a> "Be ye holy, for I am holy.<a name=1:1439></a>" God could not give the sanction of His holy presence to unjudged wickedness.<a name=1:1440></a> What!<a name=1:1441></a> Give a victory at Ai with an Achan in the camp?<a name=1:1442></a> Impossible!<a name=1:1443></a> a victory, under such circumstances, would have been a dishonour to God, and the very worst thing that could have happened to Israel.<a name=1:1444></a> It could not be.<a name=1:1445></a> Israel must be chastised.<a name=1:1446></a> They must be humbled and broken.<a name=1:1447></a> They must be brought down to the valley of Achor -- the place of trouble, for there alone can "a door of hope" be opened when evil has come in.<a name=1:1448></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let not the reader misunderstand this great practical principle.<a name=1:1449></a> It has, we fear, been greatly misunderstood by many of God's people.<a name=1:1450></a> Many there are who seem to think that it can never be right for those who are saved by grace, and who are themselves signal monuments of mercy, to exercise discipline in any form, or on any ground whatsoever.<a name=1:1451></a> To such persons, Matthew 7: 1 seems to condemn utterly the thought of our undertaking to judge.<a name=1:1452></a> Are we not, say they, expressly told by our Lord, not to judge?<a name=1:1453></a> are not these His own veritable words, "Judge not, that ye be not judged?<a name=1:1454></a>" No doubt.<a name=1:1455></a> But what do these words mean?<a name=1:1456></a> Do they mean that we are not to judge the doctrine and manner of life of such as present themselves for Christian fellowship?<a name=1:1457></a> Do they lend any support to the idea that, no matter what a man holds, or what he teaches, or what he does, we are to receive him all the same?<a name=1:1458></a> Can this be the force and meaning of our Lord's words?<a name=1:1459></a> Who could, for one moment, cede anything so monstrous as this?<a name=1:1460></a> Does not our Lord, in this very same chapter, tell us to "beware of false prophets?<a name=1:1461></a>" But how can we beware of any one, if we are not to judge?<a name=1:1462></a> If judgement is not to be exercised in any case, why tell us to beware?<a name=1:1463></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christian reader, the truth is as simple as possible.<a name=1:1464></a> God's assembly is responsible to judge the doctrine and morals of all who claim entrance at the door.<a name=1:1465></a> We are not to judge motives, but we are to judge ways.<a name=1:1466></a> We are directly taught by the inspired apostle, in 1 Corinthians 5, that we are bound to judge all who take the ground of being inside the assembly.<a name=1:1467></a> "For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?<a name=1:1468></a> Do not ye judge them that within?<a name=1:1469></a> But them that are without God judgeth.<a name=1:1470></a> <i>Therefore</i> put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<a name=1:1471></a>" Verses 12, 13.<a name=1:1472></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is most distinct.<a name=1:1473></a> We are not to judge those "without" but we are to judge those "within.<a name=1:1474></a>" That is, those who take the ground of being Christians -- of being members of God's assembly -- all such come within the range of judgement.<a name=1:1475></a> The very moment a man enters the assembly, he takes His place in that sphere where discipline is exercised upon everything contrary to the holiness of the One who dwells there.<a name=1:1476></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And let not the reader suppose, for a moment, that the unity of the <i>body</i> is touched when the discipline of the <i>house</i> is maintained.<a name=1:1477></a> This would be a very serious mistake indeed; and yet alas!<a name=1:1478></a> it is a very common one.<a name=1:1479></a> We frequently hear it said of those who rightly seek to maintain the discipline of the house of God, that they are rending the body of Christ.<a name=1:1480></a> There could hardly be a greater mistake.<a name=1:1481></a> The fact is, the former is our bounden duty; the latter, an utter impossibility?<a name=1:1482></a> The discipline of God's house must be carried out; but the unity of Christ's body can never be dissolved.<a name=1:1483></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, we sometimes hear persons speak of cutting off the limbs of the body of Christ.<a name=1:1484></a> This also is a mistake.<a name=1:1485></a> Not a single limb of the body of Christ can ever be disturbed.<a name=1:1486></a> Each member has been incorporated into its place by the Holy Ghost, in pursuance of the eternal purpose of God, and on the ground of the accomplished atonement of Christ; nor can any power of men or devils ever sever a single limb from the body.<a name=1:1487></a> All are indissolubly joined together in a perfect unity, and maintained therein by divine power.<a name=1:1488></a> The unity of the Church of God may be compared to a chain stretching across a river; you see it at either side, but it dips in the middle, and if you were to judge by the sight of your eyes, you might suppose that the chain had given way at the centre.<a name=1:1489></a> So is it with the Church of God; it was seen to be one at the beginning; it will be seen to be one by and by; and it is, in God's sight, one now, though the unity be not visible to mortal eyes.<a name=1:1490></a>

		It is of the very last moment that the Christian reader should be thoroughly clear on this great Church question.<a name=1:1491></a> The enemy has sought, by every means in his power, to cast dust into the eyes of God's dear people, in order that they might not see the truth in this matter.<a name=1:1492></a> We have, on the one side, the boasted unity of Roman Catholicism; and, on the other hand, the deplorable divisions of Protestantism.<a name=1:1493></a> Rome points, with an air of triumph, to the numerous sects of Protestants; and Protestants likewise point to the numerous errors, corruptions, and abuses of Romanism.<a name=1:1494></a> Thus the earnest seeker after truth hardly knows where to turn or what to think; while, on the other hand, the careless, the indifferent, the self-indulgent, and the world-loving are only too ready to draw a plea, from all that they see around them, for flinging aside all serious thought and concern about divine things; and even if, like Pilate, they sometimes flippantly ask the question, "What is truth?<a name=1:1495></a>" they, like him, turn on their heel without waiting for an answer.<a name=1:1496></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we are firmly persuaded that the true secret of the whole matter -- the grand solution of the difficulty -- the real relief for the hearts of God's beloved saints, will be found in the truth of the indivisible unity of the church of God, the body of Christ, on the earth.<a name=1:1497></a> This truth is not merely to be held as a doctrine, but to be confessed, maintained, and carried out, at all cost to ourselves.<a name=1:1498></a> It is a great formative truth for the soul, and contains in it the only answer to Rome's boasted unity on the one hand, and to Protestant divisions on the other.<a name=1:1499></a> It will enable us to testify to Protestantism that we have found unity, and to Roman Catholicism that we have found the unity of the Spirit.<a name=1:1500></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may, however, be argued, in reply, that it is the veriest Utopianism to seek to carry out such an idea, in the present condition of things.<a name=1:1501></a> Everything is in such ruin and confusion that we are just like a number of children who have lost their way in a wood, and are trying to make the best of their way home, some in large parties, some in groups of two or three, and some all alone.<a name=1:1502></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this may seem very plausible; and we do not doubt, in the least, but that it would carry immense weight with a large number of the Lord's people, at the present moment.<a name=1:1503></a> But, in the judgement of faith, such a mode of putting the matter possesses no weight whatever.<a name=1:1504></a> And for this simple reason, that the one all important question for faith is this, namely," Is the unity of the Church a human theory or a divine reality?<a name=1:1505></a>" A divine reality, most surely, as it is written, "There is one body, and one Spirit.<a name=1:1506></a>" (Eph 4: 4) If we deny that there is "one body," we may, with equal force, deny that there is "one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all," inasmuch as all lie side by side, on the page of inspiration, and if we disturb one, we disturb all.<a name=1:1507></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor are we confined to one solitary passage of scripture on this subject; though had we but one, it were amply sufficient.<a name=1:1508></a> But we have more that one.<a name=1:1509></a> Hearken to the following: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?<a name=1:1510></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=1:1511></a> For we, being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.<a name=1:1512></a>" (1 Corinthians 10: 16, 17) Read also 1 Corinthians 12: 12-27, where this whole subject is unfolded and applied.<a name=1:1513></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, then, the word of God doth, most clearly and fully, establish the truth of the indissoluble unity of the body of Christ; and, moreover, it establishes, as clearly and as fully, the truth of the discipline of God's house.<a name=1:1514></a> But, be it observed, the proper carrying out of the latter will never interfere with the former.<a name=1:1515></a> The two things are perfectly compatible.<a name=1:1516></a> Are we to suppose that when the apostle commanded the church of Corinth to put away from amongst them "that wicked person," the unity of the body was touched?<a name=1:1517></a> Surely not.<a name=1:1518></a> And yet was not that man a member of the body of Christ?<a name=1:1519></a> Truly so, for we find him restored in the second epistle.<a name=1:1520></a> The discipline of the house of God had done its work with a member of the body of Christ, and the erring one was brought back.<a name=1:1521></a> Such was the object of the church's act.<a name=1:1522></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this may help to clear the mind of the reader as to the deeply interesting subject of reception at the Lord's table and exclusion from it.<a name=1:1523></a> There seems to be a considerable amount of confusion in the minds of many Christians as to these things.<a name=1:1524></a> Some there are who seem to think that provided a person be a Christian, he should, on no account, be refused a place at the Lord's table.<a name=1:1525></a> The case in 1 Corinthians 5 is quite sufficient to settle this question.<a name=1:1526></a> Evidently that man was not put away on the ground of his not being a Christian.<a name=1:1527></a> He was, as we know, spite of his failure and sin, a child of God; and yet was the assembly at Corinth commanded to put him away; and had they not done so, they would have brought down the judgement of God upon the whole assembly.<a name=1:1528></a> God's presence is in the Assembly, and therefore evil must be judged.<a name=1:1529></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, whether we look at the fifth chapter of Numbers or at the fifth chapter of 1 Corinthians, we learn the same solemn truth, namely, that "Holiness becometh God's house for ever.<a name=1:1530></a>" And farther we learn that it is with God's own people that discipline must be maintained, and not with those outside.<a name=1:1531></a> For what do we read in the opening lines of Numbers 5: 1.<a name=1:1532></a> Were the children of Israel commanded to put out of the camp every one that was not an Israelite, every one that was not circumcised, every one who could not trace his pedigree, in an unbroken line, up to Abraham?<a name=1:1533></a> Were these the ground of exclusion from the camp?<a name=1:1534></a> Not at all.<a name=1:1535></a> Who then were to be put out "Every leper" -- that is, every one in whom sin is <i>allowed</i> to work.<a name=1:1536></a> "Every one that hath an issue" -- that is, every one from whom a defiling influence is emanating: and, "whosoever is defiled by the dead.<a name=1:1537></a>" These were the persons that were to be separated from the camp in the wilderness, and their antitypes are to be separated from the assembly now.<a name=1:1538></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And why, we may ask, was this separation demanded?<a name=1:1539></a> Was it to uphold the reputation or respectability of the people?<a name=1:1540></a> Nothing of the sort.<a name=1:1541></a> What then?<a name=1:1542></a> "That they defile not their camps in the midst whereof I <i>dwell</i>.<a name=1:1543></a>" And so is it now.<a name=1:1544></a> We do not judge and put away bad doctrine, in order to maintain <i>our</i> orthodoxy; neither do we judge and put away moral evil, in order to maintain our reputation and respectability.<a name=1:1545></a> The only ground of judgement and putting away is this, "Holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever.<a name=1:1546></a>" God dwells in the midst of His people.<a name=1:1547></a> "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I.<a name=1:1548></a>" Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=1:1549></a>"(l Corinthians 3: 16) And again, "Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an <i>holy temple</i> in the Lord; in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=1:1550></a>" Ephesians 2: 19-22.<a name=1:1551></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it may be that the reader feels disposed to put some such question as the following, How is it possible to find a pure, a Perfect church?<a name=1:1552></a> Is there not, will there not -- must there not be some evil in every assembly, in spite of the most intense pastoral vigilance and corporate faithfulness?<a name=1:1553></a> How then can this high standard of purity be maintained?<a name=1:1554></a>" No doubt there is evil in the assembly, inasmuch as there is indwelling sin in each member of the assembly.<a name=1:1555></a> But it must not be allowed; it must not be sanctioned; it must be judged and kept under.<a name=1:1556></a> It is not the presence of judged evil that defiles, But the allowance and sanction of evil.<a name=1:1557></a> It is with the Church, in its corporate character, as with the members in their individual character.<a name=1:1558></a> If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<a name=1:1559></a>" (1 Corinthians 11: 31) Hence, therefore, no amount of evil should lead a man to separate from the Church of God; but if an assembly denies its solemn responsibility to judge evil, both in doctrine and morals, it is no longer on the ground of the Church Of God at all, and it becomes your bounden duty to separate from it.<a name=1:1560></a> So long as an assembly is on the ground of the Church of God, however feeble it be, and few in number, to separate from it is schism.<a name=1:1561></a> But if an assembly be not on God's ground -- and most certainly it is not, if it denies its duty to judge evil -- then it is schism to continue in association with it.<a name=1:1562></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But will not this tend to multiply and perpetuate divisions?<a name=1:1563></a> Most assuredly not.<a name=1:1564></a> It may tend to break up mere human associations; but this is not schism, but the very reverse, inasmuch as all such associations, however large, powerful, and apparently useful, are positively antagonistic to the unity of the body of Christ, the Church of God.<a name=1:1565></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It cannot fail to strike the thoughtful reader that the Spirit of God is awakening attention, on all hands, to the great question of the Church.<a name=1:1566></a> Men are beginning to see that there is very much more in this subject than the mere notion of an individual mind, or the dogma of a party.<a name=1:1567></a> The question," What is the Church?<a name=1:1568></a>" is forcing itself upon many hearts and demanding an answer.<a name=1:1569></a> And what a mercy to have an answer to give!<a name=1:1570></a> an answer as clear, as distinct, and as authoritative as the voice of God, the voice of holy scripture, can give.<a name=1:1571></a> Is it not an unspeakable privilege, when assailed on all sides, by the claims of churches, "High Church," "Low Church," "Broad Church," "State Church," "Free Church," to be able to fall back upon the one true Church of the living God, the body of Christ?<a name=1:1572></a> We most assuredly esteem it as such; and we are firmly persuaded that here alone is the divine solution of the difficulties of thousands of the people of God.<a name=1:1573></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But where is this Church to be found?<a name=1:1574></a> Is it not a hopeless undertaking to set out to look for it amid the ruin and confusion which surround us?<a name=1:1575></a> No, blessed be God!<a name=1:1576></a> for, albeit we may not see all the members of the Church gathered together, yet it is our privilege and holy duty to know and occupy <i>the ground</i> of the Church of God, and no other.<a name=1:1577></a> And how is this ground to be discerned?<a name=1:1578></a> We believe that the first step towards discerning the true ground of the Church of God is, to stand apart from everything that is contrary thereto.<a name=1:1579></a> We need not expect to discover what is true while our minds are beclouded by what is false.<a name=1:1580></a> The divine order is, "Cease to do evil; learn to do well.<a name=1:1581></a>" God does not give us light for two steps at a time.<a name=1:1582></a> Hence, the moment we discover that we are on wrong ground, it is our duty to abandon it, and wait on God for further light, which He will, most surely, give.<a name=1:1583></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must proceed with our chapter.<a name=1:1584></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel; when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the Lord, and that person be guilty; then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.<a name=1:1585></a> But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.<a name=1:1586></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of the trespass offering has been considered in our "Notes on Leviticus," chapter 5; and to that we must refer our reader, as we do not mean to occupy his time or our own in going into any points which have been already considered.<a name=1:1587></a> We shall merely notice here the very important questions of confession and restitution.<a name=1:1588></a> Not only is it true that both God and man are gainers by the Great Trespass Offering presented on the cross at Calvary; but we also learn, from the foregoing quotation, that God looked for confession and restitution, when any trespass had been committed.<a name=1:1589></a> The sincerity of the former would be evidenced by the latter.<a name=1:1590></a> It was not sufficient for a Jew, who had trespassed against his brother, to go and say, "I am sorry," He had to restore the thing wherein he had trespassed and add a fifth thereto.<a name=1:1591></a> Now, although we are not under the law, yet may we gather much instruction from its institutions; although we are not under the schoolmaster, we may learn some good lessons from him.<a name=1:1592></a> If, then, we have trespassed against any one, it is not enough that we confess our sin to God and to our brother, we must make restitution; we are called upon to give practical proof of the fact that we have judged ourselves on account of that thing in which we have trespassed.<a name=1:1593></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We question if this is felt as it ought to be.<a name=1:1594></a> We fear there is a light, flippant, easy-going style in reference to sin and failure, which must be very grievous indeed to the Spirit of God.<a name=1:1595></a> We rest content with the mere lip confession, without the deep, heartfelt sense of the evil of sin in God's sight.<a name=1:1596></a> The thing itself is not judged in its moral roots, and, as a consequence of this trifling with sin, the heart becomes hard, and the conscience loses its tenderness.<a name=1:1597></a> <i>This is very serious</i>.<a name=1:1598></a> We know of few things more precious than a tender conscience.<a name=1:1599></a> We do not mean a <i>scrupulous</i> conscience, which is governed by its own crotchets; or a <i>morbid</i> conscience, which is governed by its own fears.<a name=1:1600></a> Both these are most troublesome guests for any one to entertain.<a name=1:1601></a> But we mean a <i>tender</i> conscience, which is governed, in all things, by the word of God, and which refers, at all times, to His authority.<a name=1:1602></a> This sound description of conscience we consider an inestimable treasure.<a name=1:1603></a> It regulates everything, takes cognisance of the very smallest matter connected with our daily walk and habits -- our mode of dress -- our houses -- our furniture -- our table -- our entire deportment, spirit, and style -- our mode of conducting our business, or, if it be our lot to serve others, the mode in which we discharge the service, whatever it be.<a name=1:1604></a> In short, everything falls under the healthful moral influence of a tender conscience.<a name=1:1605></a> "Herein," says the blessed apostle, "do I exercise myself, to have <i>always</i> a conscience void of offence toward God and men.<a name=1:1606></a>" Acts 24: 16.<a name=1:1607></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what we may well covet.<a name=1:1608></a> There is something morally beautiful and attractive in this exercise of the greatest and most gifted servant of Christ.<a name=1:1609></a> He, with all his splendid gifts, with all his marvellous powers, with all his profound insight into the ways and counsels of God, with all he had to speak of and glory in, with all the wonderful revelations made to him in the third heavens; in a word, he, the most honoured of apostles and privileged of saints, gave holy diligence to keep always a conscience void of offence both toward God and man; and if, in an unguarded moment, he uttered a hasty word, as he did to Ananias the high priest, he was ready, the very next moment, to confess and make restitution, so that the hasty utterance, "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall" was withdrawn, and God's word given instead -- "Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.<a name=1:1610></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor we do not believe that Paul could have retired to rest, that night, with a conscience void of offence, if he had not withdrawn his words.<a name=1:1611></a> There must be confession, when we do or say what is wrong; and if there be not the confession, our communion will assuredly be interrupted.<a name=1:1612></a> Communion, with unconfessed sin upon the conscience, is a moral impossibility.<a name=1:1613></a> We may talk of it; but it is all the merest delusion.<a name=1:1614></a> We must keep a clean conscience if we would walk with God.<a name=1:1615></a> There is nothing more to be dreaded than moral insensibility a slovenly conscience, an obtuse moral sense that can allow all sorts of things to pass unjudged; that can commit sin, pass on, and coolly say, "What evil have I done?<a name=1:1616></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, let us, with holy vigilance, watch against all this.<a name=1:1617></a> Let us seek to cultivate a tender conscience.<a name=1:1618></a> It will demand from us what it demanded from Paul, namely, "exercise.<a name=1:1619></a>" But it is blessed exercise, and it will yield most precious fruits.<a name=1:1620></a> Do not suppose that there is anything that savours of the legal in this exercise; nay, it is most thoroughly Christian; indeed we look upon those noble words of Paul as the very embodiment, in a condensed form, of the whole of a Christian's practice.<a name=1:1621></a> "To have <i>always</i> a conscience void of offence toward God and men" comprehends everything.<a name=1:1622></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But alas!<a name=1:1623></a> how little do we habitually ponder the claims of God, or the claims of our fellow-man!<a name=1:1624></a> How little is our conscience up to the mark!<a name=1:1625></a> Claims of all sorts are neglected, yet we feel it not.<a name=1:1626></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no brokenness and contrition before the Lord.<a name=1:1627></a> We commit trespass in a thousand things, yet there is no confession or restitution.<a name=1:1628></a> Things are allowed to pass that ought to be judged, confessed, and put away.<a name=1:1629></a> There is sin in our holy things; there is lightness and indifference of spirit in the assembly and at the Lord's table; we rob God, in various ways; we think our own thoughts, speak our own words, do our own pleasure; and what is all this but robbing God, seeing that we are not our own but bought with a price?<a name=1:1630></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we cannot but think that all this must sadly hinder our spiritual growth.<a name=1:1631></a> It grieves the Spirit of God and hinders His gracious ministry of Christ to our souls whereby alone we grow up into Him.<a name=1:1632></a> We know, from various parts of God's word, how much He prizes a tender spirit, a contrite heart.<a name=1:1633></a> "To this man will I look, even to him that is of a contrite spirit and trembles at my word.<a name=1:1634></a>" With such an one God can dwell; but with hardness and insensibility, coldness and indifference, He can have no fellowship.<a name=1:1635></a> Oh!<a name=1:1636></a> then let us exercise ourselves to have always a pure and uncondemning conscience, both as to God and as to our fellow-man.<a name=1:1637></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third and last section of our chapter, which we need not quote at length, teaches us a deeply solemn lesson, whether we view it from a dispensational or a moral point of view.<a name=1:1638></a> It contains the record of the great ordinance designed for the trial of jealousy.<a name=1:1639></a> Its place here is remarkable.<a name=1:1640></a> In the first section, we have the corporate judgement of evil: in the second, we have individual self-judgement, confession, and restitution: and in the third, we learn that God cannot endure even the mere suspicion of evil.<a name=1:1641></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we fully believe that this very impressive ordinance has a dispensational bearing upon the relationship between Jehovah and Israel.<a name=1:1642></a> The prophets dwell largely upon Israel's conduct as a wife, and upon Jehovah's jealousy, on that score.<a name=1:1643></a> We do not attempt to quote the passages, but the reader will find them throughout the pages of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<a name=1:1644></a> Israel could not abide the searching trial of the bitter water.<a name=1:1645></a> Her unfaithfulness has been made manifest.<a name=1:1646></a> She has broken her vows.<a name=1:1647></a> She has gone aside from her Husband, the Holy One of Israel, whose burning jealousy has been poured forth upon the Faithless nation.<a name=1:1648></a> He is a jealous God, and cannot bear the thought that the heart that He claims as His own should be given to another.<a name=1:1649></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that this ordinance for the trial of jealousy bears very distinctly upon it the impress of the divine character.<a name=1:1650></a> In it He most fully enters into the thoughts and feelings of an injured husband, or of one who even suspected an injury.<a name=1:1651></a> The bare suspicion is perfectly intolerable, and where it takes possession of the heart, the matter must be sifted to the very bottom.<a name=1:1652></a> The suspected one must undergo a process of such a searching nature that only the faithful one can endure.<a name=1:1653></a> If there was a trace of guilt, the bitter water could search down into the very depths of the soul, and bring it full out.<a name=1:1654></a> There was no escape for the guilty one; and, we may say, that the very fact of there being no possible escape for the guilty, only made the vindication of the innocent more triumphant.<a name=1:1655></a> The self-same process that declared the guilt of the guilty, made manifest the innocence of the faithful.<a name=1:1656></a> To one who is thoroughly conscious of integrity, the more searching the investigation the more welcome it is.<a name=1:1657></a> If there were a possibility of a guilty one escaping, through any defect in the mode of trial, it would only make against the innocent.<a name=1:1658></a> But the process was divine, and therefore perfect; and hence, when the suspected wife had gone through it in safety, her fidelity was perfectly manifested, and full confidence restored.<a name=1:1659></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a mercy, then, to have had such a perfect mode of settling all suspected cases!<a name=1:1660></a> Suspicion is the death blow to all loving intimacy, and God would not have it in the midst of His congregation.<a name=1:1661></a> He would not only have His people collectively to judge evil, and individually to judge themselves; But where there was even the suspicion of evil, and no evidence forthcoming, He Himself devised a method of trial which perfectly brought the truth to light.<a name=1:1662></a> The guilty one had to drink death, and found it to be judgement.<a name=1:1663></a><a href="#1:f5"><sup class="footnote-link">++++</sup></a> The faithful one drank death, and found it victory.<a name=1:1664></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f5"><sup>+++++</sup></a>The "*dust*" lifted from the floor of the tabernacle may be viewed as the figure of death. "Thou hast brought me into the dust of death." The "*water* prefigures the word, which, being brought to bear upon the conscience, by the power of the Holy Ghost, makes everything manifest. If there has been any unfaithfulness to Christ, the true husband of His people, it must be thoroughly judged. This holds good with regard to the nation of Israel, to the Church of God, and to the individual believer. If the heart be not true to Christ, it will not be able to stand the searching power of the word. But if there be truth in the inward parts, the more one is searched and tried, the better. How blessed it is when we can truly say, "Search me, O God, and know my Heart: try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting." Psalm 139: 23, 24

		In the first place, the Nazarite was not to drink wine.<a name=1:1674></a> The fruit of the vine, in every shape and form, was to him a forbidden thing.<a name=1:1675></a> Now, wine, as we know, is the apt symbol of earthly joy -- the expression of that social enjoyment which the human heart is so fully capable of entering into.<a name=1:1676></a> From this the Nazarite in the wilderness was sedulously to keep himself.<a name=1:1677></a> With him it was a literal thing.<a name=1:1678></a> He was not to excite nature by the use of strong drink.<a name=1:1679></a> All the days of his separation he was called to exercise the strictest abstinence from wine.<a name=1:1680></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such was the type, and it is written for our learning -- written too, in this marvellous book of Numbers, so rich in its wilderness lessons.<a name=1:1681></a> This is only what we might expect.<a name=1:1682></a> The impressive institution of the Nazarite finds its appropriate place in the book of Numbers.<a name=1:1683></a> It is in perfect keeping with the character of the book, which, as has been already remarked, contains all that specially belongs to life in the wilderness.<a name=1:1684></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us then inquire into the nature of the lesson taught us in the Nazarite's abstinence from everything pertaining to the vine, from the kernel even to the husk.<a name=1:1685></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There has been but one true and perfect Nazarite in this World -- but one who maintained, from first to last, the most complete separation from all mere earthly joy.<a name=1:1686></a> From the moment He entered upon His public work, He kept Himself apart from all that was of this world.<a name=1:1687></a> His heart was fixed upon God and His work, With a devotion that nothing could shake.<a name=1:1688></a> No claims of earth or nature were ever allowed, for a single moment, to come in between His heart and that work which He came to do.<a name=1:1689></a> "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<a name=1:1690></a>" And again, "What have I to do with thee?<a name=1:1691></a>" With such words did the true Nazarite seek to adjust the claims of nature.<a name=1:1692></a> He had one thing to do, and to that He separated Himself perfectly.<a name=1:1693></a> His eye was single and His heart undivided.<a name=1:1694></a> This is apparent from first to last.<a name=1:1695></a> He could say to His disciples, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of;" and when they, not knowing the deep significance of His words, said, "Hath any man brought Him anything to eat?<a name=1:1696></a>" He replied, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work (John 4) So also, at the close of His course here below, we hear Him giving utterance to such words as these, as He took into His hand the paschal cup: "Take this, and divide it among yourselves: for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.<a name=1:1697></a>" Luke 22: 17, 18.<a name=1:1698></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see how the perfect Nazarite carried himself throughout.<a name=1:1699></a> He could have no joy in the earth, no joy in the nation of Israel.<a name=1:1700></a> The time had not come for that, and therefore He detached Himself from all that which mere human affection might find in association with His own, in order to devote Himself to the one grand object which was ever before His mind.<a name=1:1701></a> The time will come when He, as the Messiah, will rejoice in His people and in the earth; But, until that blissful moment arrives, He is apart as the true Nazarite, and His people are united with Him.<a name=1:1702></a> "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<a name=1:1703></a> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<a name=1:1704></a> As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.<a name=1:1705></a> and for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=1:1706></a>" John 17: 16-19.<a name=1:1707></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christian reader, let us deeply ponder this first grand feature of the Nazarite character.<a name=1:1708></a> It is important we should faithfully examine ourselves in the light of it.<a name=1:1709></a> It is a very grave question indeed how far we, as Christians, are really entering into the meaning and power of this intense separation from all the excitement of nature, and from all merely earthly joy.<a name=1:1710></a> It may perhaps be said, "What harm is there in having a little amusement or recreation?<a name=1:1711></a> Surely we are not called to be monks.<a name=1:1712></a> Has not God given as richly all things to enjoy?<a name=1:1713></a> And while we are in the world, is it not right we should enjoy it?<a name=1:1714></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To all this we reply, It is not a question of the harm of this, that, or the other.<a name=1:1715></a> There was no harm, as a general rule, in and, nothing abstractedly wrong in the vine tree.<a name=1:1716></a> But the point is this, if any one aimed a being a Nazarite, if he aspired to this holy separation unto the Lord, then was he to abstain <i>wholly</i> from the use of wine and strong drink.<a name=1:1717></a> Others might drink wine; but the Nazarite was not to touch it.<a name=1:1718></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the question for us is this, Do we aim at being Nazarites?<a name=1:1719></a> Do we sigh after thorough separation and devotion of ourselves, in body, soul, and spirit, unto God?<a name=1:1720></a> If so, we must be apart from all these things in which mere nature finds its enjoyment.<a name=1:1721></a> It is upon this one hinge that the whole question turns.<a name=1:1722></a> The question, most assuredly, is not "Are we to be monks?<a name=1:1723></a>" but "Do we want to be Nazarites?<a name=1:1724></a>" Is it, our heart's desire to be apart, with our Lord Christ, from all mere earthly joy -- to be separated unto God from those things which, though not absolutely sinful in themselves, do, nevertheless, tend to hinder that entire consecration of heart which is the true secret of all spiritual Nazariteship?<a name=1:1725></a> Is not the Christian reader aware that there are, in very deed, many such things?<a name=1:1726></a> Is he not conscious that there are numberless things which exert a distracting and weakening influence upon his spirit, and yet were they to be tried by the standard of ordinary morality, they might be allowed to pass as harmless?<a name=1:1727></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must remember that God's Nazarites do not measure things by any such standard.<a name=1:1728></a> Theirs is not an ordinary morality at all.<a name=1:1729></a> They look at things from a divine and heavenly standpoint, and hence they cannot suffer anything to pass as harmless which tends, in any wise, to interfere with that high tone of consecration to God after which their souls are fervently breathing.<a name=1:1730></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May we have grace to weigh these things, and to watch against every defiling influence.<a name=1:1731></a> Each one must be aware of what it is which, in his case, would prove to be wine and strong drink.<a name=1:1732></a> It may seem to be a trifle; but we may rest assured that nothing is a trifle which breaks the current of our soul's communion with God, and robs us of that holy intimacy which it is our privilege ever to enjoy.<a name=1:1733></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was another thing which marked the Nazarite.<a name=1:1734></a> He was not to shave his head.<a name=1:1735></a> "All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.<a name=1:1736></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1 Corinthians 11: 14, we learn that it argues a lack of dignity for a man to have long hair.<a name=1:1737></a> "Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him" From this we learn that if we really desire to live a life of separation to God, we must be prepared to surrender our dignity in nature.<a name=1:1738></a> This our Lord Jesus Christ did perfectly.<a name=1:1739></a> He made Himself of no reputation.<a name=1:1740></a> He surrendered His rights in everything.<a name=1:1741></a> He could say, "I am a worm and no man.<a name=1:1742></a>" He emptied Himself thoroughly, and took the very lowest place.<a name=1:1743></a> He neglected Himself, while He cared for others.<a name=1:1744></a> In a word, His Nazariteship was perfect in this as in all beside.<a name=1:1745></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now here is just the very thing which we so little like to do.<a name=1:1746></a> We naturally stand up for our dignity and seek to maintain our rights.<a name=1:1747></a> It is deemed manly so to do.<a name=1:1748></a> But the perfect Man never did so; and if we aim at being Nazarites we shall not do so either.<a name=1:1749></a> We must surrender the dignities of nature, and forego the joys of earth, if we would tread a path of thorough separation to God in this world.<a name=1:1750></a> By and by both will be in place; but not now.<a name=1:1751></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here again, be it remarked, the question it is not as to the right or wrong of the case.<a name=1:1752></a> As a general rule, it was right for a man to shave his locks; but it was not right, nay it was altogether wrong, for a Nazarite to do so.<a name=1:1753></a> This made all the difference.<a name=1:1754></a> It was quite right for an ordinary man to shave and drink wine; but the Nazarite was not an ordinary man; he was one set apart from all that was ordinary to tread a path peculiar to himself; and to use a razor or taste wine would involve the entire surrender of that peculiar path.<a name=1:1755></a> Hence, if any inquire, Is it not right to enjoy the pleasures of earth, and maintain the dignities of nature?<a name=1:1756></a>" Quite right, if we are to walk as men but wholly wrong, yea, absolutely fatal, if we want to walk as Nazarites.<a name=1:1757></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This simplifies the matter amazingly.<a name=1:1758></a> It answers a thousand questions and solves a thousand difficulties.<a name=1:1759></a> It is of little use to split hairs about the harm of this or that particular thing.<a name=1:1760></a> The question is, What is our real purpose and object?<a name=1:1761></a> Do we merely want to get on as men, or do we long to live as true Nazarites?<a name=1:1762></a> According to the language of 1 Corinthians 3: 3, to "Walk as men" and to be "carnal" are synonymous.<a name=1:1763></a> Does such language really govern us?<a name=1:1764></a> Do we drink into the spirit and breathe the atmosphere of such a scripture?<a name=1:1765></a> Or are we ruled by the spirit and principles of a Godless, Christless world?<a name=1:1766></a> It is useless to spend our time arguing points which would never be raised at all if our souls were in the right temper and attitude.<a name=1:1767></a> No doubt, it is perfectly right, perfectly natural, perfectly consistent, for the men of this world to enjoy All that it has to offer them, and to maintain their rights and their dignities to the very utmost of their power.<a name=1:1768></a> It were childish to question this.<a name=1:1769></a> But, on the other hand, what is right, and natural, and consistent for the men of this world, is wrong, unnatural, and inconsistent for God's Nazarites.<a name=1:1770></a> Thus the matter stands, if we are to be governed by the simple truth of God.<a name=1:1771></a> we learn from Numbers 6, that if a Nazarite drank wine or shaved his locks, he defiled the head of his consecration.<a name=1:1772></a> Has this no voice, no lesson for us?<a name=1:1773></a> assuredly it has.<a name=1:1774></a> It teaches as that if our souls desire to pursue a path of whole-hearted consecration to God, we must abstain from the joys of earth, and surrender the dignities and the rights of nature.<a name=1:1775></a> It must be thus, seeing that God and the world, flesh and spirit, do not and cannot coalesce.<a name=1:1776></a> The time will come when it will be otherwise; But, just now, all who <i>will</i> live to God, and walk in the Spirit, must live apart from the world, and mortify the flesh.<a name=1:1777></a> May God, of His great mercy, enable us so to do!<a name=1:1778></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One other feature of the Nazarite remains to be noticed.<a name=1:1779></a> He was not to touch a dead body.<a name=1:1780></a> "All the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall come at no dead body.<a name=1:1781></a> He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because the consecration of his God is upon his head.<a name=1:1782></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that whether it was drinking wine, shaving his locks, or touching a dead body, the effect was the same; any one of the three involved the defilement of the head of the Nazarite's consecration.<a name=1:1783></a> Wherefore it is plain that it was as defiling to the Nazarite to drink wine or to shave his Head, as it was to touch a dead body.<a name=1:1784></a> It is well to see this.<a name=1:1785></a> We are prone to make distinctions which will not stand for a moment in the light of the divine presence.<a name=1:1786></a> When once the consecration of God rested upon the head of any one, that great and important fact became the standard and touchstone of all morality.<a name=1:1787></a> It placed the individual on entirely new and peculiar ground, and rendered it imperative upon him to look at everything from a new and peculiar point of view.<a name=1:1788></a> He was no longer to ask what became him as a man; but what became him as a Nazarite.<a name=1:1789></a> Hence, if his dearest friend lay dead by his side he was not to touch him.<a name=1:1790></a> He was called to keep himself apart from the defiling influence of death, and all because "the consecration of God" was upon his head.<a name=1:1791></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in this entire subject of Nazariteship, it is needful for the reader to understand, very distinctly, that it is not, by any means, a question of the soul's salvation, of eternal life, or of the believer's perfect security in Christ.<a name=1:1792></a> If this be not clearly seen it may lead the mind into perplexity and darkness.<a name=1:1793></a> There are, two grand links in Christianity which, though very intimately connected, are perfectly distinct, namely, the link of eternal life, and the link of personal communion.<a name=1:1794></a> The former can never be snapped by anything; the latter can be snapped in a moment, by the weight of a feather.<a name=1:1795></a> It is to the second of these that the doctrine of Nazariteship pertains.<a name=1:1796></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We behold, in the person of the Nazarite, a type of one who sets out in some special path of devotedness or consecration to Christ.<a name=1:1797></a> The power of continuance in this path consists in secret communion with God; so that if the communion be interrupted, the power is gone.<a name=1:1798></a> This renders the subject peculiarly solemn.<a name=1:1799></a> There is the greatest possible danger of attempting to pursue the path in the absence of that which constitutes the source of his power.<a name=1:1800></a> This is most disastrous, and demands the utmost vigilance.<a name=1:1801></a> we have briefly glanced at the various things which tend to interrupt the Nazarite's communion; but it would be wholly impossible, by any words of ours, to set forth the moral effect of any attempt to keep up the appearance or Nazariteship when the inward reality is gone.<a name=1:1802></a> It is dangerous in the extreme.<a name=1:1803></a> It is infinitely better to confess our failure, and take our true place, than to keep up a false appearance.<a name=1:1804></a> God will have reality; and we may rest assured that, sooner or later, our weakness and folly will be made manifest to all.<a name=1:1805></a> It is very deplorable and very humbling when "the Nazarites that were purer than snow," become "blacker than a coal;" but it is far worse when those who have become Thus black, keep up the pretence of being white.<a name=1:1806></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look at the solemn case of Samson, as set before us in the sixteenth chapter of Judges.<a name=1:1807></a> He, in an evil hour, betrayed his secret and lost his power-lost it though he knew it not.<a name=1:1808></a> But the enemy soon knew it.<a name=1:1809></a> It was soon made manifest to all that the Nazarite had defiled the head of his consecration.<a name=1:1810></a> "And it came to pass, when Delilah pressed will daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; that he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.<a name=1:1811></a>" Verses 16, 17.<a name=1:1812></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here alas!<a name=1:1813></a> was the betrayal of the deep and holy secret of all his power.<a name=1:1814></a> Up to this, his path had been one of strength and victory, simply because it had been one of holy Nazariteship.<a name=1:1815></a> But the lap of Delilah proved too much for the heart of Samson, and what a thousand Philistines could not do was done by the ensnaring influence of a single woman.<a name=1:1816></a> Samson fell from the lofty elevation of the Nazarite down to the level of an ordinary man.<a name=1:1817></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath showed me all his heart.<a name=1:1818></a> Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.<a name=1:1819></a> And she made him sleep upon her knees; Alas!<a name=1:1820></a> alas!<a name=1:1821></a> a fatal sleep to God's Nazarite!<a name=1:1822></a> and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.<a name=1:1823></a> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.<a name=1:1824></a> And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself.<a name=1:1825></a> And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.<a name=1:1826></a> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.<a name=1:1827></a>" Judges 16: 18-21.<a name=1:1828></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=1:1829></a> reader, what a picture!<a name=1:1830></a> How solemn!<a name=1:1831></a> How admonitory!<a name=1:1832></a> What a melancholy spectacle was Samson, going out to shake himself, "as at other times!<a name=1:1833></a>" Alas!<a name=1:1834></a> the "as" was out of place.<a name=1:1835></a> He might shake himself, But it was no longer" as at other times," for the power was gone; the Lord was departed from him; and the once powerful Nazarite became a blind prisoner; and instead of triumphing over the Philistines, he had to grind in their prison house.<a name=1:1836></a> So much for yielding to mere nature.<a name=1:1837></a> Samson never regained his liberty.<a name=1:1838></a> He Was permitted, through the mercy of God, to gain one more victory over the uncircumcised; but that victory cost him his life.<a name=1:1839></a> God's Nazarites must keep themselves pure or lose their power.<a name=1:1840></a> In their case, power and purity are inseparable.<a name=1:1841></a> They cannot get on without inward holiness; and hence the urgent need of being ever on the watch against the various things which tend to draw away the heart, distract the mind, and lower the tone of spirituality.<a name=1:1842></a> Let us ever keep before our souls those words of our chapter, "all the days of his separation he is holy unto the Lord.<a name=1:1843></a>" Holiness is the grand and indispensable characteristic of all the days of Nazariteship; so that when once holiness is forfeited, Nazariteship is at an end.<a name=1:1844></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then, it may be asked, is to be done?<a name=1:1845></a> The scripture before us supplies the answer.<a name=1:1846></a> "And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.<a name=1:1847></a> And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.<a name=1:1848></a> And he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering; but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.<a name=1:1849></a>" Numbers 6: 9-12.<a name=1:1850></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we find atonement, in its two grand aspects, as the only ground on which the Nazarite could be restored to communion.<a name=1:1851></a> He had contracted defilement, and that defilement could only be removed by the blood of the sacrifice.<a name=1:1852></a> We might deem it a very trying matter to touch a dead body, and particularly under such circumstances.<a name=1:1853></a> It might be said, "How could he help, touching it when the man had suddenly dropped dead by his side?<a name=1:1854></a>" To all this the reply is at once simple and solemn.<a name=1:1855></a> God's Nazarites must maintain personal purity; and, moreover, the standard by which their purity is to be regulated is not human but divine.<a name=1:1856></a> the mere touch of death was sufficient to break the link of communion; and had the Nazarite presumed to go on as though nothing had happened, he would have been flying in the face of God's commandments, and bringing down heavy judgment upon himself.<a name=1:1857></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed be God, grace had made provision.<a name=1:1858></a> There was the burnt offering -- the type of the death of Christ to Godward.<a name=1:1859></a> There was the sin offering -- the type of that same death to usward.<a name=1:1860></a> And there was the trespass offering -- the type of the death of Christ, not only in its application to the root or principle of sin in the nature, but also to the actual sin committed.<a name=1:1861></a> In a word, it needed the full!<a name=1:1862></a> virtue of the death of Christ to remove the defilement caused by the simple touch of a dead body.<a name=1:1863></a> This is peculiarly solemnizing.<a name=1:1864></a> Sin is a dreadful thing in God's sight -- most dreadful.<a name=1:1865></a> A single sinful thought, a sinful look, a sinful word is enough to bring a dark, heavy cloud over the soul, which will hide from our view the light of God's countenance, and plunge us into deep distress and misery.<a name=1:1866></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us, then, beware how we trifle with sin.<a name=1:1867></a> Let us remember that ere one stain of the guilt of sin even the very smallest could be removed, the blessed Lord Jesus Christ had to pass through all the unutterable horrors of Calvary.<a name=1:1868></a> That intensely bitter cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=1:1869></a>" is the only thing that can give us any proper idea of what sin is; and into the profound depths of that cry no mortal or angel can ever enter.<a name=1:1870></a> But though we can never fathom the mysterious depths of the sufferings of Christ, we should at least seek to meditate more habitually upon His cross and passion, and, in this way, reach a much deeper view of the awfulness of sin, in the sight of God.<a name=1:1871></a> If, indeed, sin was so dreadful, so abhorrent to a holy God, that He was constrained to turn away the light of His countenance from that blessed One who had dwelt in His bosom from all eternity; if He had to forsake Him because He was bearing sin in His own body on the tree, then what must sin be?<a name=1:1872></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=1:1873></a> reader, let us seriously consider these things.<a name=1:1874></a> May they ever have a place deep down in these hearts or ours that are so easily betrayed into sin!<a name=1:1875></a> How lightly, at times, do we think of that which cost the Lord Jesus everything, not only life, but that which is better and dearer than life, even the light of God's countenance!<a name=1:1876></a> May we have a far deeper sense of the hatefulness of sin!<a name=1:1877></a> May we, most sedulously, watch against the bare movement of the eye in a wrong direction, for we may rest assured that the heart will follow the eye, and the feet will follow the heart, and thus we get away from the Lord, lose the sense of His presence and His love, and become miserable, or, if not miserable, what is far worse, dead, cold, and callous -- "hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<a name=1:1878></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		May God, in His infinite mercy, keep as from falling!<a name=1:1879></a> May we have grace to watch, more jealously, against everything, no matter what, that might defile the head of our consecration!<a name=1:1880></a> it is a serious: thing to get out of communion; and a most perilous thing to attempt to go on in the Lord's service with a defiled conscience.<a name=1:1881></a> True it is that grace pardons and restores, but we never regain what we have lost.<a name=1:1882></a> This latter is set forth, with solemn emphasis, in the passage of scripture before us:" He shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering; <i>but the days that were before shall be lost</i> (or shall fall, as the margin reads it), because his separation was defiled.<a name=1:1883></a>"

		This is a point, in our subject, full of instruction and admonition for our souls.<a name=1:1884></a> When the Nazarite became defiled, by any means, even by the touch of a dead body, he had to begin over again.<a name=1:1885></a> It was not merely the days of his defilement that were lost, or let fall, but actually all the days of his previous Nazariteship.<a name=1:1886></a> All went for nothing, and this simply by reason of touching a dead body.<a name=1:1887></a>

		What does this teach us?<a name=1:1888></a> It teaches this, at least, that when we diverge, the breadth of a hair, from the narrow path of communion, and get away from the Lord, we must return to the very point from which we set out, and begin <i>de novo</i>.<a name=1:1889></a> We have many examples of this in scripture; and it would be our wisdom to consider them, and also to weigh the great practical truth which they illustrate.<a name=1:1890></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take the case of Abraham, in his descent into Egypt, as recorded in Genesis 12.<a name=1:1891></a> This was, very evidently, a divergence from his proper path.<a name=1:1892></a> and what was the consequence?<a name=1:1893></a> The days were lost or let fall, and he had to set back to the point whence he had swerved, and begin over again.<a name=1:1894></a> Thus, in Genesis 12: 8, We read, "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.<a name=1:1895></a>" Then, after his return out of the land of Egypt, we read, "He went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been <i>at the beginning</i>, between Bethel and Hai; unto the place of the altar which he had made there <i>at the first</i>: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.<a name=1:1896></a>" (Genesis 13: 3, 4) All the time spent in Egypt went for nothing.<a name=1:1897></a> There was no altar there, no worship, no communion; and Abraham had to get back to the self-same point from which he had diverged, and begin on the new.<a name=1:1898></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is in every case; and this will account for the miserably slow progress which some of us make in our practical career.<a name=1:1899></a> We fail, turn aside, get away from the Lord, are plunged in spiritual darkness; and then His voice of love reaches us in restoring power, and brings us back to the point from which we had wandered; our souls are restored, but we have lost time and suffered incalculably.<a name=1:1900></a> This is most serious, and it should lead us to walk with holy vigilance and circumspection, so that we may not have to double back upon our path, and lose what can never be regained.<a name=1:1901></a> True it is that our wanderings, and our stumblings, and our failings give us an insight into our own hearts, teach us to distrust ourselves, and illustrate the boundless and unchangeable grace of our God.<a name=1:1902></a> All this is quite true; but still there is a very much higher way of learning both ourselves and God, than by wandering, stumbling, or failing.<a name=1:1903></a> <i>Self</i>, in all the terrible depths of that word, should be judged in the holy light of the divine presence; and there, too, our souls should grow in the knowledge of God as He unfolds Himself, by the Holy Ghost, in the face of Jesus Christ, and in the precious pages of holy scripture.<a name=1:1904></a> This surely is the more excellent way of learning both ourselves and God; and this, too, is the power of all true Nazarite separation.<a name=1:1905></a> The soul that habitually lives in the sanctuary of God, or, in other words, that walks in unbroken communion with God, is the one who will have a just sense of what nature is, in all its phases, though it be not learnt by sad experience.<a name=1:1906></a> And not only so; but he will have a deeper and more just sense of what God is, in Himself, and to all who put their trust in Him.<a name=1:1907></a> It is poor work to be learning self by experience.<a name=1:1908></a> We may depend upon it, the true way to learn it is in communion; and when we learn it thus, we shall not be characterised by perpetually dwelling upon our personal vileness, but rather we shall be occupied with that which is outside and above self altogether, even the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=1:1909></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall, in closing this section, quote, at length, for the reader, the statement of "The law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and he shall offer his offering unto the Lord, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings; and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.<a name=1:1910></a> And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.<a name=1:1911></a> And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.<a name=1:1912></a> And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.<a name=1:1913></a> And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven; and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and the heave shoulder: and <i>after that the Nazarite may drink wine</i>.<a name=1:1914></a> This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the Lord for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.<a name=1:1915></a>" Numbers 6: 13-21.<a name=1:1916></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This marvellous "law" leads us onward to something future, when the full result of Christ's perfect work shall appear; and when He, as the Messiah of Israel, shall, at the close of his Nazarite separation, taste true joy in His beloved people, and in this earth.<a name=1:1917></a> The time will then have come for the Nazarite to drink wine.<a name=1:1918></a> From all this He set Himself apart, for the accomplishment of that great work, so fully set forth, in all its aspects and in all its bearings, in the foregoing "law.<a name=1:1919></a>" He is apart from the nation, and apart from this world, in the power of true Nazariteship, as He said to His disciples on that memorable night, "I will not drink henceforth (<i>ap arti</i>) Of this fruit of the vine, until <i>that day</i> when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<a name=1:1920></a>" Matthew 26: 29.<a name=1:1921></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a bright day coming, when Jehovah Messiah shall rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in His people.<a name=1:1922></a> The prophets, from Isaiah to Malachi, are full of the most glowing and soul-stirring allusions to that bright and blissful day.<a name=1:1923></a> To quote the passages would literally fill a volume.<a name=1:1924></a> But if the reader will turn to the closing section of Isaiah's prophecy, he will find a sample of that to which we refer; and he will find many similar passages throughout the various books of the prophets.<a name=1:1925></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not attempt to quote; but we would warn the reader against the danger of being led astray by the uninspired headings attached to those magnificent passages which refer to Israel's future, such, for example, as "The blessings of the gospel" -- "The enlargement of the Church.<a name=1:1926></a>" These expressions are calculated to mislead many pious readers who are apt to take for granted that the headings are as much inspired as the text; or, if not inspired, that they, at least, contain a correct statement of what the text sets forth.<a name=1:1927></a> The fact is, there is not a syllable about the Church from beginning to end of the prophets.<a name=1:1928></a> That the Church can find most precious instruction, light, comfort, and edification from this grand division of the inspired volume, is blessedly true; but she will do this just in proportion as she is enabled, by the Spirit's teaching, to discern the real scope and object of this portion of the book of God.<a name=1:1929></a> To suppose, for a moment, that we can only derive comfort and profit from that which exclusively or primarily refers to ourselves, would be to take a very narrow, if not an egotistical, view of things.<a name=1:1930></a> Can we not learn from the Book of Leviticus And yet who would assert that that section refers to the Church?<a name=1:1931></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No, reader; you may rest assured that a calm, unprejudiced, prayerful study of "The law the prophets" will convince you that the great theme of both the one and the other is God's government of the world in immediate connection with Israel.<a name=1:1932></a> True it is, that throughout "Moses and all the prophets" there are things concerning (the Lord) Himself.<a name=1:1933></a> This is plain from Luke 24: 27.<a name=1:1934></a> But it is "Himself" in His government of this world, and of Israel in particular.<a name=1:1935></a> If this fact be not distinctly seized, we shall study the Old Testament with little intelligence or profit.<a name=1:1936></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem to some of our readers, a strong statement to assert that there is nothing about the Church, properly so called, throughout the prophets, or indeed in the Old Testament; but a statement or two from the inspired pen of St.<a name=1:1937></a> Paul will settle the whole question for any one who is really willing to submit to the authority of holy scripture.<a name=1:1938></a> Thus in Romans 16.<a name=1:1939></a> we read," Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery<i>, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest</i>, and by the scriptures of the prophets evidently of the New Testament, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith.<a name=1:1940></a>" Verses 29, 26.<a name=1:1941></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also in Ephesians 3 we read, "For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the Grace of God, which is given me to youward; how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ;) <i>which.<a name=1:1942></a> in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,,, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit</i><a href="#1:f6"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++</sup></a> that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel .<a name=1:1943></a>.<a name=1:1944></a>.<a name=1:1945></a> .<a name=1:1946></a>.<a name=1:1947></a>.<a name=1:1948></a> .<a name=1:1949></a> and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which <i>from the beginning of the world hath been</i> HID IN God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.<a name=1:1950></a>" Verses 1-10.<a name=1:1951></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f6"><sup>++++++</sup></a>The "Prophets" in the above quotations, are those of the New Testament, as is evident from the form Of expression. Had the apostle meant Old Testament prophets, he would have said,'' His holy prophets and apostles." But the very point he is insisting upon is, that the mystery had never been revealed until his time -- that it had not been made known to the sons of men in other ages -- that it was hid in God; not hid in the scriptures, but in the infinite mind of God.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must not pursue this deeply interesting subject of the Church; we have merely referred to the foregoing plain passages of scripture, in order to settle the reader's mind as to the fact that the doctrine of the Church, as taught by Paul, finds no place in the page of the Old Testament; and therefore, when he reads the prophets and meets the words "Israel," "Jerusalem," "Zion," he is not to apply such terms to the Church of God, inasmuch as they belong to the literal people of Israel, the seed of Abraham, the land of Canaan, and the city of Jerusalem.<a name=1:1952></a><a href="#1:f7"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++</sup></a> God means what He says; and, therefore, we must not countenance anything that borders upon, or looks like, a loose and irreverent mode of handling the word of God.<a name=1:1953></a> When the Spirit speaks of Jerusalem, He means Jerusalem; if He meant the Church, He would say so.<a name=1:1954></a> We should not attempt to treat a respectable human document as we treat the inspired volume.<a name=1:1955></a> We take it for granted that a man not only knows what he means to say, but says what he means; and if this be so, in regard to a poor fallible mortal, how much more so, in regard to the only wise and living God, who cannot lie?<a name=1:1956></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f7"><sup>+++++++</sup></a>The statement in the text refers, of course, to the Old Testament prophecies. There are passages in the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians in which all believers are viewed as the seed of Abraham (see Romans 4: 9-17; Galatians 3: 7, 9, 21; Galatians 6: 16); but this is, obviously, a different thing altogether. We have no revelation of "the Church," properly so called, in the Old Testament scriptures.

	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must draw this section to a close, and leave the reader to meditate alone upon the ordinance of the Nazarite, so pregnant with sacred teaching for the heart.<a name=1:1957></a> We wish him to ponder, in a special way, the fact that the Holy Ghost has given us the full statement of the law of Nazariteship in the Book of Numbers -- the wilderness book.<a name=1:1958></a> And not only so, but let him carefully consider the institution itself.<a name=1:1959></a> Let him see that he understands why the Nazarite was not to drink wine; why he was not to shave his locks; and why he was not to touch a dead body.<a name=1:1960></a> Let him meditate upon these three things, and seek; to gather up the instruction contained therein.<a name=1:1961></a> Let him ask himself, "Do I really long to be a Nazarite -- to walk along the narrow path of separation unto God and, if so, am I prepared to surrender all those things which tend to defile, to distract, and to hinder God's Nazarites?<a name=1:1962></a>" And, finally, let him remember that there is a time coming when "the Nazarite may drink wine;" or, in other words, when there will be no need to watch against the varied forms of evil within or around; all will be pure; the affections may flow out without check; the garments may flow around us without a girdle; there will be no evil to be separated from, and therefore there will be no need of separation.<a name=1:1963></a> In a word, there will be "a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.<a name=1:1964></a>" May God, in His infinite mercy, keep us until that blessed time, in true consecration of heart unto Himself.<a name=1:1965></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will observe that we here reach the close of a very distinct section of our book.<a name=1:1966></a> The camp is duly arranged; every warrior is set in his proper place (Numbers 1, 2); every workman is set to his proper work (Numbers 3, 4); the congregation is purified from defilement.<a name=1:1967></a> (Numbers 5) Provision is made for the highest character of separation to God.<a name=1:1968></a> (Numbers 6) All this is very marked.<a name=1:1969></a> the order is strikingly beautiful.<a name=1:1970></a> we have before us not only a cleansed and well ordered camp, but also a character of consecration to God beyond which it is impossible to go, inasmuch as it is that which is only seen, in its integrity, in the life of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ Himself.<a name=1:1971></a> Having then reached this lofty point, nothing remains but for Jehovah to pronounce His blessing upon the whole congregation, and accordingly we get that blessing at the close of Numbers 6; and surely we may say, a right royal blessing it is.<a name=1:1972></a> Let us read and consider.<a name=1:1973></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise we shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord bless thee and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee.<a name=1:1974></a> the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.<a name=1:1975></a> And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.<a name=1:1976></a>"

		But, blessed be God, there is a moment approaching in the which the magnificent benediction of Numbers 6 shall have its full application; when Israel's twelve tribes shall be ranged round that imperishable standard, "Jehovah-shammah" (Ezekiel 48: 35); when they shall be purified from all their defilements, and consecrated unto God in the power of true Nazariteship.<a name=1:1988></a> These things are set forth in the fullest and clearest manner, throughout the pages of the prophets.<a name=1:1989></a> All these inspired witnesses, without so much as one dissentient voice, bear testimony to the glorious future in store for the literal Israel; they all point forward to that time when the heavy clouds which have gathered and still hang upon the nation's horizon shall be chased away before the bright beams of "the Sun of righteousness;" when Israel shall enjoy a cloudless day of bliss and glory, beneath the vines and fig-trees of that very land which God gave as an everlasting possession unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<a name=1:1990></a>

		If we deny the foregoing, we may as well cut out a large portion of the Old Testament, and not a small Part of the New, for in both the one and the other the Holy Ghost doth most clearly and unequivocally bear testimony to this precious fact, namely, mercy, salvation, and blessing to the seed of Jacob.<a name=1:1991></a> We hesitate not to declare our conviction that no one can possibly understand the Prophets who does not see this.<a name=1:1992></a> There is a bright future in store for God's beloved, though now rejected people.<a name=1:1993></a> Let us beware How we deal with this fact.<a name=1:1994></a> It is a very grave matter to attempt to interfere, in any wise, with the true and proper application of the word of God.<a name=1:1995></a> If He has pledged Himself to bless the nation of Israel, let us have a care how we seek to force the stream of blessing to flow in a different channel.<a name=1:1996></a> It is a serious thing to tamper with the declared purpose of God.<a name=1:1997></a> He has declared it to be His purpose to give the land of Canaan an everlasting possession to the seed of Jacob; and if this be called in question, we do not see how we can hold fast the integrity of any one portion of the word of God.<a name=1:1998></a> If we show ourselves to trifle with a large division of the inspired canon and most assuredly it is trifling with it when we seek to divert it from its true object -- then what security have we in reference to the application of scripture at all?<a name=1:1999></a> If God does not mean what He says when He speaks of Israel and the land of Canaan, how do we know that He means what He says when He speaks of the Church and her heavenly portion in Christ?<a name=1:2000></a> If the Jew be robbed of his glorious future, what security has the Christian as to his?<a name=1:2001></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the very longest section in the entire Book of Numbers.<a name=1:2007></a> It contains a detailed statement of the names of the twelve princes of the congregation, and of their respective offerings on the occasion of the setting up of the tabernacle.<a name=1:2008></a> "It came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them, that the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered.<a name=1:2009></a> And they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox; and they brought them before the tabernacle.<a name=1:2010></a> And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.<a name=1:2011></a> And Moses took: the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.<a name=1:2012></a> Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service.<a name=1:2013></a> and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.<a name=1:2014></a> But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none; because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.<a name=1:2015></a>" Verses 1-9.<a name=1:2016></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We noticed, when meditating on Numbers 3 and 4, that the sons of Kohath were privileged to carry all that was most precious of the instruments and furniture of the sanctuary.<a name=1:2017></a> Hence they did not receive any of the princes' offering.<a name=1:2018></a> It was their high and holy service to bear upon their shoulders, and not to make use of wagons or oxen.<a name=1:2019></a> The more closely we examine those things which were committed to the custody and charge of the Kohathites, the more we shall see that they set forth, in type, the deeper and fuller manifestations of God in Christ.<a name=1:2020></a> The Gershonites and Merarites, on the contrary, had to do with those things which were more external.<a name=1:2021></a> Their work was rougher and more exposed, and therefore they were furnished with the needed help which the liberality of the princes placed at their disposal.<a name=1:2022></a> The Kohathite did not want the aid of a wagon or an ox in his elevated service.<a name=1:2023></a> His own shoulder was to bear the precious mystic burden.<a name=1:2024></a>

		This is divine.<a name=1:2044></a> And may we not say that this seventh chapter of Numbers is one of those specimen pages from the book of eternity, on which the finger of God has engraved the names of His servants, and the record of their work We believe it is; and if the reader will turn to the twenty-third of second Samuel, and the sixteenth of Romans, he will find two similar pages.<a name=1:2045></a> In the former, we have the names and the deeds of David's worthies; in the latter, the names and the deeds of Paul's friends at Rome.<a name=1:2046></a> In both we have an illustration of what, we feel persuaded, is true of all the saints of God, and the servants of Christ, from first to last.<a name=1:2047></a> Each one has his own special place on the roll, and each one his place in the Master's heart; and all will come out by and by.<a name=1:2048></a> Amongst David's mighty men, we have "the first three" -- "the three" and "the thirty.<a name=1:2049></a>" Not one of "the thirty" ever attained a place among "the three;" nor did one of "the three" ever reach to "the first three.<a name=1:2050></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor this only.<a name=1:2051></a> Every act is faithfully set down; and the substance and style most accurately put before us.<a name=1:2052></a> We have the name of the man, <i>what</i> he did, and <i>how</i> he did it.<a name=1:2053></a> All is recorded, with sedulous care and minuteness, by the unerring and impartial pen of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:2054></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also, when we turn to that remarkable sample page furnished in Romans 16.<a name=1:2055></a> we have all about Phebe, what she was and what she did, and what a solid basis she had on which to rest her claim upon the sympathy and succour of the assembly at Rome.<a name=1:2056></a> Then we have Priscilla and Aquila -- the wife put first -- and how they had laid down their own necks for the life of the blessed apostle, and earned his thanks and that of all the churches of the Gentiles.<a name=1:2057></a> Next we have "the <i>well</i> beloved Epaenetus;" and "Mary who bestowed," not merely labour, but "<i>much</i> labour" on the apostle.<a name=1:2058></a> It would not have expressed the mind of the Spirit, or the heart of Christ, merely to say that Epaenetus was "beloved," or that Mary had bestowed "labour.<a name=1:2059></a>" No; the little adjuncts "well" and "much" were necessary in order to set forth the exact <i>status</i> of each.<a name=1:2060></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must not enlarge, and we shall merely call the reader's attention to verse 12.<a name=1:2061></a> Why does not the inspired penman place "Tryphena, Tryphosa," and "the beloved Persis" under one head Why does he not assign them one and the same position?<a name=1:2062></a> The reason is perfectly beautiful; because he could only say of the two former that they had "laboured in the Lord," whereas it was due to the latter to add that she had "laboured <i>much</i> in the Lord.<a name=1:2063></a>" Can anything be more discriminating?<a name=1:2064></a> It is "the three" -- "the first three" -- and "the thirty" over again.<a name=1:2065></a> There is no promiscuous jumbling of names and services together; no haste; no inaccuracy.<a name=1:2066></a> We are told what each one was, and what he did.<a name=1:2067></a> Each one gets his own place, and receives his own meed of praise.<a name=1:2068></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this, be it observed, is a specimen page from the book of eternity.<a name=1:2069></a> How solemn And yet, how encouraging There is not a single act of service which we render to our Lord that will not be set down in His book; and not only the <i>substance</i> of the act, but the <i>style</i> of it also, for God appreciates style as well as we do.<a name=1:2070></a> -- He loves a cheerful giver, and a cheerful worker, because that is precisely what He is Himself.<a name=1:2071></a> It was grateful to His heart to see the tide of liberality flowing around His sanctuary from the representatives of the twelve tribes.<a name=1:2072></a> It was grateful to his heart to mark the actings of David's worthies, in the day of his rejection.<a name=1:2073></a> It was grateful to His heart to trace the devoted path of the Priscillas, the Aquilas, and the Phebes of a later date.<a name=1:2074></a> And, we may add, it is grateful to His heart, in this day of so much lukewarmness and vapid profession, to behold, here and there, a true-hearted lover of Christ, and a devoted worker in His vineyard.<a name=1:2075></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God's Spirit stir up our hearts to more thorough devotedness!<a name=1:2076></a> May the love of Christ constrain us, more and more, to live, not unto ourselves, but unto Him who loved us and washed us from our scarlet sins in His most precious blood, and made us all we are, or ever hope to be.<a name=1:2077></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.<a name=1:2078></a> And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the Lord commanded Moses.<a name=1:2079></a> And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the Lord had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.<a name=1:2080></a>" Verses 1-4.<a name=1:2081></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On reading the foregoing paragraph, two things claim the reader's attention, namely, first, the position which the type of the golden candlestick occupies; and, secondly, the instruction which the type conveys.<a name=1:2082></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a little remarkable, that the candlestick is the only part of the furniture of the tabernacle introduced in this place.<a name=1:2083></a> We have nothing about the golden altar, nothing about the golden table.<a name=1:2084></a> The candlestick alone is before us, and that not in its covering of blue and of badgers' skins, as in chapter 4, where it, like all the rest, is seen in its travelling dress.<a name=1:2085></a> It is here seen lighted, not covered.<a name=1:2086></a> It comes in between the offerings of the princes, and the consecration of the Levites, and sheds forth its mystic light according to the commandment of the Lord.<a name=1:2087></a> Light cannot be dispensed with in the wilderness, and therefore the golden candlestick must be stripped of its covering, and allowed to shine in testimony for God, which, be it ever remembered, is the grand object of everything, whether it be the offering of our <i>substance</i>, as in the case of the princes; or the dedication of our <i>persons</i>, as in the case of the Levites.<a name=1:2088></a> It is only in the light of the sanctuary that the true worth of anything or any one can be seen.<a name=1:2089></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the moral order of the whole of this part of our book is striking and beautiful; indeed it is divinely perfect.<a name=1:2090></a> Having read, in chapter 7, the lengthened statement of the princes' liberality, we, in our wisdom, might suppose that the next thing in order would be the consecration of the Levites, thus presenting, in unbroken connection, "our persons and offerings.<a name=1:2091></a>" But no.<a name=1:2092></a> The Spirit of God causes the light of the sanctuary to intervene, in order that we may learn, in it, the true object of all liberality and service, in the wilderness.<a name=1:2093></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there not lovely moral appropriateness in this?<a name=1:2094></a> Can any spiritual reader fail to see it?<a name=1:2095></a> Why have we not the golden altar, with its cloud of incense, here?<a name=1:2096></a> Why not the pure table, with its twelve loaves?<a name=1:2097></a> Because neither of these would have the least moral connection with what goes before, or what follows after; But the golden candlestick stands connected with both, inasmuch as it shows us that all liberality and all work must be viewed in the light of the sanctuary, in order to ascertain its real worth.<a name=1:2098></a> This is a grand wilderness lesson, and it is taught us here as blessedly as type can teach us.<a name=1:2099></a> In our progress through the Book of Numbers, We have just read the account of the large-hearted liberality of the great heads of the congregation, on the occasion of the dedication of the altar; and we are about to read the record of the consecration of the Levites; but between the one and the other, the inspired penman pauses, in order to let the light of the sanctuary shine on both.<a name=1:2100></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is divine order.<a name=1:2101></a> It is, we are bold to say, one of the ten thousand illustrations which lie scattered over the surface of scripture, tending to demonstrate the divine perfectness of the volume, as a whole, and of each book, section, and paragraph therein.<a name=1:2102></a> And we are glad -- intensely glad to point out these precious illustrations to our reader, as we pass along in his company.<a name=1:2103></a> we consider we are doing him good service herein; and, at the same time, presenting our humble tribute of praise to that precious book which our Father has graciously penned for us.<a name=1:2104></a> Well indeed we know it does not need our poor testimony, nor that of any mortal pen or mortal tongue.<a name=1:2105></a> But still it is our joy to render the testimony, in the face of the enemy's manifold but futile attacks upon its inspiration.<a name=1:2106></a> The true source and character of all such attacks will become more and more manifest, as we become more deeply, livingly, and experimentally acquainted with the infinite depths and divine perfections of the Volume.<a name=1:2107></a> And hence it is that the internal evidences of holy scripture -- its powerful effect upon ourselves, no less than its intrinsic moral glories -- its ability to judge the very roots of character and conduct, no less than its admirable structure, in all its parts -- are the most powerful arguments in defence of its divinity.<a name=1:2108></a> A book that exposes me to myself -- that tells me all that is in my heart -- that lays bare the very deepest moral springs of my nature -- that judges me thoroughly, and at the same time reveals to me One who meets my every need -- such a book carries its own credentials with it.<a name=1:2109></a> It craves not, and needs not, letters of commendation from men.<a name=1:2110></a> It stands in no need of his favour, in no dread of his wrath.<a name=1:2111></a> It has often occurred to as that were we to reason about the Bible as the woman of Sychar reasoned about our Lord, we should reach as sound a conclusion about it as she reached about Him.<a name=1:2112></a> "Come," said this simple and happy reasoner, "see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<a name=1:2113></a>" May we not, with equal force of reasoning, say, "Come, see a book which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the word of God?<a name=1:2114></a>" Yes, truly; and not only so, but we may argue, <i>a fortiori</i>, inasmuch as the book of God not only tells us all that ever we did, but all we think, and all we say, and all we are.<a name=1:2115></a> see Romans 3: 10-18; Matthew 15: 19.<a name=1:2116></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But is it that we despise external evidences?<a name=1:2117></a> Far from it.<a name=1:2118></a> We delight in them, We value every argument and every evidence calculated to strengthen the foundations of the heart's confidence in the divine inspiration of holy scripture; and, most assuredly, we have abundance of such material.<a name=1:2119></a> The very history of the book itself, with all its striking facts, furnishes a broad tributary stream to swell the tide of evidence.<a name=1:2120></a> The history of its composition; the history of its preservation; the history of its translation from tongue to tongue; the history of its circulation throughout earth's wide domain -- in a word, its entire history," surpassing fable, and yet true," forms a powerful argument in defence of its divine origin.<a name=1:2121></a> Take, for example, that one fact of most commanding interest, namely, its having been kept for over a thousand years, in the custody of those who would have gladly consigned it, if they could, to eternal oblivion.<a name=1:2122></a> Is not this a telling fact?<a name=1:2123></a> Yes; and there are many such facts in the marvellous history of this peerless, priceless Volume.<a name=1:2124></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But after allowing as wide a margin as may be desired, in the which to insert the value of external evidences, we return, with unshaken decision, to our statement, that the internal evidences -- the proofs to be gleaned from the book itself -- form as powerful a defence as can be erected with which to stem the tide of sceptical and infidel opposition.<a name=1:2125></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall not, however, pursue any further this line of thought into which we have been led, while contemplating the remarkable position assigned to the golden candlestick, in the Book of Numbers.<a name=1:2126></a> We felt constrained to say thus much in testimony to our most precious Bible, and having said it, we shall return to our chapter, and seek to gather up the instruction contained in its opening paragraph.<a name=1:2127></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, when thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.<a name=1:2128></a>" Those "seven lamps" express the light of the Spirit in testimony.<a name=1:2129></a> They were connected with the beaten shaft of the candlestick which typifies Christ, who, in His Person and work, is the foundation of the Spirit's work in the Church.<a name=1:2130></a> All depends upon Christ.<a name=1:2131></a> Every ray of light in the Church, in the individual believer, or in Israel by and by, all flows from Christ.<a name=1:2132></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor is this all we learn from our type.<a name=1:2133></a> "The seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.<a name=1:2134></a>" Were we to clothe this figure in New Testament language, we should quote our Lord's words when He says to us, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<a name=1:2135></a>" (Matthew 5: 16) Wherever the true light of the Spirit shines it will always yield a clear testimony to Christ.<a name=1:2136></a> It will call attention not to itself, but to Him; and this is the way to glorify God.<a name=1:2137></a> "The seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.<a name=1:2138></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a great practical truth for all Christians.<a name=1:2139></a> The very finest evidence which can be afforded of true spiritual work is that it tends directly to exalt Christ.<a name=1:2140></a> If attention be sought for the work or the workman, the light has become dim, and the minister of the sanctuary must use the snuffers.<a name=1:2141></a> It was Aaron's province to light the lamps; and he it was who trimmed them likewise.<a name=1:2142></a> In other words, the light which, as Christians, we are responsible to yield, is not only founded upon Christ, but maintained by Him, from moment to moment, throughout the entire night.<a name=1:2143></a> Apart from Him we can do nothing.<a name=1:2144></a> The golden shaft sustained the lamps; the priestly hand supplied the oil and applied the snuffers.<a name=1:2145></a> It is all <i>in</i> Christ, <i>from</i> Christ, and <i>by</i> Christ.<a name=1:2146></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And more, it is all <i>to</i> Christ.<a name=1:2147></a> Wherever the light of the Spirit -- the true light of the sanctuary -- has shone, in this wilderness world, the object of that light has been to exalt the name of Jesus.<a name=1:2148></a> 'Whatever has been done by the Holy Ghost, whatever has been said, whatever has been written, has had for its aim the glory of that blessed One.<a name=1:2149></a> And we may say with confidence, that whatever has not that tendency -- that aim, is not of the Holy Ghost, be it what it may.<a name=1:2150></a> There may be an immense amount of work done, a great deal of apparent result reached, a quantity of that which is calculated to attract human attention, and elicit human applause, and yet not one ray of light from the golden candlestick.<a name=1:2151></a> And why?<a name=1:2152></a> Because attention is sought for the work, or for those engaged in it.<a name=1:2153></a> Man and his doings and sayings are exalted, instead of Christ.<a name=1:2154></a> The light has not been produced by the oil which the hand of the great High Priest supplies; and, as a consequence, it is false light.<a name=1:2155></a> It is a light which shines not over against the candlestick, but over against the name or the acting's of some poor mortal.<a name=1:2156></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is most solemn, and demands our deepest attention.<a name=1:2157></a> There is always the utmost danger when a man or his work becomes remarkable.<a name=1:2158></a> He may be sure Satan is gaining his object, when attention is drawn to anything or to any one but the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=1:2159></a> A work may be commenced in the greatest possible simplicity, but through lack of holy watchfulness and spirituality on the part of the workman, he himself, or the results of his work, may attract general attention, and he may fall into the snare of the devil.<a name=1:2160></a> Satan's grand and ceaseless object is to dishonour the Lord Jesus; and if he can do this by what seems to be Christian service, he has achieved all the greater victory for the time.<a name=1:2161></a> He has no objection to work, as such, provided he can detach that work from the name of Jesus.<a name=1:2162></a> He will even mingle himself, if he can, with the work; he will present himself amongst the servants of Christ, as he once presented himself amongst the sons of God; but his object is ever one and the same, namely, to dishonour the Lord.<a name=1:2163></a> He permitted the damsel, in Acts 16 to bear testimony to Christ's servants, and say, "These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.<a name=1:2164></a>" But this was simply with a view to ensnare: those servants and mar their work.<a name=1:2165></a> He was defeated, however, because the light that emanated from Paul and Silas was the genuine light, of the sanctuary, and it shone only for Christ.<a name=1:2166></a> They sought not a name for themselves; and, inasmuch as it was to them and not to their Master that the damsel bore witness, they refused the witness, and chose rather to suffer for their Master's sake than to be exalted at His expense.<a name=1:2167></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a fine example for all the Lord's workmen.<a name=1:2168></a> And if we turn, for an instant to Acts 3 we shall find another very striking illustration.<a name=1:2169></a> There the light of the sanctuary shone out in the healing of the lame man, and when attention was drawn, <i>unsought</i>, to the workmen, we find Peter and John, at once, with holy jealousy, retiring behind their glorious Master and giving all the praise to Him.<a name=1:2170></a> "And, as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them, in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.<a name=1:2171></a> And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?<a name=1:2172></a> or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by <i>our own</i> power or holiness we had made this man to walk?<a name=1:2173></a> The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His Son Jesus.<a name=1:2174></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have, in very deed, "the seven lamps giving their light over against the candlestick;" or, in other words, the sevenfold or perfect display of the Spirit's light in distinct testimony to the name of Jesus.<a name=1:2175></a> "Why," said these faithful vessels of the Spirit's light, "look ye so earnestly on <i>us</i>?<a name=1:2176></a>" No need of the snuffers here.<a name=1:2177></a> The light was undimmed.<a name=1:2178></a> It was, no doubt, an occasion which the apostles might have turned to their own account, had they been so disposed.<a name=1:2179></a> It was a moment in the which they might have surrounded their own names with a halo of glory.<a name=1:2180></a> They might have raised themselves to a pinnacle of fame, and drawn around them the respect and veneration of wondering, if not worshipping, thousands.<a name=1:2181></a> But had they done so, they would have robbed their Master; falsified the testimony; grieved the Holy Ghost, and brought down upon themselves the just judgement of Him who will not give His glory to another.<a name=1:2182></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, no; the seven lamps were shining brightly in Jerusalem, at this interesting moment.<a name=1:2183></a> The true candlestick was in Solomon's porch just then, and not in the temple.<a name=1:2184></a> At least the seven lamps were there, and doing their appointed work most blessedly.<a name=1:2185></a> Those honoured servants sought no glory for themselves; yea, they instantly put forth all their energies in order to avert the wondering gaze of the multitude from themselves, and fix it upon the only worthy One, who, though He had passed into the heavens, was still working by His Spirit on earth.<a name=1:2186></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many other illustrations might be drawn from the pages of the Acts of the Apostles; but the above will suffice to impress upon our hearts the great practical lesson taught in the golden candlestick, with its seven lamps.<a name=1:2187></a> We are deeply sensible of our need of the lesson at this very moment.<a name=1:2188></a> There is always a danger of the work and the workman being more the object than the Master.<a name=1:2189></a> Let us be on our guard against this.<a name=1:2190></a> It is a sad evil.<a name=1:2191></a> It grieves the blessed Spirit, who ever labours to exalt the name of Jesus.<a name=1:2192></a> It is offensive to the Father, who would ever be sounding in our ears, and deep down in our hearts, those words heard, from an open heaven, on the mount of transfiguration: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him.<a name=1:2193></a>" It is in the most direct and positive hostility to the mind of heaven, where every eye is fixed on Jesus, every heart occupied with Jesus, and where the one eternal, universal, unanimous cry shall be, "<i>Thou art worthy</i>.<a name=1:2194></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us think of all this -- think deeply -- think habitually; that so we may shrink from everything bordering upon, or savouring of, the exaltation of man -- of self -- our doings and sayings and thinkings.<a name=1:2195></a> May we all more earnestly seek the quiet, shady, unobtrusive path where the spirit of the meek and lowly Jesus will ever lead us to walk and serve.<a name=1:2196></a> In a word, may we so abide in Christ, so receive from Him, day by day, and moment by moment, the pure oil, that our light may shine, without our thinking of it, to His praise, in whom alone we have ALL, and apart from whom we can do absolutely NOTHING.<a name=1:2197></a>

		Has this no voice for us!<a name=1:2290></a> Assuredly it has.<a name=1:2291></a> we must ever remember, as we pass along through the pages of this marvellous Book of Numbers, that the things which happened unto Israel are our types, and that it is, at once, our duty and our privilege to hang over these types and seek to understand the holy lessons which they are designed of God to teach.<a name=1:2292></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then are we to learn from the regulations with respect to the Passover, in the second month!<a name=1:2293></a> Why was Israel so specially enjoined not to omit a single rite or ceremony on that particular occasion?<a name=1:2294></a> Why is it that, in this ninth chapter of Numbers, the directions for the second month are much more minute than those for the first?<a name=1:2295></a> It is not surely that the ordinance was more important in the one case than in the other, for its importance, in God's judgement, was ever the same.<a name=1:2296></a> Neither is it that there was a shade of difference in the order, in either case, for that, too, was ever the same.<a name=1:2297></a> Still the fact must strike the reader who ponders the chapter before us, that where reference is made to the celebration of the Passover in the first month, we simply read the words, "according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.<a name=1:2298></a>" But, on the other hand, when reference is made to the second month, we have a most minute statement of what those rites and ceremonies were: "They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<a name=1:2299></a> They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it.<a name=1:2300></a>" Compare verse 3 with 11, 12.<a name=1:2301></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What, we ask, does this plain fact teach us?<a name=1:2302></a> We believe it teaches us, most distinctly, that we are never to lower the standard, in the things of God, because of failure and weakness on the part of God's people; but rather, on that very account, to take special pains to hold the standard up, in all its divine integrity.<a name=1:2303></a> No doubt, there should be the deep sense of failure -- the deeper the better; but God's truth is not to be surrendered.<a name=1:2304></a> We can always reckon, with confidence, upon the resources of divine grace, while seeking to maintain, with unwavering decision, the standard of divine truth.<a name=1:2305></a>

		Let us seek to keep this ever in the remembrance of the thoughts of our hearts.<a name=1:2306></a> We are in danger, on the one hand, of forgetting the fact that failure has come in -- yes, gross failure, unfaithfulness, and sin.<a name=1:2307></a> And, on the other hand, we are in danger of forgetting, in view of that failure, the unfailing faithfulness of God, in spite of everything.<a name=1:2308></a> the professing Church has failed, and become a perfect ruin; and not only so, but we ourselves have individually failed and helped on the ruin.<a name=1:2309></a> We should feel all this -- feel it deeply -- feel it constantly.<a name=1:2310></a> We should ever bear upon our spirits before our God the deep and heart-subduing consciousness of how sadly and how shamefully we have behaved ourselves in the house of God.<a name=1:2311></a> It would be adding immensely to our failure were we ever to forget that we have failed.<a name=1:2312></a> The most profound humility and the deepest brokenness of spirit become us in the remembrance of all this; and these inward feelings and exercises will surely express themselves in a lowly walk and carriage in the midst of the scene in which we move.<a name=1:2313></a>

		These are, pre-eminently, lessons for the wilderness -- lessons for this very day -- lessons for us.<a name=1:2325></a> They are suggested, very forcibly, by the inspired record of the Passover in the second month -- a record peculiar to the Book of Numbers -- the great wilderness book.<a name=1:2326></a> It is in the wilderness that human failure comes so fully out; and in the wilderness the infinite resources of divine grace are displayed.<a name=1:2327></a> But once more, let us reiterate the statement and may it be engraved, in characters deep and broad, on our hearts -- the richest provisions of divine grace and mercy afford no warrant whatever for lowering the standard of divine truth.<a name=1:2328></a> If any had pleaded defilement or distance as an excuse for not keeping the Passover, or for keeping it otherwise than as God had enjoined, he would, most assuredly, have been cut off from the congregation.<a name=1:2329></a> And so with us, if we consent to surrender any truth of God, because failure has come in -- if we, in sheer unbelief of heart, give up God's standard, and abandon God's ground -- if we draw a plea from the condition of things around us to shake off the authority of God's truth over the conscience, or its formative influence upon our conduct and character -- it is very evident that our communion is suspended.<a name=1:2330></a><a href="#1:f9"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++</sup></a>

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f9"><sup>+++++++++</sup></a>Let it be noted here once for all, that the cutting off of any one from the congregation of Israel, answers to the suspension of a believer's communion because of unjudged sin.

	<div class="paragraph">
		We would gladly pursue this great practical line of truth somewhat further, but we must forbear, and close this part of our subject by quoting for our reader the remainder of this wilderness record concerning the Passover.<a name=1:2331></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the same soul shall be cat off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.<a name=1:2332></a> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the Passover unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the Passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.<a name=1:2333></a>" Verses 13, 14.<a name=1:2334></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wilful neglect of the Passover would argue, on the part of the Israelite, a total want of appreciation of the benefits and blessings coming out of his redemption and deliverance from the land of Egypt.<a name=1:2335></a> The more deeply any one entered into the divine reality of that which had been accomplished on that memorable night, in the which the congregation of Israel found refuge and repose beneath the shelter of the blood, the more earnestly would he long for the return of "the fourteenth day of the first month," that he might have an opportunity of commemorating that glorious occasion; and if there was anything preventing his enjoying the ordinance in "the first month" the more gladly and thankfully would he avail himself of "the second.<a name=1:2336></a>" But the man who could be satisfied to go on from year to year, without keeping the Passover, only proved that his heart was far away from the God of Israel.<a name=1:2337></a> It were worse than vain for any one to speak of loving the God of his fathers, and of enjoying the blessings of redemption, while the very ordinance which God had appointed to set forth that redemption lay neglected from year to year.<a name=1:2338></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And may we not, to a certain extent, apply all this to ourselves, in reference to the matter of the Lord's supper?<a name=1:2339></a> Doubtless we may, and that with very much profit.<a name=1:2340></a> There is this connection between the Passover and the Lord's supper, that the former was the type, the latter the memorial, of the death of Christ.<a name=1:2341></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we read in 1 Corinthians 5.<a name=1:2342></a> "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.<a name=1:2343></a>" This sentence establishes the connection.<a name=1:2344></a> The Passover was the memorial of Israel's redemption from the bondage of Egypt; and the Lord's supper is the memorial of the Church's redemption from the heavier and darker bondage of sin and Satan.<a name=1:2345></a> Hence, as every true and faithful Israelite would surely be found keeping the Passover, in the appointed season, according to all the rites and ceremonies thereof, so will every true and faithful Christian be found celebrating the Lord's supper, in its appointed season, and according to all the principles laid down in the New Testament respecting it.<a name=1:2346></a> If an Israelite had neglected the Passover, even on one single occasion, he would have been cut off from the congregation.<a name=1:2347></a> Such neglect was not to be tolerated in the assembly of old.<a name=1:2348></a> It was instantly visited with the divine displeasure.<a name=1:2349></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, may we not ask in the face of this solemn fact, Is it nothing now -- is it a matter of no moment for Christians to neglect, from week to week, and month to month, the supper of their Lord?<a name=1:2350></a> Are we to suppose that the One who, in Numbers 9, declared that the neglecter of the Passover should be cut off, takes no account of the neglecter of the Lord's table?<a name=1:2351></a> We cannot believe it for a moment.<a name=1:2352></a> For, albeit it is not a question of being cut off from the Church of God, the body of Christ, are we, on that account, to be negligent?<a name=1:2353></a> Far be the thought.<a name=1:2354></a> Yea, rather should it have the blessed effect of stirring us up to greater diligence in the celebration of that most precious feast wherein "we do show the Lord's death till he come.<a name=1:2355></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To a pious Israelite there was nothing like the Passover, because it was the memorial of his redemption.<a name=1:2356></a> And, to a pious Christian, there is nothing like the Lord's supper, because it is the memorial of his redemption and of the death of his Lord.<a name=1:2357></a> Of all the exercises in which the Christian can engage, there is nothing more precious, nothing more expressive, nothing that brings Christ more touchingly or solemnly before his heart, than the Lord's supper.<a name=1:2358></a> He may sing about the Lord's death, he may pray about it, he may read about it, he may hear about it; but it is only in the supper that he "shows" it forth.<a name=1:2359></a> "And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.<a name=1:2360></a> Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.<a name=1:2361></a>" Luke 22: 19, 20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the feast instituted; and, when we turn to the Acts of the Apostles, we read that, "upon the first day of the week, the disciples came together to break bread.<a name=1:2362></a>" Acts 20: 7.<a name=1:2363></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the feast <i>celebrated</i>; and, lastly, when we turn to the Epistles, we read, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?<a name=1:2364></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=1:2365></a> For we, being many, are one loaf, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one loaf.<a name=1:2366></a>" (1 Corinthians 10: 16, 17) And again, "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<a name=1:2367></a> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<a name=1:2368></a> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come.<a name=1:2369></a>" 1 Corinthians 11: 23-26.<a name=1:2370></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the feast <i>expounded</i>.<a name=1:2371></a> And may we not say that, in the institution, the celebration, and the exposition, we have a threefold cord, not easily broken, to bind our souls to this most precious feast?<a name=1:2372></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How is it, then, that in the face of all this holy authority, any of God's people should be found neglecting the Lord's table?<a name=1:2373></a> Or, looking at it in another aspect, how is it that any of Christ's members can be satisfied to go on for weeks, and months, and some all their days, without ever remembering their Lord in the way of His own direct and positive appointment?<a name=1:2374></a> We are aware that some professing Christians regard this subject in the light of a return to Jewish ordinances, and as a coming down from the high ground of the Church.<a name=1:2375></a> They look upon the Lord's supper and baptism as inward spiritual mysteries; and they consider that we are departing from true spirituality in insisting upon the literal observance of these ordinances.<a name=1:2376></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To all this we very simply reply that God is wiser than we are.<a name=1:2377></a> If the Lord Christ instituted the supper; if God the Holy Ghost led the early Church to celebrate it; and if He has also expounded it unto us, who are we that we should set up Our ideas in opposition to God?<a name=1:2378></a> No doubt, the Lord's supper should be an inward spiritual mystery to all who partake of it; but it is also an outward, literal, tangible thing.<a name=1:2379></a> There is literal bread, and literal wine -- literal eating, and literal drinking.<a name=1:2380></a> If any deny this, they may, with equal force, deny that there are literal people gathered together.<a name=1:2381></a> We have no right to explain away scripture after such a fashion.<a name=1:2382></a> It is our happy and holy duty to submit to scripture, to bow down, absolutely and implicitly, to its divine authority.<a name=1:2383></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor is it merely a question of subjection to the authority of scripture.<a name=1:2384></a> It is that, most assuredly, as we have abundantly proved by quotation after quotation from the divine word; and that alone is simply sufficient for every pious mind.<a name=1:2385></a> But there is more than this.<a name=1:2386></a> There is such a thing as the response of love in the heart of the Christian, answering to the love of the heart of Christ.<a name=1:2387></a> Is not this something?<a name=1:2388></a> Ought we not to seek, in some small degree, to meet the love of such a heart?<a name=1:2389></a> If our blessed and adorable Lord has, in very deed, appointed the bread and the wine, in the supper, as memorials of His broken body and shed blood; if He has ordained that we should eat of that bread and drink of that cup, in remembrance of Him, ought we not, in the power of responsive affection, to meet the desire of His loving heart?<a name=1:2390></a> Surely no earnest Christian will question this.<a name=1:2391></a> It ought ever to be the very joy of our hearts to gather round the table of our loving Lord, and remember Him in the way of His appointment -- to show forth His death till He come.<a name=1:2392></a> It is only marvellous to think that He should seek a place in the remembrance of such hearts as ours; but so it is; and it would be sad indeed if we, on any ground, and for any reason whatsoever, should neglect that very feast with which He has linked His precious name.<a name=1:2393></a>

		The answer is as plain as a sunbeam.<a name=1:2622></a> Let us ponder it.<a name=1:2623></a> It has a lesson for us.<a name=1:2624></a> Let us apply our hearts to it.<a name=1:2625></a> the silver trumpet settled and ordered every movement for Israel of old.<a name=1:2626></a> The testimony of God ought to settle and order everything for the Church now.<a name=1:2627></a> That silver trumpet was blown by the priests of old.<a name=1:2628></a> That testimony of God is known in priestly communion now.<a name=1:2629></a> A Christian has no right to move or act apart from divine testimony.<a name=1:2630></a> He must wait upon the word of his Lord.<a name=1:2631></a> Till he gets that, he must stand still.<a name=1:2632></a> When he has gotten it, he must <i>go forward</i>.<a name=1:2633></a> God can and does communicate His mind to His militant people now, just as distinctly as He did to His people of old.<a name=1:2634></a> True, it is not now by the sound of a trumpet, or the movement of a cloud; but by His word and Spirit.<a name=1:2635></a> It is not by anything that strikes the senses that our Father guides us; But by that which acts on the heart, the conscience, and the understanding.<a name=1:2636></a> It is not by that which is natural, but by that which is spiritual, that He communicates His mind.<a name=1:2637></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us be well assured of this, that our God can and does give our hearts full certainty both as to what we should do, and what we should not do; as to where we should go, and where we should not go.<a name=1:2638></a> It seems strange to be obliged to insist upon this -- passing strange that any Christian should doubt, much less deny it.<a name=1:2639></a> And yet so it is.<a name=1:2640></a> We are often in doubt and perplexity; and some there are who are ready to deny that there can be any such thing as certainty as to the details of daily life and action.<a name=1:2641></a> This surely is wrong.<a name=1:2642></a> Cannot an earthly father communicate his mind to his child as to the most minute particulars of his conduct?<a name=1:2643></a> Who will deny this?<a name=1:2644></a> And cannot our Father communicate His mind to us, as to all our ways, from day to day Unquestionably He can; and let not the Christian reader be robbed of the holy privilege of knowing his Father's mind in reference to every circumstance of his daily life.<a name=1:2645></a>

		Are we to suppose, for a moment, that the Church of God is worse off, in the matter of guidance, than the camp in the desert?<a name=1:2646></a> Impossible.<a name=1:2647></a> How is it, then, that one often finds Christians at a loss as to their movements?<a name=1:2648></a> It must be owing to the lack of a circumcised ear to hear the sound of the silver trumpet, and of a subject will to yield a response to the sound.<a name=1:2649></a> It may, however, be said that we are not to expect to hear a voice from heaven telling us to do this or that, or to go hither or thither; nor yet to find a literal text of scripture to guide us in the minor matters of our every day history.<a name=1:2650></a> How, for example, is one to know whether he ought to visit a certain town, and remain there a certain time?<a name=1:2651></a> We reply, If the ear is circumcised, you will assuredly hear the silver trumpet.<a name=1:2652></a> Till that sounds, never stir: when it sounds, never tarry.<a name=1:2653></a> This will make all so clear, so simple, so safe, so certain.<a name=1:2654></a> It is the grand cure for doubt, hesitancy, and vacillation.<a name=1:2655></a> It will save us from the necessity of running for advice to this one and that one, as to how we should act, or where we should go.<a name=1:2656></a> and, furthermore, it will teach us that it is none of our business to attempt to control the actions or movements of others.<a name=1:2657></a> Let each one have his ear open, and his heart subject, and then, assuredly, he will possess all the certainty that God can give him, as to his every act and movement, from day to day.<a name=1:2658></a> Our ever gracious God can give clearness and decision as to everything.<a name=1:2659></a> If he does not give it, no one can.<a name=1:2660></a> If He does, no one need.<a name=1:2661></a>

		Thus much as to the beautiful institution of the silver trumpet, which we shall not pursue further now, though, as we have noticed above, it is not confined, in its application to Israel in the wilderness, but is bound up with their entire history right onward to the end.<a name=1:2662></a> Thus we have the feast of trumpets; the trumpet of the jubilee; the blowing of trumpets over their sacrifices, upon which we do not now dwell, as our immediate object is to help the reader to seize the grand idea presented in the opening paragraph of our chapter.<a name=1:2663></a> May the Holy Spirit impress upon our hearts the needed lesson of "the silver trumpets!<a name=1:2664></a>''
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now travelled, in our meditations on this precious book, the moment in the which the camp is called to more forward.<a name=1:2665></a> All is duly ordered, according to that grand regulator -- "The commandment of the Lord.<a name=1:2666></a>" Each man according to his pedigree, and each tribe according to the standard thereof, is in the divinely appointed place.<a name=1:2667></a> The Levites are at their posts, each with his own clearly defined work to do.<a name=1:2668></a> Full provision is made for the cleansing of the camp from every species of defilement; and not only so, but the lofty standard of personal holiness is unfurled, and the fruits of active benevolence are presented.<a name=1:2669></a> Then we have the golden candlestick and its seven lamps, giving forth their pure and precious light.<a name=1:2670></a> We have the pillar of fire and of cloud; and, finally, the double testimony of the silver trumpet.<a name=1:2671></a> In short, nothing is lacking to the pilgrim host.<a name=1:2672></a> A vigilant eye, a powerful hand, and a loving heart have provided for every possible contingency, so that the whole congregation in the wilderness, and each member in particular, might be "thoroughly furnished.<a name=1:2673></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is only what we might expect.<a name=1:2674></a> If God undertakes to provide for any one, or for any people, the provision, must of necessity, be perfect.<a name=1:2675></a> It is wholly impossible that God could omit any one thing needful.<a name=1:2676></a> He knows all things, and can do all things.<a name=1:2677></a> Nothing can escape His vigilant eye; nothing is beyond His omnipotent hand.<a name=1:2678></a> Hence, therefore, all those who can truly say, "The Lord is my Shepherd," may add, without hesitancy or reserve, "I shall not want.<a name=1:2679></a>'' the soul that is, in truth and reality, leaning on the arm of the living God can never -- shall never -- want any good thing.<a name=1:2680></a> The poor foolish heart may imagine a thousand wants; but God knows what we really want, and He will provide for ALL.<a name=1:2681></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, then, the camp is ready to move; but, strange to say, there is a departure from the order laid down in the opening of the book.<a name=1:2682></a> The ark of the covenant, instead of reposing in the bosom of the camp, goes in the very front.<a name=1:2683></a> In other words, Jehovah, instead of remaining in the centre of the congregation to be waited upon there, actually condescends, in His marvellous, inimitable grace, to do the work of an avant-courier, for His people.<a name=1:2684></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us see what it is that leads to this touching display of grace.<a name=1:2685></a> "And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said, I will give it you; come thou with us and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.<a name=1:2686></a> And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.<a name=1:2687></a> and he said, Leave us not, I pray thee, forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.<a name=1:2688></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we did not know something of our own hearts, and the tendency thereof to lean on the creature!<a name=1:2689></a> rather than upon the living God, we might well marvel at the above.<a name=1:2690></a> We might feel disposed to enquire, What could Moses possibly want with Hobab's eyes?<a name=1:2691></a> Was not Jehovah sufficient?<a name=1:2692></a> Did not He know the wilderness?<a name=1:2693></a> Would He suffer them to go astray?<a name=1:2694></a> What o[ the cloud and the silver trumpet?<a name=1:2695></a> were not they better than Hobab's eyes?<a name=1:2696></a> why, then, did Moses seek for human aid?<a name=1:2697></a> Alas!<a name=1:2698></a> alas!<a name=1:2699></a> We can but too well understand the reason.<a name=1:2700></a> We all know, to our sorrow and loss, the tendency of the heart to lean upon something that our eyes can see.<a name=1:2701></a> We do not like to occupy the ground of absolute dependence upon God for every step of the journey.<a name=1:2702></a> we find it hard to lean upon an unseen arm.<a name=1:2703></a> A Hobab that we can see inspires as with more confidence than the living God whom we cannot see.<a name=1:2704></a> We move on with comfort and satisfaction when we possess the countenance and help of some poor failing mortal; but we hesitate, falter, and quail when called to move on in naked faith in God.<a name=1:2705></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These statements may seem strong; but the question is, are they true?<a name=1:2706></a> Is there a Christian who reads these lines that will not freely own that it is even so?<a name=1:2707></a> We are all prone to lean upon an arm of in flesh, and that, too, in the face of a thousand and one examples of the folly of so doing.<a name=1:2708></a> We have proved, times without number, the vanity of All creature confidences, and yet we <i>will</i> confide in the creature.<a name=1:2709></a> On the other hand, we have, again and again, proved the reality of leaning upon the word and upon the arm of the living God.<a name=1:2710></a> We have found that He has never failed us, never disappointed us, nay, that He has always done exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think; and yet we are ever ready to distrust Him, ever ready to lean upon any broken reed, and betake ourselves to any broken cistern.<a name=1:2711></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is with us; But, blessed be God, His grace abounds toward us, as it did toward Israel, on the occasion to which we are now referring.<a name=1:2712></a> If Moses will look to Hobab for guidance, Jehovah will teach His Servant that He Himself is all-sufficient as a guide.<a name=1:2713></a> "and they departed from the mount of the Lord three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days' journey, <i>to search out a resting place for them</i>.<a name=1:2714></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What rich, what precious grace!<a name=1:2715></a> In place of their finding a resting-place for Him, He would find a resting place for them.<a name=1:2716></a> What a thought!<a name=1:2717></a> The mighty God, the Creator of the ends of the earth, going through the wilderness to look out for a suitable camping ground for a people who were ready, at every turn in their path, to murmur and rebel against Him!<a name=1:2718></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is our God, ever "patient, gracious, powerful, holy" -- ever rising, in the magnificence of His grace above all our unbelief and failure, and proving Himself superior, in His love, to all the barriers which our unfaithfulness would erect.<a name=1:2719></a> He, most assuredly, proved to Moses and to Israel, that He was far better as a guide than ten thousand Hobabs.<a name=1:2720></a> We are not told in this place, whether Hobab went or not.<a name=1:2721></a> He certainly refused the first appeal, and perhaps the second likewise.<a name=1:2722></a> But we are told that the Lord went with them.<a name=1:2723></a> "The cloud of the Lord was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.<a name=1:2724></a>" Blessed shelter in the wilderness!<a name=1:2725></a> Blessed, unfailing resource, in everything!<a name=1:2726></a> He went before His people to search them out a resting place, and when He had found a spot suited to their need, He halted with them, and spread His sheltering wing over them, to protect them from every foe.<a name=1:2727></a> "He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, He instructed him, He kept will as the apple of his eye.<a name=1:2728></a> As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<a name=1:2729></a>" (Deuteronomy 32: 10-12.<a name=1:2730></a>) "He spread a Cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.<a name=1:2731></a>" Psalm 105: 39.<a name=1:2732></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, then, all was provided for, according to the wisdom, power, and goodness of God.<a name=1:2733></a> Nothing was, or could be, lacking, inasmuch as God Himself was there.<a name=1:2734></a> "And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee.<a name=1:2735></a> And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.<a name=1:2736></a>"

		Hitherto we have been occupied, in our study of this book, with God's mode of ordering and providing for His people in the wilderness.<a name=1:2737></a> We have travelled over the first ten chapters and seen in them the illustration of the wisdom, goodness, and forethought of Jehovah, the God of Israel.<a name=1:2738></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, now, we reach a point at which dark clouds gather round us.<a name=1:2739></a> Up to this, God and His actings have been before us; But, now, we are called to contemplate man and his miserable ways.<a name=1:2740></a> This is ever sad and humiliating.<a name=1:2741></a> man is the same everywhere.<a name=1:2742></a> In Eden, in the restored earth, in the wilderness, in the land of Canaan, in the Church, in the Millennium, man is proved to be a total failure.<a name=1:2743></a> the very moment he moves, he breaks down.<a name=1:2744></a> Thus, in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 God is seen acting as Creator; everything is done and ordered in divine perfection, and man is placed in the scene to enjoy the fruit of divine wisdom, goodness, and power.<a name=1:2745></a> But in Genesis 3 all is changed.<a name=1:2746></a> The moment man acts, it is to disobey and bring in ruin and desolation.<a name=1:2747></a> So after the deluge, when the earth had passed through that deep and dreadful baptism, and when man again takes his place therein, he exposes himself, and proves that, so far from being able to subdue and govern the earth, he cannot even govern himself.<a name=1:2748></a> (Genesis 9) Hardly had Israel been brought out of Egypt, when they made the golden calf.<a name=1:2749></a> No sooner had the priesthood been set up, than the sons of Korah offered strange fire.<a name=1:2750></a> Directly Saul was made king, he proved wilful and disobedient.<a name=1:2751></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also when we turn to the pages of the New Testament, we find the same thing.<a name=1:2752></a> No sooner is the Church set up and adorned with Pentecostal gifts, than we hear the sad accents of murmuring and discontent.<a name=1:2753></a> In short, man's history, from first to Last, here, there, and everywhere, is marked with failure.<a name=1:2754></a> There is not so much as a single exception from Eden down to the close of the millennial day.<a name=1:2755></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to consider this solemn and weighty fact, and to give it a deep place in the heart.<a name=1:2756></a> It is eminently calculated to correct all false notions as to man's real character and condition.<a name=1:2757></a> It is well to bear in mind that the awful sentence which struck terror into the heart of the voluptuous king of Babylon has, in point of fact, been passed upon the entire human race, and to" each individual son and daughter of fallen Adam, namely, "<i>Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting</i>.<a name=1:2758></a>" Has the reader fully accepted this sentence against himself?<a name=1:2759></a> This is a serious inquiry.<a name=1:2760></a> We feel imperatively called to press it home.<a name=1:2761></a> Say, reader, art thou one of Wisdom's children?<a name=1:2762></a> Dost thou justify God and condemn thyself?<a name=1:2763></a> Hast thou taken thy place as a self-destroyed, guilty, hell-deserving sinner?<a name=1:2764></a> If so, Christ is for thee.<a name=1:2765></a> He died to put away sin, and to bear your many sins.<a name=1:2766></a> Only trust him and all He is and has is thine.<a name=1:2767></a> He is thy wisdom, thy righteousness, thy sanctification, and thy redemption.<a name=1:2768></a> All who simply and heartily believe in Jesus have passed clean off the old ground of guilt and condemnation, and are seen by God on the new ground of eternal life and divine righteousness.<a name=1:2769></a> They are accepted in the risen and victorious Christ.<a name=1:2770></a> As he is, so are we in this world.<a name=1:2771></a>" 1 John 4: 17.<a name=1:2772></a>

		We would earnestly entreat the reader not to rest until this most momentous question is clearly and thoroughly settled in the light of God's own word and presence.<a name=1:2773></a> we pray that God the Holy Ghost may deeply exercise the heart and conscience of the unconverted and undecided reader, and lead such to the Saviour's feet.<a name=1:2774></a>

		"And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord; and the Lord heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.<a name=1:2776></a> And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched.<a name=1:2777></a> And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt among them.<a name=1:2778></a> And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?<a name=1:2779></a> we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.<a name=1:2780></a> But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.<a name=1:2781></a>"

		Here the poor human heart lets itself thoroughly out.<a name=1:2782></a> Its tastes and its tendencies are made manifest.<a name=1:2783></a> The people sigh after the land of Egypt, and cast back wistful looks-after its fruits and its fleshpots.<a name=1:2784></a> They do not say anything about the lash of the taskmaster, and the toil of the brick-kilns.<a name=1:2785></a> There is total silence as to these things.<a name=1:2786></a> Nothing is remembered now, save those resources by which Egypt had ministered to the lusts of nature.<a name=1:2787></a> How often is this the case with us!<a name=1:2788></a> When once the heart loses its freshness in the divine life -- when heavenly things begin to lose their savour -- when first love declines -- when Christ ceases to be a satisfying and altogether precious portion for the soul -- when the word of God and prayer lose their charm and become heavy, dull, and mechanical; then the eye wanders back toward the world, the heart follows the eye, and the feet follow the heart.<a name=1:2789></a> We forget, at such moments, what the world was to us when we were in it and of it.<a name=1:2790></a> We forget what toil and slavery, what misery and degradation, we found in the service of sin and of Satan, and think only of the gratification and ease, the freedom from those painful exercises, conflicts, and anxieties which attend upon the wilderness path of God's people.<a name=1:2791></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is most sad, and should lead the soul into the most profound self-judgement.<a name=1:2792></a> It is terrible when those who have set out to follow the Lord begin to grow weary of the way and of God's provision.<a name=1:2793></a> How dreadful must those words have sounded in the ear of Jehovah, "But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.<a name=1:2794></a>" Ah!<a name=1:2795></a> Israel, what more didst thou need?<a name=1:2796></a> Was not that heavenly food enough for thee!<a name=1:2797></a> Couldst thou not live upon that which the hand of thy God had provided for thee?<a name=1:2798></a>

		But we must return to our chapter, and in so doing we call the readers attention to an expression full of weighty admonition for us: "And the <i>mixed multitude</i> that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again.<a name=1:2873></a>" There is nothing more damaging to the cause of Christ or to the souls of His people than association with men of <i>mixed</i> principles.<a name=1:2874></a> It is very much more dangerous than having to do with open and avowed enemies.<a name=1:2875></a> Satan knows this well, and hence his constant effort to lead the Lord's people to link themselves with those who are only half and half; or, on the other hand, to introduce spurious materials-false professors, into the midst of those who are seeking, in any measure, to pursue a path of separation from the world.<a name=1:2876></a> We have repeated allusions to this special character of evil, in the New Testament.<a name=1:2877></a> We have it both prophetically in the Gospels, and historically in the: Acts and in the Epistles.<a name=1:2878></a> Thus we have the tares and the leaven in Matthew 13.<a name=1:2879></a> Then in the Acts we find persons attaching themselves to the assembly who were like the "mixed multitude'' of Numbers 11.<a name=1:2880></a> And, finally, we have apostolic reference to spurious materials introduced by the enemy for the purpose of corrupting the testimony and subverting the souls of God's people.<a name=1:2881></a> Thus the apostle Paul speaks of "false brethren unawares brought in.<a name=1:2882></a>" (Galatians 2: 4) Jude also speaks of "certain men crept in unawares.<a name=1:2883></a>" Verse 4.<a name=1:2884></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From all this we learn the urgent need of vigilance on the part of God's people; and not only of vigilance, but also of absolute dependence upon the Lord, who alone can preserve them from the entrance in of false materials, and keep them free from all contact with men of mixed principles and doubtful character.<a name=1:2885></a> "the mixed multitude" is sure to "fall a lusting," and the people of God are in imminent danger of being drawn away from their proper simplicity, and of growing weary of the heavenly manna -- their proper food.<a name=1:2886></a> What is needed is, plain decision for Christ; thorough devotedness to Him and to His cause.<a name=1:2887></a> Where a company Of believers are enabled to go on in whole-heartedness for Christ and in marked separation from this present world, there is not so much danger of persons of equivocal character seeking a place among them; though doubtless Satan will always seek to mar the testimony by the introduction of hypocrites.<a name=1:2888></a> Such persons do obtain an entrance, and then by their evil ways bring reproach on the Lord's name.<a name=1:2889></a> Satan knew full well what he was doing, when he led the mixed multitude to attach themselves to the congregation of Israel.<a name=1:2890></a> It was not all at once that the effect of this admixture was made manifest.<a name=1:2891></a> The people had come forth with a high hand; they had passed through the Red Sea, and raised the song of victory on its banks.<a name=1:2892></a> All looked bright and promising; but "the mixed multitude" were there, notwithstanding, and the effect of their presence was very speedily made apparent.<a name=1:2893></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is ever, in the history of God's people.<a name=1:2894></a> We may notice, in those great spiritual movements which have taken place from age to age, certain elements of decay which, at the first, were hidden from view by the flowing tide of grace and <i>energy</i>; but when that tide began to ebb, then those elements made their appearance.<a name=1:2895></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is very serious, and calls for much holy watchfulness.<a name=1:2896></a> It applies to individuals just as forcibly as to the people of God collectively.<a name=1:2897></a> In our early moments, our young days, when zeal and freshness characterised us, the spring tide of grace rose so blessedly that many things were allowed to escape unjudged, which were, in reality, seeds flung into the ground by the enemy's hand, and which, in due season, are sure to germinate and fructify.<a name=1:2898></a> Hence it follows that both assemblies of Christians and individual Christians should ever be on the watch tower -- ever keeping jealous guard lest the enemy gain an advantage in this matter.<a name=1:2899></a> Where the heart is true to Christ, all is sure to come right in the end.<a name=1:2900></a> Our God is so gracious, He takes care of us and preserves us from a thousand snares.<a name=1:2901></a> May we learn to trust him and to praise Him!<a name=1:2902></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have further lessons to draw from the weighty section which lies open before us.<a name=1:2903></a> Not only have we to contemplate failure on the part of the congregation of Israel; but even Moses himself is seen faltering and almost sinking beneath the weight of his responsibility.<a name=1:2904></a> "And Moses said unto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?<a name=1:2905></a> and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?<a name=1:2906></a> Have I conceived all this people?<a name=1:2907></a> have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<a name=1:2908></a> Whence should I have flesh to give unto, all this people?<a name=1:2909></a> for they weep unto me, saying, Give as flesh, that we may eat; I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.<a name=1:2910></a> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.<a name=1:2911></a>" Verses 11-15.<a name=1:2912></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is truly wonderful language.<a name=1:2913></a> It is not that we would think for a moment of dwelling upon the failures and infirmities of so dear and so devoted a servant as Moses.<a name=1:2914></a> Far be the thought.<a name=1:2915></a> It would ill become us to comment upon the actings or the sayings of one of whom the Holy Ghost has declared that "he was faithful in all his house.<a name=1:2916></a>" (Hebrews 3: 2) Moses, like all the Old Testament saints, has taken his place amongst the "Spirits Of just men made perfect," and every inspired Allusion to him throughout the pages of the New Testament tends only to put honour upon him, and to set him forth as a most precious vessel.<a name=1:2917></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But still we are bound to ponder the inspired history now before us -- history penned by Moses himself.<a name=1:2918></a> True it is -- blessedly true -- that the defects and failures of God's people, in Old Testament times, are not commented upon in the New Testament; yet are they recorded, with faithful accuracy, in the Old; and wherefore?<a name=1:2919></a> Is it not for our learning?<a name=1:2920></a> Unquestionably.<a name=1:2921></a> "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<a name=1:2922></a>" Romans 15: 4.<a name=1:2923></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then are we to learn from the remarkable outburst of feeling recorded in Numbers 11: 11-15?<a name=1:2924></a> We learn this at least, that it is the wilderness that really brings out what is in the very best of us.<a name=1:2925></a> It is there we prove what is in our hearts.<a name=1:2926></a> and, inasmuch as the Book of Numbers is, emphatically, the book of the wilderness, it is just there we might expect to find all sorts of failure and infirmity fully unfolded.<a name=1:2927></a> the Spirit of God faithfully chronicles everything.<a name=1:2928></a> He gives us men as they are; and even though it be a Moses that "speaks unadvisedly with his lips," that very unadvised speaking is recorded for our admonition and instruction.<a name=1:2929></a> Moses "was a man subject to like passions as we are;" and it is very evident that, in the portion of his history now before us, his heart sinks under the tremendous weight of his responsibilities.<a name=1:2930></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will, perhaps, be said, "No wonder his heart should sink.<a name=1:2931></a>" No wonder, surely, for his burden was far too heavy for human shoulders.<a name=1:2932></a> But the question is, was it too heavy for divine shoulders?<a name=1:2933></a> Was it really the case that Moses was called to bear the burden alone?<a name=1:2934></a> Was not the living God with him?<a name=1:2935></a> And was not He sufficient What did it matter whether God were pleased to act by one man or by ten thousand?<a name=1:2936></a> All the power, all the wisdom, all the grace, was in Him.<a name=1:2937></a> He is the fountain of all blessedness, and, in the judgement of which, it makes not one whit of difference as to the channel, or whether there is one channel, or a thousand and one.<a name=1:2938></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a fine moral principle for all the servants of Christ.<a name=1:2939></a> It is most needful for all such to remember that whenever the Lord places a man in a position of responsibility, He will both fit him for it and maintain him in it.<a name=1:2940></a> It is, of course, another thing altogether if a man <i>will</i> rush unsent into any field of work, or any post of difficulty of danger.<a name=1:2941></a> In such a case, we may assuredly look for a thorough break down, sooner or later.<a name=1:2942></a> But when God calls a man to a certain position, be will endow him with the needed grace to occupy it.<a name=1:2943></a> He never sends any one a warfare at his own charges; and therefore all we have to do is to draw upon Him for all we need.<a name=1:2944></a> This holds good in every case.<a name=1:2945></a> We can never fail if we only cling to the living God.<a name=1:2946></a> We can never run dry, if we are drawing from the fountain.<a name=1:2947></a> Our tiny springs will soon dry up; but our Lord Jesus Christ declares that, "He that believeth in me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=1:2948></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a grand lesson for the wilderness.<a name=1:2949></a> We cannot get on without it.<a name=1:2950></a> Had Moses fully understood it, he never would have given utterance to such words as these: "'Whence should <i>I</i> have flesh to give unto all this people" He would have fixed his eye only upon God.<a name=1:2951></a> He would have known that he was but on instrument in the hands of God, whose resources were illimitable.<a name=1:2952></a> assuredly, Moses could not supply that vast assembly with food even far a single day; but Jehovah could supply the need of every living thing, and supply it for ever.<a name=1:2953></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do we really believe this?<a name=1:2954></a> Does it not sometimes appear as though we doubted it?<a name=1:2955></a> Do we not sometimes feel as though <i>we</i> were to supply instead of God?<a name=1:2956></a> And then is it any marvel if we quail, and falter, and sink?<a name=1:2957></a> Well indeed might Moses say, "I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.<a name=1:2958></a>" There was only one heart that could bear with such a company, namely, the heart of that blessed One, who, when they were toiling amid the brick-kilns of Egypt, had come down to deliver them, and who, having redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy, had taken up His abode in their midst.<a name=1:2959></a> He was able to bear them, and He alone.<a name=1:2960></a> His loving heart and mighty hand were alone adequate to the task; and if Moses had been in the full power of this great truth, He would not and could not have said, "If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I play thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight and let we not see my wretchedness.<a name=1:2961></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This surely was a dark moment in the history of this illustrious servant of God.<a name=1:2962></a> It reminds us somewhat of the prophet Elijah, when he flung himself at the base of the juniper tree and entreated the Lord to take away his life.<a name=1:2963></a> How wonderful to see those two men together on the mount of transfiguration!<a name=1:2964></a> It proves, in a very marked way, that God's thoughts are not as ours, nor His ways as ours.<a name=1:2965></a> He had something better in store for Moses and Elijah than anything that they contemplated.<a name=1:2966></a> Blessed be His name, He rebukes our fears by the riches of His grace, and when our poor hearts would anticipate death and wretchedness, He gives life, victory, and glory.<a name=1:2967></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, we cannot but see, that, in shrinking from a position of weighty responsibility, Moses was really giving up a place of high dignity and holy privilege.<a name=1:2968></a> This seems most evident from the following passage.<a name=1:2969></a> "And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>that they may stand there with thee</i>.<a name=1:2970></a> And I will come down and talk with thee there; and <i>I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them</i>; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.<a name=1:2971></a>" Verses 16, 17.<a name=1:2972></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was there any additional power gained by the introduction of seventy men?<a name=1:2973></a> Not spiritual power certainly, inasmuch as it was only the spirit that was upon Moses, after all.<a name=1:2974></a> True, there were seventy men instead of one; but the multiplication of men was no increase of spiritual power.<a name=1:2975></a> It saved Moses trouble, but it lost him dignity.<a name=1:2976></a> He was henceforth to be a joint instrument instead of the sole one.<a name=1:2977></a> It may be said that Moses -- blessed servant as he was!<a name=1:2978></a> -- did not want dignity for himself, but rather sought a shady, retired, humble path.<a name=1:2979></a> No doubt; but this does not touch the question before us.<a name=1:2980></a> Moses, as we shall see presently, was the meekest man upon the face of the earth; nor do we mean even to hint that any mere man would have done better under the circumstances.<a name=1:2981></a> But then we must seek to bear away with us the great practical lesson which our chapter so impressively teaches.<a name=1:2982></a> the very best of men fail; and it seems exceedingly plain that Moses, in the eleventh chapter of Numbers, was not in the calm elevation of faith.<a name=1:2983></a> He appears, for the moment, to have lost that even balance of soul which is the sure result of finding one's centre in the living God.<a name=1:2984></a> We gather this, not merely from the fact of his tottering beneath the weight of his responsibility; but let us ponder the following paragraph.<a name=1:2985></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat?<a name=1:2986></a> for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.<a name=1:2987></a> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; but even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the Lord which is among you, and have wept before him, Saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?<a name=1:2988></a> And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.<a name=1:2989></a> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them?<a name=1:2990></a> or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?<a name=1:2991></a> And the Lord said unto Moses, Is the Lord's hand waxed short?<a name=1:2992></a> thou shalt see now whether my word will come to pass unto thee or not.<a name=1:2993></a>" Verses 18-23.<a name=1:2994></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all this we see the working of that spirit of unbelief which ever tends to limit the Holy One of Israel.<a name=1:2995></a> Could not the Almighty God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, the Creator of the ends of the earth -- could not fail provide flesh for six hundred thousand footmen?<a name=1:2996></a> Alas!<a name=1:2997></a> it is just here we all so sadly fail.<a name=1:2998></a> We do not enter, as we ought, into the reality of having to do with the living God.<a name=1:2999></a> Faith brings God into the scene, and therefore it knows absolutely nothing of difficulties; yea, it laughs at impossibilities.<a name=1:3000></a> In the judgement of faith, God is the grand answer to every question -- the grand solution of every difficulty.<a name=1:3001></a> It refers all to Him; and hence, it matters not in the least to faith, whether it be six hundred thousand or six hundred millions; it knows that God is all-sufficient.<a name=1:3002></a> It finds all its resources in Him.<a name=1:3003></a> Unbelief says, "<i>How</i> can such and such things be?<a name=1:3004></a>" It is full of "Hows"; but faith has one great answer to ten thousand "hows," and that answer is -- God.<a name=1:3005></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the Lord, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.<a name=1:3006></a> And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, <i>and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventh elders</i>; and it came to pass, that when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, And did not cease.<a name=1:3007></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The true secret of all ministry is spiritual power.<a name=1:3008></a> It is not man's genius, or man's intellect, or man's energy; but simply the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=1:3009></a> This was true in the days of Moses, and it is true now.<a name=1:3010></a> "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.<a name=1:3011></a>" (Zechariah 4: 6) It is well for all ministers to bear this ever in mind.<a name=1:3012></a> It will sustain the heart and give constant freshness to their ministry.<a name=1:3013></a> A ministry which flows from abiding dependence upon the Holy Ghost can never become barren.<a name=1:3014></a> If a man is drawing upon his own resources, he will soon run dry.<a name=1:3015></a> It matters not what his powers may be, or how extensive his reading, or how vast his stores of information; if the Holy Ghost be not the spring and power of his ministry, it must, sooner or later, lose its freshness and its effectiveness.<a name=1:3016></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How important therefore that all who minister, whether in the gospel or in the Church of God, should lean continually and exclusively on the power of the Holy Ghost!<a name=1:3017></a> He knows what souls need, and He can supply it.<a name=1:3018></a> But He must be trusted and used.<a name=1:3019></a> It will not do to lean partly on self and partly on the Spirit of God.<a name=1:3020></a> If there be anything of self-confidence, it will soon be made apparent.<a name=1:3021></a> We must really get at the bottom of all that belongs to self, if we are to be the vessels of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:3022></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not -- need we say it?<a name=1:3023></a> -- that there should not be holy diligence and earnestness in the study of God's word, and in the study too, of exercises, the trials, the conflicts, and the varied difficulties of souls.<a name=1:3024></a> Quite the reverse.<a name=1:3025></a> We feel persuaded that the more absolutely we lean, in self-emptiness, upon the mighty power of the Holy Ghost, the more diligently and earnestly we shall study both <i>the Book</i> and <i>the soul</i>.<a name=1:3026></a> It would be a fatal mistake for a man to use professed dependence upon the Spirit as a plea for neglecting prayerful study and meditation.<a name=1:3027></a> "Meditate upon these things; give thyself <i>wholly</i> to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.<a name=1:3028></a>" 1 Timothy 4: 15.<a name=1:3029></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, after all, let it ever be remembered that the holy Ghost is the ever living, never failing spring of ministry.<a name=1:3030></a> It is He alone that can bring forth in divine freshness and fullness, the treasures of God's word, and apply them, in heavenly power, to the soul's present need.<a name=1:3031></a> It is not a question of bringing forth new truth, but simply of unfolding the word itself, and bringing it to bear upon the moral and spiritual condition of the people of God.<a name=1:3032></a> This is true ministry.<a name=1:3033></a> A man may speak a hundred times on the same portion of scripture, to the same people, and, on each occasion, he may minister Christ, in spiritual freshness, to their souls.<a name=1:3034></a> And, on the other hand, a man may rack his brain to find out new subjects, and new modes of handling old themes, and, all the while, there may not be one atom of Christ or of spiritual power in his ministry.<a name=1:3035></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this holds good in reference to the evangelist, as well as to the teacher or pastor.<a name=1:3036></a> A man may be called to preach the gospel in the same place for years, and he may, at times, feel burdened by the thought of having to address the same audience, on the same theme, week after week, month after month, year after year.<a name=1:3037></a> He may feel at a loss for something new, something fresh, some variety.<a name=1:3038></a> He may wish to get away into some new sphere, where the subjects which are familiar to him will be new to the people.<a name=1:3039></a> It will greatly help such to remember that the one grand theme of the evangelist is Christ.<a name=1:3040></a> The power to handle that theme is the Holy Ghost; and the one to whom that theme is to be unfolded is the poor lost sinner.<a name=1:3041></a> Now, Christ is ever new; the power of the Spirit is ever fresh; the soul's condition and destiny ever intensely interesting.<a name=1:3042></a> Furthermore, it is well for the evangelist to bear in mind, on every fresh occasion of rising to preach, that those to whom he preaches are really ignorant of the gospel, and hence he should preach as though it were the very first time his audience had ever heard the message, and the first time he had ever delivered it.<a name=1:3043></a> For, be it remembered, the preaching of the gospel, in the divine acceptation of the phrase, is not a barren statement of mere evangelical doctrine -- a certain form of words enunciated over and over again in wearisome routine.<a name=1:3044></a> Far from it.<a name=1:3045></a> To preach the gospel is really to unfold the heart of God, the person and work of Christ; and all this by the present energy of the holy Ghost, from the exhaustless treasury of holy scripture.<a name=1:3046></a>

		May all preachers keep these things before the mind, and then it will not matter whether it be <i>one</i> preacher or <i>seventy</i>, one man in the same place for fifty years, or the same man in fifty different places in one year.<a name=1:3047></a> the question is not at all as to new men or new places, but simply and entirely as to the power of the Holy Ghost unfolding Christ to the soul.<a name=1:3048></a> Thus in the case of Moses, as recorded in our chapter, there was no increase of power.<a name=1:3049></a> It was the spirit that was upon him given to the seventy elders.<a name=1:3050></a> God can act by one man just as well as by seventy; and if He does not act, seventy are no more than one.<a name=1:3051></a> It is of the very utmost importance to keep God ever before the soul.<a name=1:3052></a> This is the true secret of power and freshness whether for the evangelist, the teacher, or any one else.<a name=1:3053></a> When a man can say, "all my springs are in God," he need not be troubled as to a sphere of work, or competency to fill it.<a name=1:3054></a> But when this is not so, we can well understand why a man should sigh for a division of labour and responsibility.<a name=1:3055></a> We may remember, at the opening of the book of Exodus, how unwilling Moses was to go into Egypt, in simple dependence upon God, and how readily he went in company with Aaron.<a name=1:3056></a> Thus it is ever.<a name=1:3057></a> We like something tangible, something that the eye can see, and the hand can handle.<a name=1:3058></a> We find it hard to endure as seeing Him who is invisible.<a name=1:3059></a> And yet the very props we lean upon often prove to be broken reeds that pierce the hand.<a name=1:3060></a> Aaron proved to be a fruitful source of sorrow to Moses; and those whom we, in our folly, imagine to be indispensable coadjutors, frequently turn out the very reverse.<a name=1:3061></a> O that we may All learn to lean, with an undivided heart, and unshaken confidence, upon the living God.<a name=1:3062></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must draw this section to a close, and ere doing so, we shall just glance for a moment at the truly excellent spirit in which Moses meets the new circumstances in which he had placed himself.<a name=1:3063></a> It is one thing to shrink from the weight of responsibility and care, and it is quite another thing to carry oneself with grace and genuine humility toward those who are called to share that weight with us.<a name=1:3064></a> The two things are totally different, and we may often see the differences strikingly illustrated.<a name=1:3065></a> In the scene now before us, Moses manifests that exquisite meekness which so specially characterised him.<a name=1:3066></a> "But there remained two of the (seventy) men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.<a name=1:3067></a> And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.<a name=1:3068></a> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.<a name=1:3069></a> and Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake?<a name=1:3070></a> Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them!<a name=1:3071></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is perfectly beautiful.<a name=1:3072></a> Moses was far removed from that wretched spirit of envy which would let no one speak but himself.<a name=1:3073></a> He was prepared, by grace, to rejoice in any and every manifestation of true spiritual power, no matter where or through whom.<a name=1:3074></a> He knew full well that there could be no right prophesying save by the power of the Spirit of God; and wherever that power was exhibited, who was he that he should seek to quench or hinder?<a name=1:3075></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Would there were more of this excellent spirit!<a name=1:3076></a> May we each cultivate it!<a name=1:3077></a> May we have grace to rejoice unfeignedly in the testimony and service of all the Lord's people, even though we may not see eye to eye with them, and though our mode and our measure may vary.<a name=1:3078></a> Nothing can be more contemptible than that petty spirit of envy and jealousy which will not permit a man to take an interest in any work but his own.<a name=1:3079></a> We may rest assured that where the spirit of Christ is in action in the heart, there will be the ability to go out and embrace the wide field of our blessed Master's work and all His beloved workmen: there will be the hearty rejoicing in having the work done, no matter who is the doer of it.<a name=1:3080></a> A man whose heart is full of Christ will be able to say -- and to say it without affectation, "Provided the work is done -- provided Christ is glorified -- provided souls are saved -- provided the Lord's flock is cared for and fed, it matters nothing to me who does the work.<a name=1:3081></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the right spirit to cultivate, and it stands out in bright contrast with the narrowness and self occupation which can only rejoice in work in which "<i>I, myself</i> have a prominent place.<a name=1:3082></a> may the Lord deliver us from all this, and enable us to cherish that temper of soul expressed by Moses when he said, "Enviest thou for my sake?<a name=1:3083></a> Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them?<a name=1:3084></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The closing paragraph of our chapter shows us the people in the miserable and fatal enjoyment of that for which their hearts had lusted.<a name=1:3085></a> "He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.<a name=1:3086></a>" They got what they longed for and found it death.<a name=1:3087></a> They <i>would</i> have flesh; and with the flesh came the judgement of God.<a name=1:3088></a> This is most solemn.<a name=1:3089></a> May we heed the warning!<a name=1:3090></a> The poor heart is full of vain desires and hateful lusts.<a name=1:3091></a> the heavenly manna fails to satisfy.<a name=1:3092></a> There must be Something else.<a name=1:3093></a> God allows us to have it.<a name=1:3094></a> But what then?<a name=1:3095></a> Leanness -- barrenness -- judgement!<a name=1:3096></a> O Lord, keep our hearts fixed on thyself alone and at all times!<a name=1:3097></a> Be thou the ever satisfying portion of our souls, while we tread this desert, and till we see thy face in glory!<a name=1:3098></a>

		The brief section of our book to which we now approach may be viewed in two distinct aspects; in the first place, it is typical or dispensational; and, in the second, moral or practical.<a name=1:3099></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the union of Moses with "the Ethiopian woman," we have a type of that great and marvellous mystery, the union of the Church with Christ her Head.<a name=1:3100></a> This subject has come before us in our study of the Book of Exodus; but we see it here, in a peculiar light, as that which evokes the enmity of Aaron and Miriam.<a name=1:3101></a> the sovereign actings of grace draw forth the opposition of those who stand upon the ground of natural relationship and fleshly privilege.<a name=1:3102></a> We know, from the teaching of the New Testament, that the extension of grace to the Gentiles was that which ever elicited the fiercest and most terrible hatred of the Jews.<a name=1:3103></a> They would not have it; they would not believe in it; nay, they would not even hear of it.<a name=1:3104></a> There is a very remarkable allusion to this in the eleventh chapter of Romans, where the apostle, referring to the gentiles, says," For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: even so have these [Jews] also now not believed in your mercy [or in mercy to you] that they also may obtain mercy.<a name=1:3105></a>" Verses 30, 31; see Greek.<a name=1:3106></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is precisely what we have typically presented in the history of Moses.<a name=1:3107></a> He, first of all, presented himself to Israel, his brethren according to the flesh; but they, in unbelief, rejected him.<a name=1:3108></a> They thrust him from them, and would not have him.<a name=1:3109></a> This became, in the sovereignty of God, the occasion of mercy to the stranger, for it was during the period of Moses' rejection by Israel that he formed the mystic and typical union with a Gentile bride.<a name=1:3110></a> Against this union Miriam and Aaron speak, in the chapter before us; and their opposition brings down the judgement of God.<a name=1:3111></a> Miriam becomes leprous -- a poor defiled thing -- a proper subject of mercy, which flows out to her through the intercession of the very one against whom she had spoken.<a name=1:3112></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The type is complete and most striking.<a name=1:3113></a> The Jews have not believed in the glorious truth of mercy to the Gentiles, and therefore wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.<a name=1:3114></a> But they will be brought in, by and by, on the ground of simple mercy, just as the Gentiles have come in.<a name=1:3115></a> This is very humiliating to those who sought to stand on the ground of promise and national privilege; but thus it is in the dispensational wisdom of God, the very thought of which draws forth from the inspired apostle that magnificent doxology, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=1:3116></a> how unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways past finding out!<a name=1:3117></a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord?<a name=1:3118></a> or who hath been his counselor?<a name=1:3119></a> or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?<a name=1:3120></a> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.<a name=1:3121></a> Amen.<a name=1:3122></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to the typical bearing of our chapter; Let as now look at it in its moral and practical bearing.<a name=1:3123></a> "And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.<a name=1:3124></a> and they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses?<a name=1:3125></a> hath he not spoken also by us?<a name=1:3126></a> And the Lord heard it.<a name=1:3127></a> (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.<a name=1:3128></a>) And the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=1:3129></a> And they three came out.<a name=1:3130></a> And the Lord: came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.<a name=1:3131></a> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord.<a name=1:3132></a> will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.<a name=1:3133></a> My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.<a name=1:3134></a> With him will I speak mouth to month, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?<a name=1:3135></a> And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he departed.<a name=1:3136></a> And the cloud departed-from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.<a name=1:3137></a> Verses 1-10.<a name=1:3138></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a most serious thing for any one to speak against the Lord's servant.<a name=1:3139></a> We may rest assured that God will deal with it, sooner or later.<a name=1:3140></a> In the case of Miriam, the divine judgement came down suddenly and solemnly.<a name=1:3141></a> It was a grievous wrong, yea, it was positive rebellion, to speak against the one whom God had so markedly raised up and clothed with a divine commission; and who, moreover, in the very matter of which they complained, had acted in full consonance with the counsels of God, and furnished a type of that glorious mystery which was hidden in His eternal mind, even the union of Christ and the Church.<a name=1:3142></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in any case, it is a fatal mistake to speak against the very feeblest and humblest of God's servants.<a name=1:3143></a> If the servant does wrong -- if he is in error, if he has failed in anything -- the Lord Himself will deal with him; but let the fellow servants beware how they attempt to take the matter into their hands, lest they be found like Miriam, meddling to their own hurt.<a name=1:3144></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very awful to hear, at times, the way in which people allow themselves to speak and write about Christ's servants.<a name=1:3145></a> True, these latter may give occasion; they may have made mistakes, and manifested a wrong spirit and temper; but we must confess we feel it to be a very dreadful sin against Christ to speak evil of His dear servants.<a name=1:3146></a> Surely we ought to feel the weight and solemnity of these words, "<i>Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak.<a name=1:3147></a> against my servant</i>?<a name=1:3148></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God give as grace to watch against this sore evil Let us see to it that we be not found doing that which is so offensive to Him, even speaking against those who are dear to His heart.<a name=1:3149></a> There is not a single one of God's people in whom we cannot find some good thing, provided only we look for it in the right way.<a name=1:3150></a> Let us be occupied <i>only</i> with the good; let us dwell upon that, and seek to strengthen and develop it, in every possible way.<a name=1:3151></a> And, on the other hand, if we have not been able to discover the good thing in our brother and fellow-servant; if our eye has only detected the crooked thing; if we have not succeeded in finding the vital spark amid the ashes -- the precious gem among the surrounding rubbish; if we have only seen what was of mere nature, why then let us, with a loving and delicate hand, draw the curtain of silence around our brother, or speak of him only at the throne of grace.<a name=1:3152></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also when we happen to be in company with those who indulge in the wicked practice of speaking against the Lord's people, if we cannot succeed in changing the current of the conversation, let us rise and leave the place, thus bearing testimony against that which is so hateful to Christ.<a name=1:3153></a> Let us never sit by and listen to a backbiter.<a name=1:3154></a> We may rest assured he is doing the work of the devil, and inflicting positive injury upon three distinct parties, namely, Himself, his hearer, and the subject of his censorious remarks.<a name=1:3155></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something perfectly beautiful in the way.<a name=1:3156></a> in which Moses carries himself, in the scene before us.<a name=1:3157></a> Truly he proved himself a meek man, not only in the matter of Eldad and Medad, But also in the more trying matter of Miriam and Aaron.<a name=1:3158></a> As to the former, instead of being jealous of those who were called to share his dignity and responsibility, he rejoiced in their work, and prayed that all the Lord's people might taste the same holy privilege.<a name=1:3159></a> and, as to the latter, instead of cherishing any feeling of resentment against his brother and sister, he was ready, al once, to take the place of intercession.<a name=1:3160></a> "And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.<a name=1:3161></a> Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.<a name=1:3162></a> And Moses cried unto The Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.<a name=1:3163></a>" Verses 11-13.<a name=1:3164></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here Moses breathes the spirit of His Master, and prays for those who had spoken so bitterly against him.<a name=1:3165></a> 'This was victory -- the victory of a meek man -- the victory of grace.<a name=1:3166></a> a man who knows his right place in the presence of God is able to rise above all evil speaking.<a name=1:3167></a> He is not troubled by it, save for those who practice it.<a name=1:3168></a> He can afford to forgive it.<a name=1:3169></a> He is not touchy, tenacious, or self-occupied.<a name=1:3170></a> He knows that no one can put him lower than He deserves to be; and, hence, if any speak against him, he can meekly bow his head and pass on, leaving himself and his cause in the hands of Him who judgeth righteously, and who will assuredly reward every man according to his works.<a name=1:3171></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is true dignity.<a name=1:3172></a> May we understand it somewhat better, and then we shall not be so ready to take fire if any one thinks proper to speak disparagingly of us or of our work; nay, more, we shall be able to lift up our hearts in earnest prayer for them, and thus draw down blessing on them and on our own souls.<a name=1:3173></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The few closing lines of our chapter confirm the typical or dispensational view which we have ventured to suggest.<a name=1:3174></a> "And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days?<a name=1:3175></a> Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.<a name=1:3176></a> And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.<a name=1:3177></a> And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.<a name=1:3178></a>" (verse 14-16.<a name=1:3179></a>) We may regard Miriam, thus shut out of the camp, as a figure of the present condition of the nation of Israel, who, in consequence of their implacable opposition to the divine thought of mercy to the gentile, are set aside.<a name=1:3180></a> But when the "seven days" have run their course, Israel shall be restored, on the ground of sovereign grace exercised toward them through the intercession of Christ.<a name=1:3181></a>

		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.<a name=1:3182></a> And Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the wilderness of Paran.<a name=1:3183></a>" Verses 1-3.<a name=1:3184></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order fully to understand the foregoing commandment, we must look at it in connection with a passage in the Book of Deuteronomy, where Moses, in going over the facts of Israel's marvellous history in the wilderness, reminds them of the following important and interesting circumstance: "And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-Barnea.<a name=1:3185></a> and I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.<a name=1:3186></a> Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.<a name=1:3187></a> <i>And ye came near unto me every one of you</i>, and said, <i>we will send men before us</i>, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.<a name=1:3188></a>" Deuteronomy 1: 19-22.<a name=1:3189></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now here we have the moral root of the fact stated in Numbers 13: 2.<a name=1:3190></a> It is evident that the Lord gave the commandment concerning the spies because of the moral condition of the people.<a name=1:3191></a> Had they been governed by simple faith, they would have acted on those soul-stirring words of Moses, "Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee<i>: go up and possess it</i>, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; <i>fear not, neither be discouraged</i>.<a name=1:3192></a>" There is not a single syllable about spies, in this splendid passage.<a name=1:3193></a> What does faith want of spies, when it has the word and the presence of the living God?<a name=1:3194></a> If Jehovah had given them a land, it must be worth having.<a name=1:3195></a> And had He not?<a name=1:3196></a> Yes, truly; and not only so, but He had borne testimony to the nature and character of that land in the following glowing words," For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates, a land of oil olive and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.<a name=1:3197></a>" Deut 8: 7-9.<a name=1:3198></a>

		Should not all this have sufficed for Israel?<a name=1:3199></a> Ought they not to have been satisfied with the testimony of God?<a name=1:3200></a> had not He spied out the land for them, and told them all about it?<a name=1:3201></a> And was not this enough?<a name=1:3202></a> What need of sending men to spy the land?<a name=1:3203></a> Did not God know all about it!<a name=1:3204></a> Was there a spot "from Dan to Beersheba" with which he was not perfectly acquainted?<a name=1:3205></a> Had He not selected this land and allotted it, in His own eternal counsels, for the seed of Abraham His friend?<a name=1:3206></a> Did He not know all about the difficulties?<a name=1:3207></a> and was He not able to surmount them?<a name=1:3208></a> Why, then, did they "<i>come near every one of them</i>, and say, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again!<a name=1:3209></a>"

		Ah!<a name=1:3210></a> reader, these questions come right home to our hearts.<a name=1:3211></a> they find us out, and make thoroughly manifest where we are.<a name=1:3212></a> It is not for us to sit down and coolly animadvert upon the ways of Israel in the wilderness; to point out error here, and failure there?<a name=1:3213></a> We must take all these things as types set before us for our admonition.<a name=1:3214></a> They are beacons, erected by a friendly and faithful hand, to warn us off from the dangerous shoals, quicksands, and rocks which lie along our course, and threaten our safety.<a name=1:3215></a> This, we may be sure, is the true way to read every page of Israel's history, if we would reap the profit which our God has designed for us in penning such a record.<a name=1:3216></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, it may be the reader is disposed to ask a question here.<a name=1:3217></a> "Did not the Lord expressly command Moses to send spies.<a name=1:3218></a> And if so, how was it wrong for Israel to send them?<a name=1:3219></a> True, the Lord did command Moses to send the spies, in Numbers 13; but this was in consequence of the moral condition of the people, as set forth in Deuteronomy 1.<a name=1:3220></a> We shall not understand the former unless we read it in the light of the latter.<a name=1:3221></a> we learn, most distinctly, From Deuteronomy 1: 22, that the idea of sending the spies had its origin in the heart of Israel.<a name=1:3222></a> God saw their moral condition, and He issued a command in full keeping therewith.<a name=1:3223></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the reader will turn to the opening pages of the first book of Samuel, he will find something similar in the matter of the appointment of a king.<a name=1:3224></a> The Lord commanded Samuel to hearken to the voice of the people, and make them a king.<a name=1:3225></a> (1 Samuel 8: 22) Was it that He approved of the plan?<a name=1:3226></a> Most surely not; on the contrary, He declares plainly that it was a positive rejection of Himself.<a name=1:3227></a> Why then command Samuel to appoint a king!<a name=1:3228></a> The command was given in consequence of Israel's condition.<a name=1:3229></a> They were growing weary of the position of entire dependence upon an unseen arm; and they longed for an arm of flesh.<a name=1:3230></a> They desired to be like the nations around them, and to have a king who should go out before them, and fight their battles for them.<a name=1:3231></a> Well, God gave them their request, and they were very speedily called to prove the worthlessness of their plan.<a name=1:3232></a> Their king proved a most complete failure, and they had to learn that it was an evil and a bitter thing to forsake the living God and lean on a broken reed of their own selection.<a name=1:3233></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we see the same thing in the matter of the spies.<a name=1:3234></a> There can be no question, in the mind of any spiritual person who studies the entire subject, as to the fact that the scheme of sending the spies was the fruit of unbelief.<a name=1:3235></a> A simple heart that trusted God would never have thought of such a thing.<a name=1:3236></a> What!<a name=1:3237></a> are we to send poor mortals to spy out a land which God has graciously given to us, and which He has so fully and faithfully described?<a name=1:3238></a> Far be the thought; nay, rather let us say, "It is enough; the land is the gift of God, and as such it must be good.<a name=1:3239></a> His word is enough for our hearts; we want no spies; we seek for no mortal testimony to confirm the word of the living God.<a name=1:3240></a> He has given; He has spoken; this is enough.<a name=1:3241></a>"

		But alas!<a name=1:3242></a> Israel was not in a condition to adopt such language.<a name=1:3243></a> They would send spies.<a name=1:3244></a> They wanted them, their hearts craved them: the desire for them lay in the very depths of the soul; Jehovah knew this, and hence He issued a commandment in direct reference to the moral state of the people.<a name=1:3245></a>

		The reader would do well to ponder this subject, in the light of scripture.<a name=1:3246></a> He will need to compare Deuteronomy 1 with Numbers 13.<a name=1:3247></a> It is possible he may find difficulty in judging of the true nature and moral roots of the act of sending the spies, from the fact that the thing was ultimately done in pursuance of "the commandment of the Lord.<a name=1:3248></a>" But we must ever remember that the fact of the Lord's commanding the thing to be done does not, by any means, prove that the people were right in seeking it.<a name=1:3249></a> The giving of the law at Mount Sinai; the sending of the spies; and the appointment of a king, are all proofs of this.<a name=1:3250></a> No doubt God overruled all these things for His own glory and for man's ultimate blessing; but still the law could not be viewed as the expression of the heart of God; the setting up of a king was a positive rejection of Himself; and we may say that the sending of men to spy out the land of promise proved, very distinctly, that the heart of Israel was not fully satisfied with Jehovah.<a name=1:3251></a> The whole affair was the fruit of their weakness and unbelief, though acquiesced in by God because of their condition, and overruled by Him, in His infinite goodness and unerring wisdom, for the unfolding of His ways and the display of His glory.<a name=1:3252></a> All this comes fully out as we pursue the history.<a name=1:3253></a>

		"And Moses sent them (the spies) to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain: and see the land what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein or not.<a name=1:3254></a> And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land.<a name=1:3255></a> Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.<a name=1:3256></a> So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath .<a name=1:3257></a>.<a name=1:3258></a>.<a name=1:3259></a> .<a name=1:3260></a>.<a name=1:3261></a> And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.<a name=1:3262></a> the place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.<a name=1:3263></a> And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.<a name=1:3264></a> And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the Land.<a name=1:3265></a> And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.<a name=1:3266></a>" Numbers 13: 17-27.<a name=1:3267></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, was the fullest confirmation of all that the Lord had said concerning the land -- the testimony of twelve men as to the fact that the land flowed with milk and honey -- the testimony of their own senses as to the character of the fruit of the land.<a name=1:3268></a> Furthermore, there was the telling fact that twelve men had actually been in the land, had spent forty days in travelling up and down therein, had drunk of its springs and eaten of its fruits.<a name=1:3269></a> And what, according to the judgement of faith, would have been the plain inference to be drawn from such a fact?<a name=1:3270></a> Why, simply, that the same hand which had conducted twelve men into the land could conduct the whole congregation.<a name=1:3271></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But alas!<a name=1:3272></a> the people were not governed by faith, but by dark and depressing unbelief; and even the spies themselves -- the very men who had been sent for the purpose of assuring and confirming the congregation-even they, with two brilliant exceptions, were under the power of the same God-dishonouring spirit.<a name=1:3273></a> In short, the whole scheme proved a failure.<a name=1:3274></a> The issue only made manifest the true condition of the hearts of the people.<a name=1:3275></a> Unbelief was dominant.<a name=1:3276></a> The testimony was plain enough: "We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.<a name=1:3277></a>" There was nothing whatever lacking on God's side of the question.<a name=1:3278></a> The land was all that He had said, the spies themselves being witnesses; but let us hearken to what follows.<a name=1:3279></a> "Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.<a name=1:3280></a>" Verse 28.<a name=1:3281></a>

		Thus it Is that faith ever reasons.<a name=1:3290></a> Faith reasons from God to the difficulties: it begins with Him.<a name=1:3291></a> Unbelief, on the contrary, reasons from the difficulties to God: it begins with them.<a name=1:3292></a> This makes all the difference.<a name=1:3293></a> It is not that we are to be insensible to the difficulties; neither are we to be reckless.<a name=1:3294></a> Neither insensibility nor yet recklessness is faith.<a name=1:3295></a> There are some easy-going people who seem to get along through life!<a name=1:3296></a> on the principle of taking things by the smooth handle.<a name=1:3297></a> This is not faith.<a name=1:3298></a> Faith looks the difficulties straight in the face; it is fully alive to the roughness of the handle.<a name=1:3299></a> It is not ignorant, not indifferent -- not reckless; but what?<a name=1:3300></a> IT BRINGS IN THE LIVING GOD.<a name=1:3301></a> It looks to Him; it leans on Him; it draws from Him.<a name=1:3302></a> Here lies the grand secret of its power.<a name=1:3303></a> It cherishes the calm and deep conviction that there never was a wall too high for the Almighty God -- never a city too great -- never a giant too strong.<a name=1:3304></a> In short, faith is the only thing that gives God His proper place; and, as a consequence, is the only thing that lifts the soul completely above the influences of surrounding circumstances, be they what they may.<a name=1:3305></a> Of this precious faith, Caleb was the exponent, when he said, "Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.<a name=1:3306></a>" These are the pure accents of that lively faith that glorifies God and makes nothing of circumstances.<a name=1:3307></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But alas!<a name=1:3308></a> the great majority of the spies were no more governed by this lively faith than the man who sent them; and hence, the one believer was talked down by the ten infidels.<a name=1:3309></a> "The men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people.<a name=1:3310></a>" The language of infidelity was flatly opposed to the language of faith.<a name=1:3311></a> The latter, looking at God, said," We are <i>well</i> able.<a name=1:3312></a>" The former, looking at the difficulties, said, "We are not able.<a name=1:3313></a>" Thus it was and thus it is.<a name=1:3314></a> The eyes of faith are ever covered by the living God, and therefore difficulties are not seen.<a name=1:3315></a> The eyes of unbelief are covered with the circumstances, and therefore God is not seen.<a name=1:3316></a> Faith brings in God, and therefore all is bright and easy.<a name=1:3317></a> Unbelief always shuts God out, and therefore all is dark and difficult.<a name=1:3318></a>

		What a moment was this in the history of Moses!<a name=1:3470></a> Here was what nature might well regard as a golden opportunity for him.<a name=1:3471></a> Never before and never since have we any occasion in the which a mere man had such a door open before him.<a name=1:3472></a> The enemy and his own heart might say," Now's your time.<a name=1:3473></a> You have here an offer of becoming the head and founder of a great and mighty nation -- an offer made to you by Jehovah Himself.<a name=1:3474></a> You have not sought it.<a name=1:3475></a> It is put before you by the living God, and it would be the very height of folly on your part to reject it.<a name=1:3476></a>"

		But, reader, Moses was not a self-seeker.<a name=1:3477></a> He had drunk too deeply into the spirit of Christ to seek to be anything.<a name=1:3478></a> He had no unholy ambition, no selfish aspirations.<a name=1:3479></a> He desired only God's glory and His people's good; and in order to reach those ends, he was ready, through grace, to lay himself and his interests on the altar.<a name=1:3480></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hear his marvellous reply.<a name=1:3481></a> Instead of jumping at the offer contained in the words, "I Will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they" -- instead of eagerly grasping at the golden opportunity of laying the foundation of his personal fame and fortune -- he sets himself completely aside, and replies in accents of the most noble disinterestedness: And Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou, Lord, art among this people; that thou, Lord, art seen face to face; and that thy cloud standeth over them; and that thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.<a name=1:3482></a> Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.<a name=1:3483></a>" Verses 13-16.<a name=1:3484></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here Moses takes the very highest ground.<a name=1:3485></a> He is wholly occupied about the Lord's glory.<a name=1:3486></a> He cannot endure the thought that the lustre of that glory should be tarnished in the view of the nations of the uncircumcised.<a name=1:3487></a> What though he should become a head and a founder?<a name=1:3488></a> what though future millions should look back to him as their illustrious progenitor?<a name=1:3489></a> this personal glory and greatness was only to be purchased by the sacrifice of a single ray of divine glory, -- what then Away with it all.<a name=1:3490></a> Let the name of Moses be blotted out for Ever.<a name=1:3491></a> He had said as much in the days of the <i>calf</i>; and he was ready to repeat it in the days of the <i>captain</i>.<a name=1:3492></a> In the face of the superstition and independence of an unbelieving nation, the heart of Moses throbbed <i>only</i> for the glory of God.<a name=1:3493></a> That must be guarded at all cost.<a name=1:3494></a> Come what may -- cost what it may, the glory of The Lord must be maintained.<a name=1:3495></a> Moses felt it was impossible for anything to be right if the basis were not laid firmly down in the strict maintenance of the glory of the God of Israel.<a name=1:3496></a> To think of himself made great at God's expense was perfectly insufferable to the heart of this blessed man of God.<a name=1:3497></a> He could not endure that the name which he loved so well should be blasphemed among the nations, or that it should ever be said by any one, "The Lord was not able.<a name=1:3498></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was another thing which lay near the disinterested heart of Moses.<a name=1:3499></a> He thought of the people.<a name=1:3500></a> He loved and cared for them.<a name=1:3501></a> Jehovah's glory, no doubt, stood uppermost; but Israel's blessing stood next.<a name=1:3502></a> "And now," he adds, "I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.<a name=1:3503></a> Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.<a name=1:3504></a>" Verses 17-19.<a name=1:3505></a>

		But then there is such a thing as government, as well as grace.<a name=1:3534></a> This must never be forgotten; nor must these things ever be confounded.<a name=1:3535></a> the whole book of God illustrates the distinction between grace and government; and no part of it, perhaps, more forcibly than the section which now lies open before us.<a name=1:3536></a> Grace will pardon; and grace will fill the earth with the blessed beams of divine glory; but mark the appalling movement of the wheels of government as set forth in the following burning words:" Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it.<a name=1:3537></a> But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereunto he went; and his seed shall possess it.<a name=1:3538></a> (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.<a name=1:3539></a>) To-morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.<a name=1:3540></a>" verses 22-25.<a name=1:3541></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is most solemn.<a name=1:3542></a> Instead of confiding in God, and going boldly on into the land of promise, in simple dependence upon His omnipotent arm, they provoked him by their unbelief, despised the pleasant land, and were compelled to turn back again into that great and terrible wilderness.<a name=1:3543></a> "The Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me?<a name=1:3544></a> I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.<a name=1:3545></a> Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, doubtless ye shall not come into the and concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.<a name=1:3546></a> But your little ones which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.<a name=1:3547></a> But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.<a name=1:3548></a> And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.<a name=1:3549></a> After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even Forty years; and ye shall know my breach of promise.<a name=1:3550></a> I the Lord have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die" (verses 26-33).<a name=1:3551></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such, then, was the fruit of unbelief, and such the governmental dealings of God with a people that had provoked Him by their murmurings and hardness of heart.<a name=1:3552></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the utmost importance to note here that it was unbelief that kept Israel out of Canaan, on the occasion now before us.<a name=1:3553></a> The inspired commentary in Hebrews 3 places this beyond all question.<a name=1:3554></a> "So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<a name=1:3555></a>" It might, perhaps, be said that the time was not come for Israel's entrance upon the land of Canaan.<a name=1:3556></a> The iniquity of the Amorites had not yet reached its culminating point.<a name=1:3557></a> But this is not the reason why Israel refused to cross the Jordan.<a name=1:3558></a> They knew nothing and thought nothing about the iniquity of the Amorites.<a name=1:3559></a> Scripture is as plain as possible: "They could not enter in" -- not because of the iniquity of the Amorites; not because the time was not come -- but simply "because of unbelief.<a name=1:3560></a>" They ought to have entered.<a name=1:3561></a> They were responsible to do so; and they were judged for not doing so.<a name=1:3562></a> The way was open.<a name=1:3563></a> the judgement of faith, as uttered By faithful Caleb, was clear and unhesitating: "Let us go up <i>at once</i> and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.<a name=1:3564></a>" They were as well able, at that moment, as they could ever be at any moment, inasmuch as the One who had given them the land was the spring of their ability to enter upon it and possess it.<a name=1:3565></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to see this; and to ponder it deeply.<a name=1:3566></a> There is a certain style of speaking of the counsels, purposes, and decrees of God -- of the enactments of His moral government; and of the times and seasons which he has put in His own power -- which goes far to sweep away the very foundations of human responsibility.<a name=1:3567></a> This must be carefully guarded against.<a name=1:3568></a> We must ever bear in mind that man's responsibility rests on what is revealed, not on what is secret.<a name=1:3569></a> Israel was responsible to go up at once and take possession of the land; and they were judged for not doing so.<a name=1:3570></a> Their carcasses fell in the wilderness, because they had not faith to enter the land.<a name=1:3571></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And does not this convey a solemn lesson to us?<a name=1:3572></a> Most surely.<a name=1:3573></a> How is it that we, as Christians, so fail in making good, practically, our heavenly portion?<a name=1:3574></a> We are delivered from judgement by the <i>blood</i> of the Lamb; we are delivered from this present world by the <i>death</i> of Christ; But we do not, in spirit and by faith, cross the Jordan, and take possession of our heavenly inheritance.<a name=1:3575></a> It is generally believed that Jordan is a type of death, as the end of our natural life in this world.<a name=1:3576></a> This, in one sense, is true.<a name=1:3577></a> But how was it that when Israel did, at length cross the Jordan, they had to begin to fight?<a name=1:3578></a> Assuredly, we shall not have any fighting when we actually get to heaven.<a name=1:3579></a> The spirits of those who have departed in the faith of Christ are not fighting in heaven.<a name=1:3580></a> They are not in conflict in any shape or form.<a name=1:3581></a> They are at rest.<a name=1:3582></a> They are waiting for the morning of the resurrection; but they wait in rest, not in conflict.<a name=1:3583></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, therefore, there is something more typified in Jordan than the end of an individual's life in this world.<a name=1:3584></a> We must view it as the figure of the death of Christ, in one grand aspect; just as the Red Sea is a figure of it, in another; and the blood of the paschal lamb, in another.<a name=1:3585></a> The blood of the lamb sheltered Israel from the judgement of God upon Egypt.<a name=1:3586></a> The waters of the Red Sea delivered Israel from Egypt itself and all its power.<a name=1:3587></a> But they had to cross the Jordan; they had to plant the sole of their foot upon the land of promise, and make good their place there in spite of every foe.<a name=1:3588></a> They had to fight for every inch of Canaan.<a name=1:3589></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what is the meaning of this latter?<a name=1:3590></a> Have we to fight for heaven?<a name=1:3591></a> When a Christian falls asleep, and his Spirit goes to be with Christ in paradise, is there any question of fighting?<a name=1:3592></a> Clearly not.<a name=1:3593></a> What then are we to learn from the crossing of Jordan, and the wars of Canaan?<a name=1:3594></a> Simply this, Jesus has died.<a name=1:3595></a> He has passed away out of this world.<a name=1:3596></a> He has not only died for our sins, but He has broken every link which connected us with this world; so that we are dead to the world, as well as dead to sin, and dead to the law.<a name=1:3597></a> We have, in God's sight, and in the judgement of faith, as little to do with this world as a man lying dead on the floor.<a name=1:3598></a> We are called to reckon ourselves dead to it all, and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=1:3599></a> We live in the power of the new life which we possess in union with Christ risen.<a name=1:3600></a> We belong to heaven; and it is in making good our position as heavenly men that we have to fight with wicked spirits in the heavenlies -- in the very sphere which belongs to us, and from which they have not yet been expelled.<a name=1:3601></a> If we are satisfied to "walk as men" -- to live as those who belong, to this world -- to stop short of Jordan, If we are satisfied to live as dwellers upon the earth, if we do not aim at our proper heavenly portion and position, then we shall not know anything of the conflict of Ephesians 6: 12.<a name=1:3602></a> It is seeking to live as heavenly men now on earth, that we shall enter into the meaning of that conflict which is the antitype of Israel's wars in Canaan.<a name=1:3603></a> We shall not have to fight when we get to heaven, but if we want to live a heavenly life, on the earth, if we seek to carry ourselves as those who are dead to the world, and alive to Him who went down into Jordan's cold flood for us, then, assuredly, we must fight.<a name=1:3604></a> Satan will leave no stone unturned to hinder our living in the power of our heavenly life; and hence the conflict.<a name=1:3605></a> He will seek to make us walk as those who have an earthly standing, to be citizens of this world, to contend for our rights, to maintain our rank and dignity, to give the lie, practically, to that great foundation Christian truth, that we are dead and risen with and in Christ.<a name=1:3606></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the reader will turn for a moment to Ephesians 6.<a name=1:3607></a> he will see how this interesting subject is presented by the inspired writer.<a name=1:3608></a> "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<a name=1:3609></a> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the <i>wiles</i> of the devil.<a name=1:3610></a> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood (as Israel had to do in Canaan); but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in heavenly places.<a name=1:3611></a> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<a name=1:3612></a>" Verses 10-13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have proper Christian conduct.<a name=1:3613></a> It is not here a question of the lusts of the flesh, or the fascinations of the world, though surely we have to watch against these, but "the wiles of the devil.<a name=1:3614></a>" Not his power, which is forever broken, but those subtle devices and snares by which he seeks to keep Christians from realising their heavenly position and inheritance.<a name=1:3615></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is in carrying on this conflict, that we so signally fail.<a name=1:3616></a> We do not aim at apprehending that for which we have been apprehended.<a name=1:3617></a> Many of us are satisfied with knowing that we are delivered from judgement by the blood of the Lamb.<a name=1:3618></a> We do not enter into the deep significance of the Red Sea and the river Jordan; we do not practically seize their spiritual import.<a name=1:3619></a> We walk as men, the very thing for which the apostle blamed the Corinthians.<a name=1:3620></a> We live and act as if we belonged to this world, whereas scripture teaches and our baptism expresses that we are dead to the world, even as Jesus is dead to it; and that we are risen in Him, through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead.<a name=1:3621></a> Colossians 2: 12.<a name=1:3622></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Holy Spirit lead our souls into the reality of these things.<a name=1:3623></a> May He so present to us the precious fruits of that heavenly land which is ours in Christ, and so strengthen us with His own might in the inner man, that we may boldly cross the Jordan and plant the foot upon the spiritual Canaan.<a name=1:3624></a> We live far below our privileges as Christians.<a name=1:3625></a> We allow the things that are seen to rob us of the enjoyment of those things that are unseen.<a name=1:3626></a> Oh!<a name=1:3627></a> for a stronger faith, to take possession of all that God has freely given to us in Christ.<a name=1:3628></a>

		But ah!<a name=1:3690></a> how vain to move without the living God in their midst!<a name=1:3691></a> Without Him, they could do nothing.<a name=1:3692></a> And yet, when they might have had Him, they were afraid of the Amalekites; but now they presume to face those very people without Him.<a name=1:3693></a> "Lo, we be here, and <i>will</i> go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised.<a name=1:3694></a>" This was more easily said than done.<a name=1:3695></a> an Israelite without God was no match for an Amalekite; and it is very remarkable that, when Israel refused to act in the energy of faith, when they fell under the power of a God-dishonouring unbelief, Moses points out to them the very difficulties to which they themselves had referred.<a name=1:3696></a> He tells them "<i>The Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you</i>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is full of instruction.<a name=1:3697></a> They, by their unbelief, had shut out God; and therefore it was obviously a question between Israel and the Canaanites.<a name=1:3698></a> Faith would have made it a question between God and the Canaanites.<a name=1:3699></a> This was precisely the way in which Joshua and Caleb viewed the matter when they said, "If the Lord delight in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.<a name=1:3700></a> Only rebel not ye against the Lord, <i>neither fear ye the people of the land</i>, for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and <i>the Lord is with us: fear them not</i>.<a name=1:3701></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here lay the grand secret.<a name=1:3702></a> The Lord's pleasure with His people secures victory over every foe.<a name=1:3703></a> But if he be not with them, they are as water poured upon the ground.<a name=1:3704></a> the ten unbelieving spies had declared themselves to be as grasshoppers in the presence of the giants; and Moses, taking them at their word, tells them, as it were, that grasshoppers are no match for giants.<a name=1:3705></a> If on the one hand, it be true that "according to your faith, so be it unto you;" it is also true, on the other hand, that according to your unbelief, so be it unto you.<a name=1:3706></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the people presumed.<a name=1:3707></a> They affected to be something when they were nothing.<a name=1:3708></a> And, oh!<a name=1:3709></a> how miserable to presume to move in our own strength!<a name=1:3710></a> What defeat and confusion!<a name=1:3711></a> what exposure and contempt!<a name=1:3712></a> what humbling and smashing to pieces!<a name=1:3713></a> It must be so.<a name=1:3714></a> They abandoned God in their unbelief; and He abandoned them in their vain-presumption.<a name=1:3715></a> They would not go with Him in faith; and He would not go with them in their unbelief.<a name=1:3716></a> "Nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.<a name=1:3717></a>" They went without God, and hence they fled before their enemies.<a name=1:3718></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it must ever be.<a name=1:3719></a> It is of no possible use to affect strength, to put forth lofty pretensions, to presume to be anything.<a name=1:3720></a> Assumption and affectation are worse than worthless.<a name=1:3721></a> If God be not with us, we are as the vapour of the morning.<a name=1:3722></a> But this must be learnt practically.<a name=1:3723></a> We must be brought down to the very bottom of all that is in self, so as to prove its utter worthlessness.<a name=1:3724></a> And truly it is the wilderness, with all its varied scenes, and its thousand and one exercises, that leads to this practical result.<a name=1:3725></a> There we learn what flesh is.<a name=1:3726></a> There nature comes fully out, in all its phases; sometimes full of cowardly unbelief; at other times, full of false confidence.<a name=1:3727></a> at Kadesh, refusing to go up when told to go; at Hormah, persisting in going when told not.<a name=1:3728></a> Thus it is that extremes meet in that evil nature which the writer and reader bear about, from day to day.<a name=1:3729></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is one special lesson, beloved Christian reader, which we should seek to learn thoroughly, ere we take our departure from Hormah; and it is this: There is immense difficulty in walking humbly and patiently in the path which our own failure has rendered necessary for us.<a name=1:3730></a> Israel's unbelief, in refusing to go up into the land, rendered it needful, in the governmental dealings of God, that they should turn about and wander in the wilderness for forty years.<a name=1:3731></a> To this they were unwilling to submit.<a name=1:3732></a> They kicked against it.<a name=1:3733></a> They could not bow their necks to the necessary yoke.<a name=1:3734></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How often is this the case with us!<a name=1:3735></a> We fail; we take some false step; we get into trying circumstances in consequence; and, then, instead of meekly bowing down under the hand of God, and seeking to walk with Him, in humbleness and brokenness of spirit, we grow restive and rebellious; we quarrel with the circumstances instead of judging ourselves; and we seek, in self-will, to escape from the circumstances, instead of accepting them as the just and necessary consequence of our own conduct.<a name=1:3736></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, it may happen that through weakness or failure, of one kind or another, we refuse to enter a position or path of spiritual privilege, and thereby we are thrown back in our course, and put upon a lower form in the school.<a name=1:3737></a> Then, instead of carrying ourselves humbly, and submitting, in meekness and contrition, to the hand of God, we presume to force ourselves into the position, and affect to enjoy the privilege, and put forth pretensions to power, and it all issues in the most humiliating defeat and confusion.<a name=1:3738></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things demand our most profound consideration.<a name=1:3739></a> It is a great thing to cultivate a lowly spirit, a heart content with a place of weakness and contempt.<a name=1:3740></a> God resisteth the proud, but He giveth grace to the lowly.<a name=1:3741></a> A pretentious spirit must, sooner or later, be brought down; and all hollow assumption of power must be exposed.<a name=1:3742></a> If there be not faith to take possession of the promised land, there is nothing for it but to tread the wilderness in meekness and lowliness.<a name=1:3743></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, blessed be God, we shall have Him with us in that wilderness journey, though we shall not and cannot have Him with us in our self-chosen path of pride and assumption.<a name=1:3744></a> Jehovah refused to accompany Israel into the mountain of the Amorites; but He was ready to turn about, in patient grace, and accompany them through all their desert wanderings.<a name=1:3745></a> If Israel would not enter Canaan with Jehovah, He would go back into the wilderness with Israel.<a name=1:3746></a> Nothing can exceed the grace that shines in this.<a name=1:3747></a> Had they been dealt with according to their deserts, they might, at least, have been left to wander alone through the desert.<a name=1:3748></a> But, blessed for ever be His great name, He does not deal with us after our sins, or reward us according to our iniquities.<a name=1:3749></a> His thoughts are not as our thoughts; nor are His ways as our ways.<a name=1:3750></a> Notwithstanding all the unbelief, the ingratitude, and the provocation exhibited by the people; notwithstanding that their return back into the desert was the fruit of their own conduct, yet did Jehovah, in condescending grace and patient love, turn back with them to be their travelling companion for forty long and dreary years in the wilderness.<a name=1:3751></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, if the wilderness proves what man is, it also proves what God is; and, further, it proves what faith is; for Joshua and Caleb had to return with the whole congregation of their unbelieving brethren, and remain for forty years out of their inheritance, though they themselves were quite prepared, through grace, to go up into the Land.<a name=1:3752></a> This might seem a great hardship.<a name=1:3753></a> Nature might judge it unreasonable that two men of faith should have to suffer on account of the unbelief of other people.<a name=1:3754></a> But faith can afford to wait patiently.<a name=1:3755></a> and besides, how could Joshua and Caleb complain of the protracted march, when they saw Jehovah about to share it with them?<a name=1:3756></a> Impossible.<a name=1:3757></a> They were prepared to wait for God's time; for faith is never in a hurry.<a name=1:3758></a> The faith of the servants might well be sustained by the grace of the Master.<a name=1:3759></a>

		NUMBERS 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The words with which our chapter opens are peculiarly striking, when taken in connection with the contents of chapter 14.<a name=1:3760></a> There all seemed dark and hopeless.<a name=1:3761></a> Moses had to say to the people, "<i>Go not up</i>', for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.<a name=1:3762></a>" And, again, the Lord had said to them, "as truly as I lire, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you.<a name=1:3763></a> Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness .<a name=1:3764></a>.<a name=1:3765></a>.<a name=1:3766></a> .<a name=1:3767></a>.<a name=1:3768></a>.<a name=1:3769></a> Doubtless <i>ye shall not come into the land</i> concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein .<a name=1:3770></a>.<a name=1:3771></a>.<a name=1:3772></a> .<a name=1:3773></a>.<a name=1:3774></a> As for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.<a name=1:3775></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to chapter 14.<a name=1:3776></a> But no sooner do we open the section now before us, than, just as though nothing had happened, and though all were as calm, as bright, and as certain as God could make it, we read such words as these, "The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, <i>when ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you</i>," etc.<a name=1:3777></a> This is one of the most remarkable passages in the entire of this most wonderful book.<a name=1:3778></a> Indeed there is not, in the whole compass of the book, a passage more thoroughly characteristic, not only of Numbers, but of the entire volume of God.<a name=1:3779></a> When we read the solemn sentence, "Ye shall not come into the Land," what is the plain lesson which it reads out to us?<a name=1:3780></a> The lesson, which we are so slow to learn, of man's utter worthlessness.<a name=1:3781></a> "All flesh is grass.<a name=1:3782></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, on the other hand, when we read such words as these, "When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you," what is the precious lesson which they read out to us?<a name=1:3783></a> This, assuredly, that salvation is of the Lord.<a name=1:3784></a> In the one, we learn man's failure; in the other, God's faithfulness.<a name=1:3785></a> If we look at man's side of the question, the sentence is, "Doubtless <i>ye shall not</i> come into the land.<a name=1:3786></a>'' But if we look at God's side of the question, we can reverse the matter, and say, "Doubtless <i>ye shall</i>.<a name=1:3787></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it stands in the scene now before us; and thus it stands in the whole volume of inspiration, from beginning to end.<a name=1:3788></a> Man fails; but God is faithful.<a name=1:3789></a> Man forfeits everything; but God makes good all.<a name=1:3790></a> "The things which are impossible with man are possible with God.<a name=1:3791></a>" Need we travel through the inspired canon in order to illustrate and prove this?<a name=1:3792></a> Need we refer the reader to the history of Adam, in paradise?<a name=1:3793></a> or the history of Noah, after the flood?<a name=1:3794></a> or the history of Israel, in the wilderness?<a name=1:3795></a> Israel, in the land?<a name=1:3796></a> Israel, under the law?<a name=1:3797></a> Israel, under the Levitical ceremonial?<a name=1:3798></a> Shall we dwell upon the record of man's failure in the prophetic, priestly, and kingly office?<a name=1:3799></a> Shall we point out the failure of the professing church as a responsible vessel on the earth?<a name=1:3800></a> Has not man failed always and in everything?<a name=1:3801></a> alas!<a name=1:3802></a> it is so.<a name=1:3803></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is one side of the picture -- the dark and humbling side.<a name=1:3804></a> But, blessed be God, there is the bright and encouraging side also.<a name=1:3805></a> If there is the "Doubtless ye shall not;" there is also the "Doubtless ye shall.<a name=1:3806></a>" and why?<a name=1:3807></a> Because Christ has entered the scene, and in Him all is infallibly secured for the glory of God and the eternal blessing of man.<a name=1:3808></a> It is God's eternal purpose to "Head up all things in Christ.<a name=1:3809></a>" There is not a single thing in which the fist man has failed, that the second Man will not make good.<a name=1:3810></a> All is set up on a new footing in Christ.<a name=1:3811></a> He is the Head of the new creation; Heir of all the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, touching the land; Heir of all the promises made to David concerning the throne.<a name=1:3812></a> the government shall be upon His shoulder.<a name=1:3813></a> He shall bear the glory.<a name=1:3814></a> He is the Prophet, Priest, and King.<a name=1:3815></a> In a word, Christ makes good all that Adam lost, and brings in much more beside than Adam ever had.<a name=1:3816></a> Hence, when we look at the first Adam and his doings, whenever and However viewed, the sentence is "Doubtless <i>ye shall not</i>.<a name=1:3817></a>" Ye shall not remain in Paradise -- ye shall not retain the government -- ye shall not inherit the promises -- ye shall not enter the land -- ye shall not occupy the throne -- ye shall not enter the kingdom.<a name=1:3818></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, when we look at the last Adam and His doings, wherever and However viewed, The entire category must be gloriously reversed; the "not" must be for ever taken from the sentence, for in Christ Jesus "all the promises of God are yea and Amen, to the glory of God by us.<a name=1:3819></a>" There is no "nay" in the matter when Christ is concerned.<a name=1:3820></a> all is "yea'' -- all is divinely settled and established; and because it is so, God has set His seal to it, even the seal of His Spirit, which all Believers now possess.<a name=1:3821></a> "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.<a name=1:3822></a> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.<a name=1:3823></a> Now He which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.<a name=1:3824></a>" 2 Corinthians 1: 19-22.<a name=1:3825></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, then, the opening lines of Numbers 15 must be read in the light of the whole volume of God.<a name=1:3826></a> It falls in with the entire history of the ways of God with man, in this world.<a name=1:3827></a> Israel had forfeited all title to the land.<a name=1:3828></a> They deserved nothing better than that their carcasses should fall in the wilderness.<a name=1:3829></a> And yet such is the large and precious grace of God, that He could speak to them of their coming into the land, and instruct them as to their ways and works therein.<a name=1:3830></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more blessed or more establishing than all this.<a name=1:3831></a> God rises above all human failure and sin.<a name=1:3832></a> It is utterly impossible that a single promise of God can fail of its accomplishment.<a name=1:3833></a> Could it Be that the conduct of Abraham's seed in the wilderness should frustrate God's eternal purpose, or hinder the fulfilment of the absolute and unconditional promise made to the fathers?<a name=1:3834></a> Impossible; and, therefore, if the generation which came up out of Egypt refused to go into Canaan, Jehovah would, of the very stones, raise up a seed to Whom His promise should be made good.<a name=1:3835></a> This will help to explain the opening sentence of our chapter, which comes in with such remarkable force and beauty after the humiliating scenes of chapter 14.<a name=1:3836></a> In this latter, Israel's sun seems to go down amid dark and angry clouds; But in the former, it rises with serene brightness, revealing and establishing that great truth that "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=1:3837></a>" God never repents of His call or His gift; and hence, though an unbelieving generation should murmur and rebel ten thousand times over, He will make good all that He has promised.<a name=1:3838></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is the divine resting place of faith at all times -- the sure and safe haven for the soul amid the wreck of all human schemes and undertakings.<a name=1:3839></a> Everything goes to pieces in man's hands; but God in Christ remains.<a name=1:3840></a> Let man be set up in business again and again, under the most favourable circumstances, and he is sure to become a bankrupt; but God has set up Christ in resurrection, and all who believe in Him are placed on a new footing altogether, they are taken into partnership with the risen and glorified Head, and there they stand for ever.<a name=1:3841></a> That wondrous partnership can never be dissolved.<a name=1:3842></a> All is secured on a basis that no power of earth or hell can ever touch.<a name=1:3843></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reader, say, Dost thou understand the application of all this to thyself?<a name=1:3844></a> Hast thou discovered, in the light of God's presence, that thou art, in very deed, a bankrupt; that thou hast made shipwreck of everything; that thou hast not a single plea to urge?<a name=1:3845></a> Hast thou been led to make a personal application of those two sentences upon which we have been dwelling, namely "Doubtless thou shalt not," and "Doubtless thou shalt''?<a name=1:3846></a> Hast thou learnt the force of these words, "Thou hast destroyed thyself; But in me is thy help''?<a name=1:3847></a> In one word, hast thou come to Jesus as a lost, guilty self-destroyed sinner, and found redemption, pardon, and peace in Him?<a name=1:3848></a>

		Do pause, dear friend, and seriously consider these things.<a name=1:3849></a> We can never lose sight of the weighty fact that we have something more to do than to write "Notes on the Book of Numbers.<a name=1:3850></a>" We have to consider the soul of the reader.<a name=1:3851></a> We have a most solemn responsibility to discharge to him or to her; and therefore it is that, from time to time, we feel constrained to turn, for a moment, from the page on which we are meditating, in order to make an appeal to the heart and conscience of the reader, and entreat him, most earnestly, that if he be as yet unconverted, undecided, he would lay aside this volume, and apply his heart seriously to the great question of his present condition and eternal destiny.<a name=1:3852></a> In comparison with this, all other questions dwindle into utter insignificance.<a name=1:3853></a> what are all the schemes and undertakings which begin, continue, and end in time, when compared with eternity and the salvation of your never-dying soul?<a name=1:3854></a> They are as the small dust of the balance.<a name=1:3855></a> "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul" If you had the wealth of a Rothschild, the money king -- if you stood on the loftiest pinnacle of literary fame or political ambition -- if your name were adorned with all the honours which the universities of this world could bestow -- if your brow were wreathed with the laurels and your breast covered with the medals of a hundred victories -- what would it profit you?<a name=1:3856></a> You must leave all -- you must pass through the narrow arch of time into the boundless ocean of eternity.<a name=1:3857></a> Men of princely wealth, men of literary fame, men who have ruled by their intellectual power the House of Lords and Commons -- men who have held thousands hanging entranced upon their lips -- men who have reached the very highest point of naval, military, and forensic distinction -- have passed away into eternity; and the awful question as to such is, "Where is the soul?<a name=1:3858></a>"

		Are we not forcibly reminded, by the teaching of this part of our book, of that profound section of dispensational truth presented in Romans 9-11, particularly of its magnificent close?<a name=1:3895></a> "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=1:3896></a> For as ye [strangers] in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: even so have these also now not believed in your mercy (i.<a name=1:3897></a>e.<a name=1:3898></a>, Mercy shown to the Gentiles, see Greek), that they also may obtain mercy [i.<a name=1:3899></a>e.<a name=1:3900></a>, come in on the ground of mercy like the stranger.<a name=1:3901></a>] For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all [Jews and Gentiles -- Israel and the stranger.<a name=1:3902></a>] O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=1:3903></a> how unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways past finding out!<a name=1:3904></a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord?<a name=1:3905></a> or who hath been his counselor Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?<a name=1:3906></a> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.<a name=1:3907></a> Amen.<a name=1:3908></a>" Romans 11: 29-36.<a name=1:3909></a>

		In Numbers 15: 22-32, we have instructions as to sins of ignorance and presumptuous sins -- a very grave and important distinction.<a name=1:3910></a> For the former, simple provision is made, in the goodness and mercy of God.<a name=1:3911></a> The <i>death</i> of Christ is presented, in this portion of the chapter, in its two grand aspects, namely, the burnt offering, and the sin offering; that is, its aspect to Godward, and its aspect to usward; and we have also all the preciousness, fragrance, and joy of His perfect <i>life</i> and service, as a man in this world, as typified by the meat offering and drink offering.<a name=1:3912></a> In the burnt offering, we see atonement wrought according to the measure of Christ's devotedness to God, and of God's delight in Him.<a name=1:3913></a> In the sin offering, we see atonement wrought according to the measure of the sinner's necessities and the hatefulness of sin in God's sight.<a name=1:3914></a> The two offerings, taken together, present the atoning death of Christ in all its fullness.<a name=1:3915></a> Then, in the meat offering, we have Christ's perfect life and the reality of His human nature, as manifested in all the details of His path and service in this world.<a name=1:3916></a> While the drink offering typifies His complete surrender of Himself to God.<a name=1:3917></a>

		Into the rich and marvellous instruction conveyed in the different classes of sacrifices, presented in this passage, we do not attempt to enter now.<a name=1:3918></a> The reader who desires to study the subject more fully, is referred to a little volume entitled "Notes on the Book of Leviticus.<a name=1:3919></a>" (Pages 1 - 140.<a name=1:3920></a>) We merely state here, in the very Briefest manner, what we judge to be the main import of each offering; to go into details would only be to repeat what we have already written.<a name=1:3921></a>

		And yet, while all this will, generally speaking, be fully admitted, it is often very sorrowful to hear professing Christians making excuses for ignorance, and justifying unfaithfulness and error on the ground of ignorance.<a name=1:3930></a> But very often, in such cases, the question may, very cogently, be urged, why are we ignorant, in reference to any point of conduct, or the claims of Christ upon us?<a name=1:3931></a> Suppose a question comes before us, demanding a positive judgement, and calling for a certain line of action; we plead ignorance.<a name=1:3932></a> Is this right?<a name=1:3933></a> Will it avail?<a name=1:3934></a> Will it dispose of our responsibility!<a name=1:3935></a> Will God allow us to shirk the question after such a fashion?<a name=1:3936></a> Nay, reader, we may rest assured it will not do.<a name=1:3937></a> Why are we ignorant?<a name=1:3938></a> Have we put forth all our energies, have we adopted every available means, have we made every possible effort, to get at the root of the matter and reach a just conclusion?<a name=1:3939></a> Let us bear in mind that the claims of truth and holiness demand all this of us; nor should we be satisfied with anything less.<a name=1:3940></a> We cannot but admit that, were it a question involving, in any measure, <i>our own</i> interests, our name, our reputation, our property, we should leave no stone unturned in order to make ourselves fully acquainted with all the facts of the case.<a name=1:3941></a> We should not long plead ignorance in such matters.<a name=1:3942></a> If information were to be had, we should have it.<a name=1:3943></a> We should do our very utmost to know all the ins and outs, the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the question, so that we might form a sound judgement in the matter.<a name=1:3944></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is this not so, reader?<a name=1:3945></a> Well, then, why should we plead ignorance when the claims of Christ are in question?<a name=1:3946></a> Does it not prove that while we are quick, earnest, energetic, all alive, when <i>self</i> is concerned, we are indifferent, sluggish, slow-paced, when Christ is concerned?<a name=1:3947></a> Alas!<a name=1:3948></a> alas!<a name=1:3949></a> this is the plain humbling truth.<a name=1:3950></a> May we be humbled under a sense of it!<a name=1:3951></a> May the Spirit of God make us more thoroughly in earnest in things which concern our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:3952></a> May self and its interests sink, and may Christ and His interests rise in our estimation, every day!<a name=1:3953></a> And may we at least cordially own our holy responsibility to go diligently into every question in the which the glory of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ may, even in the most remote degree, be involved, however we may fail practically in our research.<a name=1:3954></a> Let us not dare to say, or think, or act, as though we thought that anything that concerns Him is a matter of indifference to us.<a name=1:3955></a> God, in His mercy, forbid!<a name=1:3956></a> Let us esteem All that merely concerns ourselves to be, comparatively, non-essential; but the claims of Christ to be of paramount authority.<a name=1:3957></a>

		We have said thus much on the subject of ignorance, in the sense of our responsibility, to the truth of God, and to the soul of the reader.<a name=1:3958></a> We feel its immense practical importance.<a name=1:3959></a> We believe we very often plead <i>ignorance</i>, when <i>indifference</i> would be the truer term to use.<a name=1:3960></a> This is very sad.<a name=1:3961></a> Surely if our God, in His infinite goodness, has made ample provision even for sins of ignorance, that is no reason why we should coolly shelter ourselves behind the plea of ignorance when there is the most abundant information within our reach, had we only the energy to make use of it.<a name=1:3962></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We might not, perhaps, have dwelt at such length upon this point, were it not for the conviction which becomes, each day, more strengthened in the soul, that we have reached a serious moment in our history as Christians.<a name=1:3963></a> We are not given to croaking.<a name=1:3964></a> We have no sympathy whatever with it.<a name=1:3965></a> We believe it is our privilege to be filled with the most joyful confidence, and to have our hearts and minds ever garrisoned by the peace of God that passeth all understanding.<a name=1:3966></a> "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.<a name=1:3967></a>" 2 Timothy 1: 7.<a name=1:3968></a>

		But it is impossible to close our eyes to the startling fact that the claims of Christ -- the value of truth -- the authority of holy scripture, are being, more and more, set aside, each day, each week, each year.<a name=1:3969></a> We believe we are approaching a moment in the which there will be toleration for anything and everything save the truth of God.<a name=1:3970></a> It behoves us therefore to look well to it, that God's word has its own proper place in the heart; and that the conscience is governed, in all things, by its holy authority.<a name=1:3971></a> A tender conscience is a most precious treasure to carry about with us, from day to day -- a conscience that ever yields a true response to the action of the word of God -- that bows down, without a question, to its plain statements.<a name=1:3972></a> When the conscience is in this fine condition, there is always a regulating power wherewith to act upon one's practical course and character.<a name=1:3973></a> Conscience may be compared to the regulator of a watch.<a name=1:3974></a> It may happen that the hands of the watch get astray; but so long as the regulator has power over the spring, there is always the means of correcting the hands.<a name=1:3975></a> If that power be gone, the entire watch must be taken to pieces.<a name=1:3976></a> So with the conscience.<a name=1:3977></a> So long as it continues true to the touch of scripture, as applied by the Holy Ghost, there is always a safe and sure regulating power; But if it becomes sluggish, hardened, or perverted, if it refuses to yield a true response to "Thus saith the Lord," there is little if any hope.<a name=1:3978></a> It then becomes a case similar to that referred to in our chapter, "But the soul that doeth anything <i>presumptuously</i>, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, <i>the same reproacheth the Lord</i>; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people<i>.<a name=1:3979></a> Because he hath despised the word of the Lord</i>, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.<a name=1:3980></a>" Verses 30, 31.<a name=1:3981></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is no sin of ignorance, but a presumptuous, wilful sin, for which nothing remained But the unmitigated judgement of God.<a name=1:3982></a> "Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.<a name=1:3983></a>" (1 Samuel 15: 13.<a name=1:3984></a>) These are weighty words for a moment like the present, when man's will is developing itself with such extraordinary force.<a name=1:3985></a> It is deemed manly to assert our will; but scripture teaches the direct opposite.<a name=1:3986></a> The two grand elements of human perfection -- of perfect manhood -- are these, namely, <i>dependence</i> and <i>obedience</i>.<a name=1:3987></a> In proportion as any one departs from these, he departs from the true spirit and attitude of a man.<a name=1:3988></a> Hence, when we turn our eyes to Him who was the perfect man -- the man Christ Jesus, we see these two grand features perfectly adjusted and perfectly developed, from first to last.<a name=1:3989></a> That blessed One was never, for a single moment, out of the attitude of perfect dependence and absolute obedience.<a name=1:3990></a> To prove and illustrate this fact would take us through the entire gospel narrative.<a name=1:3991></a> But take the scene of the temptation, and there you will find a sample of the whole of that blessed life.<a name=1:3992></a> His one unvarying reply to the tempter was, "<i>It is written</i>.<a name=1:3993></a>" No reasonings, no arguments, no questions.<a name=1:3994></a> He lived by the word of God.<a name=1:3995></a> He conquered Satan by holding fast the <i>only</i> true position of a man -- dependence and obedience.<a name=1:3996></a> He <i>could</i> depend upon God; and He <i>would</i> obey Him.<a name=1:3997></a> What could Satan do in such a case?<a name=1:3998></a> Absolutely nothing.<a name=1:3999></a>

		Well, then, this is our example.<a name=1:4000></a> we, as having the life of Christ, are called to live in habitual dependence and obedience.<a name=1:4001></a> This is walking in the Spirit.<a name=1:4002></a> This is the safe and happy path of the Christian.<a name=1:4003></a> Independence and disobedience go together.<a name=1:4004></a> They are utterly unchristian and unmanly.<a name=1:4005></a> We find these two things in the first man, as we find the two opposites in the Second.<a name=1:4006></a> Adam in the garden sought to be independent, He was not content with being a man, and abiding in the only true place and spirit of a man, and he became disobedient.<a name=1:4007></a> Here lies the secret of fallen humanity -- these are the two elements which make up fallen manhood.<a name=1:4008></a> Trace it where you will -- before the flood, after the flood; without law, under the law; Heathen, Pagan, Jew, Turk, or nominal Christian; analyse it as closely as you please -- and you will see that it resolves itself into these two component parts -- independence and disobedience.<a name=1:4009></a> And when you reach the close of man's history in this world, when you view him in that last sad sphere in which he is to figure, how do you see him?<a name=1:4010></a> in what character does he appear?<a name=1:4011></a> as "the wilful king," and the "lawless man.<a name=1:4012></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f11"><sup>+++++++++++</sup></a>We would remind the young Christian reader, especially, that the true safeguard against sins of ignorance is the study of the word; and the true safeguard against presumptuous sins, is subjection to the word. We all need to bear these things in mind; but our younger brethren particularly. There is a strong tendency amongst young Christians to get into the current of this present age, and to drink in its spirit. Hence the independence, the strong will, the impatience of control, the disobedience to parents, the headiness, high-mindedness, and self-confidence, the pretentious style, the assumption, the setting up to be wiser than their elders -- all these things so hateful in the sight of God, and so entirely opposed to the spirit of Christianity. We would most earnestly and lovingly entreat all our young friends to guard against these things, and to cultivate a lowly mind. Let them remember that "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the lowly."

		It only remains for us, ere closing this section, to notice the case of the sabbath-breaker and the institution of "the riband of blue.<a name=1:4017></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.<a name=1:4018></a> And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.<a name=1:4019></a> And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.<a name=1:4020></a> And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.<a name=1:4021></a> And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.<a name=1:4022></a>" Verses 32-36.<a name=1:4023></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This surely was a presumptuous sin -- it was flying in the face of a most plain and positive commandment of God.<a name=1:4024></a> It is this that specially marks a presumptuous sin, and leaves it utterly inexcusable.<a name=1:4025></a> Ignorance cannot be pleaded in the face of a divine command.<a name=1:4026></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But why, it may be asked, had they to put the man in ward?<a name=1:4027></a> Because, although the commandment was explicit, yet the breach of it had not been anticipated, nor had any penalty been enacted.<a name=1:4028></a> To speak after the manner of men, Jehovah had not contemplated such folly on man's part, as the interruption of His rest, and therefore He had not formally provided for such an occurrence.<a name=1:4029></a> We need not say that God knows the end from the beginning; but in the matter now before us, He purposely left the case unnoticed until occasion required.<a name=1:4030></a> But alas!<a name=1:4031></a> occasion did require, for man is capable of anything.<a name=1:4032></a> He has no heart for God's rest.<a name=1:4033></a> To kindle a fire on the sabbath day was not only a positive breach of the law, but it evidenced the most complete alienation from the mind of the Lawgiver, inasmuch as it introduced into the day of <i>rest</i> that which is the apt symbol of <i>judgement</i>.<a name=1:4034></a> Fire is emblematic of judgement, and as such it was wholly out of keeping with the repose of the sabbath.<a name=1:4035></a> Nothing therefore remained but to visit the sabbath-breaker with judgement, for "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<a name=1:4036></a>"

		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments, throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a riband of blue.<a name=1:4037></a> And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart, and your own eyes .<a name=1:4038></a>.<a name=1:4039></a>.<a name=1:4040></a> .<a name=1:4041></a> that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.<a name=1:4042></a> I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.<a name=1:4043></a>" Verses 37-41.<a name=1:4044></a>

		The God of Israel would keep His people in continual remembrance of His holy commandments.<a name=1:4045></a> Hence the beautiful institution of "the riband of <i>blue</i>" which was designed to be a heavenly memorial attached to the very borders of their garments, so that the word of God might ever be held fast in the remembrance of the thoughts of their hearts.<a name=1:4046></a> Whenever an Israelite cast his eyes upon the blue riband, he was to think of Jehovah, and yield a hearty obedience to all His statutes.<a name=1:4047></a>

		Such was the great practical intention of "the riband of blue.<a name=1:4048></a>" But when we turn to Matthew 23: 5, we learn the sad use which man had made of the divine institution: "But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and <i>enlarge the borders of their garments</i>.<a name=1:4049></a>" Thus the very thing which had been instituted for the purpose of leading them to remember Jehovah, and to yield a lowly obedience to His precious word, was turned into an occasion of self-exaltation and religious pride.<a name=1:4050></a> Instead of thinking of God, and His word, they thought of themselves, and of the place which they held in the estimation of their fellows.<a name=1:4051></a> "<i>All</i> their works they do <i>to be seen of men</i>.<a name=1:4052></a>" Not a thought of God.<a name=1:4053></a> The spirit of the original institution was completely lost, while the outward form was kept up for selfish ends.<a name=1:4054></a> Can we not see something like this around us and among us?<a name=1:4055></a> Let us think of it -- think deeply and seriously.<a name=1:4056></a> Let us see to it that we do not turn the heavenly memorial into an earthly badge, and that which ought to lead to lowly obedience into an occasion of self-exaltation.<a name=1:4057></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter on which we have just been dwelling, is what may be called a digression from the history of Israel's wilderness life, except indeed the short paragraph respecting the Sabbath-breaker, It looks forward into the future, when, spite of all their sin and folly, their murmuring and rebellion, Israel shall possess the land of Canaan, and offer sacrifices of righteousness and songs of praise to the God of their salvation.<a name=1:4058></a> In it we have seen Jehovah rising far above all the unbelief and disobedience, the pride and wilfulness exhibited in Numbers 13 and Numbers 14, and looking on to the full and final accomplishment of His own eternal purpose, and the fulfilment of His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<a name=1:4059></a>

		But in chapter 16 the wilderness story is resumed -- that sad and humbling story, so far as man is concerned; but a bright and blessed story of the exhaustless patience and boundless grace of God.<a name=1:4060></a> These are the two grand lessons of the wilderness.<a name=1:4061></a> We learn what man is, and we learn what God is.<a name=1:4062></a> The two things lie side by side on the pages of the Book of Numbers.<a name=1:4063></a> Thus in chapter 14 we have man and his ways.<a name=1:4064></a> In chapter 15 we have God and His ways.<a name=1:4065></a> And now, in the chapter which opens before us, we come back to man and his ways again.<a name=1:4066></a> May we reap much deep and solid instruction from the double lesson!<a name=1:4067></a>

		"Now Korah, the son of Ishar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord?<a name=1:4068></a>" Verses 1-3.<a name=1:4069></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then we enter upon the solemn history of what the Holy Ghost, by the Apostle Jude, terms "The gainsaying of Core.<a name=1:4070></a>" The rebellion is attributed to Korah, inasmuch as he was the religious leader in it.<a name=1:4071></a> He seems to have possessed sufficient influence to gather around him a large number of influential men" princes, famous men, and men of renown.<a name=1:4072></a>" In short, it was a very formidable and serious rebellion; and we shall do well to look closely at its source and moral features.<a name=1:4073></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is always a most critical moment in the history of an assembly when a spirit of disaffection displays itself; for, if it be not met in the right way, the most disastrous consequences are sure to follow.<a name=1:4074></a> There are materials in every assembly capable of being acted upon, and it only needs some restless master spirit to arise, in order to work on such materials, and fan into a devouring flame the fire that has been smouldering in secret.<a name=1:4075></a> There are hundreds and thousands ready to flock around the standard of revolt, when once it has been raised, who have neither the vigour nor the courage to raise it themselves.<a name=1:4076></a> It is not every one that Satan will take up as an instrument in such work.<a name=1:4077></a> It needs a shrewd, clever, energetic man -- a man of moral' power -- one possessing influence over the minds of his fellows, and an iron will to carry forward his schemes.<a name=1:4078></a> No doubt Satan infuses much of all these into the men whom he uses in his diabolical undertakings.<a name=1:4079></a> At all events, we know, as a fact, that the great leaders in all rebellious movements are generally men of master minds, capable of swaying, according to their own will, the fickle multitude, which, like the ocean, is acted upon by every stormy mind that blows.<a name=1:4080></a> Such men know how, in the first place, to stir the passions of the people; and, in the second place, how to wield them, when stirred.<a name=1:4081></a> Their most potent agency -- the leper with which they can most effectually raise the masses-is some question as to their liberty and their rights.<a name=1:4082></a> If they can only succeed in persuading people that their liberty is curtailed, and their <i>rights</i> infringed, they are sure to gather a number of restless spirits around them, and do a vast deal of serious mischief.<a name=1:4083></a>

		Thus it was in the matter of Korah and his coadjutors.<a name=1:4084></a> They sought to make it appear that Moses and Aaron were lording it over their brethren, and interfering with their rights and privileges as members of a holy congregation, in which, according to their judgement, all were on a dead level, and one had as much right to be active as another.<a name=1:4085></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Ye take too much upon you.<a name=1:4086></a>" Such was their charge against "the meekest man in all the earth.<a name=1:4087></a>" But what had Moses taken upon him?<a name=1:4088></a> Surely the most cursory glance back at the history of that dear and honoured servant would have been sufficient to convince any impartial person that, so far from taking dignity and responsibility upon him, he had shown himself only too ready to shrink from them when presented, and sink under them when imposed.<a name=1:4089></a> Hence, therefore, any one who could think of accusing Moses of taking upon him, only proved himself totally ignorant of the man's real spirit and character.<a name=1:4090></a> Assuredly the one who could say to Joshua," Enviest thou for my sake?<a name=1:4091></a> would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His spirit upon them!<a name=1:4092></a>" was not very likely to take much upon him.<a name=1:4093></a>

		But, on the other hand, if God calls one a man into prominence -- if he qualifies him for work -- if He fills and fits the vessel for special service -- if He assigns a man his position -- then of what possible use can it be for any one to quarrel with divine gift, and divine appointment?<a name=1:4094></a> In truth, nothing can be more absurd.<a name=1:4095></a> "A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven.<a name=1:4096></a>" And therefore it must prove worse than useless for any one to assume to be or have anything, for all such assumption must prove hollow in the end.<a name=1:4097></a> Men will, sooner or later, find their level; and nothing will stand but what is of God.<a name=1:4098></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to a cursory observer it might not have appeared that Korah was seeking anything For himself.<a name=1:4204></a> He seemed to be contending for the rights of the whole assembly.<a name=1:4205></a> But Moses, by the Spirit of God, unmasks the man, and shows that, under the plausible pretext of standing up for the common rights of the congregation, he was audaciously seeking the priesthood for himself.<a name=1:4206></a> It is well to note this.<a name=1:4207></a> It will most generally be found that loud talkers about the liberties, rights, and privileges of God's people are, in reality, seeking their own exaltation and advantage.<a name=1:4208></a> Not content with doing their proper work, they are seeking an improper place.<a name=1:4209></a> This is not always apparent; but God is sure to make it manifest sooner or later, for "by him actions are weighed.<a name=1:4210></a>" Nothing can be more worthless than seeking a place for oneself.<a name=1:4211></a> It is sure to end in disappointment and confusion.<a name=1:4212></a> The grand thing for each one is to be found filling his appointed place and doing his appointed work; and the more humbly, quietly, and unpretendingly, the better.<a name=1:4213></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Korah had not learnt this simple but wholesome principle.<a name=1:4214></a> He was not content with his divinely appointed place and service, But aimed at something which did not belong to him at all.<a name=1:4215></a> He aimed at being a priest.<a name=1:4216></a> His sin was the sin of rebellion against God's high priest.<a name=1:4217></a> This was "the gainsaying of Core.<a name=1:4218></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to seize this fact in Korah's history.<a name=1:4219></a> It is not generally understood; and hence it is that his sin is charged, now-a-days, upon those who seek to exercise any gift which may have been bestowed upon them by the Head of the Church.<a name=1:4220></a> But a moment's calm reflection upon the subject in the light of scripture would be quite sufficient to show how utterly baseless is such a charge.<a name=1:4221></a> Take, for example, a man to whom Christ has manifestly given the gift of an evangelist.<a name=1:4222></a> Are we to suppose him guilty of the sin of Korah because, in pursuance of the divine gift and the divine commission, he goes forth to preach the gospel?<a name=1:4223></a> Should he preach?<a name=1:4224></a> or should he not preach?<a name=1:4225></a> Is the divine gift -- the divine call -- sufficient.<a name=1:4226></a> Is he acting as a rebel when he preaches the gospel?<a name=1:4227></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also as regards a pastor or teacher.<a name=1:4228></a> Is he guilty of the sin of Korah, because he exercises the special gift imparted to him by the Head of the Church?<a name=1:4229></a> Does not Christ's gift make a man a minister?<a name=1:4230></a> Is anything further necessary?<a name=1:4231></a> is it not plain to any unprejudiced mind -- to any one willing to be taught by scripture -- that the possession of a divinely imparted gift makes a man a minister, without anything further whatsoever?<a name=1:4232></a> And is it not equally plain that, though a man had everything else that could be had, and yet had no gift from the Head of the Church, he is no minister?<a name=1:4233></a> We confess we do not see how these plain propositions con be called in question.<a name=1:4234></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are speaking, be it remembered, of special gifts of ministry in the Church.<a name=1:4235></a> No doubt, every member in the body of Christ has some ministry to fulfil, some work to do.<a name=1:4236></a> This is understood by every well-instructed Christian; and, moreover, it is clear that the edification of the body is carried on, not merely by some special prominent gifts, but by the effectual working of all the members in their respective places, as we read in the epistle to the Ephesians: "But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which <i>every joint supplieth</i> according to The <i>effectual working in the measure of every part</i>, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.<a name=1:4237></a>" Ephesians 4: 15, 16.<a name=1:4238></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is as plain as scripture can make it.<a name=1:4239></a> But, as to any special gifts, such as that of evangelist, pastor, prophet, or teacher, it must be received from Christ alone; and the possession of it makes a man a minister, without anything further.<a name=1:4240></a> And, on the other hand, all the education and all the human authority under the sun could not make a man an evangelist, a pastor, or teacher, unless he has a <i>bona fide</i> gift from the Head of the Church.<a name=1:4241></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to ministry in the Church of God.<a name=1:4242></a> we trust enough has been said to prove to the reader that it is a very grave mistake indeed to charge men with the awful sin of Korah because they exercise those gifts which have been imparted to them by the great Head of the Church.<a name=1:4243></a> In point of fact it would be a sin not to exercise them.<a name=1:4244></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a very material difference between ministry and priesthood.<a name=1:4245></a> Korah did not aim at being a minister, for that he was.<a name=1:4246></a> He aimed at being a priest, which he could not be.<a name=1:4247></a> The priesthood was vested in Aaron and his family; and it was a daring usurpation for any one else, no matter who, to attempt to offer sacrifice, or discharge any other priestly function.<a name=1:4248></a> Now, Aaron was a type of our great High Priest who is passed into the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God.<a name=1:4249></a> Heaven is the sphere of His ministry.<a name=1:4250></a> "If he were on earth he should not be a priest.<a name=1:4251></a>" (Hebrews 8: 4) "Our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.<a name=1:4252></a>" There is no such thing as a priest on earth now, save in the sense in which all believers are priests.<a name=1:4253></a> Thus we read in Peter, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood.<a name=1:4254></a>" (1 Peter 2: 9) Every Christian is a priest in this sense of the term.<a name=1:4255></a> The very feeblest saint in the Church of God is as much a priest as Paul was.<a name=1:4256></a> It is not a question of capacity or spiritual power, but simply of position.<a name=1:4257></a> All believers are priests, and they are called to offer spiritual sacrifices, according to Hebrews 13: 15, 16: "By him therefore let us offer <i>the sacrifice of praise</i> to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.<a name=1:4258></a> But to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for with <i>such sacrifices</i> God is well pleased.<a name=1:4259></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the Christian priesthood.<a name=1:4260></a> And let the reader note it carefully, that to aim at any other form of priesthood than this -- to assume any other priestly function -- to set up a certain priestly class -- a sacerdotal <i>caste</i> -- a number of men to act on behalf of their fellows -- or discharge priestly service for them before God -- this is, in principle, the sin of Korah.<a name=1:4261></a> We only speak of the principle; not of persons.<a name=1:4262></a> The germ of the sin is as distinct as possible.<a name=1:4263></a> By and by there will be the full blown fruit.<a name=1:4264></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader cannot possibly be too simple in apprehending this entire subject.<a name=1:4265></a> It is, we may truly say, of capital importance, at this moment.<a name=1:4266></a> Let him examine it only in the light of Holy Scripture.<a name=1:4267></a> Tradition will not do.<a name=1:4268></a> Ecclesiastical history will not do.<a name=1:4269></a> It must be God's word alone.<a name=1:4270></a> In the light of that word let the question be asked and answered, "Who are justly chargeable with the sin of Korah?<a name=1:4271></a> Is it those who seek to exercise whatever gifts the Head of the Church has bestowed; or those who assume a priestly office and work which only belong to Christ Himself?<a name=1:4272></a>" This is a very weighty and solemn question.<a name=1:4273></a> may it be calmly pondered, in the divine presence; and may we seek grace to be faithful to Him who is not only our gracious Saviour but our sovereign Lord!<a name=1:4274></a>

		The closing paragraph of our chapter illustrates, in a most striking manner, the incorrigible evil of the natural heart.<a name=1:4335></a> One might fondly hope that after the impressive scenes enacted in the presence of the congregation, deep and permanent lessons would be learnt.<a name=1:4336></a> Having seen the earth open her mouth -- having heard the heart-rending cry of the rebels as they descended into the pit -- having seen the fire of the Lord coming forth and consuming, as in a moment, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation -- having witnessed such tokens of the divine judgement -- such a display of divine power and majesty -- one might suppose that the people would henceforth walk softly and humbly; and that the accents of discontent and rebellion would no more be heard in their tents.<a name=1:4337></a>

		NUMBERS 17 and 18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two chapters form a distinct section in which we have presented to us the source, the responsibilities, and the privileges of priesthood.<a name=1:4386></a> Priesthood is a divine institution.<a name=1:4387></a> "No man taketh this honour unto Himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.<a name=1:4388></a>" This is made manifest, in a most striking manner, in chapter 17.<a name=1:4389></a> "The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.<a name=1:4390></a> And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.<a name=1:4391></a> And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.<a name=1:4392></a> And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.<a name=1:4393></a> And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their father's houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.<a name=1:4394></a>" Verses 1-6.<a name=1:4395></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What matchless wisdom shines in this arrangement!<a name=1:4396></a> How completely is the matter taken out of man's hands and placed where alone it ought to be, namely, in the hands of the living God!<a name=1:4397></a> It was not to be a man appointing himself, or a man appointing his fellow; But God appointing the man of His own selection.<a name=1:4398></a> In a word, the question was to be definitively settled by God Himself, so that all murmurings might be silenced for ever, and no one be able again to charge God's high priest with taking too much upon him.<a name=1:4399></a> the human will had nothing whatever to do with this solemn matter.<a name=1:4400></a> The twelve rods, all in a like condition, were laid up before the Lord; man retired and left God to act.<a name=1:4401></a> There was no room, no opportunity, because there was no occasion, for human management.<a name=1:4402></a> In the profound retirement of the sanctuary, far away from all man's thinkings, was the grand question of priesthood settled by divine decision; and, being thus settled, it could never again be raised.<a name=1:4403></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness.<a name=1:4404></a> And it came to pass that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.<a name=1:4405></a>" striking and beautiful figure of Him who was "declared to be the Son of God with power by resurrection from the dead!<a name=1:4406></a>" The twelve rods were all alike lifeless; but God, the living God, entered the scene, and, by that power peculiar to Himself, infused life into Aaron's rod, and brought it forth to view, bearing upon it the fragrant fruits of resurrection.<a name=1:4407></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Who could gainsay this?<a name=1:4408></a> The rationalist may sneer at it, and raise a thousand questions.<a name=1:4409></a> Faith gazes on that fruit-bearing rod, and sees in it a lovely figure of the new creation in the which all things are of God.<a name=1:4410></a> Infidelity may argue on the ground of the apparent impossibility of a dry stick budding, blossoming, and bearing fruit in the coarse of one night.<a name=1:4411></a> But to whom does it appear impossible?<a name=1:4412></a> To the infidel -- the rationalist -- the sceptic.<a name=1:4413></a> and why?<a name=1:4414></a> Because he always shuts out God.<a name=1:4415></a> Let us remember this.<a name=1:4416></a> <i>Infidelity invariably shuts out God</i>.<a name=1:4417></a> Its reasonings are carried on and its conclusions reached in midnight darkness.<a name=1:4418></a> There is not so much as a single ray of true light in the whole of that sphere in which infidelity operates.<a name=1:4419></a> It excludes the only source of light, and leaves the soul wrapped in the shades and deep gloom of a darkness that may be felt.<a name=1:4420></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well for the young reader to pause here, and deeply ponder this solemn fact Let him calmly and seriously reflect on this special feature of infidelity-rationalism -- or scepticism.<a name=1:4421></a> It begins, continues, and ends with shutting out God.<a name=1:4422></a> It would approach the mystery of Aaron's budding, blossoming, fruit bearing rod with a godless, audacious "<i>How</i>?<a name=1:4423></a>" This is the infidel's great argument.<a name=1:4424></a> He can raise ten thousand questions; but never settle one.<a name=1:4425></a> He will teach you how to doubt, but never how to believe.<a name=1:4426></a> He will lead you to doubt everything; but gives you nothing to believe.<a name=1:4427></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such, beloved reader, is infidelity.<a name=1:4428></a> It is of Satan who ever has been, is, and will be, the great question raiser.<a name=1:4429></a> Wherever you trace Satan, you will always find him raising questions.<a name=1:4430></a> He fills the heart with all sorts of "ifs" and "hows," and thus plunges the soul in thick darkness.<a name=1:4431></a> If he can only succeed in raising a question, he has gained his point.<a name=1:4432></a> But he is perfectly powerless with a simple soul that just believes that God Is, and God HAS SPOKEN.<a name=1:4433></a> Here is faith's noble answer to the infidels questions -- its divine solution of all the infidel's difficulties.<a name=1:4434></a> Faith always brings in the very One that infidelity always shuts out.<a name=1:4435></a> It thinks with God; infidelity thinks without Him.<a name=1:4436></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, then, we would say to the Christian reader, and specially to the young Christian, never admit questions when God has spoken.<a name=1:4437></a> If you do, Satan will have you under his foot in a moment.<a name=1:4438></a> Your only security against him is found in that one impregnable, immortal sentence, "It is written.<a name=1:4439></a>" It will never do to argue with him on the ground of experience, of feeling, or of observation; it must be absolutely and exclusively on the ground of this -- that God is, and that God has spoken.<a name=1:4440></a> Satan can make no hand of this weighty argument at all.<a name=1:4441></a> It is invincible.<a name=1:4442></a> Everything else he can shiver to pieces; but this confounds him and puts him to flight at once.<a name=1:4443></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see this very strikingly illustrated in the temptation of our Lord.<a name=1:4444></a> the enemy, according to His usual way, approached the blessed One <i>with a question</i> -- "<i>If</i> thou be the Son of God.<a name=1:4445></a>" How did the Lord answer Him?<a name=1:4446></a> Did He say," I know I am the Son of God -- I have had a testimony from the opened heavens, and from the descending and anointing Spirit -- I feel, and believe, and realise that I am the Son of God?<a name=1:4447></a>" No; such was not His mode of answering the tempter.<a name=1:4448></a> How then?<a name=1:4449></a> "<i>It is written</i>.<a name=1:4450></a>" Such was the thrice repeated answer of the obedient and dependent Man; and such must be the answer of every one who will overcome the tempter.<a name=1:4451></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in reference to Aaron's budding rod, if any inquire, "How can such a thing be?<a name=1:4452></a> It is contrary to the laws of nature; and how could God reverse the established principles of natural philosophy?<a name=1:4453></a>" Faith's reply is sublimely simple.<a name=1:4454></a> God can do as He pleases.<a name=1:4455></a> The One who called worlds into existence, could make a rod to bud, blossom, and bear fruit in a moment.<a name=1:4456></a> Bring God in, and all is simple and plain as possible.<a name=1:4457></a> Leave God out, and All is plunged in hopeless confusion.<a name=1:4458></a> The attempt to tie up -- we speak with reverence -- the Almighty Creator of the vast universe, by certain laws of nature, or certain principles of natural philosophy, is nothing short of impious blasphemy.<a name=1:4459></a> It is almost worse than denying His existence altogether.<a name=1:4460></a> It is hard to say which is the worse, the atheist who says there is no God, or the rationalist who maintains that He cannot do as He pleases.<a name=1:4461></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We feel the immense importance of being able to see the real roots of all the plausible theories which are afloat at the present moment.<a name=1:4462></a> The mind of man is busy forming systems, drawing conclusions, and reasoning in such a manner as virtually to exclude the testimony of holy scripture altogether, and to shut out God from His own creation.<a name=1:4463></a> Our young people must be solemnly warned as to this.<a name=1:4464></a> They must be taught the immense difference between the facts of science, and the conclusions of scientific men.<a name=1:4465></a> A fact is a fact wherever you meet it, whether in geology, astronomy, or any other department of science; but men's reasonings, conclusions, and systems are another thing altogether.<a name=1:4466></a> Now, scripture will never touch the facts of science; but the reasonings of scientific man are constantly found in collision with scripture.<a name=1:4467></a> Alas!<a name=1:4468></a> alas!<a name=1:4469></a> for such men!<a name=1:4470></a> And when such is the case we must, with plain decision, denounce such reasonings altogether, and exclaim with the apostle, "Let God be true, and every man a liar.<a name=1:4471></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gladly would we dwell upon this point though it be a digression, for we deeply feel its seriousness.<a name=1:4472></a> But we must, for the present, be content with solemnly urging upon the reader the necessity of giving to holy scripture the supreme place in his heart and mind.<a name=1:4473></a> We must bow down, with absolute submission, to the authority of, not "Thus saith the Church" -- "Thus say the fathers" -- "Thus say the doctors;" but "<i>Thus saith the Lord" "It is written</i>.<a name=1:4474></a>" This is our <i>only</i> security against the rising tide of infidelity which threatens to sweep away the foundations of religious thought and feeling throughout the length and breadth of Christendom.<a name=1:4475></a> None will escape save those who are taught and governed by the word of the Lord.<a name=1:4476></a> May God increase the number of such!<a name=1:4477></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now proceed with our chapter.<a name=1:4478></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"and Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.<a name=1:4479></a> And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.<a name=1:4480></a> and Moses did so: as the Lord commanded Him, so did he.<a name=1:4481></a>" Verses 9-11.<a name=1:4482></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the question was divinely settled.<a name=1:4483></a> Priesthood is founded upon that precious grace of God which brings life out of death.<a name=1:4484></a> This is the source of priesthood.<a name=1:4485></a> It could be of no possible use for man to take any one of the eleven dead rods and make it the badge of the priestly office.<a name=1:4486></a> All the human authority under the sun could not infuse life into a dead stick, or make that stick the channel of blessing to souls.<a name=1:4487></a> And so of all the eleven rods put together; there was not so much as a single bud or blossom throughout the whole.<a name=1:4488></a> But where there were precious evidences of quickening power -- refreshing traces of divine life and blessing -- fragrant fruits of efficacious grace -- there and there alone was to be found the source of that priestly ministry which could carry not only a needy but murmuring and rebellious people through the wilderness.<a name=1:4489></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here we may naturally inquire, "What about Moses' rod?<a name=1:4490></a> Why was it not amongst the twelve?<a name=1:4491></a>" The reason is blessedly simple.<a name=1:4492></a> Moses rod was the expression of power and authority.<a name=1:4493></a> Aaron's rod was the lovely expression of that grace that quickens the dead, and calls those things that be not as though they were.<a name=1:4494></a> Now, mere power or authority could not conduct the congregation through the wilderness.<a name=1:4495></a> Power could crush the rebel; authority might strike the sinner; but only mercy and grace could avail for an assembly of needy, helpless, sinful men, women, and children.<a name=1:4496></a> The grace that could bring almonds out on a dead stick, could bring Israel through the wilderness.<a name=1:4497></a> It was only in connection with Aaron's budding rod that Jehovah could say, "Thou shalt <i>quite</i> take away the murmurings of the children of Israel from me, that they die not.<a name=1:4498></a>'' The rod of <i>authority</i> could take away <i>the murmurers</i>; but the rod of <i>grace</i> could take away the <i>murmurs</i>.<a name=1:4499></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader may refer, with interest and profit, to a passage in the opening of Hebrews 9.<a name=1:4500></a> in connection with the subject of Aaron's rod.<a name=1:4501></a> The apostle, in speaking of the ark of the covenant, says," wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant.<a name=1:4502></a>" This was in the wilderness.<a name=1:4503></a> The rod and the manna were the provisions of divine grace for Israel's desert wanderings and desert need.<a name=1:4504></a> But, when we turn to 1 Kings 8: 9, we read, "There!<a name=1:4505></a> was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.<a name=1:4506></a>" The wilderness wanderings were over, the glory of Solomon's day was sending forth its beams over the land, and hence the budding rod and the pot of manna are omitted, and nothing remains save that law of God, which was the foundation of His righteous government in the midst of His people.<a name=1:4507></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in this we have an illustration, not only of the divine accuracy of scripture, as a whole but also of the special character and object of the Book of Numbers.<a name=1:4508></a> Aaron's rod was in the ark during its wilderness wanderings.<a name=1:4509></a> Precious fact!<a name=1:4510></a> Let the reader seek to lay hold of its deep and blessed significance.<a name=1:4511></a> Let him ponder the difference between the rod of Moses and the rod of Aaron.<a name=1:4512></a> We have seen the former doing its characteristic work in other days and amid other scenes.<a name=1:4513></a> we have seen the land of Egypt trembling beneath the heavy strokes of that rod.<a name=1:4514></a> Plague after plague fell upon that devoted scene, in answer to that outstretched rod.<a name=1:4515></a> We have seen the waters of the sea divided in answer to that rod.<a name=1:4516></a> In short, the rod of Moses was a rod of power, a rod of authority.<a name=1:4517></a> But it could not avail to hush the murmurings of the children of Israel; nor yet to bring the people through the desert.<a name=1:4518></a> Grace alone could do that; and we have the expression of pure grace -- free, sovereign grace -- in the budding of Aaron's rod.<a name=1:4519></a>

		Nothing can be more forcible, nothing more lovely.<a name=1:4520></a> That dry, dead stick was the apt figure of Israel's condition, and indeed of the condition of every one of us by nature.<a name=1:4521></a> There was no sap, no life, no power.<a name=1:4522></a> One might well say, "What good can ever come of it?<a name=1:4523></a>" none whatever, had not grace come in and displayed its quickening power.<a name=1:4524></a> So was it with Israel, in the wilderness; and so is it with us now.<a name=1:4525></a> How were they to be led along from day to day?<a name=1:4526></a> How were they to be sustained in all their weakness and need?<a name=1:4527></a> How were they to he borne with in all their sin and folly?<a name=1:4528></a> The answer is found in Aaron's budding rod.<a name=1:4529></a> If the dry dead stick was the expression of nature's barren and worthless condition; the buds, blossoms, and fruit set forth that living and life-giving grace and power of God on which was based the priestly ministry that alone could bear the congregation through the wilderness.<a name=1:4530></a> Grace alone could answer the ten thousand necessities of the militant host.<a name=1:4531></a> Power could not suffice.<a name=1:4532></a> authority could not avail.<a name=1:4533></a> Priesthood alone could supply what was needed; and this priesthood was instituted on the foundation of that efficacious grace which could bring fruit out of a dry rod.<a name=1:4534></a>

		But, ere we turn from this subject, we deem it most necessary to impress upon the reader the importance of distinguishing between ministry and priesthood.<a name=1:4612></a> The sin of Korah consisted in this, that, not content with being a minister, he aimed at being a priest; and the sin of Christendom is of the same character.<a name=1:4613></a> Instead of allowing ministry to rest upon its own proper New Testament basis, to exhibit its proper characteristics, And discharge its proper functions, it is exalted into a priesthood, a sacerdotal caste, the members of which are distinguished from their brethren by their style of dress and certain titles.<a name=1:4614></a> There is no foundation whatsoever for these things in the New Testament.<a name=1:4615></a> According to the plain teaching of that blessed book, all believers are priests.<a name=1:4616></a> Thus, in Peter we read, "But <i>ye</i> [not merely the apostles, but all believers] are a chosen generation, a <i>royal priesthood</i>.<a name=1:4617></a>" (1 Peter 2: 9) so also in Revelation "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and <i>priests</i> unto God and his Father.<a name=1:4618></a>" (1 Peter 1: 5, 6) God, in pursuance of the truth set forth in the foregoing passages, we find the Apostle Paul, by the Holy Ghost, exhorting the Hebrew believers to draw nigh, and enter with boldness into the very holiest of all.<a name=1:4619></a> (Hebrews 10: 19-22) And further on he says, "By him therefore [i.<a name=1:4620></a>e.<a name=1:4621></a>, Jesus let us <i>offer The sacrifice</i> of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.<a name=1:4622></a> But to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for with <i>such sacrifices</i> God is well pleased.<a name=1:4623></a>" Hebrews 13: 15, 16.<a name=1:4624></a>

		Here we have a type of the people of God looked at in another aspect.<a name=1:4739></a> They are here presented, not as workers, but as worshippers; not as Levites, but as priests.<a name=1:4740></a> all believers -- all Christians -- all the children of God, are priests.<a name=1:4741></a> There is, according to the teaching of the New Testament, no such thing as a priest upon earth, save in the sense in which all believers are priests.<a name=1:4742></a> A special priestly caste -- a certain class of men set apart as priests, is a thing not only unknown in Christianity, but most positively hostile to the spirit and principles thereof.<a name=1:4743></a> We have already referred to this subject, and quoted the various passages of scripture bearing upon it.<a name=1:4744></a> We have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, for if He were on earth He should not be a priest.<a name=1:4745></a> (Compare Hebrews 4: 14 and 8: 4 "Our Lord sprang Out Of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.<a name=1:4746></a>" Hence, therefore, a sacrificing priest on the earth is a direct denial of the truth of scripture, and a complete setting aside of the glorious fact on which Christianity is based, namely, accomplished redemption.<a name=1:4747></a> If there is any need of spriest now, to offer sacrifice for sins, then, most assuredly, redemption is not an accomplished fact.<a name=1:4748></a> But scripture, in hundreds of places, declares that it is, and therefore we need no more offering for sin.<a name=1:4749></a> "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, <i>not made with hands</i>, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, He entered in once into the holy place, <i>having obtained eternal redemption</i>.<a name=1:4750></a>" (Hebrews 9: 11, 12) So also, in Hebrews 10 we read, "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=1:4751></a>" And again, "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<a name=1:4752></a> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.<a name=1:4753></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This settles the great question as to priesthood and sacrifice for sin.<a name=1:4754></a> Christians cannot be too clear or decided in reference to it.<a name=1:4755></a> It lies at the very foundation of true Christianity, and demands the deep and serious attention of all who desire to walk in the clear light of a full salvation, and to occupy the true Christian position.<a name=1:4756></a> There is a strong tendency towards Judaism -- a vigorous effort to engraft Christian forms upon the old Jewish stem.<a name=1:4757></a> This is nothing new; But, just now, the enemy seems peculiarly busy.<a name=1:4758></a> We can perceive a great leaning towards Romanism, throughout the length and breadth of Christendom; and in nothing is the leaning more strikingly apparent than in the institutions of a special priestly order in the Church of God.<a name=1:4759></a> We believe it to be a thoroughly antichristian institution.<a name=1:4760></a> It is the denial of the common priesthood of all believers.<a name=1:4761></a> If a certain set of men are ordained to occupy a place of peculiar nearness and sanctity, then where are the great mass of Christians to stand?<a name=1:4762></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the question.<a name=1:4763></a> It is precisely here that the great importance and gravity of this whole subject are made apparent.<a name=1:4764></a> Let not the reader suppose that we are contending for some peculiar theory of any particular class or sect of Christians.<a name=1:4765></a> Nothing is further from our thoughts.<a name=1:4766></a> It is because we are convinced that the very foundations of the Christian faith are involved in this question of priesthood that we urge its consideration upon all with whom we have to do.<a name=1:4767></a> We believe it will invariably be found that in proportion as Christians become clear and settled on the divine ground of accomplished redemption, they get further and further away from the Romanism and Judaism of an order of priests in the Church of God.<a name=1:4768></a> And, on the other hand, where souls are not clear, not settled, not spiritual; where there is legality, carnality and worldliness, there you will find a hankering after a humanly appointed priesthood.<a name=1:4769></a> Nor is it difficult to see the reason of this.<a name=1:4770></a> If a man is not himself in a fit state to draw nigh to God, it will be a relief to him to employ another to draw nigh for him.<a name=1:4771></a> And, most certainly, no man is in a fit state to draw nigh to a holy God who does not know that his sins are forgiven -- has not got a perfectly purged conscience -- is in a dark, doubting, legal state of soul.<a name=1:4772></a> In order to come boldly into the holiest of all, we must know what the blood of Christ has done for us; we must know that we ourselves are made priests to God; and that, in virtue of the atoning death of Christ, we are brought so near to God that it is impossible for any order of men to come between.<a name=1:4773></a> "He hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and made us priests unto God and his Father.<a name=1:4774></a>" (Revelation 1) "But ye are a chosen generation, <i>a royal priesthood</i>, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.<a name=1:4775></a>" and again, "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, <i>an holy priesthood</i>, to offer up <i>spiritual sacrifices</i>, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<a name=1:4776></a>" (1 Peter 2: 5, 9) "By him therefore let us offer the <i>sacrifice of praise</i> to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.<a name=1:4777></a> But to do good and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<a name=1:4778></a>" Hebrews 13: 15, 16.<a name=1:4779></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the two great branches of spiritual sacrifice which, as priests, we are privileged to offer, namely, praise to God, doing good to men.<a name=1:4780></a> The very youngest, the most inexperienced, the most unlettered Christian is capable of understanding these things.<a name=1:4781></a> Who is there in all the family of God -- in all the priestly household of our divine High Priest, who cannot, with his <i>heart</i>, say, "The Lord be praised" And who cannot, with his <i>hand</i>, do good to His fellow?<a name=1:4782></a> And this is priestly worship, and priestly service -- the common worship and service of all true Christians.<a name=1:4783></a> True, the measure of spiritual power may vary; But all the children of God are constituted priests, one as much as another.<a name=1:4784></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Numbers 18 we are presented with a very full statement of the provision made for Aaron and his house; and, in that provision, a type of the spiritual portion of the Christian priesthood.<a name=1:4785></a> And surely we cannot read the record without seeing what a royal portion is ours.<a name=1:4786></a> "Every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for <i>thy sons.<a name=1:4787></a> In the Most holy place</i> shalt thou eat it; <i>every male</i> shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.<a name=1:4788></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It demands a very large measure of spiritual capacity to enter into the depth and meaning of this marvellous passage.<a name=1:4789></a> To eat the sin offering, or the trespass offering is, in figure, to make another's sin or trespass one's own.<a name=1:4790></a> This is very holy work.<a name=1:4791></a> It is not every one who can, in spirit, identify himself with the sin of his brother.<a name=1:4792></a> To do so in fact, in the way of atonement, is, we need hardly say, wholly out of question.<a name=1:4793></a> There was but one who could do this; and He -- adored for ever be His name!<a name=1:4794></a> -- has done it perfectly.<a name=1:4795></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is such a thing as making my brother's sin my own, and bearing it in spirit before God, as though it were my own.<a name=1:4796></a> This is shadowed forth by Aaron's sons eating the sin offering, in the most holy place.<a name=1:4797></a> It was only the <i>sons</i> who did so.<a name=1:4798></a> "Every <i>male</i> shall eat it.<a name=1:4799></a><a href="#1:f13"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++++++</sup></a> It was the very highest order of priestly service.<a name=1:4800></a> "in the most holy place shalt thou eat it.<a name=1:4801></a>" We need to be very near to Christ in order to enter into the spiritual meaning and application of all this.<a name=1:4802></a> It is a wonderfully blessed and holy exercise; and it can only be known in the immediate presence of God.<a name=1:4803></a> How little we really know of this the heart can testify.<a name=1:4804></a> Our tendency is, when a brother has sinned, to sit in judgement upon him; to take the place of a severe censor, to look upon his sin as a something with which we have nothing whatever to do.<a name=1:4805></a> This is to fail sadly in our priestly functions.<a name=1:4806></a> It is refusing to eat the sin offering in the most holy place.<a name=1:4807></a> It is a most precious fruit of grace to be able so to identify oneself with an erring brother as to make his sin one's own -- to bear it in spirit before God.<a name=1:4808></a> This truly is a very high order of priestly service, and demands a large measure of the spirit and mind of Christ.<a name=1:4809></a> It is only the spiritual who really enter into this; and alas!<a name=1:4810></a> how few of us are truly spiritual!<a name=1:4811></a> "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, <i>ye which are spiritual</i> restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<a name=1:4812></a> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<a name=1:4813></a>" (Galatians 6: 1, 2) May the Lord give us grace to fulfil this blessed "law!<a name=1:4814></a>" How unlike it is to everything in us!<a name=1:4815></a> How it rebukes our harshness and selfishness!<a name=1:4816></a> Oh!<a name=1:4817></a> to be more like Christ in this as in All beside!<a name=1:4818></a>

		One thing, however, is clearly taught in verse 11 and that is, we must be "clean" in order to enjoy any priestly privilege, or eat of any priestly food -- clean, through the precious blood of Christ applied to our conscience -- clean, through the application of the word, by the Spirit, to our habits, associations, and ways.<a name=1:4828></a> When thus clean, whatever be our capacity, we have the richest provision made for our souls, through the precious grace of God.<a name=1:4829></a> Hearken to the following Words: "<i>All the best</i> of the oil, and <i>all the best</i> of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord, them have I given thee.<a name=1:4830></a> And whatsoever is <i>first ripe</i> in the land, which they shall bring unto the Lord, shall be thine; <i>every one who is clean</i> in thy house shall eat of it.<a name=1:4831></a>" Verses 12, 13.<a name=1:4832></a><a href="#1:f14"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++++++++++</sup></a>

		Christian reader, let us never forget that, when we look at the death of Christ, we see two things, namely, the death of a victim, and the death of a martyr -- a victim for sin, a martyr for righteousness -- a victim, under the hand of God, a martyr, under the hand of man.<a name=1:5011></a> He suffered for sin, that we might never suffer.<a name=1:5012></a> Blessed be His name for evermore!<a name=1:5013></a> But then, His martyr sufferings, His sufferings for righteousness under the hand of man, these we may know.<a name=1:5014></a> "For unto you <i>it is given</i>, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to <i>suffer</i> for his sake.<a name=1:5015></a>" (Philippians 1: 29) It is a positive <i>gift</i> to be allowed to suffer with Christ.<a name=1:5016></a> Do we esteem it?<a name=1:5017></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In contemplating the death of Christ, as typified by the ordinance of the red heifer, we see not only the complete putting away of sin, but also the judgement of this present evil world.<a name=1:5018></a> "He gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.<a name=1:5019></a>" (Gal 1: 4) Here the two things are put together by God; and, most surely, they should never be separated by us.<a name=1:5020></a> We have the judgement of sin, root and branch; and the judgement of this world.<a name=1:5021></a> The former should give perfect repose to the exercised conscience; while the latter should deliver the heart from the ensnaring influence of the world, in all its multiplied forms.<a name=1:5022></a> That purges the conscience from all sense of guilt; this snaps the link which binds the heart and the world together.<a name=1:5023></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is most needful for the reader to understand and enter experimentally into the connection existing between these two things.<a name=1:5024></a> It is quite possible to miss this grand link, even while holding and contending for a vast amount of evangelical truth and it may be confidently affirmed that where this link is missing, there must be a very serious defect in the Christian character.<a name=1:5025></a> We frequently meet with earnest souls who have been brought under the convicting and awakening power of the Holy Spirit, But who have not yet known, for the ease of their troubled consciences, the full value of the atoning death of Christ, as putting away, for ever, all their sins, and bringing them nigh to God, without a stain upon the soul, or a sting in the conscience.<a name=1:5026></a> If this be the present actual condition of the reader, he would need to consider the first clause of the verse just quoted.<a name=1:5027></a> "He gave himself for our sins.<a name=1:5028></a>" This is a most blessed statement for a troubled soul.<a name=1:5029></a> It settles the whole question of sin.<a name=1:5030></a> If it be true that Christ gave Himself for my sins, what remains for me but to rejoice in the precious fact that my sins are all gone The One who took my place, who stood charged with my sins, who suffered in my room and stead, is now at the right hand of God, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=1:5031></a> This is enough.<a name=1:5032></a> My sins are all gone for ever.<a name=1:5033></a> If they were not, <i>He</i> could not be where He now is.<a name=1:5034></a> The crown of glory which wreathes His blessed brow is the proof that my sins are perfectly atoned for, and therefore perfect peace is my portion -- a peace as perfect as the work of Christ can make it.<a name=1:5035></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, let us never forget that the very same work that has for ever put away our sins has delivered us from this present evil world.<a name=1:5036></a> The two things go together.<a name=1:5037></a> Christ has not only delivered me from the consequences of my sins, but also from the present power of sin, and from the claims and influences of that thing which scripture calls "the world.<a name=1:5038></a>" All this, however, will come more fully out as we proceed with our chapter.<a name=1:5039></a>

		"And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with His finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.<a name=1:5040></a>" Here we have the solid groundwork of all real purification.<a name=1:5041></a> we know that, in the type before us, it is only, as the inspired apostle tells us, a question of "sanctifying to me purifying of the flesh.<a name=1:5042></a>" (Hebrews 9: 13) But we have to look beyond the type to the antitype -- beyond the shadow to the substance.<a name=1:5043></a> In the sevenfold sprinkling of the blood of the red heifer, before the tabernacle of the congregation, we have a figure of the perfect presentation of the blood of Christ to God, as the only ground of the meeting-place between God and the conscience.<a name=1:5044></a> The number "seven," as has frequently been observed, is expressive of perfection; and, in the figure before us, we see the perfection attaching to the death of Christ, as an atonement for sin, presented to, and accepted by God.<a name=1:5045></a> All rests upon this divine ground.<a name=1:5046></a> The blood has been shed, and presented to a holy God, as a perfect atonement for sin.<a name=1:5047></a> This, when simply received by faith, must relieve the conscience from all sense of guilt and all fear of condemnation.<a name=1:5048></a> There is nothing before God save the perfection of the atoning work of Christ.<a name=1:5049></a> Sin has been judged and our sins put away.<a name=1:5050></a> They have been completely obliterated by the precious blood of Christ.<a name=1:5051></a> To believe this is to enter into perfect repose of conscience.<a name=1:5052></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here let the reader carefully note that there is no further allusion to the sprinkling of blood throughout the entire of this singularly interesting chapter.<a name=1:5053></a> This is precisely in keeping with the doctrine of Hebrews 9, 10.<a name=1:5054></a> It is but another illustration of the divine harmony of the Volume.<a name=1:5055></a> The sacrifice of Christ, being divinely perfect, needs not to be repeated.<a name=1:5056></a> Its efficacy is divine and eternal.<a name=1:5057></a> "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.<a name=1:5058></a> For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and <i>the ashes of an heifer</i>, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<a name=1:5059></a> (Hebrews 9: 11-14.<a name=1:5060></a>) Observe the force of these two words, "<i>once</i>" and "<i>eternal</i>.<a name=1:5061></a>" See how they set forth the completeness and divine efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=1:5062></a> The blood was shed once and for ever.<a name=1:5063></a> To think of a repetition of that great work would be to deny its everlasting and all-sufficient value, and reduce it to the level of the blood of bulls and goats.<a name=1:5064></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, further," It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.<a name=1:5065></a> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; nor yet <i>that He should offer Himself often</i>, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then <i>must He often have suffered</i> since the foundation of the world; but now, once in the end of the world hath he appeared to <i>put away sin</i> by the sacrifice of himself.<a name=1:5066></a>" Sin therefore, has been put away.<a name=1:5067></a> It cannot be put away, and, at the same time, be on the believer's conscience.<a name=1:5068></a> This is plain.<a name=1:5069></a> It must either be admitted that the believer's sins are blotted out, and his conscience perfectly purged, or that Christ must die over again.<a name=1:5070></a> But this latter is not only needless, but wholly out of the question; for, as the apostle goes on to say, "As it is appointed unto men <i>once</i> to die, but after this the judgement; so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation.<a name=1:5071></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something most marvellous in the patient elaborateness with which the Holy Ghost argues out this entire subject.<a name=1:5072></a> He expounds, illustrates, and enforces the great doctrine of the completeness of the sacrifice in such a way, as to carry conviction to the soul, and relieve the conscience of its heavy burden.<a name=1:5073></a> Such is the exceeding grace of God that He can not only accomplished the work of eternal redemption for us, But, in the most patient and painstaking manner, has argued and reasoned, and proved the whole point in question, so as not to leave one hair's breadth of ground on which to base an objection.<a name=1:5074></a> Let us hearken to His further powerful reasonings, and may the Spirit apply them in power to the heart of the anxious reader.<a name=1:5075></a>

		It may be, however, that the reader is ready to say, in reply to all that we have been seeking to urge upon him," I do not, in the least, doubt the efficacy of the blood of Jesus.<a name=1:5114></a> I believe it cleanseth from all sin.<a name=1:5115></a> I believe, most thoroughly, that all who simply put their trust in that blood are perfectly safe, and will be eternally happy.<a name=1:5116></a> My difficulty does not lie here at all.<a name=1:5117></a> What troubles me is, not the efficacy of the blood, in which I fully believe, but <i>my own personal interest in that blood</i>, of which I have no satisfactory evidence.<a name=1:5118></a> This is the secret of all my trouble.<a name=1:5119></a> The doctrine of the blood is as clear as a sunbeam; but the question of my interest therein is involved in hopeless obscurity.<a name=1:5120></a>"

		Now if this be at all the embodiment of the reader's feelings on this momentous subject, it only proves the necessity of his deeply pondering the fourth verse of the nineteenth of Numbers.<a name=1:5121></a> There he will see that the true basis of all purification is found in this, that the blood of atonement has been presented to God, and accepted by Him.<a name=1:5122></a> This is a most precious truth, but one little understood.<a name=1:5123></a> It is of all importance that the really anxious soul should have a clear view of the subject of atonement.<a name=1:5124></a> It is so natural to us all to be occupied with our thoughts and feelings about the blood of Christ, rather than with the blood itself, and with God's thoughts respecting it.<a name=1:5125></a> If the blood has been perfectly presented to God, if He has accepted it, if He has glorified Himself in the putting away of sin, then what remains for the divinely exercised conscience but to find perfect repose in that which has met all the claims of God, harmonised His attributes, and laid the foundations of that marvellous platform whereon a sin-hating God and a poor sin-destroyed sinner can meet?<a name=1:5126></a> Why introduce the question of my interest in the blood of Christ, as though that work were not complete without anything of mine, call it what you will, my interest, my feelings, my experience, my appreciation, my appropriation, my anything?<a name=1:5127></a> Why not rest in Christ alone?<a name=1:5128></a> This would be really having an interest in Him.<a name=1:5129></a> But the very moment the heart gets occupied with the question of its own interest -- the moment the eye is withdrawn from that divine object which the word of God and the Holy Ghost present -- then spiritual darkness and perplexity must ensue; and the soul, instead of rejoicing in the perfection of the work of Christ, is tormented by looking at its own poor, imperfect feelings.<a name=1:5130></a>

		It is the purpose of God that His children should be purified from all iniquity, and that they should walk in separation from this present evil world, where all is death and defilement.<a name=1:5180></a> this separation is effected by the action of the word on the heart, by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=1:5181></a> "Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for our sins, that he might deliver as from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.<a name=1:5182></a>" (Galatians 1: 4) And again, "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might <i>redeem</i> us from all iniquity, and <i>purify</i> unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<a name=1:5183></a>" Titus 2: 13, 14.<a name=1:5184></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Scarlet" is viewed, by those who have carefully examined scripture on the point, as the type or expression of human splendour, worldly grandeur, the glory of this world, the glory of man.<a name=1:5200></a> Hence, therefore, we see in the burning of the heifer, the end of all worldly greatness, human glory, and the complete setting aside of the flesh, with all its belongings.<a name=1:5201></a> This renders the burning of the heifer deeply significant.<a name=1:5202></a> It shadows forth a truth too little known, and, when known, too readily forgotten -- a truth embodied in these memorable words of the apostle, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, Whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.<a name=1:5203></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are all far too prone to accept the cross as the ground of escape from all the consequences of our sins, and of full acceptance with God, and, at the same time, refuse it as the ground of our complete separation from the world.<a name=1:5204></a> True it is, thanks and praise be to our God, the solid ground of our deliverance from guilt and consequent condemnation; but it is more than this.<a name=1:5205></a> It has severed us, for ever, from all that pertains to this world, through which we are passing.<a name=1:5206></a> Are my sins put away Yes; blessed be the God of all grace!<a name=1:5207></a> according to what?<a name=1:5208></a> According to the perfection of Christ's atoning sacrifice as estimated by God Himself.<a name=1:5209></a> Well then, such, precisely, is the measure of our deliverance from this present evil world -- from its fashions, its maxims, its habits, its principles.<a name=1:5210></a> The believer has absolutely nothing in common with this world, in so far as he enters into the spirit and power of the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:5211></a> That cross has dislodged him from everything here below, and made him a pilgrim and a stranger in this world.<a name=1:5212></a> The truly devoted heart sees the dark shadow of the cross looming over all the glitter and glare, the pomp and fashion of this world.<a name=1:5213></a> Paul saw this, and the sight of it caused him to esteem the world, in its very highest aspect, in its most attractive forms, in its brightest glories, as dross.<a name=1:5214></a>
	</div>

		But here let us ask, Why is not this great practical truth more pressed home upon the hearts of evangelical Christians at the present moment?<a name=1:5219></a> Why are we so slow to urge upon one another the separating power of the cross of Christ?<a name=1:5220></a> If my heart loves Jesus, I shall not seek a place, a portion, or a name where He found only a malefactor's cross.<a name=1:5221></a> This, dear reader, is the simple way to look at the matter.<a name=1:5222></a> Do you really love Christ?<a name=1:5223></a> Has your heart been touched and attracted by His wondrous love to you?<a name=1:5224></a> If so, remember that He was cast out by this world.<a name=1:5225></a> Yes, Jesus was, and still is, an outcast from this world.<a name=1:5226></a> There is no change.<a name=1:5227></a> The world is the world still; and be it remembered, that one of Satan's special devices is to lead people to accept salvation from Christ, while, at the same time, they refuse to be identified with Him in His rejection -- to avail themselves of the atoning work of the cross, while abiding comfortably in the world that is stained with the guilt of nailing Christ thereto.<a name=1:5228></a> In other words, he leads people to think and to say that the offence of the cross has ceased; that the world of the nineteenth century is totally different from the world of the first; that if the Lord Jesus were on earth now He would meet with very different treatment from that which He received then; that it is not now a pagan world, but a Christian one, and this makes a material and a fundamental difference; that now it is quite right for a Christian to accept of citizenship in this world, to have a name, a place, and a portion here, seeing it is not the same world at all, as that which nailed the Son of God to Calvary's cursed tree.<a name=1:5229></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we feel it incumbent on us to press upon all who read these lines that this is, in very deed, a lie of the arch-enemy of souls.<a name=1:5230></a> The world is not changed.<a name=1:5231></a> It may have changed its dress, But it has not changed its nature, its spirit, its principles.<a name=1:5232></a> It hates Jesus as cordially as when the cry went forth," Away with him!<a name=1:5233></a> Crucify him!<a name=1:5234></a>" There is really no change.<a name=1:5235></a> If only we try the world by the same grand test, we shall find it to be the same evil, God-hating, Christ-rejecting world as ever.<a name=1:5236></a> And what is that test?<a name=1:5237></a> Christ crucified.<a name=1:5238></a> May this solemn truth be engraved on our hearts!<a name=1:5239></a> May we realise and manifest its formative power!<a name=1:5240></a> May it detach us more completely from all that belongs to the world!<a name=1:5241></a> May we be enabled to understand more fully the truth presented in the ashes of the red heifer!<a name=1:5242></a> Then shall our separation from the world, and our dedication to Christ, be more intense and real.<a name=1:5243></a> The Lord, in His exceeding goodness, grant that thus it may be, with all His people, in this day of hollow, worldly, half-and-half profession!<a name=1:5244></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.<a name=1:5246></a> He shall purify Himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.<a name=1:5247></a> Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.<a name=1:5248></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a solemn thing to have to do with God -- to walk with Him, from day to day, in the midst of a defiled and defiling scene.<a name=1:5249></a> He cannot tolerate any uncleanness upon those with whom He deigns to walk, and in whom He dwells.<a name=1:5250></a> He can pardon and blot out; He can heal, cleanse, and restore; but He cannot sanction unjudged evil, or suffer it upon His people.<a name=1:5251></a> It would be a denial of His very name and nature were He to do so.<a name=1:5252></a> This, while deeply solemn, is truly blessed.<a name=1:5253></a> It is our joy to have to do with One whose presence demands and secures holiness.<a name=1:5254></a> We are passing through a world in which we are surrounded with defiling influences.<a name=1:5255></a> True, defilement is not now contracted by touching "a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave.<a name=1:5256></a>" These things were, as we know, types of things moral and spiritual with which we are in danger of coming in contact every day and every hour.<a name=1:5257></a> We doubt not but those who have much to do with the things of this world are most painfully sensible of the immense difficulty of escaping with unsoiled hands.<a name=1:5258></a> Hence the need of holy diligence in all our habits and associations, lest we contract defilement, and interrupt our communion with God.<a name=1:5259></a> He must have us in a condition worthy of Himself.<a name=1:5260></a> "Be ye holy, for I am holy.<a name=1:5261></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the anxious reader, whose whole soul breathes after holiness, may eagerly inquire, "What, then, are we to do, if it be true that we are thus surrounded, on all hands, with defiling influences, and if we are so prone to contract that defilement?<a name=1:5262></a> Furthermore, if it is impossible to have fellowship with God, with unclean hands and a condemning conscience, What are we to do?<a name=1:5263></a>" First of all, then, we should say, be watchful.<a name=1:5264></a> Wait much and earnestly on God.<a name=1:5265></a> He is faithful and gracious -- a prayer-hearing and a prayer-answering God -- a liberal and an unupbraiding Giver.<a name=1:5266></a> "He giveth more grace.<a name=1:5267></a>" This is, positively, a blank cheque which faith can fill up to any amount.<a name=1:5268></a> Is it the real purpose of your soul to get on, to advance in the divine life, to grow in personal holiness?<a name=1:5269></a> Then beware how you continue, for a single hour, in contact with what soils your hands and wounds your conscience, grieves the Holy Ghost, and mars your communion.<a name=1:5270></a> Be decided.<a name=1:5271></a> Be whole-hearted.<a name=1:5272></a> Give up, at once, the unclean thing, whatever it be, habit, or association, or anything else.<a name=1:5273></a> Cost what it may, give it up.<a name=1:5274></a> Entail what loss it may, abandon it.<a name=1:5275></a> No worldly gain, no earthly advantage, could compensate for the loss of a pure conscience, an uncondemning heart, and the light of your Father's countenance.<a name=1:5276></a> Are you not convinced of this?<a name=1:5277></a> If so, seek grace to carry out your conviction.<a name=1:5278></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it may be further asked, "What is to be done when defilement is actually contracted?<a name=1:5279></a> How is the defilement to be removed?<a name=1:5280></a>" Hear the reply in the figurative language of Numbers 19.<a name=1:5281></a> "And for an unclean person, they shall take of the <i>ashes</i> of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel.<a name=1:5282></a> And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave.<a name=1:5283></a> And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe Himself in water, and shall be clean at even.<a name=1:5284></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will remark that, in the twelfth and eighteenth verses, there is a double action set forth.<a name=1:5285></a> There is the action of the third day, and the action of the seventh day.<a name=1:5286></a> Both were essentially necessary to remove the ceremonial defilement caused by contact with the varied forms of death above specified.<a name=1:5287></a> Now, what did this double action typify?<a name=1:5288></a> What is it that, in our spiritual history, answers thereto?<a name=1:5289></a> we believe it to be this.<a name=1:5290></a> When we, through lack of watchfulness and spiritual energy, touch the unclean thing and get defiled, we may be ignorant of it; but God knows all about it.<a name=1:5291></a> He cares for us, and is looking after us; not, blessed be His name, as an angry judge, or stern censor, but as a loving father, who will never impute anything to us, because it was all, long ago, imputed to the One who died in our stead.<a name=1:5292></a> But, though He will never impute it to us, He will make us feel it deeply and keenly.<a name=1:5293></a> He will be a faithful reprover of the unclean thing; and He can reprove all the more powerfully simply because He will never reckon it against us.<a name=1:5294></a> The holy Spirit brings our sin to remembrance, and this causes unutterable anguish of heart.<a name=1:5295></a> This anguish may continue for some time.<a name=1:5296></a> It may be moments, days, months, or years.<a name=1:5297></a> We once met with a young Christian, who was rendered miserable, for three years, by having gone with some worldly friends on an excursion.<a name=1:5298></a> This convicting operation of the holy Ghost we believe to be shadowed forth by the action of the third day.<a name=1:5299></a> He first brings our sin to remembrance; and then He graciously brings to our remembrance, and applies to our souls, through the written word, the value of the death of Christ as that which has already met the defilement which we so easily contract.<a name=1:5300></a> This answers to the action of the seventh day -- removes the defilement and restores our communion.<a name=1:5301></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, be it carefully remembered, that we can never get rid of defilement in any other way.<a name=1:5302></a> We may seek to forget, to slur over, to heal the wound slightly, to make little of the matter, to let time obliterate it from the tablet of memory.<a name=1:5303></a> It will never do.<a name=1:5304></a> Nay, it is most dangerous work.<a name=1:5305></a> There are few things more disastrous than trifling with conscience or the claims of holiness.<a name=1:5306></a> And it is as foolish as it is dangerous; for God has, in His grace, made full provision for the removal of the uncleanness which His holiness detects and condemns.<a name=1:5307></a> But the uncleanness must be removed, else communion is impossible.<a name=1:5308></a> "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<a name=1:5309></a>" the suspension of a believers communion is what answers to the cutting off of a member from the congregation of Israel.<a name=1:5310></a> The Christian can never be cut off from Christ; but his communion can be interrupted by a single sinful thought, and that sinful thought must be judged and confessed, and the soil of it removed, ere the communion can be restored.<a name=1:5311></a> It is well to remember this.<a name=1:5312></a> It is a serious thing to trifle with sin.<a name=1:5313></a> We may rest assured we cannot possibly have fellowship with God and walk in defilement.<a name=1:5314></a> To think so, is to blaspheme the very name, the very nature, the very throne and majesty of God.<a name=1:5315></a> No, dear reader, we must keep a clean conscience, and maintain the holiness of God, else we shall, very soon, make shipwreck of faith and break down altogether.<a name=1:5316></a> May the Lord keep us walking softly and tenderly, watchfully and prayerfully, until we have laid aside our bodies of sin and death, and entered upon that bright and blessed world above, where sin, death, and defilement are unknown.<a name=1:5317></a>

		In all this, we read, in unmistakable characters, the holiness of God; but we read also, as distinctly, the grace of God.<a name=1:5324></a> If divine holiness could not suffer defilement upon the people, divine grace made ample provision for the removal thereof.<a name=1:5325></a> This provision is set forth in our chapter under two forms, namely, the blood of atonement, and the water of separation.<a name=1:5326></a> Precious provision!<a name=1:5327></a> a provision illustrating, at once, the holiness and the grace of God.<a name=1:5328></a> Did we not know the ample provisions of divine grace, the lofty claims of divine holiness would be perfectly overwhelming; but being assured of the former, we can heartily rejoice in the latter.<a name=1:5329></a> Could we desire to see the standard of divine holiness lowered a single hair's breadth?<a name=1:5330></a> Far be the thought.<a name=1:5331></a> How could we, or why should we, seeing that divine grace has fully provided what divine holiness demands?<a name=1:5332></a> An Israelite of old might shudder as he hearkened to such words as these, "He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.<a name=1:5333></a>" and again, "Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel.<a name=1:5334></a>" Such words might indeed terrify his heart.<a name=1:5335></a> He might feel led to exclaim, "What am I to do?<a name=1:5336></a> How can I ever get on?<a name=1:5337></a> It seems perfectly impossible for me to escape defilement.<a name=1:5338></a>" But, then, what of the ashes of the burnt heifer?<a name=1:5339></a> What of the water of separation?<a name=1:5340></a> What could these mean?<a name=1:5341></a> They set forth the memorial of the sacrificial death of Christ, applied to the heart by the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=1:5342></a> "He shall purify himself with it the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.<a name=1:5343></a>" If we contract defilement, even though it be through negligence, that defilement must be removed, ere our communion can be restored.<a name=1:5344></a> But we cannot get rid of the soil by any effort of our own.<a name=1:5345></a> It can only be by the use of God's gracious provision, even the water of purification.<a name=1:5346></a> An Israelite could no more remove by his own efforts the defilement caused by the touch of a dead body, than he could have broken Pharaoh's yoke, or delivered himself from the lash of Pharaoh's taskmasters.<a name=1:5347></a>

		And let the reader observe that it was not a question of offering a fresh sacrifice, nor yet of a fresh application of the blood.<a name=1:5348></a> It is of special importance that this should be distinctly seen and understood.<a name=1:5349></a> The death of Christ cannot be repeated.<a name=1:5350></a> "Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him, For in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, He liveth unto God.<a name=1:5351></a>" We stand, by the grace of God, in the full credit and value of the death of Christ; But, inasmuch as we are surrounded, on all sides, by temptations and snares; and as we have, within us, such capabilities and tendencies; and, further, seeing we have a powerful adversary who is ever on the watch to ensnare us, and lead us off the path of truth and purity, we could not get on for a single moment, were it not for the gracious way in which our God has provided for all our exigencies, in the precious death and all-prevailing advocacy of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:5352></a> It is not merely that the blood of Jesus Christ has washed away all our sins, and reconciled us to a Holy God, but "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=1:5353></a>" "He ever liveth to make intercession for us," and "He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.<a name=1:5354></a>" He is ever in the presence of God for us.<a name=1:5355></a> He represents us there, and maintains us in the divine integrity of the place and relationship in which His atoning death has set us.<a name=1:5356></a> Our case can never, by any possibility, fall through, in the hands of such an Advocate.<a name=1:5357></a> He must cease to live, ere the very feeblest of His saints can perish.<a name=1:5358></a> We are identified with Him and He with us.<a name=1:5359></a>

		Now, then, Christian reader, what should be the practical effect of all this grace upon our hearts and lives?<a name=1:5360></a> when we think of the death, and of the burning -- of the blood, and of the ashes -- of the atoning sacrifice, and the interceding Priest and Advocate, what influence should it exert upon our souls?<a name=1:5361></a> How should it act upon our consciences?<a name=1:5362></a> Should it lead us to think little of sin!<a name=1:5363></a> Should it cause us to walk carelessly and indifferently?<a name=1:5364></a> Should it have the effect of making as light and frivolous in our ways?<a name=1:5365></a> Alas!<a name=1:5366></a> for the heart that can think so.<a name=1:5367></a> We may rest assured of this, that the man who can draw a plea, from the rich provisions of divine grace, for lightness of conduct or levity of spirit, knows very little, if indeed he knows anything at all, of the true nature or proper influence of grace and its provisions.<a name=1:5368></a> Could we imagine, for a moment, that the ashes of the heifer or the water of separation would have had the effect of making an Israelite careless as to his walk?<a name=1:5369></a> Assuredly not.<a name=1:5370></a> On the contrary, the very fact of such careful provision being made, by the goodness of God, against defilement, would make him feel what a serious thing it was to contract it.<a name=1:5371></a> Such, at least, would be the proper effect of the provisions of divine grace.<a name=1:5372></a> The heap of ashes, laid up in a clean place, gave forth a double testimony; it testified of the goodness of God; and it testified of the hatefulness of sin.<a name=1:5373></a> It declared that God could not suffer uncleanness upon His people; but it declared also that He had provided the means of removing it.<a name=1:5374></a> It is utterly impossible that the blessed doctrine of the sprinkled blood, of the ashes, and of the water of separation, can be understood and enjoyed, without its producing a holy horror of sin in all its defiling forms.<a name=1:5375></a> And we may further assert that no one who has ever felt the anguish of a defiled conscience could lightly contract defilement.<a name=1:5376></a> A pure conscience is Far too precious a treasure to be lightly parted with; and a defiled conscience is far too heavy a burden to be lightly taken up.<a name=1:5377></a> But, blessed be the God of all grace, He has met all our need, in His own perfect way; and, He has met it, too, not to make us careless, but to make us watchful.<a name=1:5378></a> "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.<a name=1:5379></a>" But then he adds, "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=1:5380></a> And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the whole world.<a name=1:5381></a>" 1 John.<a name=1:5382></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must draw this section to a close, and shall merely add a word on the closing verses of our chapter.<a name=1:5383></a> "And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.<a name=1:5384></a> and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean, and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.<a name=1:5385></a>" (Numbers 19: 21, 22) In verse 18, we are taught that it needed a clean person to sprinkle the unclean; and in verse 21, we are taught that the act of sprinkling another defiled oneself.<a name=1:5386></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Putting both these together, we learn, as another has said, "That any one who has to do with the sin of another, though it be in the way of duty, to cleanse it, is defiled; not as the guilty person, it is true, but we cannot touch sin without being defiled.<a name=1:5387></a>" And we learn also that, in order to lead another into the enjoyment of the cleansing virtue of Christ's work, I must be in the enjoyment of that cleansing work myself.<a name=1:5388></a> It is well to remember this.<a name=1:5389></a> Those who applied the water of separation to others had to use that water for themselves.<a name=1:5390></a> May our souls enter into this!<a name=1:5391></a> May we ever abide in the sense of the perfect cleanness into which the death of Christ introduces us, and in which His priestly work maintains us!<a name=1:5392></a> And oh!<a name=1:5393></a> let us never forget that <i>contact with evil defiles</i>.<a name=1:5394></a> It was so under the Mosaic economy, and it is so now.<a name=1:5395></a>

		Still there are the scenes of sorrow and trial in the desert; and we have to go through them.<a name=1:5437></a> Thus it was with Israel, in the chapter before us.<a name=1:5438></a> They were called to meet the keen blasts of the wilderness, and they met them with accents of impatience and discontent.<a name=1:5439></a> "And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.<a name=1:5440></a> And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord!<a name=1:5441></a> And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?<a name=1:5442></a> And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us unto this evil place?<a name=1:5443></a> It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.<a name=1:5444></a>" Verses 2-5.<a name=1:5445></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was a deeply trying moment to the spirit of Moses.<a name=1:5446></a> We can form no conception of what it must have been to encounter six hundred thousand murmurers, and to be obliged to listen to their bitter invectives, and to hear himself charged with all the misfortunes which their own unbelief had conjured up before them.<a name=1:5447></a> All this was no ordinary trial of patience; and, most assuredly, we need not marvel if that dear and honoured servant found the occasion too much for him.<a name=1:5448></a> "And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.<a name=1:5449></a>" Verse 6.<a name=1:5450></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is deeply touching to find Moses, again and again, on his face before God.<a name=1:5451></a> It was a sweet relief, to make his escape from a tumultuous host, and betake himself to the only One whose resources were adequate to meet such an occasion.<a name=1:5452></a> "They fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.<a name=1:5453></a>" They do not appear, on this occasion, to have attempted any reply to the people; "they went from the presence of the assembly" and cast themselves upon the living God.<a name=1:5454></a> They could not possibly have done better.<a name=1:5455></a> Who But the God of all grace could meet the ten thousand necessities of wilderness life?<a name=1:5456></a> Well had Moses said, at the very beginning, "If thy presence go not with us, carry as not up hence.<a name=1:5457></a>" Assuredly, he was right and wise in so expressing himself.<a name=1:5458></a> The divine presence was the only answer to the demand of such a congregation.<a name=1:5459></a> But that presence was an all-sufficient answer.<a name=1:5460></a> God's treasury is absolutely inexhaustible.<a name=1:5461></a> He can never fail a trusting heart.<a name=1:5462></a> Let us remember this.<a name=1:5463></a> God delights to be used.<a name=1:5464></a> He never grows weary of ministering to the need of His people.<a name=1:5465></a> If this were ever kept in the remembrance of the thoughts of our hearts, we should hear less of the accents of impatience and discontent, and more of the sweet language of thankfulness and praise.<a name=1:5466></a> But, as we have had frequent occasion to remark, desert life tests every one.<a name=1:5467></a> it proves what is in us; and, thanks be to God, it brings out what is in <i>Him</i> for us.<a name=1:5468></a>

		"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.<a name=1:5469></a> and Moses took <i>the</i> rod from before the Lord as he commanded him.<a name=1:5470></a> And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock; and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?<a name=1:5471></a> And Moses lifted up his hand, and with <i>his</i> rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly; and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.<a name=1:5472></a>" Verse 7-11.<a name=1:5473></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two objects, in the foregoing quotation, demand the readers attention, namely, "The Rock," and "The Rod.<a name=1:5474></a>" They both present Christ, most blessedly, to the soul; but in two distinct aspects.<a name=1:5475></a> In 1 Corinthians 10: 4, we read, "They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.<a name=1:5476></a>" This is Plain and positive.<a name=1:5477></a> It leaves no room whatever for the exercise of the imagination.<a name=1:5478></a> "That Rock was Christ" -- Christ smitten for us.<a name=1:5479></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as regards "the rod," we must remember that it was not the rod of Moses -- the rod of authority -- the rod of power.<a name=1:5480></a> This would not suit the occasion before us.<a name=1:5481></a> It had done its work.<a name=1:5482></a> It had smitten the rock once, and that was enough.<a name=1:5483></a> This we learn from Exodus 17, where we read, "The Lord said onto Moses, go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and <i>thy</i> rod, <i>wherewith thou smotest the river</i> (see Exodus 7: 20), take in thine hand and go.<a name=1:5484></a> Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.<a name=1:5485></a> And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.<a name=1:5486></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have a type of Christ smitten for us, by the hand of God, in judgement.<a name=1:5487></a> The reader will note the expression, "Thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river.<a name=1:5488></a>" Why the river?<a name=1:5489></a> Why should this particular stroke of the rod be referred to?<a name=1:5490></a> Exodus 7: 20 furnishes the reply.<a name=1:5491></a> "And be (Moses) lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river <i>were turned to blood</i>.<a name=1:5492></a>" It was the rod which turned the water into blood that was to smite "that Rock which was Christ" in order that streams of life and refreshment might flow for us.<a name=1:5493></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this smiting could only take place once.<a name=1:5494></a> It is never to be repeated.<a name=1:5495></a> "Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.<a name=1:5496></a> For in that he died, he died unto sin <i>once</i>: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<a name=1:5497></a>" (Romans 6: 9, 10) "But now <i>once</i> in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .<a name=1:5498></a>.<a name=1:5499></a>.<a name=1:5500></a> .<a name=1:5501></a>.<a name=1:5502></a>so Christ was <i>once</i> offered to bear the sins of many.<a name=1:5503></a>'' (Hebrews 9: 26, 27) "For Christ also hath <i>once</i> suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.<a name=1:5504></a>" 1 Peter 3: 18.<a name=1:5505></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no repetition of the death of Christ; and hence Moses was wrong in smiting the rock twice with <i>his</i> rod -- wrong in smiting it at all.<a name=1:5506></a> He was commanded to take "<i>the rod</i>, Aaron's rod -- the priestly rod, and speak to the rock.<a name=1:5507></a> The atoning work is done, and now our great High Priest has passed into the heavens, there to appear in the presence of God for us, and the streams of spiritual refreshment flow to us, on the ground of accomplished redemption, and in connection with Christ's priestly ministry, of which Aaron's budding rod is the exquisite figure.<a name=1:5508></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, then, it was a grave mistake for Moses to smite the rock a second time -- a mistake to use his rod in the matter at all.<a name=1:5509></a> To have smitten with Aaron's rod would, as we can easily understand, have spoiled its lovely blossom.<a name=1:5510></a> A word would have sufficed, in connection with the rod of priesthood -- the rod of grace.<a name=1:5511></a> Moses failed to see this -- failed to glorify God.<a name=1:5512></a> He spoke unadvisedly with his lips; and as a consequence he was prohibited going over Jordan.<a name=1:5513></a> His rod could not take the people over -- for what could mere authority do with a murmuring host -- and he was not suffered to go over himself because he failed to sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of the congregation.<a name=1:5514></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Jehovah took care of His own glory.<a name=1:5515></a> He sanctified Himself before the people; and, notwithstanding their rebellious murmurings, and Moses' sad mistake and failure, the congregation of the Lord received a gushing stream from the smitten rock.<a name=1:5516></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor was this all.<a name=1:5517></a> It was not merely that grace triumphed in furnishing Israel's murmuring hosts with drink; but even in reference to Moses himself, it shines out most brilliantly, as we may see in Deuteronomy 34.<a name=1:5518></a> It was grace that brought Moses to the top of Pisgah and showed him the land of Canaan from thence.<a name=1:5519></a> It was grace that led Jehovah to provide a grave for His servant and bury him therein.<a name=1:5520></a> It was better to see the land of Canaan, in company with God, than to enter it in company with Israel.<a name=1:5521></a> And yet we must not forget that Moses was prevented entering the land because of the unadvised speaking.<a name=1:5522></a> God, in government, kept Moses out of Canaan.<a name=1:5523></a> God, in grace, brought Moses up to Pisgah.<a name=1:5524></a> These two facts, in the history of Moses, illustrate, very forcibly, the distinction between grace and government -- a subject of the deepest interest, and of great practical value.<a name=1:5525></a> Grace pardons and blesses; but government takes its course.<a name=1:5526></a> Let us ever remember this.<a name=1:5527></a> "Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.<a name=1:5528></a>" This principle runs through all the ways of God in government, and nothing can be more solemn; nevertheless "grace reigns through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=1:5529></a>" All praise to Him who is at once, the fountain and the channel of this grace!<a name=1:5530></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verses 14-20 of our chapter, we have the correspondence between Moses and the king of Edom.<a name=1:5531></a> It is instructive and interesting to notice the style of each, and to compare it with the history given in Genesis 32, 33.<a name=1:5532></a> Esau had a serious grudge against Jacob; and albeit, through the direct interposition of God, he was not suffered to touch a hair of his brother's head, still, on the other hand, Israel must not meddle with Esau's possessions.<a name=1:5533></a> Jacob had supplanted Esau; and Israel must not molest Edom.<a name=1:5534></a> "Command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore.<a name=1:5535></a> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth, because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.<a name=1:5536></a> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.<a name=1:5537></a> (Deuteronomy 2: 4-6.<a name=1:5538></a>) Thus we see that the same God who would not suffer Esau to touch Jacob, in Genesis 33, now will not suffer Israel to touch Edom, in Numbers 20.<a name=1:5539></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The closing paragraph of Numbers 20 is deeply touching.<a name=1:5540></a> We shall not quote it, but the reader should refer to it, and compare it carefully with the scene in Exodus 4: 1-17.<a name=1:5541></a> Moses had deemed Aaron's companionship indispensable; but he afterwards found him to be a sore thorn in his side, and here he is compelled to strip him of his robes and see him gathered to his fathers.<a name=1:5542></a> All this is very admonitory, in whatever way we view it, whether as regards Moses or Aaron.<a name=1:5543></a> We have already referred to this instructive piece of history, and therefore we shall not dwell upon it here; but may the good Lord engrave its solemn lesson deeply upon the tablets of our hearts!<a name=1:5544></a>

		This chapter brings prominently before us the familiar and beautiful ordinance of the brazen Serpent -- that great evangelical type.<a name=1:5545></a> "And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.<a name=1:5546></a> And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?<a name=1:5547></a> for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.<a name=1:5548></a>" Verses 4, 5.<a name=1:5549></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Alas!<a name=1:5550></a> alas!<a name=1:5551></a> it is the same sad story, over and over again -- "The murmurs of the wilderness.<a name=1:5552></a>" It was all well enough to escape out of Egypt, when the terrific judgements of God were falling upon it in rapid succession.<a name=1:5553></a> At such a moment, there was but little attraction in the flesh pots, the leaks, the onions, and the garlic, when they stood connected with the heavy plagues sent forth from the hand of an offended God.<a name=1:5554></a> But now the plagues are forgotten, and the flesh pots alone remembered.<a name=1:5555></a> "Would to God we had died at the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.<a name=1:5556></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What language!<a name=1:5557></a> man would rather sit by the flesh pots, in a land of death and darkness, than walk with God through the wilderness, and eat bread from heaven.<a name=1:5558></a> The Lord Himself had brought His glory down into connection with the very sand of the desert, because His redeemed were there.<a name=1:5559></a> He had come down to bear withal their provocation -- to "suffer their manners in the wilderness.<a name=1:5560></a>" All this grace and exceeding condescension might well have called forth in them a spirit of grateful and humble subjection.<a name=1:5561></a> But no; the very earliest appearance of trial was sufficient to elicit from them the cry, "Would to God we had died in the land of Egypt!<a name=1:5562></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, they were very speedily made to taste the bitter fruits of their murmuring spirit.<a name=1:5563></a> "The Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.<a name=1:5564></a>" (verse 6) The serpent was the source of their discontent; and their condition, when bitten of the serpents, was well calculated to reveal to them the true <i>character</i> of their discontent.<a name=1:5565></a> If the Lord's people will not walk happily and contentedly with Him, they must taste the power of the serpent -- alas!<a name=1:5566></a> a terrible power, in whatever way it may be experienced.<a name=1:5567></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The serpents' bite brought Israel to a sense of their sin.<a name=1:5568></a> "Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us.<a name=1:5569></a>" Verse 7.<a name=1:5570></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, was the moment for divine grace to display itself.<a name=1:5571></a> Man's need has ever been the occasion for the display of God's grace and mercy.<a name=1:5572></a> The moment Israel could say, "We have sinned," there was no further hindrance.<a name=1:5573></a> God could act, and this was enough.<a name=1:5574></a> When Israel murmured, the serpents' bite was the answer.<a name=1:5575></a> When Israel confessed, God's grace was the answer.<a name=1:5576></a> In the one case, the serpent was the instrument of their wretchedness; in the other, it was the instrument of their restoration and blessing.<a name=1:5577></a> "And the Lord said unto Moses, make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten.<a name=1:5578></a> when he looketh upon it, shall live.<a name=1:5579></a>" (verse 8.<a name=1:5580></a>) the very image of that which had done the mischief was set up to be the channel through which divine grace might flow down, in rich abundance, to poor wounded sinners.<a name=1:5581></a> Striking and beautiful type of Christ on the cross!<a name=1:5582></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very common error to view the Lord Jesus rather as the averter of God's wrath, than as the channel of His love.<a name=1:5583></a> That He endured the wrath of God against sin is most preciously true.<a name=1:5584></a> But there is more than this.<a name=1:5585></a> He has come down into this wretched world to die upon the cursed tree, in order that, by dying, He might open up the everlasting springs of the love of God to the heart of poor rebellious man.<a name=1:5586></a> This makes a vast difference in the presentation of God's nature and character to the sinner, which is of the very last importance.<a name=1:5587></a> Nothing can ever bring a sinner back to a state of true happiness and holiness, but his being fully established in the faith and enjoyment of the love of God.<a name=1:5588></a> The very first effort of the serpent, when, in the garden of Eden, he assailed the creature, was to shake his confidence in the kindness and love of God, and thus produce discontent with the place in which God had set him.<a name=1:5589></a> Man's fall was the result -- the immediate result of his doubting the love of God.<a name=1:5590></a> Man's recovery must flow from his belief of that love; and it is the Son of God himself who says, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him Should not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=1:5591></a>" John 3: 16.<a name=1:5592></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is in close connection with the foregoing statement that our Lord expressly teaches that He was the Antitype of the brazen serpent.<a name=1:5593></a> As the Son of God sent forth from the Father, He was, most assuredly, the gift and expression of God's love to a perishing world.<a name=1:5594></a> But He was also to be lifted up upon the cross in atonement for sin, for <i>only</i> thus could divine love meet the necessities of the dying sinner.<a name=1:5595></a> "As Moses lilted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<a name=1:5596></a>" The whole human family have felt the serpent's deadly sting; but the God of all grace has found a remedy in the One who was lifted up on the cursed tree; and now, by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, He calls on all those who feel themselves bitten, to look to Jesus for life and peace.<a name=1:5597></a> Christ is God's great ordinance, and through Him a full, free, present, and eternal salvation is proclaimed to the sinner -- a salvation so complete, so well based, so consistent with all the attributes of the divine character and all the claims of the throne of God, that Satan cannot raise a single question about it.<a name=1:5598></a> Resurrection is the divine vindication of the work of the cross, and the glory of Him who died thereon, so that the believer may enjoy the most profound repose in reference to sin.<a name=1:5599></a> God is well pleased in Jesus; and, inasmuch as He views all believers in Him, He is well pleased in them also.<a name=1:5600></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, be it noted, faith is the instrument whereby the sinner lays hold of Christ's salvation.<a name=1:5601></a> The wounded Israelite had simply to look and live -- look, not at Himself -- not at his wounds -- not at others around him But, directly and exclusively, to God's remedy.<a name=1:5602></a> If he refused or neglected to look to that, there was nothing for him but death.<a name=1:5603></a> He was called to fix his earnest gaze upon God's remedy, which was so placed that all might see it.<a name=1:5604></a> There was no possible use in looking anywhere else, for the word was, "<i>Every one</i> that is bitten, <i>when</i> he looketh upon it shall live.<a name=1:5605></a>" The bitten Israelite was shut up to the brazen serpent; for the brazen serpent was God's exclusive remedy for the bitten Israelite.<a name=1:5606></a> To look anywhere else was to get nothing; to look at God's provision was to get life.<a name=1:5607></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is now.<a name=1:5608></a> The sinner is called simply to look to Jesus.<a name=1:5609></a> He is not told to look to ordinances -- to look to churches -- to look to men or angels.<a name=1:5610></a> There is no help in any of these, and therefore he is not called to look to them, but exclusively to Jesus, whose death and resurrection form the eternal foundation of the believer's pence and hope.<a name=1:5611></a> God assures him that "Whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=1:5612></a>" This should fully satisfy the heart and conscience.<a name=1:5613></a> God is satisfied, and so ought we to be.<a name=1:5614></a> To raise doubt is to deny the record of God.<a name=1:5615></a> If an Israelite had said, How do I know that looking to that serpent of brass will restore me?<a name=1:5616></a>" or if he had begun to dwell upon the greatness and hopeless nature of his malady, and to reason upon the apparent uselessness of looking up to God's ordinance; in short, if anything, no matter what, had prevented his looking to the brazen serpent, it would have involved a positive rejection of God, and death would have been the inevitable result.<a name=1:5617></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in the case of the sinner, the moment he is enabled to cast a look of faith to Jesus, his sins vanish.<a name=1:5618></a> The blood of Jesus, like a mighty cleansing stream, flows over his conscience, washes away every stain, and leaves him without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; and all this, too, in the very light of the holiness of God, where not one speck of sin can be tolerated.<a name=1:5619></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, ere closing our meditation on the brazen serpent, it may be well just to observe what we may call the intense individuality which marked the bitten Israelite's look at the serpent.<a name=1:5620></a> Each one had to look for himself.<a name=1:5621></a> No-one could look for another.<a name=1:5622></a> It was a personal question.<a name=1:5623></a> No one could be saved by proxy.<a name=1:5624></a> There was life in a look; but the look must be given.<a name=1:5625></a> There needed to be a personal link -- direct individual contact with God's remedy.<a name=1:5626></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it was then, and thus it is now.<a name=1:5627></a> We must have to do with Jesus for ourselves.<a name=1:5628></a> The Church cannot save us -- no order of priests or ministers can save us.<a name=1:5629></a> There must be the personal link with the Saviour, else there is no life.<a name=1:5630></a> "It came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten <i>any man</i>, when he beheld the serpent of brass "lived.<a name=1:5631></a>" This was God's order then; and this is His order now, for "As Moses lilted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up.<a name=1:5632></a>" Let us remember the two little words "<i>as</i>" and "<i>so</i>," for they apply to every particular in the type and the antitype.<a name=1:5633></a> Faith is an individual thing; repentance is an individual thing; salvation is an individual thing.<a name=1:5634></a> Let us never forget this.<a name=1:5635></a> True, there is, in Christianity, union and communion; but we must have to do with Christ for ourselves, and we must walk with God for We can neither get life nor live by the faith of another.<a name=1:5636></a> There is, we repeat with emphasis, an intense individuality in every stage of the Christian's life and practical career.<a name=1:5637></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall not dwell further upon the familiar type of "The serpent of brass;" but we pray God to enable the reader to meditate upon it for himself, and to make a direct personal application of the precious truth unfolded in one of the most striking figures of Old Testament times.<a name=1:5638></a> May he be led to gaze, with a more profound and soul-subduing faith, upon the cross, and to drink into his inmost soul the precious mystery there presented.<a name=1:5639></a> May he not be satisfied with merely getting life by a look at that cross, but seek to enter, more and more, into its deep and marvellous meaning, and thus be more devotedly knit to Him who, when there was no other way of escape possible, did Voluntarily surrender Himself to be bruised on that cursed tree for us and for our salvation.<a name=1:5640></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall close our remarks on Numbers 21 by calling the reader's attention to verses 16-18.<a name=1:5641></a> "And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people together and I will give them water.<a name=1:5642></a> Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it.<a name=1:5643></a> The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves.<a name=1:5644></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a remarkable passage coming in at such a moment and in such a connection.<a name=1:5645></a> The murmurings are hushed -- the people are nearing the borders of the promised land -- the effects of the serpents' bite have passed away, and now, without any rod, without any smiting, the people are supplied with refreshment.<a name=1:5646></a> What though the Amorites, Moabites, and Ammonites are about them; What though the power of Sihon stands in the way; God can open a well for His people and give them a song in spite of all.<a name=1:5647></a> Oh!<a name=1:5648></a> what a God is our God!<a name=1:5649></a> How blessed it is to trace His actings and ways with His people in all these wilderness scenes!<a name=1:5650></a> May we learn to trust Him more implicitly, and to walk with Him, from day to day, in holy and happy subjection!<a name=1:5651></a> This is the true path of peace and blessing.<a name=1:5652></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		NUMBERS 22 -- 24.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These three chapters form a distinct section of our book -- a truly marvellous section, abounding in rich and varied instruction.<a name=1:5653></a> In it we have presented to us, first, the covetous prophet; and, secondly, His sublime prophecies.<a name=1:5654></a> There is something peculiarly awful in the case of Balaam.<a name=1:5655></a> He evidently loved money -- no uncommon love, alas!<a name=1:5656></a> in our own day.<a name=1:5657></a> Balak's gold and silver proved a very tempting bait to the wretched man -- a bait too tempting to be resisted.<a name=1:5658></a> Satan knew his man, and the price at which he could be purchased.<a name=1:5659></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Balaam's heart had been right with God, he would have made very short work with Balak's message; indeed it would not have cost him a moment's consideration to send a reply.<a name=1:5660></a> But Balaam's heart was all wrong, and we see him, in chapter 22 in the melancholy condition of one acted upon by conflicting feelings.<a name=1:5661></a> His heart was bent upon going, because it was bent upon the silver and gold; But, at the same time, there was a sort of reference to God -- an appearance of religiousness put on as a cloak to cover his covetous practices.<a name=1:5662></a> He longed for the money; but he would fain lay hold of it after a religious fashion.<a name=1:5663></a> Miserable man!<a name=1:5664></a> most miserable!<a name=1:5665></a> His name stands on the page of inspiration as the expression of one very dark and awful stage of man's downward history.<a name=1:5666></a> "Woe unto them," says Jude, "for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily <i>after the error of Balaam for reward</i> and perished in the gainsaying of Core.<a name=1:5667></a>" Peter, too, presents Balaam as a prominent figure in one of the very darkest pictures of fallen humanity -- a model on which some of the vilest characters are formed.<a name=1:5668></a> He speaks of those "having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls; an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, <i>who loved the wages of unrighteousness</i>; but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.<a name=1:5669></a>" 2 Peter 2: 14-16.<a name=1:5670></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These passages are solemnly conclusive as to the true character and spirit of Balaam.<a name=1:5671></a> His heart was set upon money -- "he loved the wages of unrighteousness," and his history has been written by the pen of the Holy Ghost, as an awful warning to all professors to beware of covetousness which is idolatry.<a name=1:5672></a> We shall not dwell further upon the sad story.<a name=1:5673></a> The reader may pause for a few moments, and gaze upon the picture presented in Numbers 22.<a name=1:5674></a> He may study the two prominent figures, the crafty king, and the covetous self-willed prophet; and we doubt not he will rise up from the study with a deepened sense of the evil of covetousness, the great moral danger of setting the heart's affections upon this world's riches, and the deep blessedness of having the fear of God before our eyes.<a name=1:5675></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now proceed to examine those marvellous prophecies delivered by Balaam in the audience of Balak, king of the Moabites.<a name=1:5676></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is profoundly interesting to witness the scene enacted on the high places of Baal, to mark the grand question at stake, to listen to the speakers, to be admitted behind the scenes on such a momentous occasion.<a name=1:5677></a> How little did Israel know or imagine what was going on between Jehovah and the enemy.<a name=1:5678></a> It may be they were murmuring in their tents at the very moment in the which God was setting forth their perfection by the tongue of the covetous prophet.<a name=1:5679></a> Balak would fain have Israel cursed; But, Blessed Be God, He will not suffer any one to curse His people.<a name=1:5680></a> He may have to deal with them Himself, in secret, about many things; but He will not suffer another to move his tongue against them.<a name=1:5681></a> He may have to expose them to themselves; but He will not allow a stranger to expose them.<a name=1:5682></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a point of deepest interest.<a name=1:5683></a> The great question is not so much what the enemy may think of God's people, or what they may think about themselves, or what they may think of one another.<a name=1:5684></a> the real -- the All-important question is, What does God think about them?<a name=1:5685></a> He knows exactly all that concerns them; all that they are; all that they have done; all that is in them.<a name=1:5686></a> Everything stands clearly revealed to His all penetrating eye.<a name=1:5687></a> The deepest secrets of the heart, of the nature, and of the life, are all known to him.<a name=1:5688></a> Neither angels, men, nor devils know us as God knows us.<a name=1:5689></a> God knows us perfectly; and it is with Him we have to do, and we can say, in the triumphant language of the apostle," If God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=1:5690></a> (Romans 8) God sees us, thinks of us, speaks about us, acts towards us, according to what He Himself has made us, and wrought for us -- according to the perfection of His own work.<a name=1:5691></a> "Beholders many faults may find;" but, as regards our standing, our God sees us only in the comeliness of Christ; we are perfect in Him.<a name=1:5692></a> When God looks at His people, He beholds in them His own workmanship; and it is to the glory of His holy name, and to the praise of His salvation, that not a blemish should be seen on those who are His -- those whom He, in sovereign grace, has made His own.<a name=1:5693></a> His character, His name, His glory, and the perfection of His work are all involved in the standing of those with whom He has linked Himself.<a name=1:5694></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, therefore, the moment any enemy or accuser enters the scene, Jehovah places Himself in front to receive and answer the accusation; and His answer is always founded, not upon what His people are in themselves, but upon what He has made them through the perfection of His own work.<a name=1:5695></a> His glory is linked with them, and, in vindicating them, He maintains His own glory.<a name=1:5696></a> He places himself between them and every accusing tongue.<a name=1:5697></a> His glory demands that they should be presented in all the comeliness which He has put upon them.<a name=1:5698></a> If the enemy comes to curse and accuse, Jehovah answers him by pouring forth the rich current of His everlasting complacency in those whom He has chosen for Himself, and whom He has made fit to be in His presence for ever.<a name=1:5699></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is strikingly illustrated in the third chapter of the prophet Zechariah.<a name=1:5700></a> There, too, the enemy presents himself to resist the representative of the people of God.<a name=1:5701></a> How does God answer him?<a name=1:5702></a> Simply by cleansing, clothing, and crowning the one whom Satan would fain curse and accuse, so that Satan has not a word to say.<a name=1:5703></a> He is silenced for ever.<a name=1:5704></a> The filthy garments are gone, and he that was a brand is become a mitred priest -- he who was only fit for the flames of hell is now fitted to walk up and down in the courts of the Lord.<a name=1:5705></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also when we turn to the Book of Canticles we see the same thing.<a name=1:5706></a> There the Bridegroom, in contemplating the bride, declares to her, "Thou art <i>all fair</i>, my love; there is <i>no spot</i> in thee.<a name=1:5707></a>" (Cant.<a name=1:5708></a> 4: 7) She, in speaking of herself, can only exclaim "<i>I am black</i>.<a name=1:5709></a>" (Cant.<a name=1:5710></a> 1: 5, 6) So also in John 13 the Lord Jesus looks at His disciples, and pronounces them "Clean every whit;" although, in a few hours afterwards, one of them was to curse and swear that he did not know Him.<a name=1:5711></a> So vast is the difference between what we are in ourselves and what we are in Christ -- between our positive standing and our possible state.<a name=1:5712></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Should this glorious truth as to the perfection of our standing make us careless as to our practical state?<a name=1:5713></a> Far away be the monstrous thought!<a name=1:5714></a> Nay, the knowledge of our absolutely settled and perfect position in Christ is the very thing which the Holy Ghost makes use of in order to raise the standard of practice.<a name=1:5715></a> Hearken to those powerful words from the pen of the inspired apostle, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=1:5716></a> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<a name=1:5717></a> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=1:5718></a> when Christ, our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<a name=1:5719></a> Mortify <i>therefore</i> your members," etc.<a name=1:5720></a> (Colossians 1 - 5.<a name=1:5721></a>) We must never measure the standing by the state, but always judge the state by the standing.<a name=1:5722></a> To lower the standing because of the state, is to give the death-blow to all progress in practical Christianity.<a name=1:5723></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The foregoing line of truth is most forcibly illustrated in Balaam's four parables.<a name=1:5724></a> To speak after the manner of men, we never should have had such a glorious view of Israel, as seen in "The vision of the Almighty" -- "from the top of the rocks" -- by one "having his eyes open," had not Balak sought to curse them.<a name=1:5725></a> Jehovah, blessed be His name, can, very speedily, open a man's eyes to the true state of the case, in reference to the standing of His people, and His judgement respecting them.<a name=1:5726></a> He claims the privilege of setting forth <i>His</i> thoughts about them.<a name=1:5727></a> Balak and Balaam with "all the princes of Moab" may assemble to hear Israel cursed and defied; they may "build seven altars," and "offer a bullock and a.<a name=1:5728></a> lamb on every altar;" Balak's silver and gold may glitter under the covetous gaze of the false prophet; but act all the powers of earth and hell, men and devils combined, in their dark and terrible array, can evoke a single breath of curse or accusation against the Israel of God.<a name=1:5729></a> As well might the enemy have sought to point out a flaw in that fair creation which God had pronounced "very good," as to fasten an accusation upon the redeemed of the Lord.<a name=1:5730></a> Oh!<a name=1:5731></a> no; they shine in all the comeliness which He has put upon them, and all that is needed, in order to see them thus, is to mount to "the top of the rocks" -- to have "the eyes open" to look at them from His point of view, so that we may see them in "the vision of the Almighty.<a name=1:5732></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus taken a general survey of the contents of these remarkable chapters, we shall briefly glance at each of the four parables in particular.<a name=1:5733></a> We shall find a distinct point in each -- a distinct feature in the character and condition of the people, as seen in "The vision of the Almighty.<a name=1:5734></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first of Balaam's wonderful parables, we have the marked separation of God's people from all the nations, most distinctly set forth.<a name=1:5735></a> "How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?<a name=1:5736></a> or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?<a name=1:5737></a> For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.<a name=1:5738></a> Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.<a name=1:5739></a>"<a href="#1:f17"><sup class="footnote-link">++++++++++++++++</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#1:f17"><sup>+++++++++++++++++</sup></a>Poor, wretched Balaam! miserable man! He would fain die the death of the righteous. Many there are who would say the same; but they forget that the way" to die the death of the righteous" is to possess and exhibit the life of the righteous. Many -- alas! how many -- would like to die the death who do not live the life. Many would like to possess Balak's silver and gold, and yet be enrolled amongst the Israel of God. Vain thought! Fatal delusion! We cannot serve God and Mammon.

		But if Jehovah, in His sovereign grace, is pleased to link Himself with a people; if He calls them out to be a separate people, in the world -- to "dwell alone," and shine for Him in the midst of those who are still "sitting in darkness and the shadow of death," He can only have them in such a condition as suits Himself.<a name=1:5749></a> He must make them such as He would have them to be -- such as shall be to the praise of His great and glorious name.<a name=1:5750></a> Hence, in the second parable, the prophet is made to tell out, not merely the negative, but the positive condition of the people.<a name=1:5751></a> "And he took up his parable and said, rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?<a name=1:5752></a> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<a name=1:5753></a> Behold, I have received commandment to bless; and <i>he hath blessed</i>; and I <i>cannot</i> reverse it.<a name=1:5754></a> He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.<a name=1:5755></a> God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.<a name=1:5756></a> Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel<i>, What hath God wrought</i> [not what hath Israel wrought?<a name=1:5757></a>] Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.<a name=1:5758></a>" Numbers 23: 18-24.<a name=1:5759></a>

		Well, therefore may we exclaim "What hath God wrought" It is not "What hath Israel wrought!<a name=1:5782></a>" Balak and Balaam would have found plenty to do in the way of cursing, had Israel's work been in question.<a name=1:5783></a> The Lord be praised, it is on what He hath wrought that His people stand, and their foundation is as stable as the throne of God.<a name=1:5784></a> "If God be for us, who can be against us" If God stands right between us and every foe, what have we to <i>fear</i>?<a name=1:5785></a> If He undertakes, on our behalf, to answer every accuser, then, assuredly, perfect peace is our portion.<a name=1:5786></a>

		However, the king of Moab still fondly hoped and sedulously sought to gain his end.<a name=1:5787></a> And, doubtless, Balaam did the same, for they were leagued together against the Israel of God, thus reminding us forcibly of the beast and the false prophet, who are yet to arise and play an awfully solemn part in connection with Israel's future, as presented on the apocalyptic page.<a name=1:5788></a>

		Reader, dost thou think that such views of divine grace will minister to a spirit of Antinomianism?<a name=1:5820></a> Far Be the thought!<a name=1:5821></a> we may rest assured we are never further away from the region of that terrible evil than when we are breathing the pure and holy atmosphere of "the top of the rocks" -- that high ground from whence God's people are viewed, not as they are in themselves, but as they are in Christ -- not according to the thoughts of man, but according to the thoughts of God.<a name=1:5822></a> And, furthermore, we may say that the only true and effectual mode of raising the standard of moral conduct is to abide in the faith of this most precious and tranquillising truth, that God sees us perfect in Christ.<a name=1:5823></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must take one more glance at our third parable.<a name=1:5824></a> Not only are Israel's tents seen to be goodly in the eyes of Jehovah, but the people themselves are presented to us as abiding fast by those ancient sources of grace and living ministry which are found in God.<a name=1:5825></a> "As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.<a name=1:5826></a>" How exquisite!<a name=1:5827></a> How perfectly beautiful!<a name=1:5828></a> And only to think that we are indebted to the godless confederacy between Balak and Balaam for those sublime utterances!<a name=1:5829></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more than this.<a name=1:5830></a> Not only is Israel seen drinking at those everlasting well-springs of grace and salvation, But, as must ever be the case, as a channel of blessing to others.<a name=1:5831></a> "He shall pour the water out of his buckets.<a name=1:5832></a>" It is the fixed purpose of God that Israel's twelve tribes shall yet be a medium of rich blessing to all the ends of the earth.<a name=1:5833></a> This we learn from such scriptures as Ezekiel 47 and Zechariah 14, on which we do not now attempt to dwell; we merely refer to them as showing the marvellous fullness and beauty of these glorious parables.<a name=1:5834></a> The reader may meditate, with much spiritual profit, upon these and kindred scriptures; but let him carefully guard against the fatal system falsely called spiritualising, Which, in fact, consists mainly in applying to the professing church all the special blessings of the house of Israel, while, to the latter, are left only the curses of a broken law.<a name=1:5835></a> We may rest assured that God will not sanction any such system as this.<a name=1:5836></a> Israel is beloved for the fathers' sakes; and "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=1:5837></a>" Romans 11.<a name=1:5838></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall close this section by a brief reference to Balaam's last parable.<a name=1:5839></a> Balak, having beard such a glowing testimony to Israel's future, and the overthrow of all their enemies, was not only sorely disappointed, but greatly enraged; "And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.<a name=1:5840></a> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; [?<a name=1:5841></a>] But, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour.<a name=1:5842></a> and Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold [the very thing his poor heart craved intensely,] I <i>cannot</i> go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak.<a name=1:5843></a> And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what <i>this people</i> shall do to <i>thy people</i> in the latter days.<a name=1:5844></a> [This was coming to close quarters.<a name=1:5845></a>] And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: he hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: [tremendous fact for Balaam!<a name=1:5846></a>] there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.<a name=1:5847></a>" Verse 10-17.<a name=1:5848></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives great completeness to the subject of these parables.<a name=1:5849></a> The top-stone is here laid on the magnificent superstructure.<a name=1:5850></a> It is, in good truth, grace and glory.<a name=1:5851></a> In the first parable we see the absolute separation of the people; in the second, their perfect justification; in the third, their moral beauty and fruitfulness; and, now, in the fourth, we stand on the very summit of the hills -- on the loftiest crag of the rocks, and survey the wide plains of glory in all their length and breadth, stretching away into a boundless future.<a name=1:5852></a> We see the Lion of the tribe of Judah crouching; we hear his roar; we see Him seizing upon all his enemies, and crushing them to atoms.<a name=1:5853></a> The Star of Jacob rises to set no more.<a name=1:5854></a> The true David ascends the throne of His father, Israel is pre-eminent in the earth, and all his enemies are covered with shame and everlasting contempt.<a name=1:5855></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible to conceive anything more magnificent than these parables; and they are all the more remarkable as coming at the very close of Israel's desert wanderings, during which they had given such ample proof of what they were -- of what materials they were made -- and what their capabilities and tendencies were.<a name=1:5856></a> But God was above all, and nothing changeth His affection.<a name=1:5857></a> Whom He loves, and as He loves, He loves to the end; and hence the league between the typical "beast and false prophet'' proved abortive.<a name=1:5858></a> Israel was blessed of God and not to be cursed of any.<a name=1:5859></a> "And Balaam rose up, and went, and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.<a name=1:5860></a>"

		The conduct of the daughters of Zelophehad, as recorded in the opening section of this chapter, presents a striking and beautiful contrast to the unbelief on which we have just been commenting.<a name=1:5946></a> They, most assuredly, belonged not to the generation of those who are ever ready to abandon divine ground, lower the divine standard, and forego the privileges conferred by divine grace.<a name=1:5947></a> No; those five noble women had no sympathy with such.<a name=1:5948></a> They were determined, through grace, to plant the foot of faith on the very highest ground, and, with holy yet bold decision, to make their own of that which God had given.<a name=1:5949></a> Let us read the refreshing record.<a name=1:5950></a>

		This is uncommonly fine.<a name=1:5955></a> It does the heart good to read such words as these at a time like the present, when so little is made of the proper standing and portion of God's people, and when so many are content to go on from day to day, and year to year, without caring even to inquire into the things which are freely given to them of God.<a name=1:5956></a> Nothing is more sad than to see the carelessness, the utter indifference, with which many professing Christians treat such great and all important questions as the standing, walk, and hope of the believer and the Church of God.<a name=1:5957></a> It is not, by any means, our purpose to go into these questions here.<a name=1:5958></a> We have done so repeatedly in the other volumes of the series of "Notes.<a name=1:5959></a>" We merely desire to call the reader's attention to the fact, that it is at once sinning against our own rich mercies, and dishonouring the Lord, when we!<a name=1:5960></a> evince a spirit of indifferentism in reference to any one point of divine revelation as to the position and portion of the Church, or of the individual believer.<a name=1:5961></a> If God in the aboundings of His grace, has been pleased to bestow upon us precious privileges, as Christians, ought we not to seek earnestly to know what these privileges are?<a name=1:5962></a> Ought we not to seek to make them our own, in the artless simplicity of faith?<a name=1:5963></a> Is it treating our God and His revelation worthily, to be indifferent as to whether we are servants or sons -- as to whether we have the Holy Ghost dwelling in us or not -- as to whether we are under law or under grace -- whether ours is a heavenly or an earthly calling?<a name=1:5964></a>

		"The daughters of Zelophehad speak right.<a name=1:6001></a>" They always do so.<a name=1:6002></a> Their words are words of faith, and, as such, are always right in the judgement of God, it is a terrible thing to limit "the Holy One of Israel.<a name=1:6003></a>" He delights to be trusted and used.<a name=1:6004></a> It is utterly impossible for faith to overdraw its account in God's bank.<a name=1:6005></a> God could no more disappoint faith than He could deny Himself.<a name=1:6006></a> He can never say to faith, "You have miscalculated; you take too lofty -- too bold a stand; so lower down, and lessen your expectations.<a name=1:6007></a>" Ah!<a name=1:6008></a> no; the only thing in all this world that truly delights and refreshes the heart of God is the faith that can simply trust him; and we may rest assured of this, that the faith that can trust Him is also the faith that can love Him, and serve Him, and praise Him.<a name=1:6009></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, then, we are deeply indebted to the daughters of Zelophehad.<a name=1:6010></a> They teach us a lesson of inestimable value.<a name=1:6011></a> And more than this, their acting gave occasion to the unfolding of a fresh truth which was to form the basis of a divine rule for all future generations.<a name=1:6012></a> The Lord commanded Moses, saying, "If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.<a name=1:6013></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have a great principle laid down, in reference to the question of inheritance, of which, humanly speaking, we should have heard nothing had it not been for the faith and faithful conduct of these remarkable women.<a name=1:6014></a> If they had listened to the voice of timidity and unbelief -- if they had refused to come forward, before the whole congregation in the assertion of the claims of Faith; then, not only would they have lost their own inheritance and blessing, but all future daughters of Israel, in a like position, would have been deprived of their portion likewise.<a name=1:6015></a> Whereas, on the contrary, by acting in the precious energy of faith, they preserved their inheritance; they got the blessing; they received testimony from God; their names shine on the page of inspiration; and their conduct furnished, by divine authority, a precedent for all future generations.<a name=1:6016></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to the marvellous results of faith.<a name=1:6017></a> But then we must remember that there is moral danger arising out of the very dignity and elevation which faith confers on those who, through grace, are enabled to exercise it; and this danger must be carefully guarded against.<a name=1:6018></a> This is strikingly illustrated in the further history of the daughters of Zelophehad, as recorded in the last chapter of our book.<a name=1:6019></a> "And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of The children of Israel: and they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.<a name=1:6020></a> And if they be married to any of the sons, of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they were received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.<a name=1:6021></a> And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.<a name=1:6022></a> And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.<a name=1:6023></a>" Numbers 36: 1-5.<a name=1:6024></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "fathers" of the house of Joseph must be heard as well as the "daughters.<a name=1:6025></a>" The faith of the latter was most lovely; but there was just a danger lest, in the elevation to which that faith had raised them, they might forget the claims of others, and remove the landmarks which guarded the inheritance of their fathers.<a name=1:6026></a> This had to be thought of and provided for.<a name=1:6027></a> It was natural to suppose what the daughters of Zelophehad.<a name=1:6028></a> would marry; and moreover it was possible they might form an alliance outside the boundaries of their tribe; and thus in the year of jubilee -- that grand adjusting institution instead of adjustment, there would be confusion, and a permanent breach in the inheritance of Manasseh.<a name=1:6029></a> This would never do; and therefore the wisdom of those ancient fathers is very apparent.<a name=1:6030></a> we need to be guarded on every side, in order that the integrity of faith and the testimony may be duly maintained.<a name=1:6031></a> We are not to carry things with a high hand and a strong will, though we have ever such strong faith, but be ever ready to yield ourselves to the adjusting power of the whole truth of God.<a name=1:6032></a>

		"This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best, only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry; so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .<a name=1:6033></a>.<a name=1:6034></a>.<a name=1:6035></a> .<a name=1:6036></a>.<a name=1:6037></a>.<a name=1:6038></a> .<a name=1:6039></a>.<a name=1:6040></a> Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad; for they [the five daughters] were married unto their father's brothers' sons.<a name=1:6041></a> And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.<a name=1:6042></a>" Verses 6-12.<a name=1:6043></a>

		Thus all is settled.<a name=1:6044></a> The activities of faith are governed by the truth of God, and individual claims are adjusted in harmony with the true interests of all; while, at the same time, the glory of God is so fully maintained, that at the time of the jubilee, instead of any confusion in the landmarks of Israel, the integrity of the inheritance is secured according to the divine grant.<a name=1:6045></a>

		So also, at the beginnings of their months (verse 11), in the feast of the Passover and unleavened bread (verse 16-25), in the feast of firstfruits (verse 26-31), in the feast of trumpets (Numbers 29: 1-6), in the feast of tabernacles (verse 7-38).<a name=1:6132></a> In a word, throughout the entire range of feasts, the leading idea is Christ as a sweet savour.<a name=1:6133></a> The sin offering is never lacking; but the sweet savour offerings get <i>the</i> prominent place, as is evident to the most cursory reader.<a name=1:6134></a> We do not think it possible for any one to read this remarkable portion of scripture and not observe the contrast between the place of the sin offering and that of the burnt offering.<a name=1:6135></a> The former is only spoken of as "one kid of the goats," whereas the latter comes before us in the form of "fourteen lambs," "thirteen bullocks" and such like.<a name=1:6136></a> Such is the large place which the sweet savour offerings get in this scripture.<a name=1:6137></a>

		This brief section has what we may term a dispensational bearing.<a name=1:6186></a> It applies specially to Israel, and treats of the question of vows and bonds.<a name=1:6187></a> The man and the woman stand in marked contrast, in relation to this subject.<a name=1:6188></a> "If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.<a name=1:6189></a>" Verse 2.<a name=1:6190></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reference to the woman, the case was different.<a name=1:6191></a> "If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her fathers house in her youth; and her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every word wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.<a name=1:6192></a> But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of Her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.<a name=1:6193></a>" (verse 3-5) The same thing applied in the case of a wife.<a name=1:6194></a> Her husband could either confirm or disannul all her vows and bonds.<a name=1:6195></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such was the law with regard to vows.<a name=1:6196></a> There was no relief for the man.<a name=1:6197></a> He was bound to go right through with whatever had proceeded out of his mouth.<a name=1:6198></a> Whatever he undertook to do, he was solemnly and irreversibly held to it.<a name=1:6199></a> There was no back door, as we say -- no way of getting out of it.<a name=1:6200></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we know who, in perfect grace, took this position, and voluntarily bound himself to accomplish the will of God, whatever that will might be.<a name=1:6201></a> We know who it is that says, "I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.<a name=1:6202></a>" "The man Christ Jesus," who, having taken the vows upon Him, discharged them perfectly to the glory of God, and the eternal blessing of His people.<a name=1:6203></a> There was no escape for Him.<a name=1:6204></a> We hear Him exclaiming, in the deep anguish of His soul, in the garden of Gethsemane, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.<a name=1:6205></a>" But it was not possible.<a name=1:6206></a> He had undertaken the work of man's salvation, and He had to go through the deep and dark waters of death, judgement, and wrath; and perfectly meet all the consequences of man's condition.<a name=1:6207></a> He had a baptism to be baptised with, and was straitened until it was accomplished.<a name=1:6208></a> In other words, He had to die in order that, by death, He might open the pent-up flood gates, and allow the mighty tide of divine and everlasting love to flow dawn to His people.<a name=1:6209></a> All praise and adoration be to His peerless name for ever!<a name=1:6210></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus much as to the man and his vows and bonds.<a name=1:6211></a> In the case of the woman, whether as the daughter or the wife, we have the nation of Israel, and that in two ways, namely, under government and under grace; Looked at from a governmental point of view, Jehovah, who is at once the Father and the Husband, has held his peace at her, so that her vows and bonds are allowed to stand; and she is, to this day, suffering the consequences, and made to feel the force of those words, "Better that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.<a name=1:6212></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, as viewed from the blessed standpoint of grace, the Father and the Husband has taken all upon Himself, so that she shall be forgiven and brought into the fullness of blessing by and by, not on the ground of accomplished vows and ratified bonds, but on the ground of sovereign grace and mercy, through the blood of the everlasting covenant.<a name=1:6213></a> How precious to find Christ everywhere!<a name=1:6214></a> He is the centre and foundation, the beginning and the end, of all the ways of God.<a name=1:6215></a> May our hearts be ever filled with him!<a name=1:6216></a> May our lips and lives speak His praise!<a name=1:6217></a> May we, constrained by His love, live to His glory all our days upon earth, and then go home to be with Himself for ever, to go no more out!<a name=1:6218></a>

		We have here the closing scene of Moses' <i>official</i> life; as in Deuteronomy 34 we have the closing scene of his <i>personal</i> history.<a name=1:6224></a> "and the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites; afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.<a name=1:6225></a> And Moses spake unto the People, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the Lord of Midian.<a name=1:6226></a> Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.<a name=1:6227></a> So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.<a name=1:6228></a> And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and <i>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest</i>, to the war, <i>with the holy instruments</i>, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.<a name=1:6229></a> And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males Verses 3-7.<a name=1:6230></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very remarkable passage.<a name=1:6231></a> The Lord says to Moses, "<i>Avenge the children of Israel</i> of the Midianites.<a name=1:6232></a>" And Moses says to Israel, "<i>Avenge the Lord</i> of Midian.<a name=1:6233></a>" The people had been ensnared by the wiles of the daughters of Midian, through the evil influence of Balaam the son of Peor; and they are now called upon to clear themselves thoroughly from all the defilement which, through want of watchfulness, they had contracted.<a name=1:6234></a> The sword is to be brought upon the Midianites; and all the spoil is to be made to pass either through the fire of judgement or through the water of purification.<a name=1:6235></a> Not one jot or tittle of the evil thing is to be suffered to pass unjudged.<a name=1:6236></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this war was what we may call abnormal.<a name=1:6237></a> By right, the people ought not to have had any occasion to encounter it at all.<a name=1:6238></a> It was not one of the wars of Canaan.<a name=1:6239></a> It was simply the result of their own unfaithfulness -- the fruit of their own unhallowed commerce with the uncircumcised.<a name=1:6240></a> Hence, although Joshua, the son of Nun, had been duly appointed to succeed Moses, as leader of the congregation, we find no mention whatever of him in connection with this war.<a name=1:6241></a> On the contrary, it is to Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, that the conduct of this expedition is committed; and he enters upon it" with the holy instruments and the trumpets.<a name=1:6242></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is strongly marked.<a name=1:6243></a> <i>The priest</i> is the prominent person; and <i>the Holy instruments</i>, the prominent instrumentality.<a name=1:6244></a> It is a question of wiping away the stain caused by their unholy association with the enemy; and therefore, instead of a general officer with sword and spear, it is a priest with holy instruments that appears in the foreground.<a name=1:6245></a> True, the sword is here; but it is not the prominent thing.<a name=1:6246></a> It is the priest with the vessels of the sanctuary; and that priest the selfsame man who first executed judgement upon that very evil which has here to be avenged.<a name=1:6247></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral of all this is, at once, plain and practical.<a name=1:6248></a> The Midianites furnish a type of that peculiar kind of influence which the world exerts over the hearts of the people of God -- the fascinating and ensnaring power of the world used by Satan to hinder our entrance upon our proper heavenly portion.<a name=1:6249></a> Israel should have had nothing to do with these Midianites; but having, in an evil hour -- an unguarded moment -- been betrayed into association with them, nothing remains but war and utter extermination.<a name=1:6250></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with us, as Christians.<a name=1:6251></a> Our proper business is to pass through the world, as pilgrims and strangers; having nothing to do with it, save to be the patient witnesses of the grace of Christ, and thus shine as lights in the midst of the surrounding moral gloom.<a name=1:6252></a> But, alas!<a name=1:6253></a> we fail to maintain this rigid separation; we suffer ourselves to be betrayed into alliance with the world, and, in consequence, we get involved in trouble and conflict which does not properly belong to us at all.<a name=1:6254></a> War with Midian formed no part of Israel's proper work.<a name=1:6255></a> They had to thank themselves for it.<a name=1:6256></a> But God is gracious; and hence, through a special application of priestly ministry, they were enabled, not only to conquer the Midianites, but to carry away much spoil.<a name=1:6257></a> God, in His infinite goodness, brings good out of evil.<a name=1:6258></a> He will cause the eater to yield meat, and the strong sweetness.<a name=1:6259></a> His grace shines out, with exceeding brightness, in the scene before us, inasmuch as He actually deigns to accept a portion of the spoils taken from the Midianites.<a name=1:6260></a> But the evil had to be thoroughly judged.<a name=1:6261></a> "Every male" had to be put to death -- all in whom there was the energy of the evil had to be completely exterminated; and finally the fire of judgement and the water of purification had to do their work on the spoil, ere God or His people could touch an atom of it.<a name=1:6262></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What holy lessons are here!<a name=1:6263></a> May we apply our hearts to them!<a name=1:6264></a> May we be enabled to pursue a path of more intense separation, and to press on our heavenly road as those whose portion and whose home is on high!<a name=1:6265></a> God, in His mercy grant it?<a name=1:6266></a>

		The fact recorded in this chapter has given rise to considerable discussion.<a name=1:6267></a> Various have been the opinions advanced in reference to the conduct of the two tribes and a half.<a name=1:6268></a> Were they right or were they wrong in choosing their inheritance on the wilderness side of Jordan!<a name=1:6269></a> This is the question.<a name=1:6270></a> Was their acting in this matter, the expression of power or of weakness?<a name=1:6271></a> How are we to form a sound judgement in this case?<a name=1:6272></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, where was Israel's proper portion -- their divinely destined inheritance?<a name=1:6273></a> Most surely, on the other side of Jordan, in the land of Canaan.<a name=1:6274></a> Well, then, ought not this fact to have sufficed?<a name=1:6275></a> would or could a really true heart -- a heart that thought, and felt, and judged with God -- have entertained the idea of selecting a portion other than that which God had allotted and bestowed Impossible.<a name=1:6276></a> Hence, then, we need not to go further, in order to have a divine judgement on this subject.<a name=1:6277></a> It was a mistake, a failure, a stopping short of the divine mark, on the part of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, to choose any boundary line short of the river Jordan.<a name=1:6278></a> They were governed, in their conduct, by worldly and selfish considerations -- by the sight of their eyes -- by carnal motives.<a name=1:6279></a> They surveyed "the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead," and they estimated it entirely according to their own interests, and without any reference to the judgement and will of God.<a name=1:6280></a> Had they been simply looking to God, the question of settling down short of the river Jordan would never have been raised at all.<a name=1:6281></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when people are not simple, not true-hearted, they get into circumstances which give rise to all sorts of questions.<a name=1:6282></a> It is a great matter to be enabled, by Divine grace, to pursue a line of action, and to tread a path so unequivocal as that no question can be raised.<a name=1:6283></a> It is our holy and happy privilege so to carry ourselves as that no complication may ever arise.<a name=1:6284></a> The secret of so doing is to walk with God, and thus to have our conduct wholly governed by His word.<a name=1:6285></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that Reuben and Gad were not thus governed, is manifest from the entire history.<a name=1:6286></a> They were half-and-half men; men of mixed principles; mere borderers; men that sought their own things, and not the things of God.<a name=1:6287></a> Had these latter engrossed their hearts, nothing would have induced them to take up their position short of the true boundary line.<a name=1:6288></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very evident that Moses had no sympathy with their proposal.<a name=1:6289></a> It was a judgement upon his conduct that he was not allowed to go over.<a name=1:6290></a> His heart was in the promised land; and he longed to go thither in person.<a name=1:6291></a> How could he then approve of the conduct of men who were not only prepared, but actually desirous, to take up their abode somewhere else?<a name=1:6292></a> Faith can never be satisfied with anything short of the true position and portion of God's people.<a name=1:6293></a> A single eye can only see -- a faithful heart only desire -- the inheritance given of God.<a name=1:6294></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, therefore, Moses at once condemned the proposition of Reuben and Gad.<a name=1:6295></a> True, he afterwards relaxed his judgement and gave his consent.<a name=1:6296></a> Their promise to cross the Jordan, ready armed, before their brethren, drew from Moses a kind of assent.<a name=1:6297></a> It seemed an extraordinary manifestation of unselfishness and energy to leave all their loved ones behind, and cross the Jordan, only to fight for their brethren.<a name=1:6298></a> But where had they left those loved ones?<a name=1:6299></a> They had left them short of the divine mark.<a name=1:6300></a> They had deprived them of a place and a portion in the true land of promise -- that inheritance of the which God had spoken to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<a name=1:6301></a> and for what?<a name=1:6302></a> Just to get good pasture for their cattle.<a name=1:6303></a> For an object like this did the two tribes and a half abandon their place within the true limits of the Israel of God.<a name=1:6304></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now let us look at the consequences of this line of action.<a name=1:6305></a> Let the reader turn to Joshua 22.<a name=1:6306></a> Here we have the first sorrowful effect of the equivocal conduct of Reuben and Gad.<a name=1:6307></a> They must needs build an altar -- "a great altar to see to" lest in time to come their brethren might disown them.<a name=1:6308></a> What does all this prove?<a name=1:6309></a> It proves that they were all wrong in taking up their position on this side of Jordan.<a name=1:6310></a> And only mark the effect upon the whole assembly -- the disturbing, alarming effect of this altar.<a name=1:6311></a> At the first blush, it wore the aspect of actual rebellion.<a name=1:6312></a> "and when the children of Israel heard of it, <i>the whole congregation of the children of Israel</i> gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.<a name=1:6313></a> And <i>the children of Israel</i> sent unto <i>the children of Reuben</i>, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,<a href="#1:f20"><sup class="footnote-link">+++++++++++++++++++</sup></a> into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.<a name=1:6314></a> And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, Thus saith <i>the whole congregation of the Lord</i> [Did not the two and a half belong to it?<a name=1:6315></a>] what trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord?<a name=1:6316></a> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord, but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord and it will be, seeing ye rebel today against the Lord, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.<a name=1:6317></a> Notwithstanding, if the land of <i>your possession</i> be unclean, then pass ye over unto <i>the land of the possession of the Lord</i>, wherein the Lord's tabernacle dwelleth, [what burning words] and take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.<a name=1:6318></a>" Joshua 22: 12-19.<a name=1:6319></a>

		The first of these sections gives us a wonderfully minute description of the desert wanderings of the people of God.<a name=1:6350></a> It is impossible to read it without being deeply moved by the tender love and care of God so signally displayed throughout the whole.<a name=1:6351></a> To think of His deigning to keep such a record of the journeyings of His poor people, from the moment they marched out of Egypt until they crossed the Jordan -- from the land of death and darkness to the land flowing with milk and honey.<a name=1:6352></a> "He knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.<a name=1:6353></a>" He went before them, every step of the way; He travelled over every stage of the wilderness; in all their afflictions He was afflicted.<a name=1:6354></a> He took care of them like a tender nurse.<a name=1:6355></a> He suffered not their garments to wax old, or their feet to swell, for these forty years; and here He retraces the entire way by which His hand had led them, carefully noting down each successive stage of that marvellous pilgrimage, and every spot in the desert at which they had halted.<a name=1:6356></a> What a journey!<a name=1:6357></a> What a travelling companion!<a name=1:6358></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The opening lines of this most interesting chapter set before us the gracious provision which Jehovah made for His servants the Levites.<a name=1:6377></a> Each of the tribes of Israel was privileged -- that we say not bound -- to furnish the Levites with a certain number of cities with their suburbs, according to their ability.<a name=1:6378></a> "All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.<a name=1:6379></a> And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; But from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites, according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.<a name=1:6380></a>" Verses 7, 8.<a name=1:6381></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's servants were wholly cast upon Him for their portion.<a name=1:6382></a> They had no inheritance or possession saving himself.<a name=1:6383></a> Blessed inheritance!<a name=1:6384></a> Precious portion!<a name=1:6385></a> None like it, in the judgement of faith.<a name=1:6386></a> Blessed are all those who can truly say to the Lord, "Thou art the portion of my cup, and the lot of my inheritance.<a name=1:6387></a>" God took care of His dependent servants, and permitted the whole congregation of Israel to taste the hallowed privilege -- for such it most assuredly was -- of being co-workers with Him in providing for those who had willingly devoted themselves to His work, abandoning all besides.<a name=1:6388></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, then, we learn that, out of the twelve tribes of Israel, forty and eight cities, with their suburbs, were to be given over to the Levites; and out of these again, the Levites had the privilege of furnishing six cities to be a refuge for the poor manslayer.<a name=1:6389></a> Most lovely provision!<a name=1:6390></a> Lovely in its origin!<a name=1:6391></a> Lovely in its object!<a name=1:6392></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cities of refuge were situated, three on the eastern and three on the western side of Jordan.<a name=1:6393></a> whether Reuben and Gad were right or wrong in settling east of that significant boundary, God in His mercy would not leave the slayer without a refuge from the avenger of blood.<a name=1:6394></a> On the contrary, like Himself, He ordained that those cities which were designed as a merciful provision for the slayer should be so situated that wherever there was need of a shelter that shelter might be near at hand.<a name=1:6395></a> There was always a city within reach of any who might be exposed to the sword of the avenger.<a name=1:6396></a> This was worthy of our God.<a name=1:6397></a> If any slayer happened to fall into the hands of the avenger of blood, it was not for want of a refuge near at hand, but because he had failed to avail himself of it.<a name=1:6398></a> All necessary provision was made; the cities were named, and well defined, and publicly known.<a name=1:6399></a> Everything was made as plain, as simple, and as easy as possible.<a name=1:6400></a> Such was God's gracious way.<a name=1:6401></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt, the slayer was responsible to put forth all his energy to reach the sacred precincts; and, no doubt, he would.<a name=1:6402></a> It is not at all likely that any one would be so blind or so infatuated as to fold his arms, in cool indifference, and say, "If I am fated to escape, I shall escape, my efforts are not needed.<a name=1:6403></a> If I am not fated to escape, I cannot escape, my efforts are of no use.<a name=1:6404></a>" We cannot fancy a manslayer using such silly language, or being guilty of such blind fatality as this.<a name=1:6405></a> He knew too well that if the avenger could but lay his hand upon him, all such notions would be of small account.<a name=1:6406></a> There was but the one thing to be done, and that was to escape for his life -- to flee from impending judgement to find his safe abode within the gates of the city of refuge.<a name=1:6407></a> Once there, he could breathe freely.<a name=1:6408></a> No evil could overtake him there.<a name=1:6409></a> The moment He crossed the threshold of the gate, he was as safe as God's provision could make him.<a name=1:6410></a> if a hair of his head could be touched, within the bounds of the city, it could but be a dishonour and a reproach upon the ordinance of God.<a name=1:6411></a> True, he had to keep close.<a name=1:6412></a> He dared not venture outside the gate.<a name=1:6413></a> Within, he was perfectly safe.<a name=1:6414></a> Without, he was thoroughly exposed.<a name=1:6415></a> He could not even visit his friends.<a name=1:6416></a> He was an exile from his Father's house.<a name=1:6417></a> He was a prisoner of hope.<a name=1:6418></a> Absent from the home of his heart's affections, he waited for the death of the high priest, which was to set him perfectly free and restore him, once more, to his inheritance and to his people.<a name=1:6419></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we believe that this beautiful ordinance had special reference to Israel.<a name=1:6420></a> They have killed the Prince of life; but the question is, As which are they viewed by God, as the murderer or as the slayer?<a name=1:6421></a> If the former, there is no refuge, no hope.<a name=1:6422></a> No murderer could be sheltered within the city of refuge.<a name=1:6423></a> Here is the law of the case, as stated in Joshua 20, "The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.<a name=1:6424></a> And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.<a name=1:6425></a> And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; <i>because he smote his neighbour unwittingly</i>, and hated him not beforetime, And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgement, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.<a name=1:6426></a>" Vv 1-6.<a name=1:6427></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But with respect to the murderer; the law was rigid and unbending "The murderer shall surely be put to death.<a name=1:6428></a> The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.<a name=1:6429></a>" Numbers 35.<a name=1:6430></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel, then, through the marvellous grace of God, will be treated as a slayer and not as a murderer.<a name=1:6431></a> "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.<a name=1:6432></a>" These potent words ascended to the ear and to the heart of the God of Israel.<a name=1:6433></a> They were heard and answered; nor are we to suppose that the answer was exhausted in its application on the day of Pentecost.<a name=1:6434></a> No; it still holds good, and its efficacy will be illustrated in the future history of the house of Israel.<a name=1:6435></a> That people are now under God's keeping.<a name=1:6436></a> They are exiles from the land and the home of their fathers.<a name=1:6437></a> But the time is coming when they shall be restored to their own land, not by the death of the high priest -- blessed be His deathless name!<a name=1:6438></a> He can never die -- but He will leave His present position, and come forth, in a new character, as the Royal Priest, to sit upon His throne.<a name=1:6439></a> Then shall the exile return to his long-lost home, and his forfeited inheritance.<a name=1:6440></a> But not till then, else it would be ignoring the fact that they killed the Prince of life, which were impossible.<a name=1:6441></a> The manslayer mast remain out of his possession until the appointed time; but he is not to be treated as a murderer, because he did it unwittingly.<a name=1:6442></a> "I obtained mercy" -- says the Apostle Paul, speaking as a pattern to Israel because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.<a name=1:6443></a>" "And now, brethren," says Peter, "I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.<a name=1:6444></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These passages, together with the precious intercession of the slain One, do, in the most distinct manner, place Israel on the ground of the manslayer, and not on the ground of the murderer.<a name=1:6445></a> God has provided a refuge and a shelter for His much-loved people, and in due time they shall return to their long-lost dwellings, in that land which Jehovah gave as a gift to Abraham his friend for ever.<a name=1:6446></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such we believe to be the true interpretation of the ordinance of the city of refuge.<a name=1:6447></a> Were we to view it as bearing upon the case of a sinner taking refuge in Christ, it could only be in a very exceptional way, inasmuch as we should find ourselves surrounded, on all hands, by points of contrast rather than by points of similarity.<a name=1:6448></a> For in the first place, the manslayer, in the city of refuge, was not exempt from judgement, as we learn from Joshua 20: 6.<a name=1:6449></a> But for the believer in Jesus there is and can be no judgement, for the simplest of all reasons, that Christ has borne the judgement instead.<a name=1:6450></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, there was a possibility of the slayer's falling into the hands of the avenger, if he ventured outside the gates of the city.<a name=1:6451></a> The believer in Jesus can never perish; he is as safe as the Saviour himself.<a name=1:6452></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, as regards the slayer, it was a question of temporal safety and life in this world.<a name=1:6453></a> As regards the believer in Jesus, it is a question of eternal salvation and life everlasting in the world to come.<a name=1:6454></a> In fact, in almost every particular, it is striking contrast rather than similarity.<a name=1:6455></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One grand point there is common to both, and that is, the point of exposure to imminent danger and the urgent need of fleeing for refuge.<a name=1:6456></a> If it would have been wild folly on the part of the slayer to linger or hesitate for a moment, until he found himself safely lodged in the city of refuge, it is surely still wilder folly, yea, the very height of madness, on the part of the sinner, to linger or hesitate in coming to Christ.<a name=1:6457></a> The avenger might perhaps fail to lay hold on the slayer even though he were not in the city; But judgement must overtake the sinner out of Christ.<a name=1:6458></a> There is no possibility of escape, if there is the thickness of a gold leaf between the soul and Christ.<a name=1:6459></a> Solemn thought!<a name=1:6460></a> May it have its due weight in the heart of the reader who is yet in his sins!<a name=1:6461></a> May he find no rest -- not one moment's rest, until he has fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before him in the gospel.<a name=1:6462></a> Judgement impends, certain, solemn judgement.<a name=1:6463></a> It is not only that the avenger may come, but judgement must come upon all who are out of Christ.<a name=1:6464></a>
