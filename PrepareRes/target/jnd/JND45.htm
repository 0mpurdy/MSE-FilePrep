		INTRODUCTION TO THE NEW TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In pursuing these scripture studies, it is with a certain kind of fear that I approach the New Testament, great as may be the blessing attendant on so doing.<a name=1:1></a> The concentration and at the same time expansion of divine light in this precious gift of God, the immense reach of the truths contained in it; the infinite variety of the aspects and true applications of one and the same passage, and of its relations with the whole circle of divine truths; the immense importance of these truths, whether considered in themselves or with reference to the glory of God or in relation to the need of man; the manner in which they reveal God and meet that need -- all these considerations, which I can but imperfectly express, would cause any humble-minded person to retire from the pretension of giving a true and (even in principle) adequate idea of the purpose of the Holy Ghost in the books of the New Testament.<a name=1:2></a> And the more truth itself is revealed, the more true light shines, the more one's incapacity to speak of it must be felt, and the more one must fear to darken that which is perfect.<a name=1:3></a> The more pure the truth is with which we have to do (and here it is truth itself), the more difficult is the endeavour to lay it before others without in some respects injuring its purity; and the more fatal also is this injury.<a name=1:4></a> In meditating on such or such a passage, we may communicate, for the profit of others, the measure of light granted to us.<a name=1:5></a> But in attempting to give an idea of the book as a whole, all the perfection of truth itself, and the universality of the purpose of God in the revelation He has made of it, present themselves to the mind; and one trembles at the thought of undertaking to give a true and general idea, if it be not a complete one, which no really christian person would pretend to do.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Old Testament may perhaps appear more difficult to some persons than the New, and with respect to the interpretation of certain isolated passages it may be so; but, although
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the inspired writers of that part of scripture reveal the mind of God as communicated to them by Him (and we can admire the wisdom there unfolded), yet God Himself was still hidden behind the veil.<a name=2:1></a> We may mistake or overlook the meaning of an expression, and we suffer loss, for it was God who spoke; but in the New Testament it is God Himself -- meek, gentle, human, on earth, in the Gospels; instructing with divine light in the subsequent communications of the Holy Ghost; yet still God -- who manifests Himself.<a name=2:2></a> But if the light is brighter, both for our personal guidance and for the knowledge of Himself, it becomes a yet more serious thing to misinterpret these living communications, or to disguise by our own thoughts that which is the truth itself.<a name=2:3></a> For we must remember that Christ is the truth.<a name=2:4></a> He is the Word.<a name=2:5></a> It is God who speaks in the Person of the Son, who, while truly man, manifests also the Father.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards even interpretation itself, the truth itself, the light, eternal life, being in that which is revealed to us in the New Testament, it may be looked at in so many aspects, that the practical difficulty is much greater.<a name=2:7></a> For this truth may be looked at in its intrinsic and essential value: we may view it as the manifestation of the eternal nature of God, or in its manifestation with respect to the glory of the Son; we may examine its connections and its contrasts with the partial communications of the Old Testament, which it fulfils and eclipses by its own brightness, with the economy of God's earthly government, which is set aside in order to introduce that which is eternal and heavenly.<a name=2:8></a> It may be viewed in its relations to man, for the life was the light of men, God having been pleased to manifest and to glorify Himself in man, to make Himself known to man, and to constitute him the means of the revelation of Himself to His other intelligent creatures.<a name=2:9></a> On every passage there would be something to say with respect to each of these aspects; for the truth is one, even as it is of God, but it shines on all things, and displays their true character.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things, however, encourage me: first, that we have to do with a God of perfect goodness, who has given us these wondrous revelations that we may profit by them; and, in the second place, that, although the source of truth is infinite and perfect, although these revelations flow from the fulness of truth in God, and its communication to us is perfect, after the perfection of Him that made it, nevertheless it is made by
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		means of divers instruments, in themselves of a limited capacity, of which God makes use in communicating this or that portion of truth to us.<a name=3:1></a> This pure and living water has been in no wise corrupted, but in each communication it has been limited by the purpose of God, in the instrument used by Him to dispense it, while still in connection with the whole, according to the perfect wisdom of Him who has communicated all truth.<a name=3:2></a> The channel is not infinite.<a name=3:3></a> The water which flows through it is infinite, but not infinite in its communication.<a name=3:4></a> They prophesied in part, and we know in part.<a name=3:5></a> The aspect and the application of truth has even an especial character, according to the vessel through which it is communicated.<a name=3:6></a> The living water is there in its perfect pureness.<a name=3:7></a> As it exists in its source, so it gushes forth: the form of the fountain through which it flows before men is according to His wisdom who has formed it to be His instrument for that purpose.<a name=3:8></a> The Holy Ghost acts in man, in the vessel thereunto prepared.<a name=3:9></a> God had created, formed, fashioned and adapted the vessel, morally and intellectually, for such and such a service in respect to the truth.<a name=3:10></a> He acts in the vessel according to the object for which He has prepared it.<a name=3:11></a> Christ was and is the truth.<a name=3:12></a> Others have communicated it, each one according to that given him, and in connection with those elements with which God had brought his mind and heart into unison, and with that object for which the Holy Ghost had thus prepared him.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Leaving therefore my fears behind, I address myself confidingly to the accomplishment of this service, my heart resting on the perfect goodness of God who delights to bless us.<a name=3:14></a> May the just sense of my responsibility prevent my hazarding anything not according to God; and may the Lord Himself, in His grace, deign to direct me, and furnish me with that which shall be a blessing to the reader!<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New Testament has evidently a very different character from the Old.<a name=3:16></a> That which I have already remarked constitutes the essence of this difference.<a name=3:17></a> The New Testament treats of the revelation of God Himself, and shews us man brought in righteousness into glory in the presence of God.<a name=3:18></a> Formerly God had made promises, and He had executed judgments.<a name=3:19></a> He had governed a people on earth, and acted towards the nations without, having this people in view as the centre of His counsels as to earth.<a name=3:20></a> He had given them His law, and bestowed on them, by means of the prophets, a growing light,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which announced, as nearer and nearer, His coming, who should tell them all things from God.<a name=4:1></a> But the presence of God Himself, a Man amongst men, changed the position of everything.<a name=4:2></a> Either man must receive, as a crown of blessing and of glory, the One whose presence was to banish all evil, and develop and perfect every element of good, furnishing at the same time an object which should be the centre of all affections, rendered perfectly happy by the enjoyment of this object; or, by rejecting Him, our poor nature must manifest itself as being enmity against God, and must prove the necessity for a completely new order of things, in which the happiness of man and the glory of God should be based upon a new creation.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know what happened.<a name=4:4></a> He who was the image of the invisible God had to say, after the exercise of a perfect patience, "Righteous Father, the world hath not known thee".<a name=4:5></a> Alas!<a name=4:6></a> yet more than that: He had to say, "They have seen and hated both me and my Father".<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless this condition of man has in nowise prevented God from fulfilling His counsels; on the contrary it became the means of His doing so.<a name=4:8></a> He would not reject man until man had rejected Him (as in the garden of Eden man, conscious of sin, being unable to bear the presence of God, withdrew from Him before God had driven him out of the garden).<a name=4:9></a> But now that man on his part had entirely rejected God come in mercy into the midst of his misery, God was free -- if one may venture to speak thus, and the expression is morally correct -- to carry out His eternal purposes.<a name=4:10></a> But it is not judgment that is carried into effect, as was the case in Eden, when man had already departed from God.<a name=4:11></a> It is sovereign grace which, when man is evidently lost and has declared himself the enemy of God, carries on its work to magnify His glory, before the whole universe, in the salvation of poor sinners who had rejected Him.<a name=4:12></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:4">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in order that the perfect wisdom of God should be manifested, even in the details, this work of sovereign grace, in which God revealed Himself, must be seen as having its due
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connection with all His previous dealings revealed in the Old Testament, and also as leaving its full place to His government of the world.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is the cause that (apart from the one great idea which reigns throughout) there are four subjects in this wonderful book which unfold themselves to the eye of faith.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the great subject, the dominant fact, is, that the perfect light is manifested: God reveals Himself.<a name=5:3></a> But this light is revealed in love, the other essential name of God.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, who is the manifestation of this light and love, and who, if He had been received, would have been the fulfilment of all the promises, is then presented to man, and especially to Israel (looked at in their responsibility), with every proof, personal, moral, and of power -- proofs which left them without excuse.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, being rejected (a rejection by means of which salvation was accomplished), the new order of things -- the new creation, man glorified, the assembly sharing with Christ in heavenly glory -- is put before us.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, the connection between the old order of things upon earth, and the new, with respect to the law, the promises, the prophets, or the divine institutions on earth, is set forth; whether in exhibiting the new as the fulfilment and setting aside of that which had grown old, or in stating the contrast between the two, and the perfect wisdom of God, which is demonstrated in every detail of His ways.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the government of the world, on the part of God, is prophetically displayed; and the renewal of God's relations with Israel, whether in judgment or in blessing, is briefly but plainly stated, on the occasion of the rupture of those relations by the rejection of the Messiah.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be added, that everything necessary for man, as a pilgrim on earth until God shall accomplish in power the purposes of His grace, is abundantly supplied.<a name=5:9></a> Come forth, at the call of God, from that which is rejected and condemned, and not yet in possession of the portion that God has prepared for him, the man who has obeyed this call needs something to direct him, and to reveal the sources of the strength he requires in walking towards the object of his vocation, and the means by which he can appropriate this strength.<a name=5:10></a> God, in calling him to follow a Master whom the world has rejected, has not failed to supply him with all the light and all the directions
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		needed to guide and encourage him on his way, as well as point him to the sources of strength and how to obtain the supply of it.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every reader of the Bible will understand that these subjects are not treated methodically and separately in the New Testament.<a name=6:2></a> Were it so, they would be much less perfectly understood.<a name=6:3></a> It is in life and in power, whether that of Christ or that of the Holy Ghost in the inspired writers, that they develop themselves to our hearts.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospels, in general, set Christ before us as light and grace -- still, though not doctrinally, as God Himself, first presented to men in this world, as well as the One in whom the promises made to Israel would be accomplished; and then openly as a divine Person in whom the purposes of the Father would be accomplished, the Jews being looked at as reprobate in their then standing.<a name=6:5></a> The Apocalypse -- the introduction of the government of God over this world, in connection with the responsibility under which its relations to a revealed God have placed it.<a name=6:6></a> The writings of Paul -- man's acceptance and place before God by redemption, the new creation, and the assembly according to the counsels of God, the mystery of God.<a name=6:7></a> Various subjects connected with these are, however, found everywhere in the Epistles, and each separate development of one of these subjects throws light upon all the rest.<a name=6:8></a> The writings of John, we may add, treat particularly of the manifestation of God, and of the divine life in Christ, and then in quickened man, corresponding as they must, to one another; those of Peter, of the Christian's pilgrimage, founded on Christ's resurrection, and of the moral government of the world.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, I repeat it, whether in the Person of Christ or in the communications of the Holy Ghost (Christ's life being, in one way or other, the light of men), the truth shines out in the living manifestation of God, and in its living application to men; and also, according to the wisdom of God, it is connected with the progressive development(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:6">footnote</a></i>) inherent to truth when communicated
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to man, and adapted to the especial wants and to the spiritual capacities of the men to whom it was addressed.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt the revelations of the New Testament are for the saints in all ages; but they were addressed, speaking historically, to living men, and adapted to their condition.<a name=7:2></a> But this circumstance weakens in no manner the truth communicated: it is of God, even as the apostle expresses it, "We are not as many which corrupt the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ".<a name=7:3></a> And again, "Not handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God".<a name=7:4></a> He adds nothing to this pure wine, he does not adulterate it.<a name=7:5></a> That which he received flows from him as pure as he received it.<a name=7:6></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:7">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the word of God addressed to men has even greater reality than any mere abstract truth; it is more immediately
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of God.<a name=8:1></a> We have not men's ideas with respect to God, nor the reasonings of men's minds even with truth for their subject; nor is it even truth, as it is in God, submitted abstractedly to the capacity of men that they may judge it.<a name=8:2></a> It is God who addresses Himself to man, who speaks to him, who communicates His thoughts as being His own.<a name=8:3></a> For if man is to judge them, they are not the words of God proclaimed as such.<a name=8:4></a> "Ye received the word of God", says the apostle, "not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God".<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect produced on man, which causes him to own the truth and authority of the word, has been often confounded with a judgment formed by man upon the word as upon something submitted to him.<a name=8:6></a> Never can the word thus present itself.<a name=8:7></a> It would be denying its own nature; it would be saying, It is not my God who speaks.<a name=8:8></a> Can God say that He is not God?<a name=8:9></a> If not, He could not speak, and say that His word has not authority in itself.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word is adapted to the nature of man: the life is the light of men.<a name=8:11></a> There are many things that produce an effect according to the nature of the thing to which they are applied, without their being judged by that thing.<a name=8:12></a> It is the case in all chemical action.<a name=8:13></a> A medicine is administered to me; I experience its effect.<a name=8:14></a> It has this effect according to my nature.<a name=8:15></a> Thus I am convinced of this effect, and of the power of the medicine.<a name=8:16></a> It is not a question of my forming a judgment on the medicine as submitted to my capacity.<a name=8:17></a> It is the same thing, through grace, with the revelation of Christ, save that the wicked will of man opposes also and rejects it, so that it becomes a savour of death unto death.<a name=8:18></a> The word of God is never judged when it produces its effect; it judges "the thoughts and intentions of the heart".<a name=8:19></a> Man is subject to it; he does not judge it.<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When man has, through grace, received the word of truth, which addresses itself to him as such, he is in a condition to understand all its bearings by the help of the Holy Ghost; and, in this case, the circumstances of the persons, to whom it was addressed historically, become a means of understanding the intention of the mind of God in that part of the word which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is under consideration.<a name=9:1></a> These circumstances, as we have seen, do not at all affect the divine pureness of the word; but, since God speaks to men according to their condition, this condition, as set before us in the word itself, is a very great assistance in understanding that which is said.<a name=9:2></a> This condition itself is only understood by the word, and by the help of the Holy Ghost.<a name=9:3></a> Sometimes it is the effect of the wickedness of the human heart; sometimes it partly depends on the dispensations of God.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However this may be, grace addresses itself to men according to their condition,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:9">footnote</a></i>) according to the faithfulness of God to His promises, and in connection with His ways, which He has already taught them.<a name=9:5></a> It is not that (the true light being come) this light is dimmed or lowered to accommodate it to the darkness.<a name=9:6></a> Were this done, it would no longer be itself nor be capable of raising man by delivering him from the condition he is in; but it is so communicated as to be within the reach of men and applicable to their condition.<a name=9:7></a> It was this which they needed, it was this which was worthy of God.<a name=9:8></a> He alone could do it.<a name=9:9></a> And this is equally true as applicable to the subjects of which the Lord speaks, and to those spoken of by the Holy Ghost through the apostles.<a name=9:10></a> He may address Himself to Jews, converted but still attached to the Jewish system, in order to bring out the intentions of God (ever faithful to His promises) with regard to this people; as He might also, when raised on high, communicate by His Spirit all the consequences of the union of the church with Himself in the heavenly places, outside all the dealings of God upon the earth.<a name=9:11></a> And to those souls that were feeding on worldly elements, contrary to this heavenly elevation, and who did not lay hold in it of that which would deliver them from this worldly and carnal tendency -- to such He might display the proofs of the evil into which they were falling; and this He might do by means that would bring them into unison with the eternal truths of God, in a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		manner which, although elementary, would judge this carnal disposition that is found at all times in those who do not rise to the height of God's purposes.<a name=10:1></a> Or the Spirit might reveal the truth more simply in the elevation proper to it.<a name=10:2></a> He might dwell upon the essential characteristics of the nature of God, in order to judge all that pretended, under the most plausible forms, to be christian light, but which sinned against that nature in the most simple things; and thus link the most simple and most immature souls with the most exalted qualities of God Himself, in the essence of His nature.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The understanding (derived from the scriptures themselves, in which these things are found) of the position of those to whom they are addressed is of great use, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, in apprehending the divine truth contained in them; truth which is absolute, but, by the grace of God, applied truth, practical truth, realised in the soul by the power of God working in it, and guarding it by means of this truth, from the carnal tendency of the heart to fall into those evils which were the occasion of the scriptures that speak of them; truth that comes down to us, whatever our condition may be, not by altering its own character to accommodate itself to us, not by taking a form according to our condition, though suited to it, but comes down to us in order to raise us up to the source from whence it came down, and from which it never separates itself (for the truth communicated to us is ever the truth in God and in Christ, in order to raise us up morally to all the height of the divine nature); "which thing is true in him and in us, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth".<a name=10:4></a> It is the effect of the intervention of Christ, to whom we are united by the Holy Ghost, and who is one with God the Father.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This truth, that the communications of God are adapted to the position of those who historically received them, brings us into intelligence of all the counsels of God; for He reveals Himself in His authority, His wisdom, and His sovereignty, in these counsels, as He makes Himself known in His nature by the revelation of Himself in Christ.<a name=10:6></a> Christ is the centre of these counsels, but every family in heaven and earth is ranged under the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=10:7></a> Angels, principalities, powers, Jews, Gentiles, everything that is named, shall be placed under His authority (the church being united to Him in His glory).<a name=10:8></a> Now, the counsels of God with respect
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to us are revealed in His word; and, although God does not speak to us in order to gratify our curiosity, many subjects, outside salvation strictly speaking, which are connected with this supremacy of Christ, are connected also with that which God sets before us for our instruction, as the development of this in His dealings here below.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, although His intentions with regard to the Jews may naturally be much more developed in the Old Testament, yet the connection of their history with the subjects of the New, the historical transition from the old economy to the new, the reconciling the promises made to the Jews with the universality of the gospel economy: -- all these subjects must necessarily have a place in the New Testament, if the ways of God are to be known by us.<a name=11:2></a> I say, the ways of God; for we have not to think of the Jews only; it is God who acts and who makes Himself known in His dealings.<a name=11:3></a> Thus, although the full light displays itself in the New Testament, we find there things addressed to the Jews, and to the disciples who had formed a part of that people, and which reveal the dealings of God towards them.<a name=11:4></a> And without these revelations, and if they did not refer to the position of that people, there would be no harmony in the ways of God; at least it would be hidden from us, and would not exist morally.<a name=11:5></a> This refers to doctrine, to history (that is, to the presentation of the Messiah), to prophecy, which shews the faithfulness of God, and to the judgment upon that people.<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order that we may know God -- the God who has condescended to interpose in the affairs of this world -- mere light is not enough.<a name=11:7></a> He must be known, not only as He is in His nature, although that is the essential and principal thing, but as He has revealed Himself in the totality of His ways; in those details in which our little narrow hearts can learn His faithful, patient, condescending love; in those dealings which develop the abstract idea of His wisdom, so as to render it accessible to our limited intelligence, which can trace in it things which have been realised amongst men -- although entirely above and beyond all their prevision, but which have been declared by God, so that we know them to be of Him.<a name=11:8></a> Above all, God has been pleased to connect Himself in a special way with man in all these things; marvellous privilege of His feeble creature!<a name=11:9></a> Philosophy -- senseless, narrow-minded, and even essentially stupid in its arguments -- would have it

		that the world is too small for God thus to expend Himself on an impotent being like man, on that which is but a mere point in an immense universe.<a name=12:1></a> Contemptible folly!<a name=12:2></a> As if the material extent of the theatre were the measure of the moral manifestations wrought upon it, and of the war of principles which is there brought to an issue.<a name=12:3></a> That which takes place in this world is the spectacle that unfolds to all the intelligences of the universe the ways, and the character, and the will of God.<a name=12:4></a> It is for us to receive thereby, through grace, understanding, and power, that we may enjoy it, and that in us God may be glorified -- not only by us, which will be true of all things, but in us.<a name=12:5></a> This is our privilege, through the grace that is in Christ, and by our union with Him who is the wisdom of God and the power of God.<a name=12:6></a> The more we are as little children, obedient and humble, the more we shall realise this glorious position.<a name=12:7></a> Hereafter we shall know as we are known.<a name=12:8></a> Meanwhile, the more Christ is objectively our portion and our occupation, the more shall we resemble Him subjectively.<a name=12:9></a> Thanks be to God!<a name=12:10></a> He has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them unto babes.<a name=12:11></a> "Howbeit", says the apostle, "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought; but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory".<a name=12:12></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>, 6 - 7.<a name=12:13></a>)

		The Gospels, in general, develop these characters of Christ, not in a dogmatic manner (that of John alone having to a certain degree that form), but by so relating the history of the Lord as to present Him in these different characters, in a much more living way than if it were only set before us in doctrine.<a name=15:15></a> The Lord speaks according to such or such a character; He acts in the one or in the other; so that we see Him Himself accomplishing that which belonged to the different positions that we know to be His according to scripture.<a name=15:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may observe that the Holy Ghost mentions, in this genealogy, the grievous sins committed by the persons whose names are given, magnifying the sovereign grace of God who could bestow a Saviour in connection with such sins as those of Judah, with a poor Moabitess brought in amidst His people, and with crimes like those of David.<a name=19:2></a>

		No doubt repentance is an eternal necessity to every soul that approaches God; but what a light is thrown upon this truth, when we see the intervention of the Lord Himself who calls His people to this repentance, setting aside -- on their refusal -- the whole system of their relationships with Him, and establishing a new dispensation -- a kingdom which only belongs to those who hear Him -- and causing at length His judgment to break forth against His people and the city which He had so long cherished!<a name=25:1></a> "If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!<a name=25:2></a> but now they are hid from thine eyes".<a name=25:3></a>

		This truth gives room for the exhibition of another and most highly important one, announced here in connection with the sovereign rights of God rather than in its consequences, but which already contained in itself all those consequences.<a name=25:4></a> The people from all parts, and as we learn elsewhere especially the ungodly and despised, went out to be baptised, confessing their sins.<a name=25:5></a> But those who, in their own eyes, held the chief place among the people, were in the eyes of the prophet who loved the people according to God, the objects of the judgment he announced.<a name=25:6></a> Wrath was impending.<a name=25:7></a> Who had warned these scornful men to flee from it?<a name=25:8></a> Let them humble themselves like the rest; let them take their true place, and prove their change of heart.<a name=25:9></a> To boast in the privileges of their nation, or of their fathers, availed nothing before God.<a name=25:10></a> He required that which His very nature, His truth, demanded.<a name=25:11></a> Moreover He was sovereign; He was able of those stones to raise up children to Abraham.<a name=25:12></a> This is what His sovereign grace has done, through Christ, with regard to the Gentiles.<a name=25:13></a> There was reality needed.<a name=25:14></a> The axe was at the root of the trees, and those that did not bring forth good fruit should be cut down.<a name=25:15></a> This is the great moral principle which the judgment was going to put in force.<a name=25:16></a> The blow was not yet struck, but the axe was already at the root of the trees.<a name=25:17></a> John was come to bring those who received his testimony into a new position, or at least into a new state in which they were prepared for it.<a name=25:18></a> On their repentance he would distinguish them from the rest by baptism.<a name=25:19></a> But He who was coming after John -- He whose shoes John was not worthy to bear -- would thoroughly purge His floor, would separate those that were truly His, morally His, from among His people Israel (that was His floor), and would execute judgment on the rest.<a name=25:20></a> John on his part opened the door to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Judgment was not the only work that belonged to Jesus.<a name=26:2></a> Two things are however attributed to Him in John's testimony He baptises with fire -- this is the judgment proclaimed in verse 12, which consumes all that is evil.<a name=26:3></a> But He baptises also with the Holy Ghost -- that Spirit which, given to, and acting in divine energy in man, quickened, redeemed, cleansed in the blood of Christ, brings him out from the influence of all that acts on the flesh, and sets him in connection and in communion with all that is revealed of God, with the glory into which He brings His creatures in the life which He imparts, destroying morally in us the power of all that is contrary to the enjoyment of these privileges.<a name=26:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, as He has realised and displayed the place in which man is set with God in His own Person, and in the counsels of grace as to us our relationship with God, so, as we are in conflict with the enemy, He enters into that side of our position also.<a name=32:17></a> We have our relationship with God and our Father, and now we have to say to Satan also.<a name=32:18></a> He overcomes for us, and shews us how to overcome.<a name=32:19></a> Remark too, the relationship with God is first fully settled and brought out, and then, as in that place, the conflict with Satan begins, and so with us.<a name=32:20></a> But the first question was, Would the second Adam stand where the first had failed?<a name=32:21></a> only, in the wilderness of this world and Satan's power -- instead of the blessings of God -- for there we had got.<a name=32:22></a>

		John being cast into prison, the Lord departs into Galilee.<a name=38:5></a> This movement, which determined the scene of His ministry outside Jerusalem and Judea, had great significance with respect to the Jews.<a name=38:6></a> The people (so far as centred in Jerusalem, and boasting in the possession of the promises, the sacrifices, and the temple, and in being the royal tribe) lost the presence of the Messiah, the Son of David.<a name=38:7></a> He went away for the manifestation of His Person, for the testimony of God's intervention in Israel, to the poor and despised of the flock; for the remnant and poor of the flock are already in chapters 3, 4 clearly distinguished from the heads of the people.<a name=38:8></a> He thus really became the true stock, instead of being a branch of that which had been planted elsewhere; although this effect was not yet fully manifested.<a name=38:9></a> The moment corresponds with <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=38:10></a>

		At the same time this manifestation of the Son of David in Galilee was the fulfilment of a prophecy in Isaiah.<a name=39:1></a> The force of that prophecy is this: -- although the Roman captivity was far more terrible than the invasion of the Assyrians when they came up against the land of Israel, there was nevertheless this circumstance which altered everything, namely, the presence of the Messiah, the true Light, in the land.<a name=39:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We observe that the Spirit of God here passes over the whole history of Jesus until the commencement of His ministry after the death of John the Baptist.<a name=39:3></a> He gives Jesus His proper position in the midst of Israel -- Emmanuel, the Son of David, the Beloved of God, acknowledged as His Son, the faithful One in Israel, though exposed to all Satan's temptations; and then at once, afterwards, His prophetic position announced by Isaiah, and the kingdom proclaimed as at hand.<a name=39:4></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:39">footnote</a></i>)

		This discourse gives the principles of the kingdom, but supposes the rejection of the King, and the position into which this would bring those that were His; who consequently must look for a heavenly reward.<a name=42:5></a> They were to be a divine savour where God was known and was dealing, and would be a spectacle to the whole world.<a name=42:6></a> Moreover this was God's object.<a name=42:7></a> Their confession was to be so open that the world should refer their works to the Father.<a name=42:8></a> They were to act, on the one hand, according to a judgment of evil which reached the heart and motives, but also, on the other, according to the Father's character in grace -- to approve themselves to the Father who saw in secret, where the eye of man could not penetrate.<a name=42:9></a> They were to have full confidence in Him for all their need.<a name=42:10></a> His will was the rule according to which there was entrance into the kingdom.<a name=42:11></a>

		This parable does not speak, as a similitude, of the kingdom, though the word sown was the word of the kingdom, but of the great elementary principle of the service of Christ in the universality of its application, and as it was realised in His own Person and service while on the earth, and after He was gone, though fuller subjects of grace might then be brought out.<a name=69:13></a>

		Let us consider first the exterior of the kingdom publicly announced to the multitude -- the outward form which the kingdom would assume.<a name=70:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must remember that the King, that is, the Lord Jesus, was rejected on earth; that the Jews, in rejecting Him, had condemned themselves; that, the word of God being used to accomplish the work of Him whom the Father had sent, the Lord thus made it known that He established the kingdom, not by His power exercised in righteousness and in judgment, but by bearing testimony to the hearts of men; and that the kingdom now assumed a character connected with man's responsibility, and with the result of the word of light being sown in the earth, addressed to the hearts of men, and left as a system of truth to the faithfulness and the care of men (God, however, still holding good His sovereign right for the preservation of His children and of the truth itself).<a name=70:3></a> This latter part is not the subject of these parables.<a name=70:4></a> I have introduced it here, because it might otherwise have been supposed that everything depended absolutely on man.<a name=70:5></a> Had it been so, alas!<a name=70:6></a> all would have been lost.<a name=70:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable of the tares is the first.<a name=70:8></a> It gives us a general idea of the effect of these sowings as to the kingdom; or rather, the result of having for the moment committed the kingdom here below to the hands of men.<a name=70:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result was that the kingdom here below no longer presented as a whole the appearance of the Lord's own work.<a name=70:10></a> He sows not tares.<a name=70:11></a> Through the.<a name=70:12></a> carelessness and the infirmity of men, the enemy found means to sow these tares.<a name=70:13></a> Observe that this does not apply to the heathen or to the Jews, but to the evil done among Christians by Satan through bad doctrines, bad teachers and their adherents.<a name=70:14></a> The Lord Jesus sowed.<a name=70:15></a> Satan, while men slept, sowed also.<a name=70:16></a> There were judaisers, philosophers, heretics who held with both the former on the one hand, or on the other opposed the truth of the Old Testament.<a name=70:17></a>

		Nevertheless Christ had only sown good seed.<a name=70:18></a> Must the tares then be rooted out?<a name=70:19></a> Clearly the condition of the kingdom during the absence of Christ depends on the answer to this question; and it throws light also upon that condition.<a name=70:20></a> But there was still less power to bring in a remedy than there had

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We next find that it would not only be a great tree in the earth, but that the kingdom would be characterised as a system of doctrine, which would diffuse itself -- a profession, which would enclose all it reached within its sphere of influence.<a name=72:16></a> The whole of the three measures would be leavened.<a name=72:17></a> I need not dwell here on the fact that the word leaven is always used in a bad sense by the sacred writers; but the Holy Ghost gives us to understand that it is not the regenerative power of the word in the heart of an individual, bringing him back to God; neither is it simply a power acting by outward strength, such as Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, and the other great trees of scripture.<a name=72:18></a> But it is a system of doctrine that should characterise the mass, pervading it throughout.<a name=72:19></a> It is not faith properly so called, nor is it life.<a name=72:20></a> It is a religion; it is Christendom.<a name=72:21></a> A profession of doctrine, in hearts which will bear neither the truth nor God, connects itself always with corruption in the doctrine itself.<a name=72:22></a>

		After this parable Jesus no longer remains by the seaside with the multitude -- a place suited to the position in which He stood towards the people after the testimony borne at the end of chapter 12, and whither He had repaired on quitting the house.<a name=73:3></a> He now re-enters the house with His disciples; and there, in secluded intimacy with them, He reveals the true character -- the object -- of the kingdom of heaven, the result of that which was done in it, and the means which should be taken to cleanse everything on earth, when the outward history of the kingdom during His absence should have terminated.<a name=73:4></a> That is to say, we find here that which characterises the kingdom to the spiritual man, that which he understands as the true mind of God with regard to the kingdom, and the judgment which should purge out from it all that was contrary to Him -- the exercise of power which should render it outwardly in accordance with the heart of God.<a name=73:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen its outward history ending with this, the wheat hidden in the garner, and the tares left in bundles on the earth ready to be burnt.<a name=73:6></a> The explanation of this parable resumes the history of the kingdom at that period; only it gives us to understand and distinguish the different parts of the intermixture, ascribing each part to its true author.<a name=73:7></a> The field is the world;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:73">footnote</a></i>) there the word was sown for the establishment, in this manner, of the kingdom.<a name=73:8></a> The good seed were the children of the kingdom; they belonged to it really according to God; they are its heirs.<a name=73:9></a> The Jews were no longer so, and it was no longer the privilege of natural birth.<a name=73:10></a> The children of the kingdom were born of the word.<a name=73:11></a> But among these, in order to spoil the Lord's work, the enemy introduced all sorts of people, the fruit of the doctrines which he had sown among

		Chapter 16 goes farther than the revelation of the simple grace of God.<a name=86:12></a> Jesus reveals what was about to be formed in the counsels of that grace, where He was owned, shewing the rejection of the proud among His people, that He abhors them as they abhor Him.<a name=86:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#11">Zechariah  11</a>).<a name=86:14></a> Shutting their eyes (through perversity of will) to the marvellous and beneficent signs of His power, which He constantly bestowed on the poor who sought Him, the Pharisees and Sadducees -- struck with these manifestations, yet unbelieving in heart and will -- demand a sign from heaven.<a name=86:15></a> He rebukes them for their unbelief, shewing them that they knew how to discern the signs of the weather; yet the signs of the times were far more striking.<a name=86:16></a> They were the adulterous and wicked generation, and He leaves them: significant expressions of what was now passing in Israel.<a name=86:17></a>

		The work of the cross was needed; but it is not the question here of that which the righteous judgment of God required, or of the justification of an individual, but of that which nullified the power of the enemy.<a name=89:5></a> It was the Person of Him whom Peter was given to acknowledge, who lived according to the power of the life of God.<a name=89:6></a> It was a peculiar and direct revelation from heaven by the Father.<a name=89:7></a> Doubtless Christ had given proofs enough of who He was; but proofs had proved nothing to man's heart.<a name=89:8></a> The Father's revelation was the way of knowing who He was, and this went far beyond the hopes of a Messiah.<a name=89:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus far with respect to the assembly, now mentioned for the first time, the Jews having been rejected because of their unbelief, and man a convicted sinner.<a name=90:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another subject presents itself in connection with this of the assembly that the Lord was going to build; namely, the kingdom which was going to be established.<a name=90:7></a> It was to have the form of the kingdom of heaven; it was so in the counsels of God; but it was now to be set up in a peculiar manner, the King having been rejected on earth.<a name=90:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, rejected as He was, the keys of the kingdom were in the Lord's hand; its authority belonged to Him.<a name=90:9></a> He would bestow them on Peter, who, when He was gone, should open its doors to the Jews first, and then to the Gentiles.<a name=90:10></a> He should also exercise authority from the Lord within the kingdom; so that whatsoever he bound on earth in the name of Christ (the true King, although gone up to heaven) should be bound in heaven; and if he loosed anything on earth, his deed should be ratified in heaven.<a name=90:11></a> In a word, he had the power of command in the kingdom of God on earth, this kingdom having now the character of kingdom of heaven, because its King was in heaven(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:90">footnote</a></i>)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These four things then are declared by the Lord in this passage: -- First, the revelation made by the Father to Simon; Second, the name given to this Simon by Jesus, who was going to build His assembly on the foundation revealed in that which the Father had made known to Simon; Third, the assembly built by Christ Himself, not yet complete, on the foundation of the Person of Jesus acknowledged as Son of the living God; Fourth, the keys of the kingdom that should be given to Peter, that is to say, authority in the kingdom as administering it on the part of Christ, ordering in it that which was His will, and which should be ratified in heaven.<a name=91:4></a> All this is connected with Simon personally, in virtue of the Father's election (who, in His wisdom, had chosen him to receive this revelation), and of Christ's authority (who had bestowed on him the name that distinguished him as personally enjoying this privilege).<a name=91:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord having thus made known the purposes of God with regard to the future -- purposes to be accomplished in the assembly and in the kingdom, there was no longer room for His presentation to the Jews as Messiah.<a name=92:1></a> Not that He gave up the testimony, full of grace and patience towards the people, which He had borne throughout His ministry.<a name=92:2></a> No; that indeed continued, but His disciples were to understand that it was no longer their work to proclaim Him to the people as the Christ From this time also He began to teach His disciples that He must suffer and be killed and be raised again.<a name=92:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, blessed and honoured as Peter was by the revelation which the Father had made to him, his heart still clung in a carnal manner to the human glory of his Master (in truth, to his own), and was still far from rising to the height of the thoughts of God.<a name=92:4></a> Alas!<a name=92:5></a> he is not the only instance of this.<a name=92:6></a> To be convinced of the most exalted truths, and even to enjoy them sincerely as truths, is a different thing from having the heart formed to the sentiments, and to the walk here below, which are in accordance with those truths.<a name=92:7></a> It is not sincerity in the enjoyment of the truth that is wanting.<a name=92:8></a> What is wanting is to have the flesh, self, mortified -- to be dead to the world.<a name=92:9></a> We may sincerely enjoy the truth as taught of God and yet not have the flesh mortified or the heart in a state which is according to that truth in what it involves down here.<a name=92:10></a> Peter (so lately honoured by the revelation of the glory of Jesus, and made in a very special manner the depositary of administration in the kingdom given to the Son -- having a distinguished place in that which was to follow the Lord's rejection by the Jews) is now doing the adversary's work with respect to the perfect submission of Jesus to the suffering and ignominy that were to introduce this glory and characterise the kingdom.<a name=92:11></a> Alas!<a name=92:12></a> the case was plain; he savoured the things of men, and not the things of God.<a name=92:13></a> But the Lord, in faithfulness, rejects Peter in this matter, and teaches His disciples that the only path, the appointed and necessary path, is the cross; if any one would follow Him, that is the path He took.<a name=92:14></a> Moreover what would it profit a man to save his life and lose all -- to gain the world and lose his soul?<a name=92:15></a> For this was the question,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:92">footnote</a></i>) and not now the outward glory of the kingdom.<a name=92:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having examined this chapter, as the expression of the transition from the Messianic system to the establishment of the assembly founded on the revelation of the Person of Christ, I desire also to call attention to the characters of unbelief which are developed in it, both among the Jews and in the hearts of the disciples.<a name=93:1></a> It will be profitable to observe the forms of this unbelief.<a name=93:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all, it takes the grosser form of asking a sign from heaven.<a name=93:3></a> The Pharisees and Sadducees unite to shew their insensibility to all that the Lord had done.<a name=93:4></a> They require proof to their natural senses, that is, to their unbelief.<a name=93:5></a> They will not believe God, either in hearkening to His words or in beholding His works.<a name=93:6></a> God must satisfy their wilfulness, which would be neither faith nor the work of God.<a name=93:7></a> They had understanding for human things that were much less clearly manifested, but none for the things of God.<a name=93:8></a> A Saviour lost to them, as Jews on earth, should be the only sign granted them.<a name=93:9></a> They would have to submit, willing or not, to the judgment of the unbelief they displayed.<a name=93:10></a> The kingdom should be taken from them; the Lord leaves them.<a name=93:11></a> The sign of Jonah is connected with the subject of the whole chapter.<a name=93:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We next see this same inattention to the power manifested in the works of Jesus; but it is no longer the opposition of the unbelieving will; occupation of heart with present things withdraws such from the influence of the signs already given.<a name=93:13></a> This is weakness, not ill-will.<a name=93:14></a> Nevertheless they are guilty; but Jesus calls them "men of little faith", not "hypocrites", and "a wicked and adulterous generation".<a name=93:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We then see unbelief manifesting itself in the form of indolent opinion, which proves that the heart and conscience are not interested in a subject that ought to command them -- a subject that if the heart would really face its true importance, it would have no rest until it had arrived at certainty with respect to it.<a name=93:16></a> The soul here has no sense of need; consequently there is no discernment.<a name=93:17></a> When the soul feels this need, there is but one thing that can meet it; there can be no rest till it is found.<a name=93:18></a> The revelation of God that created this need, does not leave the soul in peace until it is assured of possessing that which awakened it.<a name=93:19></a> Those who are not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=94>[Page 94]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sensible of this need can rest in probabilities, each according to his natural character, his education, his circumstances.<a name=94:1></a> There is enough to awaken curiosity -- the mind is occupied about it, and judges.<a name=94:2></a> Faith has wants, and, in principle intelligence as to the object which meets those wants; the soul is exercised till it finds that which it needs.<a name=94:3></a> The fact is that God is there.<a name=94:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is Peter's case.<a name=94:5></a> The Father reveals His Son to him Though weak, living faith was found in him, we see the condition of his soul when he says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=94:6></a> Thou hast the words of eternal life; and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=94:7></a> Happy the man to whom God reveals such truths as these, in whom He awakens these wants!<a name=94:8></a> There may be conflict, much to learn, much to mortify; but the counsel of God is there, and the life connected with it.<a name=94:9></a> We have seen its effect in the case of Peter.<a name=94:10></a> Every Christian has his own place in the temple of which Simon was so eminent a stone.<a name=94:11></a> Does it then follow that the heart is, practically, at the height of the revelation made to it?<a name=94:12></a> No; there may be, after all, the flesh not yet mortified on that side where the revelation touches our earthly position.<a name=94:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fact the revelation made to Peter implied the rejection of Christ on earth -- necessarily led to His humiliation and death.<a name=94:14></a> That was the point.<a name=94:15></a> To substitute the revelation of the Son of God, the assembly and the heavenly kingdom, for the manifestation of the Messiah on earth -- what could it mean, except that Jesus was to be delivered up to the Gentiles to be crucified, and after that to rise again?<a name=94:16></a> But morally Peter had not attained to this.<a name=94:17></a> On the contrary, his carnal heart availed itself of the revelation made to him, and of that which Jesus had said to him, for self-exaltation.<a name=94:18></a> He saw, therefore, the personal glory without apprehending the practical moral consequences.<a name=94:19></a> He begins to rebuke the Lord Himself, and seeks to turn Him aside from the path of obedience and submission.<a name=94:20></a> The Lord, ever faithful, treats him as an adversary.<a name=94:21></a> Alas!<a name=94:22></a> how often have we enjoyed some truth, and that sincerely, and yet have failed in the practical consequences that it led to on earth!<a name=94:23></a> A heavenly glorified Saviour, who builds the assembly, implies the cross on earth.<a name=94:24></a> The flesh does not understand this.<a name=94:25></a> It will raise its Messiah to heaven, if you will; but to take its share of the humiliation that necessarily follows is not its

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are the forms of unbelief that precede a true confession of Christ, and that are found alas!<a name=95:5></a> in those who have sincerely confessed and known Him (the flesh not being so mortified that the soul can walk in the height of that which it has learnt of God, and the spiritual understanding being obscured by thinking of consequences which the flesh rejects).<a name=95:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if the cross was the entrance into the kingdom, the revelation of the glory would not be delayed.<a name=95:7></a> The Messiah being rejected by the Jews, a title more glorious and of far deeper import is unfolded: the Son of man should come in the glory of the Father (for He was the Son of God), and reward every man according to his works.<a name=95:8></a> There were even some standing there who should not taste of death (for of this they were speaking) till they had seen the manifestation of the glory of the kingdom that belonged to the Son of man.<a name=95:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark here the title of "Son of God" established as the foundation; that of Messiah given up so far as concerned the testimony rendered in that day, and replaced by that of "Son of man", which He takes at the same time as that of the Son of God, and which had a glory that belonged to Him in His own right.<a name=95:10></a> He was to come in the glory of His Father as Son of God, and in His own kingdom as Son of man.<a name=95:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to remember here the instruction given us in the beginning of the Book of Psalms.<a name=95:12></a> The righteous man, distinguished from the congregation of the wicked, had been presented in the first Psalm.<a name=95:13></a> Then, in the second, we have the rebellion of the kings of the earth and the rulers against the Lord and against His Anointed (that is, His Christ).<a name=95:14></a> Now upon this the decree of Jehovah is declared.<a name=95:15></a> Adonai, the Lord, shall mock at them from heaven.<a name=95:16></a> Further, Jehovah's King shall be established on Mount Zion.<a name=95:17></a> This is the decree: "Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my Son: this day(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:95">footnote</a></i>)

		After this (chapter 22: 15, et seq.<a name=116:5></a>) the different classes of the Jews come forward, each in turn.<a name=116:6></a> First, the Pharisees and the Herodians (that is, those who favoured the authority of the Romans, and those who were opposed to it) seek to entangle Jesus in His talk.<a name=116:7></a> The blessed Lord answers them with that perfect wisdom that ever displayed itself in all He said and all He did.<a name=116:8></a> On their part, it was pure wickedness manifesting a total want of conscience.<a name=116:9></a> It was their own sin that had brought them under the Roman yoke -- a position contrary indeed to that which should have belonged to the people of God on earth.<a name=116:10></a> Apparently therefore Christ must either become an object of suspicion to the authorities, or renounce His claim to be the Messiah and consequently the Deliverer.<a name=116:11></a> Who had occasioned this dilemma?<a name=116:12></a> It was the fruit of their own sins.<a name=116:13></a> The Lord shews them that they had themselves accepted the yoke.<a name=116:14></a> The money bore the mark of this: let them render it then to those unto whom it belonged, and let them also -- which they were not doing -- render unto God the things that were God's.<a name=116:15></a> He leaves them under the yoke which they were obliged to confess they had accepted.<a name=116:16></a> He reminds them of the rights of God; which they had forgotten.<a name=116:17></a> Such might moreover have been Israel's state according to the establishment of power in Nebuchadnezzar, as a "spreading vine of low stature".<a name=116:18></a>

		The Sadducees come next before Him, and question Him as to the resurrection, thinking to prove its absurdity.<a name=116:19></a> Thus, as the condition of the nation had been exhibited in His discourse with the Pharisees, the unbelief of the Sadducees is displayed here.<a name=116:20></a> They thought only of the things of this world, seeking to deny the existence of another.<a name=116:21></a> But whatever the state of degradation and subjection into which the people had fallen, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, changed not.<a name=116:22></a> The promises made to the fathers remained sure, and the fathers were living to enjoy these promises hereafter.<a name=116:23></a> It was the word and the power of God which were in question.<a name=116:24></a>

		It was now the Lord's turn to propose His question in order to bring out His own position.<a name=117:7></a> He asks the Pharisees to reconcile the title of Son of David with that of Lord which David himself gave Him, and that in connection with the ascension of this same Christ to sit at the right hand of God until God had made all His enemies His footstool, and established His throne in Zion.<a name=117:8></a> Now this was the whole of Christ's position at that moment.<a name=117:9></a> They were unable to answer Him, and no man durst ask Him any more questions.<a name=117:10></a> In fact, to understand that Psalm, would have been to understand all the ways of God with respect to His Son at the time they were going to reject Him.<a name=117:11></a> This necessarily closed these discourses by shewing the true position of Christ, who, although the Son of David, must ascend on high to receive the kingdom, and, while waiting for it, sit at the right hand of God according to the rights of His glorious Person -- David's Lord, as well as David's Son.<a name=117:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point of interest to be remarked here.<a name=117:13></a> In these interviews and these discourses with the different classes of the Jews, the Lord brings out the condition of the Jews on all sides with respect to their relations with God, and then the position which He took Himself.<a name=117:14></a> He first shews their national position towards God, as under responsibility to Him, according to natural conscience and the privileges belonging to them.<a name=117:15></a> The result would be their cutting off, and the bringing in of others into the Lord's vineyard.<a name=117:16></a> This is chapter 21: 28 - 46.<a name=117:17></a> He then exhibits their condition with regard to the grace of the kingdom, and the introduction of Gentile sinners.<a name=117:18></a> Here also

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the general history of that which would take place until the end of the age, without entering on the subject of the proclamation which founded the assembly properly so called.<a name=123:3></a> The impending destruction of Jerusalem, and the refusal of the Jews to receive the gospel, caused God to raise up a special testimony by the hands of Paul, without annulling the truth of the coming kingdom.<a name=123:4></a> That which follows proves that such a going forth of testimony of the kingdom will take place at the end, and that the testimony will reach all nations before the coming of that judgment which will put an end to the age.<a name=123:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there will be a moment when, within a certain sphere (that is, in Jerusalem and its vicinity) a special time of suffering shall set in as regards the testimony in Israel.<a name=123:6></a> In speaking of the abomination that maketh desolate, the Lord refers us to Daniel, that we may understand whereof He speaks.<a name=123:7></a> Now Daniel (chapter 12, where this tribulation is spoken of) brings us definitely to the last days -- the time when Michael shall stand up for Daniel's people, that is, the Jews, who are under the domination of the Gentiles -- the days in which there shall be a time of trouble, such as never had been nor ever again should be, and in which the remnant should be delivered.<a name=123:8></a> In the latter part of the previous chapter of that prophet, this time is called "the time of the end", and the destruction of the king of the north is prophetically declared.<a name=123:9></a> Now the prophet announces that 1335 days before the full blessing (blessed is he that has part therein!<a name=123:10></a>) the daily sacrifice should be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up; that from this moment there should be 1290 days (that is, one month more than the 1260 days spoken of in the Apocalypse, during which the woman who flees from the serpent is nourished in the wilderness; and also than the three years and a half of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>).<a name=123:11></a> At the end, as we find here, the judgment comes and the kingdom is given to the saints.<a name=123:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides this, other circumstances prove, if further proof were needed, that it is the Jewish remnant who are in question, and not the assembly.<a name=124:8></a> We know that all believers are to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=124:9></a> They will afterwards return with Him.<a name=124:10></a> But here there will be false Christs on the earth, and people will say, "He is here in the wilderness", "He is there in the secret chambers".<a name=124:11></a> But the saints who shall be caught up and return with the Lord have nothing at all to do with false Christs on earth, since they will go up to heaven to be with Him there, before He returns to the earth; while it is easy to understand that the Jews, who are expecting earthly deliverance, should be liable to such temptations, and that they should be deceived by them unless kept by God Himself.<a name=124:12></a>

		The prophetic history continues in chapter 25: 31, which is connected with chapter 24: 30.<a name=126:5></a> And as chapter 24: 31 relates the gathering together of Israel after the appearance of the Son of man, chapter 25: 31 announces His dealings in judgment with the Gentiles.<a name=126:6></a> He will appear doubtless as the lightning with regard to the apostasy, which will be as a dead body in His sight.<a name=126:7></a> But when He shall come solemnly to take His earthly place in glory, that will not pass away like lightning.<a name=126:8></a> He shall sit upon the throne of His glory, and all nations shall be gathered before Him on His throne of judgment, and they shall be judged according to their treatment of the messengers of the kingdom, who had gone out to preach it unto them.<a name=126:9></a> These messengers are the brethren (verse 40); those who had received them are the sheep; those who had neglected their message are the goats.<a name=126:10></a> The account then which begins chapter 25: 31, of the separation of sheep and goats and of its result, pictures the nations who are judged on earth according to their treatment of these messengers.<a name=126:11></a> It is the judgment of the living, so far at least as regards the nations -- a judgment as final as that of the dead.<a name=126:12></a> It is not Christ's judgment in battle as in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>.<a name=126:13></a> It is a session of His supreme tribunal in His right of government over the earth, as in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20:4">Revelation  20:4</a> I speak of the principle or rather of the character of the judgment.<a name=126:14></a> I do not doubt that these brethren are Jews, such as the disciples were, that is to say, those who will be in a similar position as to their testimony.<a name=126:15></a> The Gentiles, who had received this message, should be accepted, as though they had treated Christ in the same manner.<a name=126:16></a> His Father had prepared for them the enjoyment of the kingdom; and they should enter into it, being still on earth, for Christ was come down in the power of eternal life.<a name=126:17></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:126">footnote</a></i>)

		There are however, before we come to these, some verses of which I have not yet spoken, which apply more particularly to the state of things in Israel, as warning to the disciples who are there, and describe the discriminating judgment which takes place among the Jews in the last days.<a name=127:5></a> I speak of them here, because all this part of the discourse -- namely, from chapter 24: 31 to chapter 25: 31 -- is an exhortation, an address from the Lord, on the subject of their duties during His absence.<a name=127:6></a> I refer to chapter 24: 32 - 44.<a name=127:7></a> They speak of the continual expectation which their ignorance of the moment when the Son of man would come imposed on the disciples, and in which the disciples were intentionally left (and the judgment is the earthly one); while from verse 45, the Lord addresses Himself more directly, and at the same time in a more general manner, to their conduct during His absence, not in connection with Israel, but with His own -- His household.<a name=127:8></a> He had committed to them the task of supplying them with suitable food in due season.<a name=127:9></a> This is the responsibility of ministry in the assembly.<a name=127:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The efficacy of His death is presented to us in this Gospel in a double aspect.<a name=146:3></a> First, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.<a name=146:4></a> God, who had been always hidden behind the veil, discovered Himself completely by means of the death of Jesus.<a name=146:5></a> The entrance into the holy place is made manifest -- a new and living way which God has consecrated for us through the veil.<a name=146:6></a> The entire Jewish system, the relations of man with God under its sway, its priesthood, all fell with the rending of the veil.<a name=146:7></a> Every one found himself in the presence of God without a veil between.<a name=146:8></a> The priests were to be always in His presence.<a name=146:9></a> But, by this same act, the sin, which would have made it impossible for us to stand there, was for the believer entirely put away from before God.<a name=146:10></a> The holy God, and the believer, cleansed from his sins, are brought together by the death of Christ.<a name=146:11></a> What love was that which accomplished this!<a name=146:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, besides this, such was the efficacy of His death, that when His resurrection had burst the bonds that held them, many of the dead appeared in the city -- witnesses of His power who, having suffered death, had risen above it, and overcome it, and destroyed its power, or taken it into His own hands.<a name=146:13></a> Blessing was now in resurrection.<a name=146:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence therefore of God without a veil, and sinners without sin before Him, prove the efficacy of Christ's sufferings.<a name=146:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The resurrection of the dead, over whom the king of terrors had no more right, displayed the efficacy of the death of Christ for sinners, and the power of His resurrection.<a name=146:16></a> Judaism is over for those that have faith, and the power of death also.<a name=146:17></a> The veil is rent.<a name=146:18></a> The grave gives up its prey; He is Lord of the dead and of the living.<a name=146:19></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:146">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But they were not the only ones who filled the place of the terrified disciples.<a name=147:4></a> Others -- and this often happens -- whom the world had held back, when once the depth of their affection is stirred by the question of His sufferings whom they really loved, when the moment is so painful that others are terrified, then (emboldened by the rejection of Christ) they feel that the time is arrived for decision and become fearless confessors of the Lord.<a name=147:5></a> Hitherto associated with those that have crucified Him, they must now either accept that act, or declare themselves.<a name=147:6></a> Through grace they do the latter.<a name=147:7></a>

		But unbelief has no faith in itself, and, fearing lest that which it denies be true, it mistrusts everything.<a name=148:3></a> The chief priests request Pilate to guard the sepulchre, in order to frustrate any attempt the disciples might make to found the doctrine of the resurrection on the absence of the body of Jesus from the tomb in which it had been laid.<a name=148:4></a> Pilate bids them secure the sepulchre themselves; so that all they did was to make themselves involuntary witnesses to the fact, and assure us of the accomplishment of the thing they dreaded.<a name=148:5></a> Thus Israel was guilty of this effort of futile resistance to the testimony which Jesus had rendered to His own resurrection.<a name=148:6></a> They were a testimony against themselves to its truth.<a name=148:7></a> The precautions which Pilate would not perhaps have taken they carried to the extreme, so that all mistake as to the fact of His resurrection was impossible.<a name=148:8></a>

		The Lord's resurrection is briefly related in Matthew.<a name=148:9></a> The object is again, after the resurrection, to connect the ministry and service of Jesus -- now transferred to His disciples -- with the poor of the flock, the remnant of Israel.<a name=148:10></a> He again assembled them in Galilee, where He had constantly instructed them, and where the despised among the people dwelt afar from the pride of the Jews.<a name=148:11></a> This connected their work with His, in that which especially characterised it with reference to the remnant of Israel.<a name=148:12></a>

		As I have already said, Jesus connects Himself with His former work among the poor of the flock, afar from the seat of Jewish tradition, and from the temple, and from all that linked the people with God according to the old covenant.<a name=149:10></a> He appoints His disciples to meet Him there, and there they find Him and recognise Him; and it is there, in this former scene of the labours of Christ, according to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8">Isaiah  8</a>and 9, that they receive their commission from Him.<a name=149:11></a> Hence we have not the ascension of Christ at all in this Gospel, but all power is given unto Him in heaven and in earth, and accordingly the commission given to His disciples extends to all nations (Gentiles).<a name=149:12></a> To them they were to proclaim His rights, and make disciples of them.<a name=149:13></a>

		MARK
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel according to Mark has a character that differs in certain respects from all the others.<a name=151:1></a> Each Gospel, as we have seen, has its own character; each is occupied with the Person of the Lord in a different point of view: as a divine Person, the Son of God; as the Son of man; as the Son of David, the Messiah presented to the Jews, Emmanuel.<a name=151:2></a> But Mark is occupied with none of these titles.<a name=151:3></a> It is the Servant we find here -- and in particular His service as bearing the word -- the active service of Christ in the gospel.<a name=151:4></a> The glory of His divine Person shews itself, it is true, in a remarkable manner through His service, and, as it were, in spite of Himself, so that He avoids its consequences.<a name=151:5></a> But still service is the subject of the book.<a name=151:6></a> Doubtless we shall find the character of His teaching developing itself (and truth consequently shaking off the Jewish forms under which it had been held), as well as the account of His death, on which all depended for the establishment of faith.<a name=151:7></a> But that which distinguishes this Gospel is the character of service and of Servant that is attached to the life of Jesus -- the work that He came to accomplish personally as living on the earth.<a name=151:8></a> On this account the history of His birth is not found in Mark.<a name=151:9></a> It opens with the announcement of the beginning of the gospel.<a name=151:10></a> John the Baptist is the herald, the forerunner, of Him who brought this good news to man.<a name=151:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The message is new -- at least in the absolute and complete character it assumes, and in its direct and immediate application.<a name=151:12></a> It was not the Jewish privileges which should be obtained by repenting and returning to the Lord.<a name=151:13></a> The Lord was coming according to His promise.<a name=151:14></a> To prepare His way before Him, John was preaching repentance for the remission of sins.<a name=151:15></a> It was this they needed: remission of sins for the repentant was the great thing, the formal object of John's mission.<a name=151:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Repentance and remission of sins refer clearly to the responsibility of man, here of Israel, in his natural standing with God; and clearing that as to man's state relatively to God, morally and responsibly qualify him for the reception of purposed blessing -- morally in that he judges the sins in principle as God does, and responsibly by God's forgiving them all.<a name=151:17></a> Hence also remission is necessarily a present actual thing.<a name=151:18></a>

		There is a governmental forgiveness as well as a justifying one, but the principle is the same, and the latter is the basis of the former.<a name=152:1></a> Only where it is governmental it may be accompanied by various accompanying dealings of God, only the sin is no longer imputed as to present relationship with God, as in justifying, this is eternally true.<a name=152:2></a> In justifying forgiveness as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>, shewing by its use of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32">Psalm  32</a>, the common character of non-imputation -- it is founded on the work of Christ, and hence is absolute and unchangeable.<a name=152:3></a> Sin is not imputed and never can be, because the work is done and finished which puts it away out of God's sight: that -- eternal, absolute, and immutable in itself -- is the basis of all God's dealings with man in grace.<a name=152:4></a> Grace reigns through righteousness.<a name=152:5></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>, 10 unfolds this, where the conscience and coming to God, and that in the holiest, are concerned.<a name=152:6></a> So <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>- 5, where the question is judicial, a matter of judgment, wrath, and justifying.<a name=152:7></a> It is the basis of blessings, not the end, great as it is in itself -- peace with God and reconciliation.<a name=152:8></a> Here it was the ground of all the blessings Israel will have by the new covenant (founded on Christ's death), but being rejected, those who believed entered into better and heavenly blessings.<a name=152:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:14">Exodus  32:14</a>, 34, we get governmental forgiveness, not justifying.<a name=152:10></a> In the case of David's great sin, it was pardoned when owned, the iniquity of it put away, but severe chastisement connected with it because he had given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme.<a name=152:11></a> God's glory in righteousness had to be maintained before the world (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:13">2 Samuel  12:13</a>, 14).<a name=152:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here it was a proposal of present forgiveness to Israel, which will be accomplished in the last days; and then, as their long rejection will have closed in governmental forgiveness, they will also through the death and blood-shedding of Christ at least the remnant, be forgiven and justified for the enjoyment of the promises under the new covenant (compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>).<a name=152:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophets had indeed announced pardon if the people returned to the Lord; but here it was the present object of the address.<a name=152:14></a> The people go out in a body to avail themselves of it.<a name=152:15></a> Conscience at least was stirred; and whatever might be the pride of their leaders, the sense of Israel's condition was felt by the people, as soon as anything outside the routine of religion acted on the heart and conscience -- that is to say, when God spoke.<a name=152:16></a> They confess their sins.<a name=152:17></a> With some perhaps it was only natural conscience, that is, not a really quickening

		But John, rigidly separate from the people, and living apart from human society, proclaims another, mightier than he, whose shoe-latchet he was not worthy to unloose: He would not merely preach repentance accepted by the baptism of water; He would bestow the Holy Ghost, power, on those who received His testimony.<a name=153:2></a> Here our Gospel passes on rapidly to the service of Him whom John thus declared.<a name=153:3></a> It only sets forth summarily that which introduces Him into this service.<a name=153:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord takes His place among the repentant of His people, and, submitting to John's baptism, He sees heaven open to Him, and the Holy Ghost descending upon Him like a dove.<a name=153:5></a> The Father acknowledges Him as His Son on earth, in whom He is well pleased.<a name=153:6></a> He is then led by the Holy Ghost into the wilderness, where He undergoes the temptation of Satan for forty days; He is with the wild beasts, and angels exercise their ministry towards Him.<a name=153:7></a> Here we see His whole position -- the character which the Lord takes on earth -- all its features and relations with that which surrounded Him, gathered into these two or three verses.<a name=153:8></a> It has been treated of in its details in Matthew.<a name=153:9></a>

		LUKE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of Luke sets the Lord before us in the character of Son of man, revealing God in delivering grace among men.<a name=197:1></a> Hence the present operation of grace and its effect are more referred to, and even the present time prophetically, not the substitution of other dispensations as in Matthew, but of saving heavenly grace.<a name=197:2></a> At first, no doubt (and just because He is to be revealed as man, and in grace to men), we find Him, in a prefatory part in which we have the most exquisite picture of the godly remnant, presented to Israel, to whom He had been promised, and in relationship with whom He came into this world; but afterwards this Gospel presents moral principles which apply to man, whosoever he may be, whilst yet manifesting Christ for the moment in the midst of that people.<a name=197:3></a> This power of God in grace is displayed in various ways in its application to the wants of men.<a name=197:4></a> After the transfiguration, which is recounted earlier in the narration by Luke(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:197">footnote</a></i>) than in the other Gospels, we find the judgment of those who rejected the Lord, and the heavenly character of the grace which, because it is grace, addresses itself to the nations, to sinners, without any particular reference to the Jews, overturning the legal principles according to which the latter pretended to be, and as to their external standing were originally called at Sinai to be, in connection with God.<a name=197:5></a> Unconditional promises to Abraham, etc.<a name=197:6></a>, and prophetic confirmation of them, are another thing.<a name=197:7></a> They will be accomplished in grace, and were to be laid hold of by faith.<a name=197:8></a> After this, we find that which should happen to the Jews according to the righteous government of God; and, at the end, the account of the death and resurrection of the Lord, accomplishing the work of redemption.<a name=197:9></a> We must observe that Luke (who morally sets aside the Jewish system, and who introduces the Son of man as the man before God,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=198>[Page 198]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		presenting Him as the One who is filled with all the fulness of God dwelling in Him bodily, as the man before God, according to His own heart, and thus as Mediator between God and man, and centre of a moral system much more vast than that of Messiah among the Jews) -- we must observe, I repeat, that Luke, who is occupied with these new relations (ancient, in fact, as to the counsels of God), gives us the facts belonging to the Lord's connection with the Jews, owned in the pious remnant of that people, with much more development than the other evangelists, as well as the proofs of His mission to that people, in coming into the world -- proofs which ought to have gained their attention, and fixed it upon the child who was born to them.<a name=198:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Luke, I add, that which especially characterises the narrative and gives its peculiar interest to this Gospel is, that it sets before us that which Christ is Himself.<a name=198:2></a> It is not His official glory, a relative position that He assumed; neither is it the revelation of His divine nature, in itself; nor His mission as the great Prophet.<a name=198:3></a> It is Himself, as He was, a man on the earth -- the Person whom I should have met every day had I lived at that time in Judea, or in Galilee.<a name=198:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add a remark as to the style of Luke, which may facilitate the study of this Gospel to the reader.<a name=198:5></a> He often brings a mass of facts into one short general statement, and then expatiates at length on some isolated fact, where moral principles and grace are displayed.<a name=198:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many had undertaken to give an account of that which was historically received among Christians, as related to them by the companions of Jesus; and Luke thought it well -- having followed these things from the beginning, and thus obtained exact knowledge respecting them -- to write methodically to Theophilus, in order that he might have the certainty of those things in which he had been instructed.<a name=198:7></a> It is thus that God has provided for the instruction of the whole church, in the doctrine contained in the picture of the Lord's life furnished by this man of God; who, personally moved by christian motives, was directed and inspired by the Holy Ghost for the good of all believers.<a name=198:8></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:198">footnote</a></i>)

		At verse 5 the evangelist begins with the first revelations of the Spirit of God respecting these events, on which the condition of God's people and that of the world entirely depended; and in which God was to glorify Himself to all eternity.<a name=199:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we immediately find ourselves in the atmosphere of Jewish circumstances.<a name=199:2></a> The Jewish ordinances of the Old Testament, and the thoughts and expectations connected with them, are the framework in which this great and solemn event is set.<a name=199:3></a> Herod, king of Judea, furnishes the date; and it is a priest, righteous and blameless, belonging to one of the twenty-four classes, whom we find on the first step of our way.<a name=199:4></a> His wife was of the daughters of Aaron; and these two upright persons walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord (Jehovah) without blame.<a name=199:5></a> All was right before God, according to His law in the Jewish sense.<a name=199:6></a> But they did not enjoy the blessing that every Jew desired; they had no child.<a name=199:7></a> Nevertheless, it was according, we may say, to the ordinary ways of God in the government of His people, to accomplish His blessing while manifesting the weakness of the instrument -- a weakness that took away all hope according to human principles.<a name=199:8></a> Such had been the history of the Sarahs, the Rebeccas, the Hannahs, and many more, of whom the word tells us for our instruction in the ways of God.<a name=199:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This blessing was often prayed for by the pious priest; but until now the answer had been delayed.<a name=199:10></a> Now, however, when, at the moment of exercising his regular ministry, Zacharias drew near to burn incense, which, according to the law, was to go up as a sweet savour before God (type of the Lord's intercession), and while the people were praying outside the holy place, the angel of the Lord appears to the priest on the right side of the altar of incense.<a name=199:11></a> At the sight of this glorious personage Zacharias is troubled, but the angel encourages him by declaring himself to be the bearer of good news; announcing to him that his prayers, so long apparently addressed in vain to God, were granted.<a name=199:12></a> Elizabeth should bear a son, and the name by which he should be called was, "The favour of the Lord", a source of joy and gladness to Zacharias, and whose

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of Elias was a stedfast and ardent zeal for the glory of Jehovah, and for the establishment, or re-establishment by repentance, of the relations between Israel and Jehovah.<a name=200:5></a> His heart clung to this link between the people and their God, according to the strength and glory of the link itself, but in the sense of their fallen condition, and according to the rights of God in connection with these relationships.<a name=200:6></a> The spirit of Elias -- although indeed the grace of God towards His people had sent him -- was in a certain sense a legal spirit.<a name=200:7></a> He asserted the rights of Jehovah in judgment.<a name=200:8></a> It was grace opening the door to repentance, but not the sovereign grace of salvation, though what prepared the way to it.<a name=200:9></a> It is in the moral force of his call to repentance that John is here compared to Elias, in bringing back Israel to Jehovah.<a name=200:10></a> And in fact Jesus was Jehovah.<a name=200:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the faith of Zacharias in God and in His goodness did not come up to the height of his petition (alas!<a name=200:12></a> too common a case), and when it is granted at a moment that required the intervention of God to accomplish his desire, he is not able to walk in the steps of an Abraham or a Hannah, and he asks how this thing can now take place.<a name=200:13></a>

		Having thus unfolded the difference in character between the two dispensations, and the circumstances of the transition from the one to the other, the Lord turns (<b>chapter 15</b>) to higher principles -- the sources of the one that was brought in by grace.<a name=266:10></a> It is indeed a contrast between the two, as well as the chapters we have been going through.<a name=266:11></a> But this contrast rises to its glorious source in God's own grace, contrasted with the miserable self-righteousness of man.<a name=266:12></a> The publicans and sinners draw near to hear Jesus.<a name=266:13></a> Grace had its true dignity to those who needed it.<a name=266:14></a> Self-righteousness repulsed that which was not as contemptible as itself, and God Himself at the same time in His nature of love.<a name=266:15></a> The Pharisees and the scribes murmured against Him who was a witness of this grace in fulfilling it.<a name=266:16></a>

		When speaking on the Gospel of John, I shall enter more on the character of the temptations; but I would notice here, that at the commencement of His public life the tempter endeavoured to turn Jesus aside by setting before Him the attractiveness of all that which, as privilege, belonged to Him, all that might be agreeable to Christ as man, as to which His own will might work.<a name=291:12></a> He was defeated by the perfect obedience of Christ.<a name=291:13></a> He would have Christ, being Son, go out of the place He had taken as servant.<a name=291:14></a> Blessed be God he failed.<a name=291:15></a> Christ by simple obedience bound the strong man as to this life, and then returning in the power of the Spirit into Galilee spoiled his goods.<a name=291:16></a> Putting away sin and bearing our sins was another matter.<a name=291:17></a> Satan then departed from Him for a season.<a name=291:18></a> In Gethsemane he returns, using the fear of death to throw anguish into the heart of the Lord.<a name=291:19></a> And He must needs go

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of John has a peculiar character, as every Christian perceives.<a name=294:1></a> It does not present the birth of Christ in this world, looked at as the Son of David.<a name=294:2></a> It does not trace His genealogy back to Adam, in order to bring out His title of Son of man.<a name=294:3></a> It does not exhibit the Prophet who, by His testimony, accomplished the service of His Father in this respect here below.<a name=294:4></a> It is neither His birth, nor the commencement of His gospel, but His existence before the beginning of everything that had a beginning.<a name=294:5></a> "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=294:6></a> In short it is the glory of the Person of Jesus, the Son of God, above all dispensation -- a glory developed in many ways in grace, but which is always itself.<a name=294:7></a> It is that which He is; but making us share in all the blessings that flow from it, when He is so manifested as to impart them.<a name=294:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first chapter asserts what He was before all things, and the different characters in which He is a blessing to man, being made flesh.<a name=294:9></a> He is, and He is the expression of, the whole mind that subsists in God, the Logos.<a name=294:10></a> In the beginning He was.<a name=294:11></a> If we go back as far as is possible to the mind of men, how far soever beyond all that has had a beginning, He is.<a name=294:12></a> This is the most perfect idea we can form historically, if I may use such an expression, of the existence of God or of eternity.<a name=294:13></a> "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=294:14></a> Was there nothing beside Him?<a name=294:15></a> Impossible!<a name=294:16></a> Of what would He have been the Word?<a name=294:17></a> "The Word was with God".<a name=294:18></a> That is to say, a personal existence is ascribed to Him.<a name=294:19></a> But, lest it may be thought that He was something which eternity implies but which the Holy Ghost comes to reveal, it is said that He "was God".<a name=294:20></a> In His existence eternal -- in His nature divine -- in His Person distinct, He might have been spoken of as an emanation in time, as though His personality were of time, although eternal in His nature: the Spirit therefore adds, "In the beginning he was with God".<a name=294:21></a> It is the revelation of the eternal Logos before all creation.<a name=294:22></a> This Gospel therefore really begins before Genesis.<a name=294:23></a> The Book of Genesis gives us the history of the world in time: John gives us that of the Word, who existed in eternity before the world was; who -- when man can speak of beginning -- was; and, consequently, did not begin to exist.<a name=294:24></a> The language of

		the Gospel is as plain as possible, and, like the sword of paradise, turns every way, in opposition to the thoughts and reasonings of man, to defend the divinity and personality of the Son of God.<a name=295:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By Him also were all things created.<a name=295:2></a> There are things which had a beginning; they all had their origin from Him: "All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made".<a name=295:3></a> Precise, positive, and absolute distinction between all that has been made and Jesus.<a name=295:4></a> If anything has been made, it is not the Word; for all that has been made was made by that Word.<a name=295:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thing, besides the supreme act of creating all things (an act that characterises the Word) -- there is that which was in Him.<a name=295:6></a> All creation was made by Him; but it does not exist in Him.<a name=295:7></a> But in Him was life.<a name=295:8></a> In this He was in relation with an especial part of creation -- a part which was the object of the thoughts and intentions of God.<a name=295:9></a> This "life was the light of men", revealed itself as a testimony to the divine nature, in immediate connection with them, as it did not with respect to any others at all.<a name=295:10></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:295">footnote</a></i>) But, in fact, this light shone in the midst of that which was in its own nature(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:295">footnote</a></i>) contrary to it, and evil beyond any natural image, for where light comes, darkness is no longer: but here the light came, and the darkness had no perception of it -- remained darkness, which therefore neither comprehended nor received it.<a name=295:11></a> These are the relations of the Word with creation and with man, seen abstractedly in His nature.<a name=295:12></a> The Spirit pursues this subject, giving us details, historically, of the latter part.<a name=295:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Spirit passes from the divine and eternal nature of the Word who was before all things, to the manifestation, in this world, of the Word made flesh in the Person of Jesus.<a name=296:1></a> All the ways of God, the dispensations, His government of the world, are passed over in silence.<a name=296:2></a> In beholding Jesus on the earth we are in immediate connection with Him as existing before the world was.<a name=296:3></a> Only He is introduced by John, and that which is found in the world is recognised as created.<a name=296:4></a> John is come to bear witness of the Light.<a name=296:5></a> The true Light was that which, coming into the world, shone for all men, and not for the Jews only.<a name=296:6></a> He is come into the world; and the world, in darkness and blind, has not known Him.<a name=296:7></a> He is come unto His own, and His own (the Jews) have not received Him.<a name=296:8></a> But there were some who received Him.<a name=296:9></a> Of them two things are said: they have received authority to become the children(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:296">footnote</a></i>) of God, to take their place as such; and, secondly, they are, in fact, born of God.<a name=296:10></a> Natural descent, and the will of man, went for nothing here.<a name=296:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have seen the Word, in His nature, abstractedly (verse 1 - 3); and, as life, the manifestation of divine light in man, with the consequences of that manifestation (verse 4, 5); and how He was received where it was so (verse 10 - 13).<a name=296:12></a> This general part, in regard to His nature, ends here.<a name=296:13></a> The Spirit carries on the history of what the Lord is, manifested as man on earth.<a name=296:14></a> So that, as it were, we begin again here (verse 14) with Jesus on the earth -- what the Word became, not what He was.<a name=296:15></a> As light in the world, there was the unanswered claim of what He was on man.<a name=296:16></a> Not knowing Him, or rejecting Him where He was dispensationally in relationship was the only difference.<a name=296:17></a> Grace in life-giving power then comes in to lead men to receive Him.<a name=296:18></a> The world did not know its Creator come into it as light,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us in the fulness of grace and truth.<a name=297:4></a> This is the great fact, the source of all blessing to us;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:297">footnote</a></i>) that which is the full expression of God, adapted, by taking man's own nature, to all that is in man, to meet every human need, and all the capacity of the new nature in man to enjoy the expression of all in which God is suited to him.<a name=297:5></a> It is more than light, which is pure and shews all things; it is the expression of what God is, and God in grace, and as a source of blessing.<a name=297:6></a> And note, God could not be to angels what He is to man -- grace, patience, mercy, love, as shewn to sinners.<a name=297:7></a> And all this He is, as well as the blessedness of God, to the new man.<a name=297:8></a> The glory in which Christ was seen, thus manifested (by those who had eyes to see), was that of an only Son with His Father, the one concentrating object of His delight as Father.<a name=297:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are the two parts of this great truth.<a name=297:10></a> The Word, who was with God and who was God, was made flesh; and He who was beheld on the earth had the glory of an only Son with the Father.<a name=297:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things are the result.<a name=297:12></a> Grace (what greater grace?<a name=297:13></a> It is love itself that is revealed, and towards sinners) and truth, that are not declared, but come, in Jesus Christ The true relation of all things with God is shewn, and their departure from it.<a name=297:14></a> This is the groundwork of truth.<a name=297:15></a> Everything takes its true place, its true character, in every respect; and the centre to which all refers is God.<a name=297:16></a> What God is, what perfect man, what sinful man, what the world, what its prince, Christ's presence brings all out.<a name=297:17></a> Grace then and truth are come.<a name=297:18></a> The second thing is, that the only Son in the bosom of the Father reveals God, and reveals Him consequently as known by Himself in that position.<a name=297:19></a> And this is largely connected with the character and revelation of grace in John: first, fulness, with which we are in communication, and from which we have all received; then relationship.<a name=297:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Person of Jesus, the Word made flesh, dwelling among us, was full of grace and truth.<a name=298:1></a> Of this fulness we have all received: not truth upon truth (truth is simple, and puts everything exactly in its place, morally and in its nature); but we have received that which we needed -- grace upon grace, the favour of God abundantly, divine blessings (the fruit of His love) heaped one upon another.<a name=298:2></a> Truth shines -- everything is perfectly manifested; grace is given.<a name=298:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection of this manifestation of the grace of God in the Word made flesh (in which perfect truth also displays itself) with other testimonies of God is then taught us.<a name=298:4></a> John bore witness to Him; the service of Moses had quite another character.<a name=298:5></a> John preceded Him in his service on earth; but Jesus must be preferred before him; for (humble as He might be) God above all, blessed for ever, He was before John, although coming after him.<a name=298:6></a> Moses gave the law, perfect in its place -- requiring from man, on God's part, that which man ought to be.<a name=298:7></a> Then God was hidden, and God sent out a law shewing what man ought to be; but now God has revealed Himself by Christ, and the truth (as to everything) and grace are come.<a name=298:8></a> The law was neither the truth, full and entire,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:298">footnote</a></i>) in every respect, as in Jesus, nor grace; it was no transcript of God, but a perfect rule for man.<a name=298:9></a> Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, not by Moses.<a name=298:10></a> Nothing can be more essentially important than this statement.<a name=298:11></a> Law requires from man what he ought to be before God, and, if he fulfils it, it is his righteousness.<a name=298:12></a> Truth in Christ shews what man is (not ought to be), and what God is, and, as inseparable from grace, does not require but brings to man what he needs.<a name=298:13></a> If thou knewest the gift of God, says the Saviour to the Samaritan woman.<a name=298:14></a> So at the end of the wilderness journey Balaam has to say: "according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought?<a name=298:15></a>" The verb "came" is in the singular after grace and truth.<a name=298:16></a> Christ is both at once; indeed, if grace were not there He would not be the truth as to God.<a name=298:17></a> To require from man what he ought to be was righteous requirement.<a name=298:18></a> But to give grace and glory, to give His Son was another thing in every respect; only sanctioning the law as perfect in its place.<a name=298:19></a>

		After the abstract revelation of the nature of the Word, and that of His manifestation in the flesh, the testimony actually borne in the world is given.<a name=300:1></a> Verses 19 - 28 form a kind of introduction, in which, on the inquiry of the scribes and Pharisees, John gives account of himself, and takes occasion to speak of the difference between himself and the Lord.<a name=300:2></a> So that, whatever the characters may be that Christ takes in connection with His work, the glory of His Person is ever first in view.<a name=300:3></a> The witness is occupied naturally, so to speak, with this, before bearing his formal testimony to the office which he fulfilled.<a name=300:4></a> John is neither Elias nor that prophet (that is, the one of whom Moses spoke) nor the Christ.<a name=300:5></a> He is the voice mentioned by Isaiah, who was to prepare the way of the Lord before Him.<a name=300:6></a> It is not precisely before the Messiah, although He was that; neither is it Elias before the day of Jehovah, but the voice in the wilderness before the Lord (Jehovah) Himself.<a name=300:7></a> Jehovah was coming.<a name=300:8></a> It is this consequently of which he speaks.<a name=300:9></a> John baptised indeed unto repentance; but there was already One, unknown, among them, who, coming after him, was yet his superior, whose shoe's latchet he was not worthy to unloose.<a name=300:10></a>

		But this was not all.<a name=301:7></a> He had made Himself man, and as man had received the fulness of the Holy Ghost, who had descended upon Him and abode upon Him; and the man thus pointed out, and sealed on the part of the Father, was Himself to baptise with the Holy Ghost.<a name=301:8></a> At the same time He was pointed out by the descent of the Holy Ghost in another character, to which John therefore bears testimony.<a name=301:9></a> Thus subsisting and seen and sealed on the earth, He was the Son of God.<a name=301:10></a> John recognises Him and proclaims Him as such.<a name=301:11></a>

		Before going farther, let us review some points in this chapter.<a name=303:3></a> The Lord is revealed as the Word -- as God and with God -- as light -- as life: secondly, as the Word made flesh, having the glory of an only Son with His Father -- as such He is full of grace and truth come by Him, of His fulness we have all received, and He has declared the Father (compare chapter 14) -- the Lamb of God -- the One on whom the Holy Ghost could descend, and who baptised with the Holy Ghost -- the Son of God:(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#45:303">footnote</a></i>) thirdly, His work what He does, Lamb of God taking away sin, and Son of God and King of Israel.<a name=303:4></a> This closes the revelation of His Person and work.<a name=303:5></a> Then verses 35 - 42 John's ministry, but where Jesus, as He alone could, becomes the gathering centre.<a name=303:6></a> Verse 43, Christ's ministry, in which He calls to follow Him, which, with verses 38, 39, give His double character as the one attractive point in the world; with this His entire humiliation, but owned through a divine testimony reaching the remnant as according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, but the taking His title of Son of man according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>-- the Son of man: we may say, all His personal titles.<a name=303:7></a> His relationship to the assembly is not here, nor His function as Priest; but that which belongs to His Person, and the connection of man with God in this world.<a name=303:8></a> Thus, besides His divine nature, it is all that He was and will be in this world: His heavenly place and its consequences to faith are taught elsewhere, and barely alluded to, when necessary, in this Gospel.<a name=303:9></a>

		Observe that, in preaching Christ, in a way to a certain degree complete, the heart of the hearer may truly believe and attach itself to Him, though investing Him with a character which the condition of soul cannot yet go beyond, and while ignorant of the fulness in which He has been revealed.<a name=304:1></a> Indeed where it is real, the testimony, however exalted in character, meets the heart where it is.<a name=304:2></a> John says, "Behold the Lamb of God!<a name=304:3></a>" "We have found the Messiah", say the disciples who followed Jesus on John's testimony.<a name=304:4></a>

		The Lord begins with the full restoration of Peter's soul.<a name=411:5></a> He does not reproach him with his fault, but judges the source of evil that produced it -- self-confidence.<a name=411:6></a> Peter had declared, that if all should deny Jesus, yet he at least would not deny Him.<a name=411:7></a> The Lord therefore asks him, "Lovest thou me more than do these?<a name=411:8></a>" and Peter is reduced to acknowledge that it required the omniscience of God to know that he, who had boasted of having more love than all others for Jesus, had really any affection for Him at all.<a name=411:9></a> And the question thrice repeated must indeed have searched the depths of his heart.<a name=411:10></a> Nor was it till the third time that he says, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee".<a name=411:11></a> Jesus did not let his conscience go until he had come to this.<a name=411:12></a> Nevertheless the grace which did this for Peter's good -- the grace which had followed him in spite of everything, praying for him before he felt his need or had committed the fault -- is perfect here also.<a name=411:13></a> For, at the moment when it might be thought that at the utmost he would be re-admitted through divine forbearance, the strongest testimony of grace is lavished upon him.<a name=411:14></a> When humbled by his fall, and brought to entire dependence upon grace, all-abounding grace displays itself.<a name=411:15></a> The Lord commits that which He most loved to him -- the sheep whom He had just redeemed.<a name=411:16></a> He commits them to Peter's care.<a name=411:17></a> This is the grace which surmounts all that man is, which is above all that man is; which consequently produces confidence, not in self, but in God, as One whose grace can always be trusted in, as being full of grace and perfect in that grace which is above everything, and is always itself; grace which makes us able to accomplish the work of grace towards -- whom?<a name=411:18></a> -- man who needs it.<a name=411:19></a> It creates confidence in proportion to the measure in which it acts.<a name=411:20></a>

		But the grace of the loving Saviour did not stop here.<a name=412:13></a> Peter might still feel the sorrow of having missed such an opportunity of confessing the Lord at the critical moment.<a name=412:14></a> Jesus assures him that if he had failed in doing so of his own will, he should be allowed to do it by the will of God; and as when young he girded himself, others should gird him when old and carry him whither he would not.<a name=412:15></a> It should be given him by the will of God to die for the Lord, as he had formerly declared himself ready to do in his own strength.<a name=412:16></a> Now also that Peter was humbled and brought entirely under grace -- that he knew he had no strength -- that he felt his dependence on the Lord, his utter inefficiency if he trusted to his own power -- now, I repeat, the Lord calls Peter to follow Him; which he had pretended to do, when the Lord had told him he could not.<a name=412:17></a> It was this that his heart desired.<a name=412:18></a> Feeding those whom Jesus had continued to feed until His death, he should see Israel reject everything, even as Christ had seen them do; and his own work end, even as Christ had seen His work end (the judgment ready to fall, and beginning at the house of God).<a name=412:19></a> Finally, what he had pretended to do and could not, he would now do -- follow Christ to prison and to death.<a name=412:20></a>
