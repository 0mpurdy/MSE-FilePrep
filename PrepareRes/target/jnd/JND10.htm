		LAW
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <br>I am not sorry to know with some distinctness what the views of those are who maintain the law to be the Christian's rule of life; and what the arguments by which they maintain their opinions.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, but without controversy, to consider the subject, which is really an important one, as calmly as I can.<a name=1:2></a> I make allowance, or would endeavour to do so, for theological habits of mind.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Taught myself exclusively by scripture, a multitude of expressions which are never found there appear strange to me, while they are at the base of the habits of thought of those whose views I have here to consider.<a name=1:4></a> Thus, "the moral law," "Christ's righteousness," and the like, which lie at the heart of the subject, are never found in scripture.<a name=1:5></a> But we must make allowance for these theological habits and expressions, see how far they are scriptural in substance, and hold fast the substance, while preferring, as surely clearer and more excellent, scriptural forms of expression.<a name=1:6></a> I have no doubt that unscriptural expressions are the fruit of, and lead to, unscriptural habits of mind; on the other hand it is not good to jeopardize substantial truths by making war on words which express them.<a name=1:7></a> The word "Trinity" is not found in scripture; the expression "justified by faith only" is not found in scripture; yet I need not justify them to you as human expressions of essentially fundamental truths.<a name=1:8></a> I have no better words, and I use what I find commonly used to express what I believe in my inmost soul; and I would not shake the faith of those who hold fast the truth expressed in these words to quarrel with the words by which thousands of saints have expressed it before me.<a name=1:9></a> So with the word "Person" applied to the Godhead.<a name=1:10></a> It is not scriptural; but I have no better word for One who sends, is sent, comes, goes away, wills, distributes, and does distinctive acts.<a name=1:11></a> The Father sends the Son, the Son does not send the Father.<a name=1:12></a> I doubt that any one will give me a better word than that which has clothed the deep divinely given convictions of faith in saints for ages.<a name=1:13></a> If a person quarrels with the word always used to express a truth without having a better, I dread a little his quarrelling with the truth it conveys.<a name=1:14></a> I say this that you may be assured that I do not seek to unsettle any simple soul by captious difficulties about words, or by resistance to expressions formed in the schools.<a name=1:15></a>

		If a servant of God merely sought to insist on the danger of what is vulgarly called Antinomianism -- that is, the wickedness of making liberty a cloak for maliciousness (and we know from scripture that flesh is perfectly capable of doing so), certainly he would not have me for an adversary.<a name=2:1></a> If they called this the moral law, in urging godliness as the necessary fruit of a living faith, I might have regretted the vagueness of an unscriptural phraseology -- the want of spiritual point and power in not making Christ the substance of moral teaching, as of doctrinal, as the scripture surely and blessedly does; but, in the root of the matter, I think I may say I should have cordially joined with what was intended.<a name=2:2></a> Such exhortations have their place and their necessity.<a name=2:3></a> That a Christian should walk according to the precepts of the New Testament, and all the divine light he can gather for his walk from the Old, be it the Ten Commandments or anything else, no consistent or right-minded Christian could for a moment deny.<a name=2:4></a> I could not own as being on christian ground one who would.<a name=2:5></a> I may not be his judge, but I am bound to judge the principles he professes.<a name=2:6></a> But I suppose such are rare, if such are to be found.<a name=2:7></a> At any rate he would receive no support from me or from you.<a name=2:8></a> I need hardly dwell on it otherwise than to reject it as utterly evil and unchristian.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is one of the distinctive marks between heresy and any advance in true divine knowledge, that the latter always holds the moral foundation fast, the difference of right and wrong immovable and fixed, as it is in the divine nature and revealed in the word; the heretic slights or loses sight of it.<a name=2:10></a> This is remarkably shewn in Romans 2: 6-10, found at the outset of an epistle where justification by faith and by grace is so largely, methodically, and blessedly insisted on.<a name=2:11></a> The apostle does not stop to enquire there how the good is to be arrived at, or to weaken fundamental principles by explanations to prove their consistency with other doctrines, so as to enfeeble them.<a name=2:12></a> Other scriptures may teach us this, and do, I doubt not, clearly, and these we have to compare; but there is the great truth, in all its immovable and unalterable firmness, founded in the nature of God and responsibility of man.<a name=2:13></a> The divine <i>fines bonorum et malorum</i> (if I may use a heathen expression in divine things) are not to be overpassed.<a name=2:14></a> I may see that in myself I must, in my state of nature, be condemned on this ground, and flee for refuge to the hope set before me, and find a life which does continue in well-doing, as is here demanded, and find righteousness in Christ, and know I can find these

		things nowhere else; but immutable righteousness is there to make it necessary I should find them, however unspeakably the grace and glory which I do find may be beyond the measure of the responsibility which has forced me to seek them.<a name=3:1></a> These will never destroy nor enfeeble that.<a name=3:2></a> My objection to the way in which the moral law is spoken of, where Christians are put under law, is not the maintenance of moral obligations (this is all right); but that, by using the term moral law, and then referring to law as spoken of by the apostle, the teaching of the apostle is subverted and set aside, and that in practically most important points.<a name=3:3></a> And as this will lead me to some very vital truths, I desire to take the question up, which for mere controversy's sake I should not.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I speak of <i>moral law</i> (which scripture does not), I make it, by the very expression, a fatal thing to be delivered from it.<a name=3:5></a> Yet Paul says the Christian is delivered from the law.<a name=3:6></a> If I make of the law a moral law (including therein the precepts of the New Testament, and all morality in heart and life), to say a Christian is delivered from it is nonsense or utterly monstrous wickedness; certainly it is not Christianity.<a name=3:7></a> Conformity to the divine will, and that, as obedience to commandments, is alike the joy and the duty of the renewed mind.<a name=3:8></a> I say, "obedience to commandments.<a name=3:9></a>" Some are afraid of the word, as if it would weaken love and the idea of a new creation; scripture is not.<a name=3:10></a> Obedience and keeping the commandments of one we love is the proof of that love, and the delight of the new nature.<a name=3:11></a> Did I do all right and not do it in obedience, I should do nothing right, because my true relationship and heart-reference to God would be left out.<a name=3:12></a> This is love, that we keep His commandments.<a name=3:13></a> We are sanctified to the obedience of Christ.<a name=3:14></a> Christ Himself says, "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me; but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given me commandment, so I do.<a name=3:15></a>" His highest act of love is His highest act of obedience.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this it is that just makes it so mischievous to put the Christian under the law, and change the scripture phraseology to another, and speak of the moral law being given as a rule of life; and having no passage in which "moral law" is used, quoting Paul's statements as to "law," from which he says, and insists on it as one of the chief topics of his teaching, we are delivered.<a name=3:17></a> Not merely that we are not justified by its works (<i>yet we should be if the moral law were kept</i>, and so he declares, "the doer of the law shall be justified"); but that we are <i>delivered from it</i>.<a name=3:18></a> A Christian

		is delivered from it, because it is ruinous in its effect, whenever applied to men who are fallen.<a name=4:1></a> Not, clearly, the ceremonial law -- that he could fulfil, however burdensome it might be.<a name=4:2></a> It is the moral law which is ruinous in its effect to every fallen son of Adam.<a name=4:3></a> Is it morality that is ruinous, or obedience to Christ's precepts?<a name=4:4></a> That were a blasphemy to say, and shocking to every christian mind.<a name=4:5></a> But it is of law the apostle declares, what was ordained to life he found to be to death.<a name=4:6></a> (Romans 7.<a name=4:7></a>) It is a ministration of death, and ministration of condemnation.<a name=4:8></a> (2 Corinthians 3: 7-9.<a name=4:9></a>) As <i>many</i> as are of its works -- on the principle of it -- its works are not bad ones -- are under a curse.<a name=4:10></a> (Galatians 3: 10.<a name=4:11></a>) That is, law means, in the apostle's teaching, something else than a rule or measure of conduct.<a name=4:12></a> It is a principle of dealing with men which necessarily destroys and condemns them.<a name=4:13></a> This is the way the Spirit of God uses law in contrast with Christ, and never in christian teaching puts men under it; but carefully shews how they are delivered from it -- are no longer under it.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor does scripture ever think of saying, You are not under the law in one way, but you are in another; you are not for justification, but you are as a rule of life.<a name=4:15></a> It declares you are not under law, but under grace; and if you are under law, you are condemned and under a curse.<a name=4:16></a> It must have its own proper force and effect.<a name=4:17></a> Remark, it puts it as a principle contrasted with grace.<a name=4:18></a> But will a man say, You wrong us in saying we hold that a Christian is under law?<a name=4:19></a> I ask, How is that obligatory which a man is not under -- from which he is delivered?<a name=4:20></a> No; the apostle carefully insists that the law is good, that it is not the fault of the law that we are condemned, if we have to say to it (but he as carefully declares we are if we have); and that, in fact, we are delivered from it; that if led of the Spirit, we are not under law.<a name=4:21></a> He uses it to express a principle, a manner of dealing on the part of God, contrasted with grace.<a name=4:22></a> That is the way he speaks of law.<a name=4:23></a> I repeat it, scripture speaks elaborately of being delivered from the law as ministering death and a curse, declaring that we are not under it.<a name=4:24></a> Use the term moral law, and say so, and see where you bring us.<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that this may be before our eyes, I will quote some scriptures, that we may see that this is no light subject nor strained assertion: "As many as are of the works of the law are under a curse.<a name=4:26></a>" "The law entered that the offence might abound.<a name=4:27></a>" Mark the word entered (<i>pareiselthe</i>).<a name=4:28></a> It was a principle, a system, a way of dealing that came in.<a name=4:29></a> "Sin shall not have dominion over you, <i>because</i> ye are <i>not</i> under the law, but under grace.<a name=4:30></a>"

		"The sting of death is sin; the <i>strength of sin is</i> the law.<a name=5:1></a>" "I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.<a name=5:2></a>" Is the apostle speaking of the ceremonial law?<a name=5:3></a> Far from it; he is speaking of the law in its moral nature and essence.<a name=5:4></a> He says, "I had not known lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet (lust).<a name=5:5></a>" And when he had said that sin should not have dominion over us, because we are not under the law, he immediately adds, "What then?<a name=5:6></a> shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?<a name=5:7></a>" shewing that the introduction of the notion of the ceremonial law has no place at all here.<a name=5:8></a> Nor is it justification he is speaking of here; but serving sin, or the contrary.<a name=5:9></a> No; he treats the whole question of law in a way totally different, and contrary to that in which it is treated in much evangelical teaching.<a name=5:10></a> I continue: "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.<a name=5:11></a>" "Sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<a name=5:12></a>" Is this ceremonial law?<a name=5:13></a> It is a principle on which God placed man "four hundred and thirty years after the promise," which "was <i>added</i> because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.<a name=5:14></a>" But now the seed is come to whom the promise was made, and "now we are delivered from the law.<a name=5:15></a>" What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God has done in another way.<a name=5:16></a> How we are delivered from the law, so as not to allow sin, I shall speak of presently.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am now shewing that scripture treats the question of law in another way from what I am here examining.<a name=5:18></a> Before faith came, we were kept under the law; but after that faith came, we were no longer under the schoolmaster.<a name=5:19></a> If the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise; but God gave it unto Abraham by promise.<a name=5:20></a> The law was added.<a name=5:21></a> Further, if there had been a law given which could have given life, righteousness should have been by the law.<a name=5:22></a> "But the scripture hath concluded all under sin.<a name=5:23></a>" "I, through law," says the apostle, "am dead to law, that I might live to God.<a name=5:24></a>" "If I am led of the Spirit, I am not under law.<a name=5:25></a>" "Ye are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ, that ye might be married to another.<a name=5:26></a>" It is "the ministration of death written and engraven on stones.<a name=5:27></a>" How is it possible, if law could be used as the moral law, by which a Christian is bound, that the apostle should say, "Wherefore, my brethren, ye are become dead to the law by the body of Christ?<a name=5:28></a>"

		Will it be said that this was the effect of law out of and before Christ?<a name=6:17></a> Let the reader remember that the apostle is writing to Christians, and reasoning against a tendency and an effort which beset Christians everywhere to bring in the obligation of the law <i>after Christ</i>.<a name=6:18></a> And he shews the working of the law for any that took it up to bring its obligations upon them when they were Christians, and declares that he who had been under law was delivered from it, and that it was a schoolmaster up to faith; but that when faith came men were no longer under it.<a name=6:19></a> The subject he is everywhere treating is law in its nature,<a href="#6:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> or specifically an attempt to place men under its obligation <i>after</i> they had received the faith.<a name=6:20></a>

		It is monstrous to suppose, if the disciples in seeing Jesus were blessed as no prophet or king had been, and yet that it was expedient for them that He should go away, because otherwise the Comforter could not come; that when He is come He should not have given us in joy, piety, intelligence, motives, knowledge of God, even of the Father and the Son, the Spirit of sonship, consciousness of being in Christ and Christ in us, communion with the Father and the Son, which the Old Testament saints did not possess.<a name=26:4></a> "The heir, as long as he was a child, differed nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all.<a name=26:5></a>" This, the apostle diligently teaches, is the difference of the state of Old Testament saints -- "God having reserved some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect," so that the least in the kingdom of heaven should be greater than the greatest of those before born of women.<a name=26:6></a> Life and incorruptibility are brought to light by the gospel.<a name=26:7></a> I do not see piety or respect for the word in denying or undervaluing the revealed gifts of God unfolded to us in the New Testament.<a name=26:8></a> Is it nothing that the Comforter is come?<a name=26:9></a> Where in the Old Testament are saints called on to yield themselves to God as those that are alive from the dead?<a name=26:10></a> Is this no rule of life?<a name=26:11></a> Is it the law?<a name=26:12></a> It is a mere abuse of words to say so.<a name=26:13></a>

		Hear him on Noah's: "Some think these burnt offerings had something in them of the nature of a propitiatory sacrifice, as well as eucharistical, which they certainly were, for their deliverance from the flood.<a name=38:10></a> Their reason is taken from what follows, 'The Lord smelled a sweet savour' (verse 21); that is, as Munster understands it, He ceased from His anger, and was appeased.<a name=38:11></a> So the Syriac and Josephus.<a name=38:12></a> But it may signify no more, but that his thankfulness was as grateful to God as sweet odours are to us.<a name=38:13></a>" As to Abel: "What kind of sacrifices these were is a question among learned men.<a name=38:14></a> The Talmudists are of opinion they were whole burnt offerings.<a name=38:15></a> Abel brought of the fat thereof, that is, of the very best.<a name=38:16></a>" Cain ate the firstfruits himself, as some allege.<a name=38:17></a> He says, "But there is no certainty of this; and the apostle to the Hebrews hath directed us to a better account -- Abel offered with a pious mind.<a name=38:18></a>" And before, "It was a very seasonable time to make their grateful acknowledgments to God who had given them a plentiful year.<a name=38:19></a>" But worse yet, "He graciously accepted them (Abel's offerings, offered with a pious mind), and his offering was accepted, because he himself was accepted.<a name=38:20></a> It is a metaphor from those who, when a present is made to them, look kindly upon the person who brings it, if they like him and his present.<a name=38:21></a>" What do you think, my reader, of citing Bishop Patrick to prove that burnt offerings are propitiatory?<a name=38:22></a> And what do you think of the journal which cites him for it?<a name=38:23></a> "Cain offered of the fruit of the ground, but did not devote himself to God.<a name=38:24></a>" Now I do not agree with Bishop Patrick, though I do not charge him with Socinianism; but he lays the Socinian axe to the parent root and stem in a terrible way.<a name=38:25></a>

		Now in the burnt offering the thought is distinctly kept up that death had come in, and that atonement and a victim were needed for our approach to God.<a name=39:9></a> But while this is carefully maintained, and sin, being there, Christ could not have offered Himself for us and as making atonement for sin without bloodshedding ("for without shedding of blood there is no remission"); yet the specific purport of the burnt offering is that which the article seeks, as far as possible, to destroy.<a name=39:10></a> Christ is presented in the burnt offering as offering Himself to God for us.<a name=39:11></a> This must go on to death most surely for atonement; but it had not the specific character of the sin offering, but another.<a name=39:12></a> Job, when there were no other than burnt offerings (unless feasts are offerings, peace offerings, for such I think they were, see Exodus 18: 12), offered them in case his sons should have sinned.<a name=39:13></a> The whole idea of an offering, even to death and expiation by it, was embraced in the one kind.<a name=39:14></a> In the law, God, while maintaining the grand principle of death and atonement, separated the distinctive parts, that is, the voluntary offering (because Christ was to offer Himself wholly, even unto death), and the actual bearing of sins and drinking the cup of wrath, though both were in one act, death being there for both.<a name=39:15></a>

		This was called for when such a one as the Son of God was to be brought near the eye, so to speak, as a sacrifice; and this difference the writer obliterates, and C.<a name=40:1></a> H.<a name=40:2></a> M.<a name=40:3></a> insists on.<a name=40:4></a> The differences are these:<br>The name of the sin offering in Hebrew is the same as sin itself.<a name=40:5></a> So Christ, who knew no sin, was made sin.<a name=40:6></a> The offerer was to bring his sin.<a name=40:7></a> The sin offering was appointed to be offered only when a man had sinned.<a name=40:8></a> He was to offer, and was bound to do it, for that sin.<a name=40:9></a> He could not rightly offer the burnt offering till this was done.<a name=40:10></a> The burnt offering was not offered when a man had sinned, but of his own voluntary will.<a name=40:11></a> The sin was forgiven (the word is omitted as to the high priest) when the sin offering was offered.<a name=40:12></a> This is never said as to the burnt offering.<a name=40:13></a> When the blood of the sin offering was brought into the holy place, the body was not burnt on the altar at all (hence I said the writer was very inexact) -- and this was a capital fact referred to by the Epistle to the Hebrews -- but burnt outside the camp.<a name=40:14></a> It was not called a sweet savour (though the fat <i>was</i>, in the individual ones, to intimate the connection of the two in the one perfect person of Christ).<a name=40:15></a> In the burnt offering the sacrifice was wholly burnt on the altar and was always a sweet savour.<a name=40:16></a> And this was so distinct that the word <i>burn</i> is not the same.<a name=40:17></a> As to the sin offering, "burn" is the common word; as to the burnt offering, the same as burning incense.<a name=40:18></a> In the individual sin offering the priests ate a part; in the burnt offering all was consumed on the altar.<a name=40:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this marks out a very different aspect of the work.<a name=40:20></a> Sin offering, called sin, supposes a person incapable of worshipping.<a name=40:21></a> He must bear sin (or another for him) and be forgiven.<a name=40:22></a> The burnt offering does not suppose an actual state of sin before God, which forbids approach, though it shews that no man could approach without blood; and that if Christ gave Himself up for us, it must be to death.<a name=40:23></a> When the case called for it, he first offered a sin offering, and, being forgiven, could offer his burnt offering.<a name=40:24></a> It was the voluntary act of the worshipper, not the present necessity of sin.<a name=40:25></a> Thus it represents Christ who gave Himself up obedient unto death; and then, in a subordinate sense, our coming through Him, worshipping, and devoting ourselves to God.<a name=40:26></a>

		Imputed righteousness has been treated of elsewhere.<a name=41:3></a> I only add here, that the writer's mistake here arises from his not understanding what imputed righteousness means.<a name=41:4></a> It does not mean a quantum of formal righteousness outside us, imputed to us, but our being accounted righteous.<a name=41:5></a> Righteousness being imputed to a man simply means the man being accounted righteous.<a name=41:6></a> As the writer refers to the Thirty-nine Articles, he may see it so expressed there.<a name=41:7></a> Hence the argument of the article about imputing a divine attribute goes for nothing -- has no sense in it; it is, like the rest, simply ignorance.<a name=41:8></a> God, according to that divine attribute, accounts us righteous, because of the work of Christ.<a name=41:9></a> There is nothing "lurks" at all, except in the mind or pen of the writer of the article.<a name=41:10></a> I simply, very openly, deny his doctrine of the justifying vicariousness of Christ's life as under the law.<a name=41:11></a> But the writer says we evade the passages which speak of His righteousness.<a name=41:12></a> We do not evade them; we ask for them.<a name=41:13></a> It does not at all follow because Christ is God that, if God's righteousness is spoken of, it means Christ's as a man under the law.<a name=41:14></a> What we say is, that Christ's righteousness as a man under law is not spoken of at all.<a name=41:15></a> The righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, in 2 Peter, is not spoken of as to justification at all, and has nothing to do with the subject.<a name=41:16></a> The promises have been fulfilled in sending Christianity (Christ the object of faith, though not personally present) to the dispersed remnant by a righteous God.<a name=41:17></a> (Chapter 1: 1).<a name=41:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In fine, the sacrifices do incontestably point out the difference of Christ's voluntarily devoting Himself to death to glorify God Himself in the work of atonement when sin was come in, and His specifically charging Himself with the sins of His guilty people to bear and put them away.<a name=41:19></a> If the writer cannot understand the difference, he loses a large part of the blessed truths specially exposed in St.<a name=41:20></a> John's Gospel, and suffers very great loss to his own soul.<a name=41:21></a>

		The very day on which I terminated the above I received a "Record" of August 11 from England, in reply (if it can be called so) to my letter on the Righteousness of God.<a name=70:10></a> I do not think there is any superfluous honesty in it, but only one thing which calls for any answer, because it refers to scripture.<a name=70:11></a> The rest insists on the question being settled by divines, about which I trouble myself very little.<a name=70:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Record" says I have (in quoting it) omitted what was "the substance of three proof texts.<a name=70:13></a>" Had I quoted the passage in full, it says, it would have been an answer to my demand of scripture.<a name=70:14></a> Here is what is stated to be omitted, "That he bore the curse of the broken law, and also at the same time magnified it and made it honourable.<a name=70:15></a> He was obedient unto death, His obedience unto death.<a name=70:16></a>" The "Record" then refers to Galatians 3: 13; Philippians 2: 8; Isaiah 42: 21.<a name=70:17></a> Now I am quite ready to admit that the "Record" had these passages in mind, though it did not quote them.<a name=70:18></a> Let us look at them.<a name=70:19></a> The question is, whether Christ's keeping the law for us during His lifetime is imputed to us for righteousness.<a name=70:20></a>

		But there is one passage in the new article of the "Record" to which I must turn, because it is to me vital in this question, more so than some which relate to the law.<a name=72:7></a> Those who hold our justification by Christ's keeping the law are obliged, more or less, to obliterate the true character of His death as propitiation.<a name=72:8></a> If His living sufferings and obedience had this character, then the death of Christ loses its peculiar atoning force.<a name=72:9></a> "Without shedding of blood there is no remission.<a name=72:10></a>" He gives His flesh for the life of the world.<a name=72:11></a> On the cross He stands a victim under the curse -- under wrath, forsaken of God, pouring out His soul unto t death.<a name=72:12></a> The life, says the "Record," "is the basis of the death, the death the close of the life-work.<a name=72:13></a>" So before, "We ought to think of Christ's work as a whole.<a name=72:14></a> The Bible speaks of it as His obedience unto death.<a name=72:15></a>" The "Record" states that I do "not believe in the obedience unto death of the Lord Jesus Christ as the one man's obedience whereby many were made righteous.<a name=72:16></a>" This is simply untrue: I do believe it.<a name=72:17></a>

		It is this slighting of propitiation and the dying sorrow of Christ -- when it pleased the Lord to bruise Him, when He made His soul an offering for sin, when the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, when He was bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, when He once suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust, being put to death in the flesh -- it is this that I abhor and denounce above all.<a name=73:15></a> This <i>indeed</i> the Socinian would own-that He was blessedly obedient unto death, that His death was the close of His life-work, all one whole: why should he not?<a name=73:16></a> But substitution on the cross, propitiation, drinking the cup of wrath for us there -- this the Socinian would not hear of; and this the language of the "Record" sets aside.<a name=73:17></a> Nothing, it seems to me, is a more terrible sign of the state of the professing church than the open slighting of Christ's death which is current in it.<a name=73:18></a> With Mr.<a name=73:19></a> Newton first it was an incident; with the "Christian Examiner" it was having life to pass through death with; for the "Record" it is the close of His life-work, and to be viewed as a whole.<a name=73:20></a>

		scripture which the "Record" displays.<a name=77:1></a> They accuse us of teaching that "Christ did not obey our law.<a name=77:2></a>" This is simply false, unless <i>our</i> law is some other law than the law of God.<a name=77:3></a> I have stated the contrary in many places.<a name=77:4></a> One passage of scripture suffices: "Made of a woman, made under the law.<a name=77:5></a>" Further, I hold that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.<a name=77:6></a> It is useful to convince of sin, but it is not made for the righteous: at least so scripture says.<a name=77:7></a> Using it to convict a sinner of sin is a different thing from a Christian being under it; as different as having a sword with a handle, and running another through the body, from being run through oneself.<a name=77:8></a> The law is good, if a man use it lawfully; it is death and condemnation if he is under it.<a name=77:9></a> "It is the ministration of death and condemnation," as scripture teaches.<a name=77:10></a> Further, the law may be used as all scripture teaching which communicates the mind of God, as in Ephesians 6, where the importance attached to obedience to parents is noticed; God thinks so much of it that it is the first commandment to which a promise is attached.<a name=77:11></a> Further, the authority of the law is proved by those who have sinned under it being judged by it; a passage which at the same time disproves positively its universality, because this is contrasted with those who have sinned without law perishing without law.<a name=77:12></a> A Christian is not under it, because he has in Christ died and risen again.<a name=77:13></a> Of this I have spoken and shall have occasion briefly to refer to it.<a name=77:14></a>

		righteousness.<a name=78:1></a> I do not think it refers to application, but states what we are to hold as sanctification; but I make no resistance, as I think there is an intended order, though not a state described.<a name=78:2></a> The Spirit of God seems to me to be speaking of the first necessity as before God, righteousness; and then the actual result, as viewing the end of being actually before Him; and hence sanctification, the setting apart of the whole man according to what is in Christ Himself, is brought out afterwards; and then final delivery from our whole mortal state into glory, which is what I understand here by redemption.<a name=78:3></a>

		In 1 Thessalonians 5: 23, we get what may justly be called progressive sanctification -- "May the God of peace sanctify you wholly.<a name=78:4></a>" Again, Hebrews 12: 14, "Follow after holiness.<a name=78:5></a>" (See too 2 Corinthians 3: 18.<a name=78:6></a>) These fully justify speaking of progress in holiness, or practical setting apart of the heart and mind to God by its being filled with Christ, provided that the first truth be held of a primary setting apart, which is absolute and once for all, and that in the way of a new life, being born of God -- of water, and of the Spirit.<a name=78:7></a> If this be not held, sanctification becomes a mere gradual fitting of man as such for God, leaving out a new life, and denies that in that he is washed (<i>leloumenos</i>) he needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.<a name=78:8></a> And this is a mischievous doctrine; and this, as far as I can see, is the doctrine of the "Record," the rather as it speaks of a peculiar view as to flesh.<a name=78:9></a> Does it not believe that the flesh is irreparably bad, and is not subject to the law of God (which is the "Record's" means of sanctifying), neither indeed can be?<a name=78:10></a> The "Record" must answer for itself in this.<a name=78:11></a> Does it believe in a new nature really imparted, that Christ becomes our life, and that thus we are in Christ sanctified to God, though this may be developed, as a child's life may, but is never in its nature other than it is at the beginning?<a name=78:12></a> What does the "Record" say?<a name=78:13></a> It does not venture meeting its adversaries on scripture truths.<a name=78:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Record" assures us that Romans 6 and 7 fully bring out its doctrine; it forgets to tell us where.<a name=78:15></a> But the appeal is a singular one.<a name=78:16></a> There we are told we are to reckon ourselves dead and alive to God through Christ; that sin shall not have dominion over us, because we are not under law but under grace; that we are delivered from the law, having died in that wherein we were held; that we cannot be subject to the law and Christ together -- that it is as bad as having two husbands.<a name=78:17></a> Further, we get the effects of attempts at sanctification under law; namely, the

		discovery that there is no power; and that, when to will is present, there is no possibility of finding the means of performing what is good, so that the soul is forced to cry for deliverance -- a deliverance which is found in Christ, because in Him we are no longer in the flesh at all.<a name=79:1></a> Thus the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made the Christian free from the law of sin and death; which the law could not do, because it was weak through the flesh.<a name=79:2></a> This, the "Record" tells us, teaches us the doctrine of progressive sanctification by means of the law!<a name=79:3></a> It really is infatuation.<a name=79:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I return to the accusation -- that we hold that we are on another principle than law.<a name=79:5></a> Assuredly we do.<a name=79:6></a> I say with Paul, "Be ye as I am; ye have not injured me at all.<a name=79:7></a>" We are under grace, not under law.<a name=79:8></a> We are not justified by the law.<a name=79:9></a> And as to the dominion of sin, we believe that sin will not have dominion over us because we are <i>not</i> under law but under grace.<a name=79:10></a> The principle we find in scripture is, being dead to the law by the body of Christ.<a name=79:11></a> Nothing can exceed the diligence and care with which the apostle -- that is, the Spirit of God -- teaches us that we are on a different principle from law.<a name=79:12></a> We are not under the first husband but the second; and death has wholly severed the bond.<a name=79:13></a> We are called upon to reckon ourselves dead to the principle on which the "Record" insists, and married to another to bring forth -- and by which alone we can bring forth -- fruit to God (namely, to Him that is risen from the dead).<a name=79:14></a>

		Further, we are under quite a different head from the first Adam.<a name=79:15></a> This is the vital point -- we are under the Second.<a name=79:16></a> We have died in Christ as under the first Adam, and belong to Christ only.<a name=79:17></a> We say "when <i>we were</i> in the flesh," because God has taught us so in His word.<a name=79:18></a> The truth is, it is difficult to understand how the writer of this article can be a Christian.<a name=79:19></a> If he be, he must have wholly neglected scripture.<a name=79:20></a> We are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of Christ dwells in us; if not, we are not Christ's at all.<a name=79:21></a> We have died in Christ to our whole condition as under Adam headship -- died in that which put away sin for us, and we know no head but Christ.<a name=79:22></a> The flesh remains, to lust against the Spirit, but we are called upon not to own it -- to <i>reckon</i> ourselves dead, knowing there is no good thing in it.<a name=79:23></a> We are told we are dead; if dead with Christ, not living (alive) in the world.<a name=79:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I merely add, that to say the taking away the law from the gospel leaves nothing deserving the name of the gospel, is a monstrous statement.<a name=80:7></a> Forgiveness, justification, eternal life, sovereign love, all, and still more than this, are ignored as of no consequence.<a name=80:8></a> The "Record" quotes, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<a name=80:9></a>" Does the "Record" believe we get life by keeping the law?<a name=80:10></a> The statements of this article are incredible.<a name=80:11></a> Of course, under the law, to one who said "Good Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?<a name=80:12></a>" no answer could have been given than "Keep the commandments.<a name=80:13></a>" "This do and thou shalt live" is the principle of law.<a name=80:14></a> But was a law given which could give life?<a name=80:15></a> or is eternal life the gift of God through Jesus?<a name=80:16></a> Is not the whole teaching of the epistles, of Christianity itself, that neither life nor righteousness can be had by law?<a name=80:17></a> that Moses says, he that doeth shall live by them, but that the righteousness of faith speaks otherwise?<a name=80:18></a> Do we get life by the law, or by Christ?<a name=80:19></a> No doubt the path towards eternal life in its fulness in glory is the path of patient obedience.<a name=80:20></a> But to quote "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" as the way of attaining life, or as a sufficient rule of life, is setting Christ aside.<a name=80:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this brings me to another question and to statements in the "Record" which again almost throw the Christianity of the critic into doubt.<a name=80:22></a> He accuses C.<a name=80:23></a> H.<a name=80:24></a> M.<a name=80:25></a> of writing "of something higher, better, than the law.<a name=80:26></a>" Let him, he says, "tell us what it is, what specifically is the morality, the heart-holiness, that is higher than the commandments demand?<a name=80:27></a> Who exemplified it?<a name=80:28></a> for Christ did not.<a name=80:29></a> The law contented Him.<a name=80:30></a> That and that alone

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The simple answer to this is, <i>God</i> was in Christ.<a name=81:7></a> Was He (with reverence be it spoken) to love His neighbour as Himself?<a name=81:8></a> Was there nothing but this in Christ?<a name=81:9></a> Was this the highest standard of His walk?<a name=81:10></a> Let us continue the passage: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them.<a name=81:11></a>" Did all His path not answer to this?<a name=81:12></a> Were His relationships to saints and sinners not founded on and characterized by this position?<a name=81:13></a> Did not all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him stamp His walk in everything as a man?<a name=81:14></a> But it will be said, He was no pattern for us in this.<a name=81:15></a> This, too, is a mistake.<a name=81:16></a> Let us still continue the passage.<a name=81:17></a> "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.<a name=81:18></a>" All are not apostles; but all are called, each in his place, to walk in the spirit and temper of this.<a name=81:19></a> See how the apostle speaks in 2 Corinthians 5, "The love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they that live should live henceforth not to themselves, but to him that died for them and rose again.<a name=81:20></a> Therefore if any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new; and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ.<a name=81:21></a>" Nor is the love of Christ in His death excepted from this following of Him.<a name=81:22></a> "Hereby," says the apostle John, "know we love, because he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=81:23></a>" Again, see the end of Ephesians 4 and beginning of chapter 5, and the parallel passage in Colossians 3, "And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<a name=81:24></a>" "Be ye therefore imitators of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=81:25></a>"

		I have anticipated this question, happily, already at the close of the article to which this is appended.<a name=81:26></a> I only add therefore, that it is quite evident that the actings of God in grace must be something quite different from the subjection of man to law in its highest form; and he who does not understand this understands neither what the grace of God nor what the law is.<a name=81:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every one who can read the original knows that John 5 is a distinct statement that the believer will not come into judgment.<a name=82:15></a> First, both the Father and Christ are spoken of as quickening or giving life.<a name=82:16></a> But the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son, thereby securing His glory in the case of the unwilling and the wicked.<a name=82:17></a> But the cases are not confounded.<a name=82:18></a> "He," says the Saviour, "who heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.<a name=82:19></a>" Hence we read at the end, there is a resurrection to life and a resurrection to judgment.<a name=82:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That we wait for Christ in glory, consequently, scripture makes plain: "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.<a name=82:21></a>" Are we not to believe that Christ will come and receive believers into glory?<a name=82:22></a> Is that taking them up to raise the question, whether they are to be accepted or not?<a name=82:23></a> And if we take the saints who have died, it is, if possible, still more absurd; for they

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, take the resurrection: "it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.<a name=83:3></a>" We must be judged after we are glorified, if we are thence taken to judgment.<a name=83:4></a> I might cite many other passages -- Philippians 3, for instance.<a name=83:5></a> None is stronger than the one the "Record" has quoted the half of to prove the contrary.<a name=83:6></a> The doctrine of a general judgment at the end, in which the acceptance of the believer is to be settled, is not Christianity.<a name=83:7></a> It teaches that Christ's first coming was a perfect and saving work for those who, through grace, believe on Him; that they are accepted in the Beloved and loved as He is loved; but that all will be brought out in the presence of God.<a name=83:8></a> But believers know that, when Christ shall appear, they shall be like Himself; as it is so beautifully stated in 1 John 4, "Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.<a name=83:9></a>" Christ has borne their judgment, their sins; and when they appear before Him, they will meet Him who has done so.<a name=83:10></a> Christ's coming is, for them, their final bringing into glory.<a name=83:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now to take up the question of what the Church is.<a name=83:12></a> On this point I can well suppose beloved saints not seeing clear, but I distinctly maintain the doctrine which the "Record" attacks.<a name=83:13></a> The Church, a thing spoken of in the doctrinal part of scripture only by Paul, is composed, according to scripture, only of the saints from Pentecost till the Lord comes to receive it to Himself.<a name=83:14></a> We must distinguish between salvation and an assembly.<a name=83:15></a> When men speak of the Church, Christians have a general vague idea of all the redeemed.<a name=83:16></a> If we say "assembly," we can easily understand that individuals can be saved without forming an assembly.<a name=83:17></a> We can easily understand that Israel was an assembly -- as it is often called in the Old Testament -- without confounding it with an assembly formed of Jew and Gentile, by the breaking down of that middle wall of partition, the maintenance of which alone maintained the Jewish assembly.<a name=83:18></a> Even in heaven we find an innumerable company of angels, the general assembly (<i>paneguris</i>), the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven (<i>echchlesia</i>), and the spirits of just men made perfect, all distinguished.<a name=83:19></a> Now the christian assembly, properly called the Church, neither was revealed nor existed, nor could have existed, before the death of Christ and the mission of the Holy Ghost.<a name=83:20></a> The Jewish assembly was that of the people
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=84>[Page 84]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		contrasted with the nations.<a name=84:1></a> The christian church is, ostensibly and in its real purpose, the gathering together in one of the children of God scattered abroad.<a name=84:2></a> These two, Israel and the assembly, are noticed as distinct objects of Christ's death in that remarkable comment on the prophecy of Caiaphas: He gave Himself "not for that nation only, but that he might gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<a name=84:3></a>" This distinction between Israel and the assembly is brought into distinct relief when the Lord, setting aside Israel for a time, added to the Church the remnant of them that escaped by grace.<a name=84:4></a> At the end, when the christian saints get their heavenly portion, Israel will be established as a whole.<a name=84:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now shew that the Christian Church had never been revealed before Christ.<a name=84:6></a> "Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began.<a name=84:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a>.<a name=84:8></a>) "Whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.<a name=84:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:4">Ephesians  3:4</a>-6.<a name=84:10></a>) "And to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things: to the intent that now to the principalities and to the powers in the heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.<a name=84:11></a>" (verse 9, 10.<a name=84:12></a>) "Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints.<a name=84:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>, 26.<a name=84:14></a>) Thus we see that with this manifold wisdom of God, neither man nor principalities and powers in heavenly places could have any acquaintance; it was hid in God.<a name=84:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, I say that the Church did not exist, any more than the knowledge of it was given.<a name=84:16></a> The first time it is mentioned in scripture is when the confession of Christ's being the Son of the living God is made by Simon, and the Lord declares that on this Rock, now first thus revealed, He <i>will</i> build His Church, a thing yet future.<a name=84:17></a> I may add that in the following chapter the glory of the kingdom is revealed, and in chapter 18 the Church is practically substituted for the synagogue.<a name=84:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, when the Holy Ghost is come down and the disciples have been baptized with it, we find, as we have seen in the beginning of Acts, "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.<a name=85:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now turn to divine teaching on the subject, which, as we have said, is found only in Paul: not even the word is found elsewhere, save as applied to a local church.<a name=85:2></a> It is distinctly founded, in the end of Ephesians 1, on the exaltation of the man Christ above all principalities and powers (we being quickened together with Him, to be united with Him in this place).<a name=85:3></a> In chapter 2, where the effectuating of these truths is unfolded, it is expressly taught that it is by the breaking down of the middle wall of partition by Christ's death, and reconciling both Jew and Gentile in one body by the cross, making in Himself of twain one new man; and then shewing that we are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit -- a different kind of dwelling of God from that which formed the centre of the assembly of Israel.<a name=85:4></a> All this is enlarged and insisted upon, and applied to our walk in this new condition in chapters 3 and 4 from which I have quoted already, and to which the reader may refer.<a name=85:5></a> If we turn to 1 Corinthians we are taught how the unity of the body is formed.<a name=85:6></a> We are the body of Christ and members in particular; and it is by one Spirit we have been all baptized into one body; and we are expressly taught in the beginning of Acts that this baptism took place at the day of Pentecost.<a name=85:7></a> "Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<a name=85:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the formation of the body is distinctly revealed to date from the day of Pentecost.<a name=85:9></a> The Church according to God did not exist before.<a name=85:10></a> I add that it could not have existed before; first, because the head was not yet in heaven, to which the body was to be united; secondly, that consequently the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified; and thirdly, as to its actual formation on earth, because it was founded on the breaking down of the middle wall of partition by Christ's death.<a name=85:11></a> Its existence in the mind of God is nothing to the purpose -- that it did from all eternity.<a name=85:12></a> And the question still remains, What existed in the mind of God to be revealed in due time?<a name=85:13></a> And this, if scripture is to be believed, was the gathering together Jew and Gentile in one body, by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, consequent upon the exaltation of the Christ to the right hand of God.<a name=85:14></a> I would just warn the reader to take notice of the double character of the Church: its being the body of Christ on the one

	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Record" quotes many coming from the east and from the west to sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, as a proof that they belonged to the Church, the body of Christ.<a name=86:4></a> But this is mere blundering: the kingdom of God is not the body of Christ.<a name=86:5></a> The reader may see, from the quotation from C.<a name=86:6></a> H.<a name=86:7></a> M.<a name=86:8></a>, which immediately follows in the "Record," that it is expressly taught, that they will be in the heavenly glory.<a name=86:9></a> No further remark as to this theme is called for.<a name=86:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of the Sabbath I approach with more fear, though perfectly clear in my own mind about what scripture teaches, because it really requires, in order to understand it, a knowledge of God's ways, and because of the abuse likely to be made of it by those who are lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.<a name=86:11></a> But as the subject has been raised, I will refer to it.<a name=86:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Were I merely arguing against the Sabbath, as people say, I might cite the fact of the entire omission of any reference to it in the "Sermon on the Mount," where the spirituality of the law is insisted on.<a name=86:13></a> I might cite the fact, that in every instance in which it is mentioned, the Lord throws a slight upon it, Christ declaring the Son of man to be Lord of it.<a name=86:14></a> I might appeal to history, shewing that the primitive church was unaware of its obligation, and treated it as Judaism, and that there were even stringent canons against the observance of it.<a name=86:15></a> I might challenge the "Record" (not "stoutly to maintain," which it is easy to do, but) to give some scriptural proof or authority for the change of day it talks of; but all this would misrepresent my feelings on the subject.<a name=86:16></a> I hold it to be one of vast and important bearing; because a part in the rest of God seems to me distinctive of the blessing belonging to God's people, whatever the foreshadowing of it may be.<a name=86:17></a> A promise is left us of entering into God's rest; and it must be God's rest, and not rest without God, if such were even possible.<a name=86:18></a>

		But that old covenant, in which the sabbath was made legally obligatory, was to be done away, and the time of Messiah, the true rest of His creation, was to come in.<a name=87:10></a> We have here, therefore, to consider how the Lord Jesus deals with the sabbath.<a name=87:11></a> We have already seen that He does not introduce it in His spiritual summary of practice in the Sermon on the Mount.<a name=87:12></a> Nor can the smallest instance be found in which He sets up or insists upon its authority.<a name=87:13></a> But when He goes out of Judaism and reveals Himself as Son of man, He declares that He is Lord of it.<a name=87:14></a> Speaking in His divine character, when charged with the breach of it, His language is still more striking -- "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<a name=87:15></a>" Grace might labour in a world of sin; but neither the holiness nor the love of the Father and Son could find their rest in a world of sin and misery.<a name=87:16></a> No one can find in the writings of the New Testament a word that insists upon the moral obligation of the sabbath.<a name=87:17></a> When the question arose between Jew and Gentile Christians as to what was to be maintained as obligatory, the sabbath was not one of the things insisted upon.<a name=87:18></a> Have we then lost the rest of God?<a name=87:19></a> or even every trace of it here below?<a name=87:20></a> God forbid!<a name=87:21></a> And I have no doubt that the last words, "The sabbath was made for man," remain in practice a true blessing now for man; but when we come to spiritual hopes of that rest, it is a different matter.<a name=87:22></a> The rest of God in the first creation is

		I add, that as long as Christianity is to be the nominal religion of the world, or of a country, it must live by institutions, although its tone and character will be really expressed by its preaching.<a name=89:1></a> Now of all these institutions, though there are others, the institution of the christian sabbath has, though greatly abused, by far the widest and most beneficent influence on the masses.<a name=89:2></a> It is the poor man's day, and the family day; two objects to which, in the government of the human race, God attaches peculiar importance.<a name=89:3></a> And here I may apply the expression, "The sabbath was made for man.<a name=89:4></a>" In Popery and in Puseyism, christian institutions, blended with an immense power of Satan over the imagination, have been turned into puerilities and superstitions.<a name=89:5></a> Man has been put between man and God.<a name=89:6></a> The measure of right and wrong having fallen below that of natural conscience, and sin, what I may call, pried into by man, with occasional individual devotedness, the masses have been universally morally degraded, or, if not, turned infidel.<a name=89:7></a> The dissenters (while there are many individuals in their ranks more excellent and devoted than myself) appear to me in the old world to be now in an entirely false position; and the same remark applies to all denominations in the new world, where, as there is no Establishment, there can be no dissent.<a name=89:8></a> They profess to build up and form the true church upon its own proper principles, and at the same time grasp energetically at the masses and the world.<a name=89:9></a> What the state of Presbyterianism is, where it does not come under the category of dissent in the old world, is sufficiently known not to call for any remark from me.<a name=89:10></a> The consequence has been, since the full freedom of dissent, a tendency to adapt Christianity itself to the progress of the age, and hence towards latitudinarianism and rationalism, from which the Establishment itself, though with more fixed formularies, knows perhaps still less how to free itself.<a name=89:11></a> In the midst of all this God surely carries on His own work; and I have no doubt the just maintenance of the christian sabbath is, as I have said, a great blessing as regards God's government of the professing world.<a name=89:12></a> But this is another thing from the truth of eternal life -- another thing from the narrow path in which the Christian has to walk.<a name=89:13></a>

		BRIEF NOTICE OF THE "RECORD'S" COMMENTS ON "J.N.D.S" LETTER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that in the four tracts -- "The Righteousness of God," "A Letter on the Righteousness of God, in answer to the 'Record,'" "The Law," and "Brethren and their Reviewers" -- I have gone sufficiently fully into the question which has been raised as to legal righteousness to make it unnecessary to pursue the subject farther at present.<a name=91:1></a> Controversy may instruct but it seldom feeds the soul.<a name=91:2></a> It is my comfort to know that in my controversial tracts the great truths of grace have been pretty largely brought out, so that there may be edification as well as conviction.<a name=91:3></a> I am more than ever convinced that the question which now occupies us involves the true character of Christianity.<a name=91:4></a> Is our connection with Christ association or union with Him risen, consequent on accomplished redemption, or one under law, and Christ living on the earth the One with whom we are united?<a name=91:5></a> But as the pamphlet comprising the articles in the "Record" has been published and circulated, and professes to give a fair account of the views set forth in my tracts, and that in my own words, I am obliged to say that its statements, in most essential points, are entirely false; I can hardly avoid saying deliberately false.<a name=91:6></a> I could, of course, suppose that the writer had overlooked statements I had made.<a name=91:7></a> But statements the opposite of what the "Record" declares to be my doctrine are found on the same page with quotations the "Record" has made from my letter, so that they could hardly have escaped the writer.<a name=91:8></a>

		First, as to the passage quoted -- Romans 5: 19: we are told, that "His whole life, as the law-fulfiller, constituted the obedience by which many are made righteous.<a name=97:7></a>" Now, how does the passage speak?<a name=97:8></a> It speaks of Adam and Christ as two heads of races subordinated to them, in contrast with law, shewing that we must not confine Christ to those under law, since death and sin had reigned when there was none -- between Adam and Moses -- over those who had not transgressed any covenant like Adam.<a name=97:9></a> (Hosea 6: 7.<a name=97:10></a>) And Christ's work could not be limited within bounds short of sin and sinners.<a name=97:11></a> It is a contrast between sin and law-breaking; the passage shewing that it was not simply by law-breaking, but by a disobedience which applied to those who were not under law, and an obedience which did the same, that evil and good came; and making, not individual law-keeping, but their state in their respective heads, the true ground of ruin or righteousness, and then adds, in direct explicit contrast with this: "(But) law entered that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace did much more abound.<a name=97:12></a>" Romans 5: 19 is the summary of the argument of the obedient and disobedient man in contrast with law; and not only so, but declares that the law came in by the by as a distinct thing.<a name=97:13></a> Verses 12, 13, 14, 20, shew that the apostle diligently argues here against obedience, sin, or righteousness being confined to law-breaking or law-fulfilling.<a name=97:14></a> But this is not all.<a name=97:15></a> In chapter 6, the apostle raises the question, in practice: whether not being under law is a reason for sinning, as is alleged.<a name=97:16></a> "Sin," he assures us, on the contrary, "shall not have dominion over us, <i>because</i> we are not under law, but under grace.<a name=97:17></a>" And then shews that, though not under law, we yield ourselves up to obedience unto righteousness.<a name=97:18></a> He contrasts christian obedience and law.<a name=97:19></a> Taking from under law might seem, as with our modern legal divines, to take away from obedience.<a name=97:20></a> The answer of the apostle is, "In no wise.<a name=97:21></a>" We get from under the power of sin, because we are <i>not</i> under law; and we obey as servants to righteousness and to God, being not under law.<a name=97:22></a> In a word, the passage quoted to shew that obedience is law-fulfilling is an elaborate

		But we are told of absolute law, and referred to Hooker.<a name=99:20></a> Hooker, as is known, pleaded the cause of the Episcopalian Establishment against Travers, resting it on the nature of law, with a view to justify the obligation of what was not contained in scripture.<a name=99:21></a> I have nothing to do with his views; but it is singular enough that what is referred to contains the germ of the two principal infidel doctrines of the present day, and of the Puseyite movement -- quite unknown, surely, to himself; but a false principle bears its fruit in its own season.<a name=99:22></a> One is the subjecting God to the law He has imposed on Himself in a way which destroys His sovereignty; the other exalting conscience under the name of right reason: quoting Plato, Aristotle, etc.<a name=99:23></a>, for proof, so as to give conscience a title, enfeebling that of scripture; and on the other hand, insisting (contrary to the Reformers) that scripture does not prove itself, but we must have proof of it from

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here are the author's words on the first point (vol.<a name=100:5></a> 1: 204 of Keble's edition, book 1, chap 2: 3), "That law, the Author and Observer whereof is one only God to be blessed for ever," etc.<a name=100:6></a> "The law whereby He worketh is eternal, and therefore can have no show or colour of mutability," etc.<a name=100:7></a> "Nor is the freedom of the will of God any whit abated, let, or hindered; because the imposition of this law upon Himself is His own free and voluntary act.<a name=100:8></a> This law, therefore, we may name eternal, being that order which God, before all ages, hath set down with Himself for Himself to do all things by.<a name=100:9></a>" Now this (however far it was from Hooker's mind) excludes all miracles.<a name=100:10></a> It is the modern ground of denial of them.<a name=100:11></a> If Hooker had said, God has established a law for nature and left Himself free, it had been all well.<a name=100:12></a> Then nature would go on orderly, as Hooker speaks of it, and God interfere in power, when He pleased, for good.<a name=100:13></a> And in this he might have well said, "God could not act inconsistently with His own blessed nature.<a name=100:14></a>" But farther on we shall see a little the danger in practice of entering on such a ground.<a name=100:15></a> Still, in a general way, we can say, "God who cannot lie.<a name=100:16></a>"

		Hooker takes up these forms of law, first, a rule imposed by authority, alone held to be such by some, which he extends to any rule by which actions are framed.<a name=100:17></a> I have no objection.<a name=100:18></a> The first only is properly law, and the difference is all-important; but the second is often in a secondary sense so called, as the law of faith, the law of the spirit of life; so in natural things, the law of gravity.<a name=100:19></a> But scripture, speaking of law as such, uses it in the former sense.<a name=100:20></a> The fact of an <i>imposed</i> rule (as contrasted with the voluntary actings of nature, uniform because it is such) is capital.<a name=100:21></a> But to return a moment to Hooker.<a name=100:22></a> He classes under the general idea of law, nature's laws, what angels observe, the law of reason (he never speaks of conscience, which is by no means immaterial), divine law known but by special revelation, human law, suppose conformed to one of the last two.<a name=100:23></a> The first two he calls law eternal.<a name=100:24></a> God may overrule, he alleges, the law imposed on the creature -- nature's law -- according to the law which Himself

		Law is the rule of just conduct in the relationship in which we stand -- its measure.<a name=101:10></a> Now I will suppose that conscience perfectly maintains this rule.<a name=101:11></a> This is, in fact, impossible, because man got the knowledge of right and wrong when he broke from his relationship with God (hence law can only condemn, as the apostle shews); as if a son have gone off in rebellion, he may not steal, etc.<a name=101:12></a>, may judge of right and wrong, but he can do nothing right till he repents and goes back home again.<a name=101:13></a> But I will suppose conscience does maintain its rule -- conscience can only maintain the rule of duty according to the place I am in.<a name=101:14></a> This shuts out -- not the conferring of greater benefits (Adam innocent, for example, might have gone to heaven), but -- dealings of grace and sovereign goodness to evil doers.<a name=101:15></a> These cannot be a law in any sense: God is free in His mercy.<a name=101:16></a> Part of the law of His nature is to be so.<a name=101:17></a> Hence the apostle shews us that grace and law cannot go together.<a name=101:18></a> Well, what Christianity teaches is, that God has acted so.<a name=101:19></a> In contrast with all that law, man's duties, and all right reason could tell man, He has given His Son for sinners.<a name=101:20></a> It may confirm law in the highest way, because it meets its obligation and curse in the death of the blessed Son of God: but there is no law for God's giving Christ to die for us, no right reason to talk of obligation, save as shewing we have been wanting to it.<a name=101:21></a> Even to understand this gift, man must be taught of God.<a name=101:22></a> It would have been audacious sin for man to have looked for it.<a name=101:23></a> God has acted in sovereign grace.<a name=101:24></a> When He has, I by grace apprehend it.<a name=101:25></a> He is free, infinite in goodness, in doing it.<a name=101:26></a> If He is not free in it, I have lost grace.<a name=101:27></a> It is according to His blessed nature, for He is love; but its free actings above all that could be imposed on it.<a name=101:28></a> It is an act, not a law; though an act according to the perfection of His nature, which is always such.<a name=101:29></a> This saves me, not by any law, but by redemption, by power.<a name=101:30></a> Along with this, I partake of this nature as born of God.<a name=101:31></a>

		Now, Christ came to accomplish this work in obedience, but not according to any law imposed on man.<a name=102:1></a> He did love God perfectly in it, which law required, but He came to fulfil the work out of sovereign love to man a sinner.<a name=102:2></a> He became obedient in this special service which was not in itself any "rule or canon by which actions are framed," though He fulfilled the highest formula of law in doing it, but He was not accomplishing any law in what He did, but a special sovereign will of God.<a name=102:3></a> There was no uniform rule or canon by which actions are framed in God's giving His Son, none by which the Son offered Himself.<a name=102:4></a> God prepared Him a body.<a name=102:5></a> No doubt, when a man, He obeyed, and being born under the law, He obeyed the law; but obedience to will, when there is no law, is the highest, truest, and most absolute obedience, personal subjection, absolute and entire, without any law to measure it.<a name=102:6></a> This Christ did.<a name=102:7></a> And this we have to do.<a name=102:8></a> We have, as born of God, a nature which delights to do it, and asks no law or measure, but asks a will -- is glad there is a will.<a name=102:9></a> It is this which, even in ordinary walk, is contrasted (that is, law and obedience) in Romans 6.<a name=102:10></a> It is thus that Christ baffled Satan.<a name=102:11></a> He waited for a will to act, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God shall man live.<a name=102:12></a>" A word comes out -- I act.<a name=102:13></a> None comes -- I wait.<a name=102:14></a> The delight to do God's will, whatever it is, and to do it because it is, and having no motive when it is not revealed, this is true obedience.<a name=102:15></a>

		Note, I may fulfil the law by this; but it is not by being under the law, nor in virtue of it, that I do so, but the contrary; and this is what the apostle insists on.<a name=102:16></a> Nor was it assuredly because Christ was under law that He died for sinners.<a name=102:17></a> He came freely into obedience by His own love, and accomplished the work of obedience to a special sovereign will, <i>though</i> in doing so He proved when man, His perfect love to God, and even before it to His Father.<a name=102:18></a> And He did it in obedience.<a name=102:19></a> Note, hence this kind of obedience does not exclude commandments; it supposes them.<a name=102:20></a> It does exclude taking the requirements of law as the motive and principle of conduct; it alone fulfils it.<a name=102:21></a> But it is not obedience of law and under law.<a name=102:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat, it is exactly in this way (Christ, the blessed One, being our life) we are called to obey.<a name=102:23></a> Obedience is not the estimate of a measured rule, a canon to which we are bound, but the delight in love which refers to a person whose every command and expression of will governs this nature.<a name=102:24></a> Thereupon commands,

	<div class="paragraph">
		All I find in Hooker on this point then is, subjecting God to a self-imposed law, destroying the possibility of miracles, or free sovereign grace, and destroying thus along with it the true principle of christian obedience and acting in grace after Christ's example.<a name=103:6></a> It is evident, if we speak of a law binding on the conscience of any being, it must be a law suited to his nature according to the measure of it; and so God's law expressly is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all <i>thy</i> heart, and with all <i>thy</i> soul, and with all <i>thy</i> strength, and thy neighbour as <i>thyself</i>.<a name=103:7></a>" Now this is evidently the measure, and must be so to the conscience.<a name=103:8></a> Man may be incapable of it through sin; but that is the normal measure.<a name=103:9></a>

		Now the love of the Son to the Father (may we ever speak with adoration and reverence of Him!<a name=103:10></a>) was infinitely above this in its nature.<a name=103:11></a> No doubt, when a man, He fulfilled what the law thus required; but His service to the Father was none the less according to <i>His</i> love to Him.<a name=103:12></a> Hence reducing it to law given to man, and saying it must be in accordance or opposition to it, is only a proof that the blessedness of His service is unknown.<a name=103:13></a> In its true blessedness -- who indeed does know it?<a name=103:14></a> But it is by these views reduced in its nature to His dishonour.<a name=103:15></a> It may be said, We have nothing to do with this kind of obedience.<a name=103:16></a> We have everything to do with it, as far as it is revealed.<a name=103:17></a> That in ourselves we never rise up to it, that surely is true; but it is made known to us in Him, and becomes the motive and spring of all our christian thoughts of God, and so of moral life and obedience.<a name=103:18></a> "The Father loveth the Son.<a name=103:19></a>" We read, "That the world may know that I love the Father.<a name=103:20></a>" "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life and take it again.<a name=103:21></a>" Yet herein He was also obedient; and the blessed Lord tells us, that the world shall know that the Father has loved us as He loved Himself, and that we are to know it, He dwelling in us.<a name=103:22></a> So our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=103:23></a> The Father Himself

		When I compare all this with scripture, such as the beginning of Romans, "There is none that understandeth, none that seeketh after God" (whereas, we are told that nature cannot but seek after this sovereign good with "intentive desire," so as to neglect all else); that "the natural man understandeth not the things of the Spirit, because they are spiritually discerned;" that "the mind of the flesh is enmity against God" (whereas, Hooker declares it is necessary and cannot be avoided, and quite distinct from the will; that sin works the lust in me, where, according to him, will is not, even at all) -- in a word, when I weigh Hooker's doctrine with the word of God, I am not at a loss to judge what are the views of law absolute, and others to which I am invited to look, in contrast with the plain declarations of scripture.<a name=107:7></a> Hooker uses them to vindicate those things in the English Establishment for which there is no warrant in scripture.<a name=107:8></a> But they equally warrant, though he did not intend it, Popery and modern Rationalism; one contending that scripture does not suffice, the other contending that the christian conscience has its light independent of scripture, just as Hooker does, applying it then to the judgment of statements in scripture, and, of course, soon to the rejection of all that reason does not like, Hooker laying full ground for it in insisting that scripture does not prove itself (in which he wholly departs from the first Reformers).<a name=107:9></a> As regards Popery, Hooker distinctly asserts, not that scripture suffices -- this he denies in terms -- but that, as we have reason and scripture, they are sufficient, and tradition therefore is not needed.<a name=107:10></a> It is a pity that the national Establishment should be founded on such principles.<a name=107:11></a> I recognize, not right reason, but conscience; I recognize all use of gifts of ministry, parental care according to God; but the doctrine of Hooker is low and dangerous.<a name=107:12></a>

		And this leads me to another point, on which, as to us, all really hinges.<a name=108:4></a> We are not, we Christians, looked at as alive under law, but as dead.<a name=108:5></a> Hence not under its empire at all, but on a new footing of obedience as risen.<a name=108:6></a> Let it be remembered that no deliverance from law is deliverance from obedience or commandments.<a name=108:7></a> I add even commandments, for it is not sufficient to be right, Christ's expressed authority must be obeyed.<a name=108:8></a> It is said that, if Christ's whole life had not been law-fulfilling, it must have been law-transgressing.<a name=108:9></a> This is simply saying that He was incapable of going beyond the measure to which all as creatures are subject.<a name=108:10></a> If there is no alternative but law-keeping and law-transgressing, there could have been no act of sovereign goodness and love to sinners; for that is neither.<a name=108:11></a> He could not go beyond man's obligations.<a name=108:12></a> Such is the theology and reasoning opposed to us.<a name=108:13></a>

		<a name=109>[Page 109]</a>

		alleging the Reformers followed him.<a name=109:1></a> Now Augustine, in the passages referred to, teaches (as Milner's "Church History" long ago remarked of him) inherent righteousness, not imputed righteousness in any way.<a name=109:2></a> His words are these, in the same passage as is quoted: "But the righteousness of God without law is that which God confers on the believer through grace, without the help of the law.<a name=109:3></a>" What that is the same section shews: "Not that it is done without our will, but how will is by the law shewn to be infirm, that grace may heal our will and the healed will fulfil the law, not constituted under the law nor wanting the law.<a name=109:4></a>" (De Sp.<a name=109:5></a> et Lit.<a name=109:6></a> 9: 15.<a name=109:7></a>) It is inherent righteousness without law.<a name=109:8></a> And so he continues in chapter 10: 16.<a name=109:9></a> And this view of righteousness and grace is a settled one with Augustine, as the other passages quoted shew.<a name=109:10></a> But no one fulfils the law save he whom grace has helped (he is speaking of the righteousness of God): "What is this, the righteousness of God and the righteousness of men?<a name=109:11></a> The righteousness of God is here spoken of, not as that by which God is just, but which God gives to man that man may be just by God; but what was that justice of theirs?<a name=109:12></a> That by which they persevered in their own strength, and, as if they were fulfillers of the law by their own virtue, gave themselves the name of righteous.<a name=109:13></a> But no one fulfils the law save he whom grace has helped; that is the bread descended from heaven.<a name=109:14></a> For the fulness of the law, says the apostle, is charity .<a name=109:15></a>.<a name=109:16></a>.<a name=109:17></a> .<a name=109:18></a> Whence is that charity to man?<a name=109:19></a> Let us hear himself.<a name=109:20></a> "The charity (love) of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given us.<a name=109:21></a> The Lord, therefore, being about to give the Holy Spirit, said that He was the bread descended from heaven, exhorting to believe on Him.<a name=109:22></a>"

		If the Reformers followed Augustine, their belief in imputed righteousness was a very poor one.<a name=109:23></a> Here is Dr.<a name=109:24></a> Milner's account: "The precise and accurate nature of the doctrine itself seems not to have been understood by this holy man.<a name=109:25></a> He perpetually understands St.<a name=109:26></a> Paul's term, to justify, of inherent righteousness, as if it meant sanctification: still he knew what faith in the Redeemer meant.<a name=109:27></a>" The extracts I have given of the continuation of the passages quoted by my opponents prove pretty clearly how right Milner was.<a name=109:28></a> A pretty clear proof that they have no scripture for it is afforded in the following sentence: "We say imputed, because the scripture speaks of imputation; we say imputed righteousness, because that which is imputed is righteousness (Romans 4: 6).<a name=109:29></a>" If this is the authority, faith, not another's righteousness, is imputed,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And see the consequence.<a name=111:9></a> Our being dead to sin is openly denied.<a name=111:10></a> St.<a name=111:11></a> Paul in this chapter (Romans 6), tells us we are to reckon ourselves dead to sin, and alive to God.<a name=111:12></a> "It must certainly be," we are told, "that we are dead to, or freed from, the guilt and consequences of sin.<a name=111:13></a>" This is why I am glad of this otherwise wearisome service of controversy -- the true character of doctrines is brought out.<a name=111:14></a> Here we are told, that being dead to sin is only being dead to the guilt; a most serious statement; for thus the doctrine of a Christian being <i>dead to sin is</i> wholly set aside.<a name=111:15></a> He is only dead as regards guilt; and this is to maintain godliness!<a name=111:16></a> Now no one can read the chapter with the smallest attention, without seeing that it is sin, practical righteousness, serving God, which is in question.<a name=111:17></a> It is the apostle's, the Holy Ghost's answer, to the charge that being righteous by Christ's obedience was giving license to sin.<a name=111:18></a> What answer to that was being dead to guilt?<a name=111:19></a> It was just the contrary.<a name=111:20></a> To be sure, the flesh would say, That is what I am glorying in.<a name=111:21></a> I am dead to all the guilt: so I may continue in sin.<a name=111:22></a> The apostle's answer is, Ah!<a name=111:23></a> but you were baptized to Christ's death -- you have been planted in the likeness of Christ's death -- to be thus clear: how can you live in a thing you are dead to?<a name=111:24></a> Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=111:25></a> We were servants of sin in the flesh -- now to righteousness and God, as alive through Christ.<a name=111:26></a> Not under law -- but this is no reason for sinning; for it is a question, not of law or measured claim, but of yielding ourselves wholly to God as alive from the dead.<a name=111:27></a> Death to sin, and life to God through Christ, are contrasted with the sin in the flesh we are dead to, and the law which found it in us and left us under its dominion.<a name=111:28></a> Sin would not have <i>dominion</i> (it is no question of guilt) because we were not under law, but under

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the divine way of being able to do this is (not by saying sin is in the flesh, therefore I am not dead; as my opponent does; but) reckoning myself dead, so as to get power under grace; every motion of sin, which is by the law, being thus disallowed.<a name=112:2></a> But I beg distinct attention to the point that, to sustain this doctrine of our being under law, my adversaries are obliged wholly to deny the Christian's reckoning himself dead to sin.<a name=112:3></a> "I unhesitatingly conclude then, that when scripture says we are dead to sin, and dead to law, it means no more than that we are dead to the guilt and consequences of sin, and dead to the justification or condemnation of the, law, on account of what Christ has done in our room and stead.<a name=112:4></a>" I only ask my readers to read through Romans 6, 7, which treat these two questions, and see if it is not a total subversion of the whole doctrine of the apostle, and of the power of Christianity, as to godliness.<a name=112:5></a> But if so, the whole system falls with it; because, if so, godliness and obedience come not by law, but by a new nature in the power of Christ's resurrection, in virtue of which we count ourselves dead as regards the old, not in the flesh at all.<a name=112:6></a> Sin and law are met by our death as to the flesh, and a new nature in which we live to God.<a name=112:7></a> Hence the apostle says, "When we <i>were</i> in the flesh;" "Ye are not in the flesh.<a name=112:8></a>" Flesh, sin, and the law, are correlatives; for the old man lives in a fallen nature, and the law applies to man as responsible in that nature in which he is fallen.<a name=112:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture teaches that the true Christian (whose life Christ, the Second Adam, is) has by faith -- has as partaker of that life -- died with Christ, and is to reckon himself dead; and, as in the new man, is not to place himself under law, but to live to God as one that is alive from the dead, Christ's authority being that which governs him; His word the guide as well as the seed of life to him -- His Father's will his constant delight.<a name=112:10></a>

		My opponents tell me we are not dead, nor to reckon ourselves dead to sin; but, ignoring our having put on the new man, and Christ being our life, put us back under law, as if sin was our only desire, and that which would break out if law did not hinder it -- which it never did.<a name=112:11></a> The apostle, on the contrary, assures us that sin shall not have dominion over us, because we are not under law.<a name=112:12></a>

		I have been referred to Dr.<a name=113:1></a> O'Brien's book as a masterpiece on this subject.<a name=113:2></a> There is a great deal that is excellent in that book; especially when the faith of the writer himself breaks through, it rises up into real moral eloquence.<a name=113:3></a> In its insistence on the plain doctrine of justification by faith, I am thankful for it; but on this point we are treating, I find nothing that can be called argument -- indeed, nothing about it (save a mistaken piece of logic) but what the "Record" quoted, which assumes the whole question, and is no argument at all.<a name=113:4></a> "It is evident," says the now Right Revelation Prelate, "then, that in the justification with which we have to do -- in which man is the party and God is the Judge -- we have only to look to the law to which man is answerable, to see what his justification means.<a name=113:5></a>" Now, what argument is there in -- "It is evident?<a name=113:6></a>" He says, "The law to which man is answerable.<a name=113:7></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle declares that, when God is the Judge, there are those who have sinned and perished without law; and others who are judged by the law.<a name=113:8></a> And he equally assures us that the Christian is not under law at all; but that law has power over a man as long as he lives.<a name=113:9></a> But that the Christian is viewed as having died, and risen again in virtue of a new sovereign way of God's dealing in grace.<a name=113:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The teaching of the word tells me, that talking of man's being amenable to law, as if nothing had happened -- that this generic way of talking of man -- is false altogether.<a name=113:11></a> It tells me that man <i>was</i> with God under a covenant; broke it, and was driven out from God's presence; and is wholly lost, sinful, and lawless.<a name=113:12></a> And that God took a special people out of the world to shew us clearly what flesh (sinful human nature) was, when subject to law; and to give us the profitable lesson of its convicting of sin.<a name=113:13></a> It does shew me that, when man was driven out from God's presence, he got a knowledge of right and wrong -- a conscience to carry with him into the world; but that the law was given by Moses.<a name=113:14></a>

		This whole view of man and law is heathenish and false.<a name=113:15></a> If my reader take Hooker's argument, he will find heathens, not scripture, quoted for it, the apostle's judgment of whom is, "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest.<a name=113:16></a>" But I said our preacher added a piece of false logic: it is this.<a name=113:17></a> He does not mean to intimate that, when he speaks of acquitting of violating the divine law and acceptance as though he had fulfilled it, these are distinct acts.<a name=113:18></a> The nature of the divine law recognizes no intermediate state between the guilt of violating it, and the merit of obeying it.<a name=113:19></a> There is, he insists, no separation between the

		acts of pardon and acceptance; but my reader will remark that the theory is, that Christ died for the violation, and lived for the fulfilment besides.<a name=114:1></a> But if that be so, the prohibitions of which Dr.<a name=114:2></a> O'Brien speaks could have no fulfilment.<a name=114:3></a> When a command was violated, there was satisfaction for the violation, and fulfilment of the command.<a name=114:4></a> May our hearts be kept in reverence towards the Blessed One, while we meet such arguments!<a name=114:5></a> But if I had acted when something was forbidden, satisfaction may be made; but there is nothing to be fulfilled, so that there cannot be the merit of <i>doing</i> here; and the difference the writer so justly seeks to avoid, his false system drags him into.<a name=114:6></a> Our bolder adversaries do not stumble on the difficulties which beset the cautious prelate's path.<a name=114:7></a> Do this and live, we are told, is written on heaven's gates; and we want active duties to be added to make up the inadequacy of atonement.<a name=114:8></a>

		But to the substance of the matter: Dr.<a name=114:9></a> O'Brien assumes the whole question, and only discusses its form as to negative and positive precepts.<a name=114:10></a> I deny the whole ground assumed, and affirm that scripture puts the believer on a wholly new footing in Christ, as dead and alive again in Him, where law does not reach.<a name=114:11></a> I may be allowed to quote Hooker here.<a name=114:12></a> It may instruct some as to justifying the ungodly, and awaken some who may receive his testimony, and would not mine, to a righteousness beyond law.<a name=114:13></a> It shews the power of God's word on a godly mind, in spite of system.<a name=114:14></a> "Christ has merited righteousness for as many as are found in Him.<a name=114:15></a> In Him God findeth us, if we be faithful; for by faith we are incorporated with Christ.<a name=114:16></a> Then, although in ourselves we be altogether sinful and unrighteous; yea, even the man which is impious in himself -- full of iniquity -- full of sin; him, being found in Christ through faith, and having his sin remitted through repentance -- him God beholdeth with a gracious eye; putteth away sin by not imputing it; taketh away the punishment due thereto by pardoning it; and accepteth him in Jesus Christ, as perfectly righteous as if he had himself fulfilled all that was commanded him in the law.<a name=114:17></a> Shall I say, more perfectly righteous than if himself had fulfilled the whole law?<a name=114:18></a> I must take heed what I say.<a name=114:19></a> But the apostle saith, 'God made him which knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<a name=114:20></a>' Such are we in the sight of God the Father, as is the very Son of God Himself.<a name=114:21></a>" Now, I am not giving all this as systematically what I hold; but it does shew how the word of God forced on the mind of a godly man the belief that there was

	<div class="paragraph">
		a righteousness of God beyond law.<a name=115:1></a> There are other objections, too poor to dwell on, as that Christ is an example, not a rule.<a name=115:2></a> But that Christ is an example because He rendered perfect obedience to the law, I wholly deny.<a name=115:3></a> He does not become a law, but He is a rule or measure of our conduct, and as far beyond the law as the manifestation of God is beyond the perfect measure of man's ways.<a name=115:4></a> As to Romans 13: 9, Paul does not quote the commandments to put us under them at all, but to shew that love fulfils them; so that, as Augustine says, we do not want the help of the law for it.<a name=115:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would just refer to two passages said to be obscure in what I have written, because one of them is so on an important subject.<a name=115:6></a> It is from the tract "The Righteousness of God," page 9.<a name=115:7></a> The word "it," in "no conferring of righteousness on it," refers to what precedes the passage quoted by Dr.<a name=115:8></a> Carson, and is not in the quotation at all.<a name=115:9></a> It refers to the old man, our sinful nature in flesh.<a name=115:10></a> But that to which the "it" refers, though carried on in my mind as being the main subject treated of, yet is so far from the "it" that the sentence <i>is</i> obscure.<a name=115:11></a> The doctrine is all important, and easily apprehended by those who wish to know what is meant; but I do not justify the obscurity.<a name=115:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the second, I have nothing to change or remark, save that he who does not understand it does not understand the true place of a Christian before God, nor the diligent teaching of Paul on the subject; I know many dear saints of God do not.<a name=115:13></a> And I take this opportunity of saying, that, for my part, my heart would receive a Christian who believed Christ had kept the law for him, as cordially and freely as any other.<a name=115:14></a> I know of no difference on that ground.<a name=115:15></a> Only I am sure that such are not clear on the scriptural doctrine as to the place we have in Christ by faith.<a name=115:16></a> But clearness as to truth, or progress in it, is not the ground of union in Christ, however precious it may be.<a name=115:17></a>

		Now I have no doubt that, in recent activities, Christians outside and inside "Brethren" so-called have (in their zeal -- a zeal I wish in many things I imitated better -- for winning souls, and delivering them from the state of death in which they were) stated many things less soberly than was right.<a name=117:4></a> They have pressed the love of God and the freeness of the gospel in a way which would not bear critical examination.<a name=117:5></a> I have no doubt such defects are to be found in their statements, as I have no doubt they are in Mr.<a name=117:6></a> Trench's; only that his are more detrimental to the glory of God a great deal than theirs.<a name=117:7></a> Still truth is truth; and it is well that errors should be corrected.<a name=117:8></a> But I do not think Mr.<a name=117:9></a> Trench's views that which will do it.<a name=117:10></a> Of all styles of Christianity, I avow, the calculating one of Mr.<a name=117:11></a> Trench I believe to be the least agreeable to God.<a name=117:12></a> As to the charges against "Brethren," the simple way is to leave them where they are; they have outlived many others.<a name=117:13></a><a href="#117:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> "Woe unto you when all men speak well of you.<a name=117:14></a>" Mr.<a name=117:15></a> Trench is little in danger of being so attacked.<a name=117:16></a> I would warn him that, in the present breaking up of much that he trusts in, common sense will be found an awfully poor thing to guide a man.<a name=117:17></a> In these last days God directs us to the scriptures as a safeguard.<a name=117:18></a> Mr.<a name=117:19></a> T.<a name=117:20></a> would secure us by the Establishment and confessions of faith.<a name=117:21></a> Why, they drive a coach and six through them now-a-days.<a name=117:22></a> Here is the highest legal authority of his church, acting for the Archbishop of Canterbury, who tells us that unfeignedly believing all canonical scriptures means simply that all necessary to salvation is to be found in them.<a name=117:23></a> And the clergy of the system he belongs to are the public active promoters of infidelity in the country; and the same high authority has gone out of his way to declare that, if they do not contravene the letter of the thirty-nine Articles,

		The great question then arises as to direct proof: has not God set up another <i>kind</i> of righteousness than that of law?<a name=157:2></a> And if so, the fulfilment of the law cannot accomplish that righteousness, a righteousness which is not the adequate fulfilment of man's obligations (and the law can be no more), but the glorifying of <i>God's</i> nature fully, so that He is glorified in blessing according to all that that nature is.<a name=157:3></a> Not the setting aside of the authority of the law; for both God's authority and real creature-righteousness were involved in it; but magnifying it, yet putting man on another ground as to his acceptance, the fruit of God's thoughts and God's work, made good in setting Christ at His right hand; setting man on the ground of resurrection by the glory of the Father, and, I may add, heavenly glory; the law knowing nothing of resurrection, but applying to man alive in this world.<a name=157:4></a> I affirm that, according to scripture, there is such a new divine justification and righteousness.<a name=157:5></a> It has a double bearing or aspect.<a name=157:6></a> It meets the failure of men, as under the responsibilities of the first Adam, including the transgression of the law.<a name=157:7></a> It places man, accepted of God, in a wholly new position, in which divine life in power is also found: and God is just or righteous in both.<a name=157:8></a> It is according to what <i>He is</i>, not what man ought to be merely, though atonement meets that.<a name=157:9></a> It is from Him, His doing, and put in force by Him in justifying.<a name=157:10></a> He it is that acts in it in grace, so that it is His righteousness.<a name=157:11></a> It is in contrast with man's, founded on Christ's work in manhood, but in which God Himself was glorified; and into which man is brought, so that in it, He, <i>God</i>, is <i>just</i> and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus; otherwise God could only have been just in condemning, for justice had nothing to do with unfallen Adam.<a name=157:12></a> He was, I repeat, what God had made him, and should have stayed so.<a name=157:13></a> God cannot judge or call in question His own work, so as to apply justice to it.<a name=157:14></a>

		Now, in scripture, we find man's righteousness, or legal righteousness, always contrasted with God's, in nature, in fact, and in principle; the latter being distinctively introduced by the gospel, while promised of old; the law having in the interval raised the question of man's righteousness and given the true measure of it so that God has confirmed it by His divine sanction.<a name=157:15></a> Thus "Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, that the man which doeth those things shall live by them.<a name=157:16></a> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not .<a name=157:17></a>.<a name=157:18></a>.<a name=157:19></a> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<a name=157:20></a>"

		Paul is not ashamed of the gospel, because therein the righteousness of God is revealed in the way of faith to faith -- a new thing as to its revealed completeness and ground, though prophesied of old.<a name=158:7></a> So, in Romans 3, God's righteousness apart from law is manifested.<a name=158:8></a> It is "at this time," and "<i>His</i> righteousness," that <i>He</i> might be just and justify him that was of the faith of Jesus.<a name=158:9></a> It may be alleged, Yes, but that is by Christ's keeping the law.<a name=158:10></a> But it is not.<a name=158:11></a> The same passage says, "God hath set him forth to be a propitiation through faith in his <i>blood</i>, to declare his [God's] righteousness for the remission of sins that are past.<a name=158:12></a>" God's righteousness is shewn in remission through blood-shedding; and this, the apostle emphatically declares, that God might be just and the justifier of believers.<a name=158:13></a> And note, in speaking of the sins of believers in past times, there is not a hint of fulfilling law for them, but of His blood.<a name=158:14></a> That made God evidently righteous as regards Old Testament saints.<a name=158:15></a> Surely, if the other had been true, it would have come in here as regards these.<a name=158:16></a> But no; he is justified freely by His grace through redemption; but keeping law is not redemption.<a name=158:17></a>

		ON THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear -- , <br>The questions you put make me feel deeply all that there is sorrowful in the walk of one whom nevertheless I love very sincerely, our friend M.<a name=181:1></a> G.<a name=181:2></a> To enter upon subtle questions as to the person of Jesus tends to wither and trouble the soul, to destroy the spirit of worship and affection, and to substitute thorny enquiries, as if the spirit of man could solve the manner in which the humanity and the divinity of Jesus were united to each other.<a name=181:3></a> In this sense it is said, "No one knoweth the Son but the Father.<a name=181:4></a>" It is needless to say that I have no such pretension.<a name=181:5></a> The humanity of Jesus cannot be compared.<a name=181:6></a> It was true and real humanity, body, soul, flesh, and blood, such as mine, as far as human nature is concerned.<a name=181:7></a> But Jesus appeared in circumstances quite different from those in which Adam was found.<a name=181:8></a> He came expressly to bear our griefs and infirmities.<a name=181:9></a> Adam had none of them to bear; not that his nature was incapable of them in itself, but he was not in the circumstances which brought them in.<a name=181:10></a> God had set him in a position inaccessible to physical evil, until he fell under moral evil.<a name=181:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, God was not in Adam.<a name=181:12></a> God was in Christ in the midst of all sorts of miseries and afflictions, fatigues, and sufferings, across which Christ passed according to the power of God, and with thoughts of which the Spirit of God was always the source, though they were really human in their sympathies.<a name=181:13></a> Adam before his fall had no sorrows: God was not in him, neither was the Holy Ghost the source of his thoughts; after his fall, sin was the source of his thoughts.<a name=181:14></a> It was never so in Jesus.<a name=181:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other side, Jesus is the Son of man, Adam was not.<a name=181:16></a> But at the same time, Jesus was born by divine power, so that that holy thing which was born of Mary was called the Son of God: which is not true of any other.<a name=181:17></a> He is Christ born of man, but as man even born of God; so that the state of humanity in Him is neither what Adam was before his fall nor what he became after his fall.<a name=181:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what was changed in Adam by the fall was not humanity, but the state of humanity.<a name=181:19></a> Adam was as much a man before as after, and after as before.<a name=181:20></a> Sin entered humanity, which became estranged from God; it is without God in the world.<a name=181:21></a> Now Christ is not that.<a name=181:22></a> He was always perfectly with God, save that He suffered on the cross the forsaking of God in His soul.<a name=181:23></a> Also the Word was made flesh.<a name=181:24></a> God was manifest in flesh.<a name=181:25></a> Thus acting

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a mistake to suppose that Adam had immortality in himself.<a name=182:2></a> No creature possesses it.<a name=182:3></a> They are all sustained of God, who "alone has immortality" essentially.<a name=182:4></a> When God was no longer pleased to sustain in this world, man becomes mortal and his strength is exhausted: in fact, according to the ways and will of God, he attains to the age of near one thousand years when God so wills, seventy when He finds it good.<a name=182:5></a> Only God would have this terminate, that one should die sooner or later when sin enters, save changing those who survive to the coming of Jesus, because He has overcome death.<a name=182:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, God was in Christ, which changed all in this respect (not as to the reality of His humanity, with all its affections, its feelings, its natural wants of soul and body; all which were in Jesus, and were consequently affected by all that surrounded Him, only according to the Spirit and without sin).<a name=182:7></a> No one takes His life from Him; He gives it up, but at the moment willed of God.<a name=182:8></a> He is abandoned in fact to the effect of man's iniquity, because He came to accomplish the will of God; He suffers Himself to be crucified and slain.<a name=182:9></a> Only the moment in which He yields up, His spirit is in His hands.<a name=182:10></a> He works no miracle to hinder the effect of the cruel means of death which man employed, in order to guard His humanity from their effect; He leaves it to their effect.<a name=182:11></a> His divinity is not employed to secure Himself from it, to secure Himself from death; but it is employed to add to it all His moral value, all His perfection to His obedience.<a name=182:12></a> He works no miracle not to die, but He works a miracle in dying.<a name=182:13></a> He acts according to His divine rights in dying, but not in guarding Himself from death; for He surrenders His soul to His Father as soon as all is finished.<a name=182:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference then of His humanity is not in that it was not really and fully that of Mary, but in that it was so by an act of divine power, so as to be such without sin; and, moreover, that in place of being separated from God in His soul, like every sinful man, God was in Him who was of God.<a name=182:15></a> He could say "I thirst," "my soul is troubled," "it is melted like wax in the midst of my bowels;" but He could also say "the Son of man who is in heaven," and "before Abraham was, I am.<a name=182:16></a>" The innocence of Adam was not God manifest in flesh; it was not man subjected, as to the circumstances in which His humanity was found, to all the consequences of sin.<a name=182:17></a>

		On the other hand, the humanity of man fallen was under the power of sin, of a will opposed to God, of lusts which are at enmity with Him.<a name=183:1></a> Christ came to do God's will: in Him was no sin.<a name=183:2></a> It was humanity in Christ where God was, and not humanity separate from God in itself.<a name=183:3></a> It was not humanity in the <i>circumstances</i> where God had set man when he was created, the circumstances where sin had set him, and in these circumstances without sin; not such as sin rendered man in their midst, but such as the divine power rendered Him in all His ways in the midst of those circumstances, such as the Holy Ghost translated Himself in humanity.<a name=183:4></a> It was not man where no evil was, like Adam innocent, but man in the midst of evil; it was not man bad in the midst of evil like Adam fallen, but man perfect, perfect according to God, in the midst of evil, God manifest in flesh; real, proper humanity, but His soul always having the thoughts that God produces in man, and in absolute communion with God, save when He suffered on the cross, where He must, as to the suffering of His soul, be forsaken of God; more perfect then, as to the extent of the perfection and the degree of obedience, than anywhere else, because He accomplished the will of God in the face of His wrath, instead of doing it in the joy of His communion; and therefore He asked that this cup should pass, which He never did elsewhere.<a name=183:5></a> He could not find His meat in the wrath of God.<a name=183:6></a>

		Now, dear -- , having said thus much, I recommend you with all my heart to avoid discussing and defining the person of our blessed Saviour.<a name=183:8></a> You will lose the savour of Christ in your thoughts, and you will only find in their room the barrenness of man's spirit in the things of God and in the affections which pertain to them.<a name=183:9></a> It is a labyrinth for man because he labours there at his own charge.<a name=183:10></a> It is as if one dissected the body of his friend, instead of nourishing himself with his affections and character.<a name=183:11></a> It is one of the worst signs of all those I have met with for the church (as they call it) to which M.<a name=183:12></a> G.<a name=183:13></a> belongs, that he has entered thus, and that it presents itself after such a sort before the Church of God and before the world.<a name=183:14></a> I may add, that I am so profoundly convinced of man's incapacity in this respect, that it is outside the teaching of the Spirit to wish to define how the divinity and the humanity are united in Jesus, that I am quite ready to suppose

		LETTER ON FREE-WILL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Elberfeld, October 23, 1861</i>.<a name=185:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Very Dear Brother, <br>I had a little lost sight of an important subject of your last letter but one, solely through the multitude of my occupations.<a name=185:2></a> This fresh breaking out of the doctrine of free-will helps on the doctrine of the natural man's pretension not to be entirely lost, for that is really what it amounts to.<a name=185:3></a> All men who have never been deeply convinced of sin, all persons with whom this conviction is based upon gross and outward sins, believe more or less in free-will.<a name=185:4></a> You know that it is the dogma of the Wesleyans, of all reasoners, of all philosophers.<a name=185:5></a> But this idea completely changes all the idea of Christianity and entirely perverts it.<a name=185:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Christ has come to save that which is lost, free-will has no longer any place.<a name=185:7></a> Not that God hinders man from receiving Christ -- far from it.<a name=185:8></a> But even when God employs all possible motives, everything which is capable of influencing the heart of man, it only serves to demonstrate that man will have none of it, that his heart is so corrupted and his will so decided not to submit to God (whatever may be the truth of the devil's encouraging him in sin), that nothing can induce him to receive the Lord and to abandon sin.<a name=185:9></a> If, by liberty of man, it is meant that no one obliges him to reject the Lord, this liberty exists fully.<a name=185:10></a> But if it is meant that, because of the dominion of sin to which he is a slave, and willingly a slave, he cannot escape from his state and choose good (while acknowledging that it is good, and approving it), then he has no liberty whatever.<a name=185:11></a> He is not subject to the law, neither indeed can be; so that those who are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=185:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here is where we touch more closely upon the bottom of the question.<a name=185:13></a> Is it the old man that is changed, instructed, and sanctified?<a name=185:14></a> or do we receive, in order to be saved, a new nature?<a name=185:15></a> The universal character of the unbelief of these times is this -- not the formally denying Christianity, as heretofore, or the rejection of Christ openly, but the receiving Him as a person, it will be even said divine, inspired (but as a matter of degree), who re-establishes man in his position of a child of God.<a name=185:16></a> Where Wesleyans are taught of God, faith makes them feel that without Christ they are lost, and that it is a question of salvation.<a name=185:17></a> Only their fright with regard to pure grace, their desire to gain men, a mixture of charity and of the spirit of man, in a word, their confidence in

		their own powers, makes them have a confused teaching and not recognize the total fall of man.<a name=186:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For myself, I see in the word, and I recognize in myself, the total ruin of man.<a name=186:2></a> I see that the cross is the end of all the means that God had employed for gaining the heart of man, and therefore proves that the thing was impossible.<a name=186:3></a> God has exhausted all His resources, and man has shewn that he was wicked, without remedy, and the cross of Christ condemns man -- sin in the flesh.<a name=186:4></a> But this condemnation having been manifested in another's having undergone it, it is the absolute salvation of those who believe; for condemnation, the judgment of sin, is behind us; life was the issue of it in the resurrection.<a name=186:5></a> We are dead to sin, and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=186:6></a> Redemption, the very word, loses its force when one entertains these ideas of the old man.<a name=186:7></a> It becomes an amelioration, a practical deliverance from a moral state, not a redeeming by the accomplished work of another person.<a name=186:8></a> Christianity teaches the death of the old man and his just condemnation, then redemption accomplished by Christ, and a new life, eternal life, <i>come down from heaven</i> in His person, and which is communicated to us when Christ enters us by the word.<a name=186:9></a> Arminianism, or rather Pelagianism, pretends that man can choose, and that thus the old man is ameliorated by the thing it has accepted.<a name=186:10></a> The first step is made without grace, and it is the first step which costs truly in this case.<a name=186:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe we ought to hold to the word; but, philosophically and morally speaking, free-will is a false and absurd theory.<a name=186:12></a> Freewill is a state of sin.<a name=186:13></a> Man ought not to have to choose, as being outside good.<a name=186:14></a> Why is he in this state?<a name=186:15></a> He ought not to have a will, any choice to make.<a name=186:16></a> He ought to obey and enjoy in peace.<a name=186:17></a> If he ought to choose good, then he has not got it yet.<a name=186:18></a> He is without what is good in himself, any way, since he has not made his decision.<a name=186:19></a> But, in fact, man is disposed to follow that which is evil.<a name=186:20></a> What cruelty to propose a duty to man who has already turned to evil!<a name=186:21></a> Moreover, philosophically speaking, he must be indifferent; otherwise he has already chosen as to his will -- he must then be absolutely indifferent.<a name=186:22></a> But if he is absolutely indifferent, what is to decide his choice?<a name=186:23></a> A creature must have a motive; but he has none, since he is indifferent; if he is not, he has chosen.<a name=186:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, it is not at all thus: man has a conscience; but he has a will and lusts, and they lead him.<a name=186:25></a> Man was free in Paradise, but then he enjoyed what was good.<a name=186:26></a> He used his free choice,

		and therefore he is a sinner.<a name=187:1></a> To leave him to his free choice, now that he is disposed to do evil, would be a cruelty.<a name=187:2></a> God has presented the choice to him, but it was to convince the conscience of the fact, that in no case did man want either good or God.<a name=187:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been somewhat oppressed with sleep while writing to you, but I think you will understand me.<a name=187:4></a> That people should believe that God loves the world -- this is very well; but that they should not believe that man is in himself wicked, without remedy (and in spite of the remedy), is very bad.<a name=187:5></a> One does not know oneself and one does not know God.<a name=187:6></a>

		The Epistle to the Ephesians goes a step farther.<a name=197:1></a> It does not, as I have said, view Christ as alive in blessed love and godliness, and man in sin; but man dead in sin, and Christ is first seen as dead, which was for and to sin.<a name=197:2></a> That is, the apostle sees man down in the ditch and grave of death through sin, and Christ has come down into it in grace, where man was by sin.<a name=197:3></a> But so He has put away the sin as guilt, and come down to save and redeem out of that condition: God raises up both by the same power.<a name=197:4></a> "What is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe .<a name=197:5></a>.<a name=197:6></a>.<a name=197:7></a> which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.<a name=197:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a>, 20.<a name=197:9></a>) Of "His great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.<a name=197:10></a>" (Chapter 2: 4, 5.<a name=197:11></a>) Thus we are God's "workmanship, created in Christ Jesus.<a name=197:12></a>" (verse 10).<a name=197:13></a>

		Thus as chapter 3 of John's Gospel taught us the nature of the life which we receive (that as born of the Spirit it <i>is</i> spirit -- divine, morally speaking, in its nature), so do the epistles shew to us the position in which the possession of this new life places us, inasmuch as it is the life of Christ risen, after being delivered for our offences and having died to sin once.<a name=197:14></a> And what is the consequent effect as to our relationship to sin and to God?<a name=197:15></a> The Epistle to the Romans, as indeed that to the Galatians, teaches us that we have died with Christ, and that we are to reckon ourselves dead to sin, that our old man has been crucified with Him; but that we are alive to God; that it is not we that live, but Christ that lives in us.<a name=197:16></a> The Epistle to the Colossians teaches us that we have died with Christ, and that we are risen with Him; and further that, when dead in sins and the uncircumcision of our flesh, God has quickened us together with Him, having forgiven us all trespasses -- brought up from the dead with Christ into newness of life as to ourselves; but, according to the blessed efficacy of His death, entirely forgiven all the sins and state of sin in which we were till thus raised, consequent on the efficacy of His death.<a name=197:17></a> This last point the Epistle to the Ephesians takes up fully and exclusively, and shews us quickened with Christ and raised out of the death of sin by the same power which raised Christ Himself.<a name=197:18></a> It is not merely the divine nature become our life, but death to sin, life to God; raised up, forgiven, and accepted, as in the state in which He is as risen yea, sitting in heavenly places in Him.<a name=197:19></a> The nature is divine.<a name=197:20></a> That is supremely excellent; but, by death and resurrection having come in and our being united to Christ,

		our whole relative condition is changed; we are not, for God and for faith, accounted as alive in the old man; we are not in it at all, we have put it off.<a name=198:1></a> It is (for the reckoning of faith, and that according to the possession of and being alive in a new life) dead and gone.<a name=198:2></a> We are in Christ, and Christ is our life: alive in Him and alive in what He is alive to -- to God.<a name=198:3></a> Our standing is not consequently in the first Adam at all.<a name=198:4></a> We have died as in the first Adam to all that he is; we are alive in the last Adam, the Lord Jesus, according to all the acceptance in which He now lives before God.<a name=198:5></a>

		Thus chapter 3 of John's Gospel teaches us the intrinsic excellency of the life we receive of God, and shews it in direct connection with what is divine, Christ speaking what He knew and shewing that we must have a nature from God, and fit for God Himself.<a name=198:6></a> Christ speaking thus, that which He knew is of the deepest interest -- the direct communication of what is divine.<a name=198:7></a> This life is there shewn in its nature and origin as contrasted with flesh.<a name=198:8></a> Its proper character and excellency is more seen in John.<a name=198:9></a> The Epistle to the Ephesians however confirms it in result: "That we should be holy and blameless before him in love.<a name=198:10></a>" (Chapter 1: 4.<a name=198:11></a>) But in its condition and state, the epistles are more full as to this life.<a name=198:12></a> There -- inasmuch as Christ died -- living in the life of Christ we are [looked at as] dead to sin, the life being a new thing wholly distinct from the old man, and we alive in Christ.<a name=198:13></a> We are not in the flesh; we have died and are risen again.<a name=198:14></a> Being regenerated is being dead and risen again; for we receive Christ as life.<a name=198:15></a> It is having left Adam, his nature and fruits, condemnation, death, and judgment behind; and being, as delivered from all these things, in necessary and righteous acceptance, according to Christ's acceptance before God.<a name=198:16></a> The natures are distinct.<a name=198:17></a> I am not in the flesh; I have died; I am risen again; I am accepted in Christ risen; I am partaker of the divine nature and to enjoy its fulness in God.<a name=198:18></a>

		I am not sure that I have sufficiently distinguished in the following article between the atonement and the sprinkling on the altar of incense.<a name=199:1></a> The blood of the bullock was sprinkled on the mercy seat for Aaron and his sons -- the heavenly saints; the blood of the goat also.<a name=199:2></a> This made an atonement for himself and for the holy place, and for the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=199:3></a> He was alone within in doing it; the congregation of Israel being in view also, for God must have been glorified in order to bless them.<a name=199:4></a> Then he went out and sprinkled the altar of incense with the blood both of the bullock and of the goat.<a name=199:5></a> After all this was complete, he confessed the sins of Israel on the scape-goat, and it was sent away.<a name=199:6></a>

		If we examine the order of the ceremonies of the great day of atonement, we shall find a more definite character in them than had yet drawn my attention.<a name=199:10></a> The blood was sprinkled on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat, and on the altar of incense, but on nothing else, according to the directions of Leviticus 16; we may specially remark, not on the altar of burnt offering.<a name=199:11></a> But atonement is made for the holy place; I presume it is meant, by the sprinkling that did take place, but there was none on the candlestick or the shew bread.<a name=199:12></a> These aspersions of blood at once lead to the thought, that what was in view was approach to God in the sanctuary.<a name=199:13></a> There was clearly the great general fact, that the blood was sprinkled on the mercy seat, so that God's nature and character were glorified in Christ's shedding His blood; so that, His blood being thus presented to God, the gospel founded on that could be preached to every creature.<a name=199:14></a> It was the Lord's lot.<a name=199:15></a> But this I have spoken of elsewhere, as of the other aspect of

		The blood was sprinkled on the place connected with the drawing near of the priests in the sanctuary, and that as representing the whole people approaching God, coming into God's presence in the highest way, or a daily approaching in the same character.<a name=200:3></a> For us there is no veil; but the altar of incense, though without the veil, specially referred to what was within.<a name=200:4></a> God in the holy places was seen in His divine righteousness.<a name=200:5></a> It is such as He is that He must be approached.<a name=200:6></a> It is not merely how He deals with responsible man as such, but His own nature.<a name=200:7></a> If we approach Him, we must approach Him as He is in Himself.<a name=200:8></a> This is evidently the character of approaching Him in the sanctuary.<a name=200:9></a> This connects itself, I have no doubt, with the gold.<a name=200:10></a> All was of gold in the sanctuary.<a name=200:11></a> In the court of the tabernacle the vessels were of brass, specially the laver and the brazen altar.<a name=200:12></a> This refers, as the place also shews, to God's dealing with sin in this world.<a name=200:13></a> Not that the court represented this world; but it was not the sanctuary.<a name=200:14></a> It referred to God's dealings with sinners in this world.<a name=200:15></a> Men came there as unclean, whether for sacrifice for their suns when in them, or for cleansing; that is, to Christ as a sacrifice, or to have the washing of water by the word, which, without the sacrifice, they could not have had.<a name=200:16></a> Hence it was priests who washed; but it was washing.<a name=200:17></a>

		But there is another thing needed.<a name=201:9></a> The sacrifice of Christ is available for transgressions.<a name=201:10></a> There is not only its intrinsic value as the Lord's lot, but Christ is the bearer of the sins of His people as the scapegoat.<a name=201:11></a> God, as a governor that has to do with sins, has to do with us as responsible men, the Jews as a responsible nation, both in flesh.<a name=201:12></a> Christ has borne them in His own body on the tree, and they are gone.<a name=201:13></a> It is not and cannot be of course another sacrifice.<a name=201:14></a> The sacrifice must be suited to God, but it is another aspect of it than the one we have previously spoken of.<a name=201:15></a> It is the removing of sins that men may be received judicially in righteousness, not enter into God's presence according to the intrinsic excellence of His nature, and Christ's acceptableness in it, and enjoy that nature.<a name=201:16></a> (In the new nature we enter in.<a name=201:17></a> The transgressions belong to the old.<a name=201:18></a>) This is our proper and only <i>present</i> place, because we are risen, and in Christ, in the place of priests.<a name=201:19></a> The bullock fully represents the character of Christ's sacrifice in this aspect for us.<a name=201:20></a> Then our sins, when we were alive in the flesh, have been put away, and we are reckoned dead, and he that has died is justified from sin.<a name=201:21></a> The whole nature of the flesh and its deeds are viewed as a past existence, the moment Christ rose,

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the application is, in a measure, different when Israel comes in question: because they do not enter into the holiest through the rent veil, the new and living way.<a name=202:9></a> They know the value of Christ's sacrifice when He comes out, and they look on Him whom they have pierced.<a name=202:10></a> They are under the weight of multiplied transgressions as a nation, and stand on that ground, and in flesh -- have not to do with Christ within the veil, but when He has come out.<a name=202:11></a> I need not say, it is no new sacrifice.<a name=202:12></a> Isaiah 53 presents to us their recognition of the One we already own.<a name=202:13></a> They are not in heavenly places in Him; but He appears to and is with them, to bless them in the earth.<a name=202:14></a> They are accepted according to the righteousness of God as a moral governor.<a name=202:15></a> I do not say individuals, and all of them, as spared, are not viewed of God in His sight according to Christ's blood in heavenly places -- I cannot doubt indeed they are; but it is not their dispensed place to stand there in their own souls before God.<a name=202:16></a> That moral government indeed continues as that under which they are as men in flesh on the earth.<a name=202:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this point I feel important -- the character of the blood-sprinkling, as confined to the holy place and tabernacle itself.<a name=203:3></a> Israel's ordinary sacrifices were on the altar of burnt offering; the blood was sprinkled there; they came as from without there.<a name=203:4></a> It was all right; every sinner must do so.<a name=203:5></a> It is as blessed as it is needed that we can.<a name=203:6></a> The sins must be put away if we are to draw near to God.<a name=203:7></a> But it does not take into the sanctuary.<a name=203:8></a> And here multitudes of Christians rest, if indeed they know this: they rest in the putting away, or hoped for putting away of their sins.<a name=203:9></a> It must be the first approach, but they stay on Jewish ground; and indeed in every way; for they look for a new sprinkling with blood (a new sacrifice they dare not, and nothing else would do, for, as the apostle says, Christ must often have suffered from the foundation of the world) every time they fail.<a name=203:10></a> It is not the value of the sacrifice in itself which is different.<a name=203:11></a> There is, we know, but one -- never to be repeated, which has its own intrinsic, necessary value; but the sacrifice and sprinkling of blood on the brazen altar has a different character from sprinkling it on the mercy seat and on the altar of incense.<a name=203:12></a> This, the brazen altar, was judicial righteousness, as dealing with man as responsible to God, and in the exercise of moral government.<a name=203:13></a> Here the Israelites came to God.<a name=203:14></a> Christ met this claim on the cross, bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, dying for the nation of Israel also.<a name=203:15></a> This bearing of sins was shewn in the scapegoat, but in a way which not only met our case in principle, but had, in its form, special reference to Israel in the last days after the Church's time was over.<a name=203:16></a> But the sprinkling of blood on the day of atonement went further.<a name=203:17></a> It entered into that within the veil.<a name=203:18></a> It carries us up to God, where Christ is gone.<a name=203:19></a> It may be remarked that the offerings of the day of atonement, which gave it its special character, did not include burnt-offerings.<a name=203:20></a> The bullock and the goat were both sin-offerings.<a name=203:21></a> The burnt-offerings for himself and for the people were not offered till the last special service of the day -- the letting loose the live goat into the wilderness -- was concluded.<a name=203:22></a> All was

		I turn to the second subject of which I spoke, introducing it by begging my reader to refer to the well-known chapter (3) of John's Gospel, as shewing the way the Lord connects His life and death with the heavenly place, which He contemplates, but does not then speak of.<a name=204:12></a> A man must be born again, He assures Nicodemus, even to have a share in the earthly part of the kingdom of God, as taught by Ezekiel; but it was sovereign grace, and so went out, as the wind, whither it listed.<a name=204:13></a> But Christ spoke from His own knowledge, who came from heaven, yea, was in heaven, and it was a nature intrinsically capable -- immense blessing!<a name=204:14></a> -- of enjoying God, and the rejected Messiah was the Son of man lifted up, that whosoever believed in Him should have eternal life; not blessing, as life on earth.<a name=204:15></a> He died to all that was here, yea, even to His own Messiahship, as born of the seed of David according to the flesh, and opened the door by His death to those heavenly things of which He was able to speak.<a name=204:16></a> The life of the Spirit and the death of Christ, in their proper value, when known as death to this world, as was seen in Christ and glorifying God in His nature, are the entrance, as possessing life in Him risen, into the heavenly sanctuary.<a name=204:17></a> Compare Colossians 3 (where life aspiring after those heavenly things is the subject) and Ephesians (where the power of the Holy Ghost, uniting us to Christ, gives us the sitting of the saints in heavenly places in Him).<a name=204:18></a> In John 3 it is only opened out to us in vista.<a name=204:19></a> Thus, in the resurrection of Christ, as risen with Him, we pass up into the heavenly places, while Christ has died to the whole world, and sin, to everything which is in the

		There was not a movement of His life which was not the perfection of the divine nature in man, in the midst of the temptations through which we pass, and having completed and finished that obedience, He died to the whole sphere and scene of existence -- really died to it, and in resurrection entered on another, which did not belong to that order or state of things, but which had its starting point, its womb of existence, in death to it.<a name=206:3></a> Always morally separate from sinners, His life proved that that divine display could not win man to association with it, or to come to Him to have life, and He died so as to make a final and judicial separation of divine life from the whole first Adam condition, because there was nothing but sin there in will, and transfers, so to speak, the divine life which was in Him to a new and heavenly sphere, where flesh or sin could not come -- the resurrection state.<a name=206:4></a>

		Next we may enquire, What is a priest?<a name=210:12></a> and more exactly, What are the principles on which earthly priesthood, where it is established amongst men, is founded?<a name=210:13></a> A high priest from among men is thus described in the Epistle to the Hebrews: "Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.<a name=210:14></a>" Other priests had the same office when priesthood was established upon earth.<a name=210:15></a> Certain functions belonged to the high priest only, but gifts and sacrifices for sins were offered by all the priests.<a name=210:16></a> Hence, when priests are officially established now, there is always either the formal institution of a sacrifice, as that of the mass, which is quite consistent; or the hankering after one, and the effort on the part of those called priests to turn the Lord's Supper into one, from the sense of inconsistency and of what they ought to be about, if they are really priests.<a name=210:17></a>

		The establishment of a class of priests to offer gifts or sacrifice or prayers, is the public declaration that other worshippers cannot directly approach God with their gifts, and sacrifices, and prayers.<a name=211:2></a> They must stay at a distance, and the more favoured class approach for them.<a name=211:3></a> The character which God assumed in such an order of things was distance from men, shutting Himself up in a hidden sanctuary, where <i>none</i> could approach freely.<a name=211:4></a> There was in the Jewish system one veil, inside which the priests went to offer incense; then another, inside which even the priests could not go, and where God's glory was enthroned between the cherubim.<a name=211:5></a> Into this the high priest alone went, only once a year, with the blood of propitiation to put upon the mercy seat, and even then enveloping himself in a cloud of incense lest he should die.<a name=211:6></a> Thus God was hidden within the veil.<a name=211:7></a> "The Holy Ghost," the Epistle to the Hebrews tells us, "this signifying, that the way into the holiest was not yet manifested, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing.<a name=211:8></a>" Even to the altar, which was outside the two veils, the worshipper could not approach to offer his gifts or sacrifices.<a name=211:9></a> The priest received the gifts, or the victim's blood, at his hand, and he offered them.<a name=211:10></a>

		The Epistle to the Hebrews, from which I quote these statements, gives two striking reasons why there could be no repetition of the sacrifice, nor any more sacrifice for sins.<a name=212:13></a> First, without <i>shedding</i> of blood there is no remission; therefore, Christ must have <i>suffered</i> often if there were any besides that accomplished on the cross.<a name=212:14></a> Further, it is added, the Jewish priests <i>stood</i> offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which could never take away sins, but this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever <i>sat down</i>; for by one offering He hath perfected for ever them who are sanctified.<a name=212:15></a> Such is the plain and blessed language of scripture.<a name=212:16></a> God would shew His goodness and grace towards us, but He could not bear sin, nor receive what was defiled and guilty into His presence, in His holy habitation, and hence gave His Son to put it away, that we might draw nigh with full assurance of faith.<a name=212:17></a> But this work is accomplished once for all.<a name=212:18></a> We have therefore (it is the conclusion drawn in Hebrews 10) "boldness to enter into the holiest by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.<a name=212:19></a>" There no priest could enter (save the high priest, once a year, as we have said) when there were priests.<a name=212:20></a> And now every Christian can enter with boldness under the great High Priest, who is over the house of

		The setting a certain quantity of repentance first (as some men preach), as a preliminary process to believing, I hold to be utterly mischievous and unscriptural.<a name=215:1></a> According to such views, repentance must take place without the word of God; for if it be by the word of God, there must be faith in that word, or else repentance is founded on unbelief, which is absurd.<a name=215:2></a> That it should be wrought by the preaching of a full gospel -- glad tidings of a free and finished salvation -- is the desire of my heart.<a name=215:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In some tracts on this subject of repentance, there has been an unhappy mingling up of the means and the effects.<a name=215:4></a> Be it that the true means of working repentance <i>now is</i> a full free gospel; be it too that there is a change of mind as to God in repentance.<a name=215:5></a> I believe both; yet neither of these is repentance itself.<a name=215:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to scripture, I cannot admit that <i>believing</i> the gospel is repentance, nor that a change of mind simply is repentance.<a name=215:7></a> I admit that the mind must be changed to have it, but it is not simply a change of mind.<a name=215:8></a> When the Lord said, "Repent and believe the gospel," the two things do not mean one and the same thing; nor, here, was the gospel that which we now have consequent upon the death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord.<a name=215:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, again, I may notice Acts 3.<a name=215:24></a> Here there is not a word of the gospel.<a name=215:25></a> It is an earnest pressing upon them of their sin in rejecting Christ, and promising the blotting out of their sins and the return of Christ on their repentance.<a name=215:26></a> In this case we have, however, no record of the effects.<a name=215:27></a> For the chief priests and captains of the temple came upon them and stopped the discourse.<a name=215:28></a>

		Thirdly, Acts 10.<a name=216:1></a> Here there is no call for repentance at all.<a name=216:2></a> Cornelius was already a godly man; his prayers and his alms had gone up for a memorial before God.<a name=216:3></a> It was a revelation that in every nation those who feared God and wrought righteousness were accepted of Him.<a name=216:4></a> It was <i>salvation</i> brought to a godly man, though he was a Gentile.<a name=216:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourthly, Acts 13 is more to the purpose.<a name=216:6></a> It is an announcement of the fulfilment of promise in Christ, His resurrection, and forgiveness of sins and justification to those that believe.<a name=216:7></a> But the question of repentance is not raised, though I cannot doubt <i>it</i> was wrought in them that believed.<a name=216:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifthly.<a name=216:9></a> In Acts 17 repentance is spoken of, but in view of the judgment of this world, and nothing is said of grace.<a name=216:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now let us see how repentance itself is spoken of in scripture.<a name=216:11></a> And I beg you to note that I do not in the least plead for the call to repentance being founded on what it is founded on in the passages which I shall cite.<a name=216:12></a> It ought to be founded <i>now</i> on a full free gospel.<a name=216:13></a> It is wrong to set it as a preliminary in man, though it may precede man's enjoyment of peace and solid assurance, and, I believe, must.<a name=216:14></a> I quote the texts to shew the ground in scripture for what I said at first about repentance.<a name=216:15></a> In scripture it does not mean believing; though man must believe in order to repent.<a name=216:16></a> Neither does it mean change of mind as to God, though a man's mind must be changed as to God in order to true repentance.<a name=216:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I must add that this change of mind does not in itself give peace or assurance.<a name=216:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonas.<a name=216:19></a> Was that belief in the glorious free salvation of the gospel?<a name=216:20></a> No; but scripture calls it <i>repentance</i>.<a name=216:21></a> I do not say Jonas's sermon to produce it should be ours.<a name=216:22></a> But scripture says these men <i>repented</i>; and thus repentance does not mean belief in the gospel.<a name=216:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, John the Baptist's ministry was a solemn call to repentance; but it was not the belief of that gospel which we now so rightly preach.<a name=216:24></a> The axe, he told them, was laid to the root of the trees.<a name=216:25></a> They were to repent because the kingdom of heaven was at hand.<a name=216:26></a> The effect was, the people feared God, had their hearts broken about their sins, and confessed them; they repented like the Ninevites at the preaching of Jonas.<a name=216:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord said, "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish," it was not believing a free gospel, but judging themselves and their sins with a heart turned to God.<a name=216:28></a> So when the Lord

	<div class="paragraph">
		upbraided the cities where most of His mighty works were done because they repented not.<a name=217:1></a> When it is said, If thy brother <i>repent</i>, forgive him, and that seven times a day, it clearly is not believing the gospel, but self-judgment and recognition of his fault in sorrow of heart which is meant.<a name=217:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In passages such as Acts 8: 22, we have "repent of this thy wickedness;" a clear proof that repentance does not mean believing, nor a change of mind as to God, for he was to repent <i>of something</i> done.<a name=217:3></a> So in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:21">Revelation  2:21</a>, "repent of her fornication.<a name=217:4></a>" So in 2 Corinthians 12: 21, as to the Corinthians sins.<a name=217:5></a> So, when it is said God by sorrow works repentance never to be regretted, they were already believers; but here the apostle's reproofs had wrought in them repentance, as regards their allowance of disgraceful evil; and what wrought it was godly sorrow, not the joy of the gospel.<a name=217:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, when it is said, repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, we have distinct things: one, a state of mind as <i>regards God</i>; the other, faith and confidence in Christ.<a name=217:7></a> And repentance is justly thus applied to God, not ever, I believe, to Christ as the object, as faith is; because it is in the heart and conscience toward God in this our nature and character as such, not faith in the means and power of salvation.<a name=217:8></a> So I read in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:25">2 Timothy  2:25</a>, "If God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth," evidently a breaking down of soul; and will was to bow to God's word.<a name=217:9></a> Now these passages shew to me clearly that though a full and free gospel may be the means of leading to repentance, yet repentance is a state of heart produced by it, and not the belief of it in itself.<a name=217:10></a> I repent because I believe; I repent of my sins.<a name=217:11></a>

		Let me now take the rich exhibition of grace in Luke 15.<a name=217:12></a> In the first two parables it is sovereign grace, and nothing wrought in the saved one; but the third brings before us the work wrought.<a name=217:13></a> The young man comes to himself; and there is the change of mind as to his father, which is always the case when grace works: the hired servants had bread enough there.<a name=217:14></a> But the first effect was not joy.<a name=217:15></a> "I perish with hunger.<a name=217:16></a>" "I will arise and go.<a name=217:17></a>" Nor in going was there yet the knowledge of forgiveness.<a name=217:18></a> He proposes to say, Make me as one of thy hired servants.<a name=217:19></a> Nor had he yet met his father; he met him in his rags.<a name=217:20></a> Then he does not say, Make me as one of thy hired servants.<a name=217:21></a> He does then know what his father is -- does then get the best robe and entrance into the house.<a name=217:22></a> But the effect of this, that there was goodness with God,

		was to find that he was perishing far from him, was to make him arise and go; to change his mind and to turn his face to his father instead of his back, not merely to change his mind as to God, but by that to produce a judgment of <i>himself</i>, and all his ways and state.<a name=218:1></a> In a word, the goodness of God led him to repentance.<a name=218:2></a> And this repentance was to be preached <i>as well</i> as remission of sins.<a name=218:3></a> Faith must be objective, is only objective, and the way of peace and confidence; the judgment of my own state will never be so, nor ought to be.<a name=218:4></a> But the faith in the objects presented -- God's free and sovereign love, and the Saviour and His work -- produces a subjective state which scripture calls repentance.<a name=218:5></a> This is not a preliminary to faith, but its fruit.<a name=218:6></a> But there <i>is</i> the subjective fruit.<a name=218:7></a> There may have been a faith in Christ's person and words which has wrought a work in the soul before a free gospel may have been even heard; it may have wrought sorrow and self: judgment, made the soul weary and heavy laden.<a name=218:8></a> Then a free gospel will produce outward joy.<a name=218:9></a> But when a full and free gospel is preached, and is the first thing heard by a careless soul, it is not a good sign that "they <i>anon with joy receive it</i>.<a name=218:10></a>" So the parable, and so ample experience, shews a deep <i>subjective</i> work is a happy and blessed thing produced by the gospel -- not man's work on himself to prepare for it -- still produced.<a name=218:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, having plentifully quoted scripture, I may appeal to experience, whether he who recalls what has passed in his own mind does not know that he was brought to a subjective state of hatred of sin, self-judgment, confession of sins, with humiliation and self-loathing.<a name=218:12></a> In a word, whether repentance was not produced in his soul, if it were through the terrors of the law, with fear and dread perhaps, yet, if real, always with some drawing to God as good, some love of holiness, some sense of responsibility in grace whatever the terror, for mere terror of consequences is not repentance at all.<a name=218:13></a> If it be produced by a full display of God's love and grace, it will be a softer, deeper, fuller work; the humiliation and hatred of sin so much the deeper.<a name=218:14></a> If, as I have said, a previous divine exercise of soul has been already there, a full and free gospel will give liberty and peace.<a name=218:15></a> But I appeal to every soul that has believed the gospel, if they are not conscious of a subjective work -- the fruit of faith; and I ask them, Which, according to scripture, is repentance?<a name=218:16></a> That, or the belief of the gospel, or word of God in any shape, which produced it?<a name=218:17></a> I do not ask about the form which the repentance took -- that depends on the nature of the testimony that wrought it; but whether there was not such

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I add here a word more.<a name=219:6></a> The forgiveness of sins is something different from the judgment of sin.<a name=219:7></a> And I do not believe there is settled peace, in respect of divine righteousness, till the latter work is wrought.<a name=219:8></a> A person may be joyous because of the forgiveness of sins, and rightly so, with very little knowledge of self and sin, and yet this has to be learned.<a name=219:9></a> If it has been learnt through the law, before forgiveness of sins is known, all the rest is easy; but with a free and clear gospel, specially such as is preached in these days, forgiveness of sins is often known where self is not, and this must be learnt.<a name=219:10></a> The Epistle to the Romans treats of sins to the end of chapter 5: 11; it then takes up the question of sin, unfolded in connection with the law in chapter 7, the result being, not that Christ was set forth for a propitiation through His blood, but that we are not in the flesh but in Christ.<a name=219:11></a> You will find more than one soul rejoicing in forgiveness that could not think of the judgment-seat with peace.<a name=219:12></a> They do not know Christ as righteousness.<a name=219:13></a> The blood on the door-post was not one and the same thing as being out of Egypt by crossing the Red Sea.<a name=219:14></a> It will be said, But they were secure by the blood.<a name=219:15></a> Surely: God was for them; but for all that they did not know it as deliverance from the state they were in, and when assailed by Pharaoh at the Red Sea they were afraid.<a name=219:16></a> Once past that they were free.<a name=219:17></a> Do I for a moment mean that a full, free, finished salvation should not be preached to sinners?<a name=219:18></a> God forbid.<a name=219:19></a> Do I wish that a certain quantum of repentance should be insisted on as a preliminary?<a name=219:20></a> I reject such a thought altogether.<a name=219:21></a> I believe the life of Christ was just to win back confidence to God which Satan had destroyed; that this want of confidence preceded, and was the door of, the entrance of lust into Eve's heart.<a name=219:22></a> But all this does not hinder my believing that the faith of that gospel produces in the heart a deep subjective work, in which it is humbled, broken, and subdued; in which it repents towards God; in which God's claim is owned; in which self, past self, is judged.<a name=219:23></a> You will tell me, a man has life when he does this.<a name=219:24></a> Be it so.<a name=219:25></a> But it is not the less true that the work is wrought and must be wrought.<a name=219:26></a> It

		A gospel which makes light of this is a defective gospel.<a name=220:2></a> It opens the door to legalism and false views as to repentance.<a name=220:3></a> Men put repentance as a human preliminary.<a name=220:4></a> I abhor this, and rightly; but if anyone speaks of repentance in a way not borne out by scripture, hundreds of souls, in finding him wrong, will suppose it as a question between his view and the Arminian doctrine, and take the latter to be right.<a name=220:5></a> It is because I reject the view such contend for, that I dread the use of the statements not borne out by scripture which I have referred to, and because I think that so speaking of repentance, as if it was itself only believing the gospel of the grace of God, is calculated to give superficiality and self-confidence to newly-converted souls, even if the conversion be real.<a name=220:6></a> I believe many souls have been set free from legal apprehensions of repentance and untrue bondage by such erroneous statements; but we are sanctified by <i>the truth</i>, and an error imbibed with it always bears its subsequent fruit.<a name=220:7></a>

		The Greek word signifies an afterthought, a change of mind on reflection; but the question is, a change of mind as to what?<a name=220:8></a> Not, I distinctly say, as to God, though true knowledge of God gives us, on reflection, a just judgment of self, involving, I believe, a sense of God's claims upon us, and our responsibility, which is a different thing from knowing Him; and thus a true judgment of <i>all our</i> past ways.<a name=220:9></a> Godly sorrow is not this, but it works it.<a name=220:10></a> In repentance the bent of life is changed by the apprehension of God.<a name=220:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to present to you my thoughts on repentance, as I believe scripture presents it to us.<a name=221:1></a> I have already once, I think, sent you a small paper on it, but I think the character of the gospel now commonly preached, calls for a distinct scriptural statement of what it is.<a name=221:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not conversion, as even the Lausanne translators of the New Testament have rendered it.<a name=221:3></a> That is in no way the meaning of the word.<a name=221:4></a> Conversion is the turning of the heart and will to God through grace.<a name=221:5></a> It is not faith; that, in its true force, is the divinely given perception of what is seen through the revelation of it to the soul by testimony in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=221:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is literally an after or changed thought, a judgment formed by the mind on reflection, after it has had another or previous one; habitually, in its use in scripture, the judgment I form in God's sight of my own previous conduct and sentiments, consequent on the reception of God's testimony, in contrast with my previous natural course of feeling.<a name=221:7></a> Of course this may be more or less deep.<a name=221:8></a> It is not the sorrow itself: that works repentance if it is godly sorrow.<a name=221:9></a> Not the regret or remorse: that is <i>metameleia</i> not <i>metanoia</i>;" words used sometimes one for another, but not in scripture.<a name=221:10></a> Judas had remorse and hanged himself, not repentance.<a name=221:11></a> Godly sorrow works repentance never to be regretted.<a name=221:12></a> Repentance is the judgment we form, under the effect of God's testimony, of all in ourselves to which that testimony applies.<a name=221:13></a> Hence it is always founded on faith: I do not say the faith of the gospel.<a name=221:14></a> That may be its source; but we may repent through the testimony of God to the soul, and afterwards receive those glad tidings.<a name=221:15></a> Conversion itself may follow repentance; that is, conversion as the full deliberate turning of the heart to God.<a name=221:16></a> "Repent," says Peter, "and be converted.<a name=221:17></a>" (Acts 3: 19.<a name=221:18></a>) Conversion is the turning of the will to God.<a name=221:19></a> Repentance (<i>metanoia</i>) is the changed thought, or judgment, we have of things, bringing in with it often, when it concerns self, the sense of a change of feeling.<a name=221:20></a> The use of it in classical writers will shew us the meaning of the word in itself; Scripture, the scriptural use of it.<a name=221:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I select a few cases of the former, and then shall cite scripture, which alone can give its own use of it, and does so amply.<a name=221:22></a> Thus as to <i>metanoeo, "ech toutou de enagchazometha metanoein</i>.<a name=221:23></a>" ("From this we were obliged to change our mind.<a name=221:24></a>") -- <i>Xenophon Cyr.<a name=221:25></a> "Kai auton mentoi psasin ananepsanta outo metanoesai eps ois epoiesen</i>.<a name=221:26></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now turn to scripture, which it is more especially important of course to search into.<a name=222:14></a> In the LXX it is, save in the Proverbs, used for God's not changing His mind.<a name=222:15></a> In the Proverbs, it is said, "Vow not hastily, for afterwards a man will repent of it.<a name=222:16></a>" And in another case it is said, "The simple believeth every word, but the prudent uses <i>(metanoian)</i> reflection, afterthought.<a name=222:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the New Testament, we have John the Baptist's well-known testimony.<a name=222:18></a> He preached the baptism of repentance, for the kingdom of heaven was at hand.<a name=222:19></a> Christ's first testimony is the same: Matthew 3: 2, 4: 7; 3: 8, 11; Mark 1: 4, 15; Luke 3: 3, 8.<a name=222:20></a> The effect was, that they went out confessing their sins.<a name=222:21></a> Surely this was a judgment of themselves and of their sins produced through the testimony of the word.<a name=222:22></a> There was a change of mind, an afterthought on reflection -- the definition given of <i>metanoia</i> -- light being let into their conscience as to their state: and fruits were looked for suited to this change of mind as evidence of its reality.<a name=222:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The only place in the New Testament in which I believe it means simply change of mind, without reference to the judgment of ourselves and our sins, is in Hebrews 12: 17.<a name=223:23></a> He found no place for repentance -- for going back from his previous way of taking up the matter, though he sought it -- the blessing, not the repentance -- bitterly with tears.<a name=223:24></a> The blessing and taking back his previous act, and unbelieving self-gratification go together; but here it has nothing to do with repenting of sin, but the first ordinary sense, changing his mind.<a name=223:25></a> It is not necessary, nor, I believe, just, to refer it to Jacob.<a name=223:26></a>

		The writer has found an obscure passage in the very valuable tract he comments on, and has made the most of it; he has found an incorrect expression used by one of his own friends who holds the truth on these points, and he makes the most of that.<a name=234:2></a> The latter is, "when Christ was in incarnation.<a name=234:3></a>" It <i>is</i> inexact; but every one can understand what is meant, and the speaker was quite right.<a name=234:4></a> He means, evidently, the period of Christ's life on earth when incarnate down here.<a name=234:5></a> In the former the expressions may lead an ignorant person to confound the state of life into which Christ has entered (and what is necessary to association and union with Himself, in contrast with His state down here, in which there could not possibly be union) with the fact of life in power in the Son.<a name=234:6></a> This last is the prerogative of the Son at all times (yet never revealed till He was incarnate).<a name=234:7></a> He could and did quicken while on earth (John 5), but there was no union with Him.<a name=234:8></a> But this is obscurely expressed, and union with Him in life spoken of, or, as it is there expressed, "be united to Him in the same life that He has," which might lead to suppose union to consist in life -- a notion as common as it is unscriptural and false.<a name=234:9></a> And, as this is the false doctrine of the commentator, he has naturally taken it in his own sense; as to which one may fairly excuse him.<a name=234:10></a> But his whole system of doctrine as to it is mere popular error, a hundred times exposed.<a name=234:11></a>

		It is exceedingly important to see the doctrine our opponents, with the mass of Evangelicals, hold as to the Holy Ghost -- their total denial of what constitutes the essential difference of the christian position; and that, not only as to the Church, but as to the individual.<a name=234:12></a> What constitutes the essential difference of the present christian state (not its foundation, but its essential difference) is the presence of the Comforter.<a name=234:13></a> This it is the prophets had prophesied of; this it is Christ had promised; this it is He gave as the witness of His being gone on high and set down at God's right hand.<a name=234:14></a> T.<a name=234:15></a> M.<a name=234:16></a> and his companions affirm that this is lost to the Church.<a name=234:17></a> There was nothing, they will have it, peculiar at Pentecost, but what are called miraculous gifts, and they are gone.<a name=234:18></a> Here are his words: "The scripture is, 'baptized with the Holy Ghost,' or 'in the Holy Ghost.<a name=234:19></a>' Acts 1:5; 2:15.<a name=234:20></a> The obvious meaning is, that they were to be submerged or baptized into the powers of the Holy Ghost, which took place at Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost came down upon them .<a name=234:21></a>.<a name=234:22></a>.<a name=234:23></a> Does our speaker mean to say that we have now the Pentecostal baptism which he connects with 1 Corinthians 12: 12, etc.<a name=234:24></a>?<a name=234:25></a> If so, we must now be in the enjoyment of Pentecostal gifts, which most certainly we have not.<a name=234:26></a>"

		"The fact is, that our being baptized by one Spirit into one body is not subsequent to regeneration, but an integral and necessary part of it.<a name=235:1></a>" I believe these statements to be the root principle of the apostasy prophesied of, and a denial of the essential characteristic of Christianity, the power and grace consequent on the exaltation of Jesus to the right hand of God, and the fruit of His finished work.<a name=235:2></a> This consisted simply, they say, in the enjoyment of Pentecostal gifts, which most certainly we have not.<a name=235:3></a>

		Let us see how scripture speaks on this point.<a name=235:4></a> The fact of miracles clearly does not make the difference.<a name=235:5></a> They were wrought of old, and by the Lord, and, through His power, by the disciples.<a name=235:6></a> It is true that, in their extent and in their character in certain respects (and these very interesting ones, such as tongues), there was a difference.<a name=235:7></a> The apostles were to do greater things than those which Christ had done, because He went to the Father.<a name=235:8></a> But the fact of miracles did not make the difference.<a name=235:9></a> They were wrought of old.<a name=235:10></a> But the outpouring of the Spirit was spoken of by the prophets as distinctive of the great time of Messiah's blessing -- the hoped-for promised blessing.<a name=235:11></a> It was identified with the blessing of Abraham coming on the Gentiles.<a name=235:12></a> The Jews received it then.<a name=235:13></a> Galatians 3: 14.<a name=235:14></a> This was the glory of the great promise in Joel; this, the blessed promise connected with the Redeemer come to Zion, Isaiah 59; this the promise of full blessing by the same prophet in chapter 32: 15.<a name=235:15></a> Messiah did come and was rejected; but this presence of the Holy Ghost (though Christ was not there, and so far in lieu of His presence) became for that very reason the essential, necessary, distinctive, present blessing of Christianity, founded on the perfect accomplishment of His work and His exaltation to the right hand of God.<a name=235:16></a> This the Lord carefully teaches us Himself in the Gospel of John: "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=235:17></a> But this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=235:18></a>" This is a most important passage.<a name=235:19></a> No Christian in the world thinks that that divine person began to exist after that.<a name=235:20></a> I need not dwell on this with any who are in the truth.<a name=235:21></a>

		Scripture shews that that divine Spirit is the direct agent in creation and on creatures from the beginning.<a name=236:1></a> The Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.<a name=236:2></a> By His Spirit He garnished the heavens.<a name=236:3></a> I might cite other passages; and even the Lord Himself in His blessed works on earth could say, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.<a name=236:4></a>" So every believer knows that the Spirit of God wrought on the prophets.<a name=236:5></a> I need not multiply quotations.<a name=236:6></a>

		But that this divine Person should come and take up His abode on earth, consequent on an accomplished redemption, was a wholly new thing; and this was so distinct and prominent a fact, and a fact so characteristic of the earthly condition, of a state of things which was the special object of God's eternal counsels, that it is said, looking at earth, "The Holy Ghost <i>was not yet</i>.<a name=236:7></a>" That which could be called the Holy Ghost (that is, His personal presence on earth in the redeemed) was not yet; and the reason is given: Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=236:8></a> The Holy Ghost might accomplish every divine operation which was to be wrought; but He could not dwell, and have a temple on earth as come down from heaven, until Christ was in heaven as man having accomplished redemption -- till Jesus was glorified.<a name=236:9></a> This distinction of the previous operations of the Spirit, and His coming down, is clearly made by Peter: "The prophets searched what and what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories which should follow; to whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them which have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=236:10></a>" The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets.<a name=236:11></a> Now the Holy Ghost is sent down from heaven.<a name=236:12></a> But the end of John's Gospel treats this subject at large (chapter 14: 16): "I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<a name=236:13></a>" The Father had been revealed in the Son.<a name=236:14></a> That they ought to have known (verse 9, 10); but now they should know that He was in the Father, and they in Him, and He in them.<a name=236:15></a> This was a wholly new thing by the Comforter.<a name=236:16></a> The Father was to send Him in Christ's name.<a name=236:17></a>

		Now I beg the reader to weigh very earnestly all these testimonies of the Lord to the sending and coming of the Holy Ghost, after, and consequent upon, Christ's going away.<a name=237:2></a> They were told accordingly to tarry at Jerusalem till they were endued with power from on high.<a name=237:3></a> On the departure of Christ they were assured they were to be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<a name=237:4></a> (Acts 1: 5.<a name=237:5></a>) The importance of this we may judge of by its being presented by John Baptist as one of the two great features which distinctively characterized the Christ, the other being that He was the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.<a name=237:6></a> (John 1: 33; Matthew 3: 11.<a name=237:7></a>) But, further, we are assured that it was only on His going up on high that Christ received the Spirit to this end.<a name=237:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts..htm#2:33">Acts.  2:33</a>.<a name=237:9></a>) "Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.<a name=237:10></a>" So Peter testifies to his auditors, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=237:11></a> For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.<a name=237:12></a>" So, again, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a>: "And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him" -- connecting this gift, as spoken of in Acts, with John 15:26,27.<a name=237:13></a> So in John's Epistle we read, "And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.<a name=237:14></a>"

		Now these scriptures make it plain, as plain as God's testimony can make it, that the Holy Ghost -- what is called distinctively, "the Holy Ghost" and the Comforter -- was not given until after Christ was exalted; that, if Christ had not gone away, He could not have come; and that He never came till Christ had been so exalted: then He was sent, Christ having then received Him according to the promise of the Father.<a name=237:15></a> I say the Holy Ghost, as thus come, "was not" till Christ was exalted.<a name=237:16></a> If it was merely an integral and necessary part of regeneration, then nobody was regenerate before at all.<a name=237:17></a> That the Comforter thus <a name=238>[Page 238]</a>

		The scripture is as plain as words can be.<a name=239:6></a> First, in the quoted passage: "This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.<a name=239:7></a>" They believed on Him, and must do so, before they received the Spirit thus; but we are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=239:8></a> That is, they were first children, regenerate, and afterward received the Holy Ghost.<a name=239:9></a> And this is distinctly thus followed out in Galatians, "We are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus;" and, having received the adoption of sons by the Son's coming down here for us and redeeming us, "because we are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=239:10></a>" Note, it is not Pentecostal gifts, but the Spirit crying Abba in our hearts.<a name=239:11></a>

		In perfect analogy with Peter's sermon, Paul asks the disciples at Ephesus, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?<a name=239:18></a>" -- a question perfectly senseless had that receiving been an integral and necessary part of their regeneration.<a name=239:19></a> Their answer was, "We have not so much as heard if the Holy Ghost is" -- that is, if what John has taught us has been fulfilled, that Christ would baptize with the Holy Ghost.<a name=239:20></a>

		We have thus the certainty from scripture of the personal presence of God in the Church, and in the saint, in the person of the Spirit, after and distinct from believing and being children, and the seal of that faith, the fruit of accomplished redemption, and hence after, and only after, the exaltation of Jesus, by whom and in whose name by the Father He was sent down as the other Comforter.<a name=240:4></a> And this is simple, when we consider who are regenerated, and who are sealed; for unbelievers only can be regenerated, believers only can be sealed.<a name=240:5></a>

		I reply to his questions.<a name=253:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First.<a name=253:15></a> The Gospels do <i>not</i> contain the widest possible form of instruction.<a name=253:16></a> I know no part of scripture so blessed, because they present Christ Himself to me.<a name=253:17></a> But <i>they</i> teach me that as to truth there were many things which Christ had to teach, which the disciples could not then bear, and that the Spirit was to guide them into all truth.<a name=253:18></a> If T.<a name=253:19></a> M.<a name=253:20></a> does not believe this, he does not bow to what Christ says in the gospels.<a name=253:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly.<a name=253:22></a> We are to believe that the Church was not related to Christ when He was on earth; because Ephesians tells us He was to be exalted in order to be the Head of the body, and that by His death He was to make of twain one new man, and reconcile both in one body by the cross.<a name=253:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly.<a name=253:24></a> No doubt the disciples were children of God while Christ was on earth, but they had not the Spirit of adoption, nor did Christ own them as His brethren.<a name=253:25></a> The expression of "brother and sister" has evidently no relation to this.<a name=253:26></a> They were as much His mother as His brethren.<a name=253:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourthly.<a name=253:28></a> It is no part of our faith that the blood of Christ gives an equal standing and relationship to all whom it cleanses -- not even as on earth.<a name=253:29></a> It gives power to enter into the holiest.<a name=253:30></a> It did not on earth to the Old Testament saints; it will not to the millennial saints on earth.<a name=253:31></a> It is "a new and living way which is opened to us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.<a name=253:32></a>" As to any

		standing and relationship with Christ in the heavenly state, that must be learnt from scripture, not from human inferences.<a name=254:1></a> When a scripture is brought which teaches me that all saints are the body and bride of Christ, I shall of course bow.<a name=254:2></a> I read that God has reserved some better things for us.<a name=254:3></a> Salvation is the same for all; but our special place must be learned from God's revealed purpose.<a name=254:4></a> If the result must be the same, why are there those who sit on the right hand and on the left, others who do not?<a name=254:5></a> If there is a difference in degree, as T.<a name=254:6></a> M.<a name=254:7></a> is forced to admit, then the blood of Christ does not involve equality of place; if it did, it must be absolute equality; if this be not so, the inference is <i>false</i>.<a name=254:8></a> We must learn from the word what is true.<a name=254:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifthly.<a name=254:10></a> We are to limit Matthew 16 to the formation of the Church at Pentecost and after.<a name=254:11></a> It is not an Old Testament prophecy at all.<a name=254:12></a> It does not contain a promise to Israel in the millennial days.<a name=254:13></a> Were it even so, it could not be true of days preceding Christ's coming.<a name=254:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sixthly.<a name=254:15></a> We are to hold that the Old Testament saints are not united to Him.<a name=254:16></a> It is a delusion to hold that men are united to Christ because they are quickened and raised by Him.<a name=254:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The seventh is a mere false accusation against his own friends.<a name=254:18></a> No such thing is said in his friend's speech, as quoted by T.<a name=254:19></a> M.<a name=254:20></a> It is only said they are not so easy to be understood, which is quite true, and for the reason stated.<a name=254:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eighthly.<a name=254:22></a> Romans does not contain the truth of the Church.<a name=254:23></a> In practical exhortation, it alludes to it as existing in chapter 12; but it is not at all the subject of its teaching.<a name=254:24></a> It speaks of what is even more important, individual justification and peace, forgiveness of sins, and judgment of the law of the old man, and freedom from it in a new life.<a name=254:25></a> Nay, more; it does not (save in an allusion, in order to speak of intercession) speak of Christ as ascended.<a name=254:26></a> It teaches us the new condition into which Christ's death and resurrection bring us.<a name=254:27></a> It is so far a contrast to Ephesians, that Romans begins with man in wickedness and sin, and presents the remedy; Ephesians, with God's purpose, and, looking at Christ dead, and we dead in sins, shews us quickened together with Him, does not teach us justification as responsible men on earth, but a new creation, by which we are associated with, and united to, Christ in heaven.<a name=254:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ninthly.<a name=254:29></a> It is undoubtedly true that we are first regenerated and then sealed and baptized into one body.<a name=254:30></a> I speak of no interval of time being necessary; but the consequence of the divine acts

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Tenthly.<a name=255:8></a> The operations of the Spirit are not limited to this dispensation; but the sending of the Comforter is, because Christ expressly declares it could not come till He went away, and when it did come, was to abide for ever, not go away like Him.<a name=255:9></a> The Holy Ghost is not the same as the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<a name=255:10></a> He distributes, when come, to whom He will.<a name=255:11></a> All this is but infidelity as to the presence of the Spirit.<a name=255:12></a> True, the Church has so grieved Him, it is hard often to discern His operations; but God is calling back the conscience of the Church to its sin in this respect, and what it has lost; and these teachers are denying the evil.<a name=255:13></a> It is only repeating what I have said in the body of the tract, but there cannot be a more complete denial or ignoring of the specific sending the Comforter on Christ's going away -- that is, of the essential characteristic of Christianity which is the ministration of the Spirit.<a name=255:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eleventhly.<a name=255:15></a> This question betrays the same setting aside of the Church that the former did of the Spirit.<a name=255:16></a> Scripture never says, the Church which is in the Father, but "the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father.<a name=255:17></a>" And the difference is all important, because, though a local church may stand locally in the responsibilities of the body, it is a candlestick which may be removed out of its place.<a name=255:18></a> But the body of Christ cannot come to nought.<a name=255:19></a> Further, there is no question of sonship or union.<a name=255:20></a> The Church, the assembly, is not a son of God, nor can there be union with the Father.<a name=255:21></a> The question is a complication of blunders.<a name=255:22></a> Individual Christians are sons, the church of the Thessalonians has nothing to do with being a son, and, save Christ in a divine way, no son is in the Father.<a name=255:23></a> The whole question is a blunder.<a name=255:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In fine, I see nothing in this tract -- save the denial, in ignorance (I fully admit) not of the foundation of a sinner's hope, nor of the work of God in him for salvation, but of the essential and characteristic truth of Christianity, both as to the Spirit and the Church.<a name=255:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is then ever true, that for every blessed soul there must be regeneration and a holy nature; there must be redemption and cleansing by the precious blood of Christ.<a name=256:19></a> Confiding faith in Him is the privilege of the saints at all times.<a name=256:20></a> But take the whole dealing of God with us now, and all depends on and is wrought by truth which no prophet could have used at all.<a name=256:21></a> Go no farther than Peter's sermon (Acts 2): not a word of that would have been said by a prophet.<a name=256:22></a> Take John 16, God's whole present testimony in the world: not one word of it possible but by the coming of the Comforter.<a name=256:23></a> I only pray the reader to recall what is lost by T.<a name=256:24></a> M.<a name=256:25></a>'s doctrine of the Comforter being only Pentecostal gifts -- no Spirit of adoption, no love shed abroad in our hearts, no earnest of the inheritance, no taking the things of Christ to shew them to us, no unction of the Holy One by which we know all things, no access into the holiest or to the Father, no knowledge of the things freely given to us of God, no knowledge that Christ is in the Father, we in Him, and He in us.<a name=256:26></a> I need go no farther.<a name=256:27></a> None of these are Pentecostal gifts, which are gone; none simply regeneration; for they are by the Spirit sent down, and given consequent on Christ's exaltation; whereas regeneration, T.<a name=256:28></a> M.<a name=256:29></a> insists, was at all times true.<a name=256:30></a> Is all this (and I might largely add to the list) lost?<a name=256:31></a> or what is the Comforter?<a name=256:32></a>

		Now all this is the hinge of the question.<a name=258:1></a> But all this shews the evil consequence of drawing conclusions instead of bowing to the word.<a name=258:2></a> It is clearly and distinctly revealed, that, when Christ appears, we shall appear with Him in glory; and therefore it is simply impossible that we should be on earth till His appearing, and "at that time;" because we appear with Him from heaven "at that time.<a name=258:3></a>" Now that the glorious appearing is the hope of believers, and that we wait for it, I accept fully.<a name=258:4></a> But why should that not be the case if we appear with Christ, instead of being on earth when He appears?<a name=258:5></a> Much more so, I should think.<a name=258:6></a> No doubt, the earth will then be set right, and that is a blessed thought indeed; but not less so if we are the companions of Christ when He comes.<a name=258:7></a> And this all scripture fully testifies.<a name=258:8></a> "The Lord my God shall come and all the saints with thee.<a name=258:9></a>" (Zechariah 14: 5.<a name=258:10></a>) Again, "The Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints.<a name=258:11></a>" (Jude 14.<a name=258:12></a>) And again, "The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<a name=258:13></a>" (Revelation 19: 14.<a name=258:14></a>) And again, "They that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.<a name=258:15></a>" (Revelation 17: 14).<a name=258:16></a>

		Secondly, the essence of the law, that on which law and prophets hung, as presented by the Lord, was the abstract rule of perfectness in a creature, loving God with all the heart, and our neighbour as ourselves.<a name=280:11></a> This, in a creature, would be human perfection.<a name=280:12></a> Doubtless the angels do it, if even a commandment be not needed for them.<a name=280:13></a> It is folly to talk of a transcript of God's own mind, unless it be His mind as to what the creature ought to be, which, of course, His law must be; but it cannot be the perfection of God's mind in Himself, because it is of what man's ought to be.<a name=280:14></a> God cannot love His neighbour as Himself, nor any other being with all His heart, as owing it to him.<a name=280:15></a> It is, what it professes to be, a perfect rule for man as such.<a name=280:16></a> It condemns him as he is, because it tells what he ought to be; nor, if he were what he ought to be, would he want it.<a name=280:17></a> A command to do it, to feel right, supposes the need of it -- liability to fail in doing so.<a name=280:18></a><a href="#280:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But in itself it is a perfect positive rule for man as a child of Adam.<a name=280:19></a>

		Let us see what scripture says directly on the subject; and first of all Genesis 2.<a name=290:1></a> Here God rested on the seventh day and sanctified it, because He rested on it.<a name=290:2></a> I do not think Paley's argument right, or of any value if it be right.<a name=290:3></a> In any case the seventh day is recognized by God as consecrated when He did give a law, as sanctified and blessed because He rested on that day.<a name=290:4></a> But it was the rest of creation, of the first creation as God made it, very good.<a name=290:5></a> Nobody says it was observed all along from that to Israel's departure from Egypt.<a name=290:6></a> There may have been traditions of it, clearer or more obscure.<a name=290:7></a> It seems there were, both scriptural and heathen, but they are obscure.<a name=290:8></a> But that creation fell at once, and the very thing we have heard in Christianity is, that man never did keep it, never could, nor ever can be subject to it, or have rest on that footing.<a name=290:9></a> It may be a mercy to his body (I believe it is): his body is part of the old creation.<a name=290:10></a> But I speak of relationship with God.<a name=290:11></a> Religiously the rest of the old creation is impossible to him.<a name=290:12></a>

		In the law God took up man in the flesh and the creation, to test the possibility of man's living in relationship with God in them; and it was proved impossible there.<a name=290:13></a> But the sabbath was the sign then of relationship with God.<a name=290:14></a> It was not a seventh day, but the seventh, not of the six, on those God was working, they were not His rest.<a name=290:15></a> It is all very well to talk of a seventh day.<a name=290:16></a> <i>A</i> seventh day may be good for man, but shuts out God, leaves His rest aside, and gives man his rest as a physical rest without Him, rests when He was working, and works when He was resting, slights God, if it reposes man.<a name=290:17></a> It was <i>the</i> seventh day was blessed because God rested on it.<a name=290:18></a> Man did not want rest from toil in Paradise.<a name=290:19></a> Was he not to keep the seventh day if he had not fallen?<a name=290:20></a> Would he keep a seventh day as the essence of it, or the seventh because God rested on it?<a name=290:21></a> No, <i>the</i> seventh day alone is the religious character of it, because man's blessing is in God's rest.<a name=290:22></a> He is man all the six days as to his path according to God's will, with God the seventh.<a name=290:23></a> But he fell directly, never entered into God's rest.<a name=290:24></a>

		I will shew how very much was made of it, but first a few words on moral law and the decalogue.<a name=293:1></a> By moral law I understand the duty of maintaining the relationship in which we stand.<a name=293:2></a> But they acquire their obligation from their institution by God, and the first relationship of all is relationship with God -- hence the first of all moralities -- and which casts its light and character on all the rest, because, in whatever God has instituted or commanded, I am bound to obedience; and obedience itself is morality in its highest form.<a name=293:3></a> It is maintaining relationship with God.<a name=293:4></a> Hence, before sin came in, the test was abstract pure obedience -- "thou shalt not eat.<a name=293:5></a>" Well, man disobeyed and fell -- got wholly away from God; but he got a conscience in and by his fall -- the knowledge of good and evil, that is, the sense of good and evil in itself without a commandment or law which made it obedience, which would have supposed his being still with God.<a name=293:6></a> Such was the wisdom of God.<a name=293:7></a> But this natural conscience enforced the obligation of these relationships in which God had placed man.<a name=293:8></a> Man's institutions might deface and obscure them: still the internal obligation was there.<a name=293:9></a> A wife was owned as a wife, though divorce might come in; parents as parents, though the state might claim rights over that tie; violence and robbery were known to be violence, though they might gloriously plunder enemies, and so on.<a name=293:10></a> And the blessed Lord would restore the testimony, "from the beginning it was not so.<a name=293:11></a>" Thus, though there was no commandment, no law, there was morality, and the Gentile would do by nature the things contained in the law and be a law to himself, an expression which peremptorily excludes the having a law of God which made it obedience, and rests it on conscience acquired in the fall, when man left God and was turned out from Him.<a name=293:12></a>

		And then he enlarges.<a name=303:1></a> "Wherefore these words, I am dead to the law, are very effectual.<a name=303:2></a> For he saith not: I am free from the law for a time, or I am lord over the law; but simply, I am dead to the law, that is, I have nothing to do with the law .<a name=303:3></a>.<a name=303:4></a>.<a name=303:5></a> Now to die to the law is not to be bound to the law, but to be free from the law, and not to know it.<a name=303:6></a> Therefore let him that will live to God endeavour that he may be found without the law, and let him come out of the grave with Christ.<a name=303:7></a>"

		THE INTERCESSION OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some obscurity seems to hang over the doctrine of Christ's intercession in the minds of some saints, which I feel it would be profitable to seek to dispel.<a name=304:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some (and it is a common case) put it in the wrong place, viz.<a name=304:2></a>, as the means of obtaining righteousness and peace, and thus enfeeble (and that because they are ignorant of) the true character of redemption; others, seeing that this is perfect and complete, set intercession aside as incompatible with that perfectness, as if it enfeebled or denied it.<a name=304:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both are wrong, and both mistake the nature of Christ's intercession.<a name=304:4></a> Christ's intercession is not the means of obtaining righteousness and peace.<a name=304:5></a> It is mischievous to use it to this end; and it does, so used, hinder the apprehension of our being made the righteousness of God in Christ.<a name=304:6></a> It is mischievous too to deny its use when we do know Christ as our perfect righteousness.<a name=304:7></a> The doing so makes that righteousness to be a cold and heartless security, destroying the deep and softening sense of His constant love to us, and our dependence on the daily exercise of that love.<a name=304:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The former class, not assured of God's perfect love in righteousness, go to Christ to get Him to undertake their cause and go to God for them, and, so to speak, settle matters.<a name=304:9></a> They really (though they would not say so) see love in Christ and judgment in God; and go to Christ to move God to compassion, mercy, and forgiveness.<a name=304:10></a> It is very natural we should go through this state, particularly with the current teaching; but it is not really christian ground.<a name=304:11></a> God's love is the source of all our blessings, and of the hopes of our salvation; and that love is fully exercised in righteousness, because of Christ's work and glorifying of God.<a name=304:12></a> Grace reigns through righteousness: we are the righteousness of God in Christ; we have not to seek it.<a name=304:13></a> Christ is our righteousness always and constantly.<a name=304:14></a> It is as perfect as it is constant and perpetual; and as constant and perpetual as it is perfect.<a name=304:15></a> God has been -- is -- perfectly glorified in this respect; and His love goes forth freely and righteously on the Christian as on Christ Himself.<a name=304:16></a> It is a settled position before God, a standing and relationship which does not change.<a name=304:17></a> The intercession of Christ is founded upon it.<a name=304:18></a> How far the act which completed this ground of our place before God was the act of the priest, I will consider when speaking of the Epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=304:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now consider what intercession really is, what place it takes in the christian system.<a name=305:8></a> There are two characters which the intercession of our Lord takes -- priesthood with God, and advocacy with the Father.<a name=305:9></a> In both He appears before God or the Father for us that we may receive needed blessing; but the former is more general.<a name=305:10></a> He is before God, so that we draw near and can do so.<a name=305:11></a> He makes withal intercession for our need.<a name=305:12></a> As Advocate with the Father, it is more restoration of communion.<a name=305:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here some preliminary difficulties have to be met.<a name=305:14></a> There are those who deny the force of the word intercession as implying active intercession or intervention for us; they say that <i>entugchano</i> merely means His personal presence or appearance there for us.<a name=305:15></a> But this is not so.<a name=305:16></a> The word <i>entugchano</i> is used for active intervention or intercession.<a name=305:17></a> So, in scripture, He ever lives to do it.<a name=305:18></a> Surely not He ever lives to be present simply between God and us.<a name=305:19></a> So in Romans 8, "Who is even at the right hand of God, who <i>also</i> maketh intercession for us.<a name=305:20></a>" And in the same chapter, what is said of the Holy Ghost clearly shews that this word is used in the plain ordinary sense of intercessory pleading for us.<a name=305:21></a> He makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<a name=305:22></a> The Holy Ghost does not appear (<i>entugchano</i>) in the presence of God <i>for</i> us at all, but He intercedes, pleads in us, with groans which cannot be uttered.<a name=305:23></a> This use of <i>entugchano</i> cannot then be controverted.<a name=305:24></a>

		This ground of advocacy leads me to speak of the analogous, or really same, foundation of priesthood.<a name=308:2></a> On earth He could not be a priest: but there was one work which the high priest did, not in the exercise of his priesthood, properly speaking, which was in the sanctuary, but which laid the foundation for it, in which he was substitute and representative of the people, the foundation of his priestly service proper during the year.<a name=308:3></a> This was the sacrifice of the great day of atonement: the blood put upon the mercyseat; and the sins of the people confessed on the head of the scapegoat.<a name=308:4></a> Reconciliation or propitiation was made for the sins of the people.<a name=308:5></a> All exercise of priesthood was founded on this, and this the Epistle to the Hebrews refers to, as well as to priesthood.<a name=308:6></a> His earthly life fitted Christ for sympathy, though He be now in heaven, and the sacrifice accomplished on earth (in putting away for ever as to guilt the sins He had borne) formed the basis of intercession for daily blessing and access to God by Him.<a name=308:7></a> Hence, while clearly stating that if on earth He would not be a priest, we read, Hebrews 2: 17, "It behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation [more exactly, propitiation] for the sins of the people.<a name=308:8></a>" On this is founded His gracious and constant priesthood and intercession.<a name=308:9></a> Imputation of sin to us is become impossible because of Christ's sacrifice; and His suffering and tempted life enables Him in grace, intelligent of sorrow and trial, to succour them that are tempted.<a name=308:10></a> Hence in chapter 4 we Christians are called upon to hold fast our profession,<a href="#308:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> "for we have not an high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, sin apart.<a name=308:11></a>" We have then a Priest with God, and an Advocate with the Father: there in virtue of a sacrifice in which He has once for all borne our sins and appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself; there in a perfect acceptance in which we have a part -- Jesus Christ the righteous, the propitiation for our sins; able to save to the end those that come to God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them; who is even at the right hand of God, set down when

		No wonder you did not see Christ then.<a name=319:4></a> Now this is what God calls submitting to God's righteousness, finding a righteousness which is neither of nor in ourselves, but finding Christ before God, and the proud will, through grace, submitting to be saved by that which is not of or in ourselves.<a name=319:5></a> It is Christ instead of self, instead of our place in the flesh.<a name=319:6></a> Had you obtained peace in the way you sought it, you would have been satisfied with whom?<a name=319:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just so.<a name=319:9></a> And what would that have been?<a name=319:10></a> Nothing real indeed, and shutting out Christ if it were, save as a help; shutting Him out as righteousness and peace.<a name=319:11></a> And as an upright soul taught really of God cannot be satisfied with itself, it remains, though confidingly in love if walking with God, yet without peace for years perhaps, till it does submit to God's righteousness.<a name=319:12></a> And now note another point: for the soul at peace with God can now contemplate Christ to learn.<a name=319:13></a> He has not only borne our sins, and died to sin, and closed the whole history of the old man in death for those who believe, they having been crucified with Him; but He has glorified God in this work (John 12<i>:</i> 31, 33; 17: 4, 5), and so obtained a place for man in the glory of God, and a place of present positive acceptance, according to the nature and favour of God whom He has glorified; and that is our place before God.<a name=319:14></a> It is not only that the old man and his sins are all put out of God's sight, but we are in Christ before God; and this we have the consciousness of by the Holy Ghost given to us (John 14: 20), accepted in the Beloved, divine favour resting on us as on Him.<a name=319:15></a> And thus too He dwells in us; and this leads unto true practical holiness.<a name=319:16></a> We are sanctified, set apart, to God by His blood; but we are so in possessing His life, or Him as our life, and the Holy Ghost; and these, or, if you please, He Himself becomes the measure of our walk and relationship with God.<a name=319:17></a> We are not our own, but bought with a price, and nothing inconsistent with His blood, and the price of it, and its power in our hearts, becomes a Christian.<a name=319:18></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		This was beautifully expressed in the Old Testament in figures.<a name=319:19></a> When a leper was cleansed, besides the sacrifice, the blood was put on the tips of his ear, his thumb, and his great toe.<a name=319:20></a> Every thought, every act, all in our walk which cannot pass the test of that blood, is excluded from the Christian's thoughts and walk.<a name=319:21></a> <a name=320>[Page 320]</a>

		And how glad he is to be freed from this world and the body of sin practically, and have that precious blood as the motive, measure, and security for it; that whatever grieves the Holy Spirit of God, by which we are sealed when thus sprinkled, is unsuited to a Christian, seeing he dwells in Him.<a name=320:1></a> And that precious blood and the love Christ shewed in shedding it become the motive, and the Holy Ghost the power of, devotedness and love in walking as Christ walked.<a name=320:2></a> If we are in Christ, Christ is in us; and we know it by the Comforter given (John 14); and we are the epistle of Christ in this world: the life of Jesus is to be manifested in our mortal body.<a name=320:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, we have to seek that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith, being rooted and grounded in love, that we may comprehend.<a name=322:12></a> Yet if the Holy Ghost who dwells in us is the source of our thoughts and joys and feelings, they cannot be discordant, though we may be poor feeble creatures, with those of the Father and the Son.<a name=322:13></a> Does not the Christian's heart delight in Christ, in His words, His obedience, His holiness, His sacrifice of Himself to the Father's will?<a name=322:14></a> and does not the Father delight in it?<a name=322:15></a> we indeed most poorly and feebly, He infinitely; but the object is one.<a name=322:16></a> He is chosen of God and precious, and to them that believe He is precious.<a name=322:17></a> I go no farther than to cite this as an illustration.<a name=322:18></a> This is a matter of your daily life and diligence of heart; but you can understand that what comes from the Holy Ghost must conform to the mind of the Father and the Son.<a name=322:19></a>

		Now when persons live close with God in simplicity of heart, the sense of goodness in God predominates, and there is the savour of piety; but when they do not, there is uneasiness and restlessness; the accusing conscience predominates, and they are unhappy, if not dismally afraid.<a name=324:11></a> But in neither case is redemption really known; it is not known that Christ has taken our place in judgment, and given us His in glory: only we must wait for the adoption itself, the redemption of the body.<a name=324:12></a> The way in which scripture unites these two truths is in the resurrection of Christ.<a name=324:13></a> This is the power of life, and the seal of the acceptance of His work -- His coming fully up out of the consequences of our sin into another state.<a name=324:14></a> So we in Him.<a name=324:15></a> We were dead in sin, exposed to judgment, and under death; Christ comes down from heaven, accomplishing in dying the work of putting our sins away; and we are dead with Him; and then He and we with Him are raised, consequent on the completed work, and God's acceptance of it.<a name=324:16></a> He has quickened us together with Him, having forgiven us all trespasses.<a name=324:17></a> It is life, whose full divine power is shewn in resurrection; it is not only eternal life communicated, but deliverance out of the state we were in, and our entrance into another; not outwardly of course yet, but really by the possession of this life.<a name=324:18></a> <a name=325>[Page 325]</a>

		Redemption means, though by price, a deliverance out of the state I was in, and bringing me into another and a free one.<a name=325:1></a> Hence we talk of the redemption of the body, which we have not yet.<a name=325:2></a> Life does not by itself give this: through it we feel the burden of the old state we are in; but when we find that we are redeemed also, we know that we have been brought, at the cost of Christ's death, out of the old Adam state we were in, into Christ.<a name=325:3></a> Hence we have "boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.<a name=325:4></a>"

		I cannot follow quite the course of scripture thoughts you give.<a name=325:5></a> I must learn these things; but I see the difference between redemption and life, though we have both in Christ now.<a name=325:6></a> He has died and is risen.<a name=325:7></a> I suppose I had life before; but I have, in a measure, now understood redemption too.<a name=325:8></a>

		Yes, you were of course redeemed.<a name=325:9></a> And surely God had wrought in you in grace, as you said; but, as already said, you were looking at this in view of a God of judgment, with glimpses of divine love, but had not faith in accomplished redemption.<a name=325:10></a> See how the reasoning of the apostle applies to this in Romans 5: 19: "By one man's obedience many shall be made (constituted) righteous.<a name=325:11></a>" "Then," says the flesh, "I may live in sin.<a name=325:12></a>" What is the answer?<a name=325:13></a> No, you ought not!<a name=325:14></a> This would be to put you back under the claims of law, and so destroy again what is taught of Christ's obedience.<a name=325:15></a> In no wise: "How can we that are dead to sin live in it?<a name=325:16></a>" You have been baptized to Christ's death, and are a Christian by having part in His death.<a name=325:17></a> How, if you have died with Him to sin, can you live in it?<a name=325:18></a> We are now free to give ourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead.<a name=325:19></a>

		Well, while the old foundations remain, it makes a new thing of the whole matter.<a name=325:20></a> It is not the same way of putting Christianity at all.<a name=325:21></a> I have to realize it, though I am quite different as to my ground of peace already; or, rather, I have one, and had not before.<a name=325:22></a> But I see it is in scripture, and I must search that out.<a name=325:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true.<a name=326:14></a> Do not suppose I want to make difficulties: but there is still a question I have to ask; I wish to get clear on these points.<a name=326:15></a> We have been taught to rely on God's promises and trust them for our salvation; it is the language we constantly hear, and I do not see, if your view be right, how exactly to connect it with trusting in the promises for salvation; and surely we should do that.<a name=326:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The answer is very simple, and I am glad you put the question.<a name=326:17></a> It is just these points we have to inquire into.<a name=326:18></a> Trusting God's promises is clearly right: that is certain; and there are most precious promises too.<a name=326:19></a> But tell me, is it a promise that Christ shall come and die and rise again?<a name=326:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		This then cannot be a promise, because it is an accomplished fact.<a name=326:22></a> For Abraham it was a promise, and he did right to believe it as such.<a name=326:23></a> To us it is an accomplished fact, and we must believe it as such.<a name=326:24></a> And so scripture speaks.<a name=326:25></a> He believed that that which

		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had promised He was able also to perform.<a name=327:1></a> But we believe that what by its efficacy saves us He has performed.<a name=327:2></a> It would be unbelief to treat it yet as a promise; and so it is written -- "You to whom it shall be imputed, believing on him who hath raised up Jesus Christ from the dead.<a name=327:3></a>" You will find both passages together, speaking of this very point, at the end of Romans 4.<a name=327:4></a> As to help on our journey onward, there are many and cherished promises.<a name=327:5></a> "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.<a name=327:6></a>" "God will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able to bear.<a name=327:7></a>" "No man shall pluck his sheep out of his hand.<a name=327:8></a>" "Who will also confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=327:9></a>" I might cite many others of the greatest comfort and value to us in our difficulties on the way.<a name=327:10></a> But the work in which I have to believe as justifying me and reconciling me to God, as alone and perfectly putting away my sins and redeeming me to God, is not a promise; nor can it be looked at as such.<a name=327:11></a> It is an accomplished fact, a work already accepted of God.<a name=327:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see it clearly; indeed, nothing can be simpler and plainer the moment it is before you.<a name=327:13></a> What justifies before God is not a promise at all, but an accomplished fact.<a name=327:14></a> I had never noticed that passage in Romans 4.<a name=327:15></a> It is very plain.<a name=327:16></a> How carelessly one reads scripture.<a name=327:17></a> But indeed, the truth of what you say is evident on the face of it.<a name=327:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me, as we have touched this point, to draw your attention to another thing in the form in which the work and testimony of grace is put.<a name=327:19></a> You may remark that in the passage in Romans 4 it is said, not "believe on Christ," however true that remains, but "on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.<a name=327:20></a>" So Peter, "who by him do believe in God who raised him up from the dead and gave him glory.<a name=327:21></a>" So the Lord Himself as to His coming into the world, "He that heareth my words, and believeth on him that sent me.<a name=327:22></a>" We know God Himself only really, by knowing Him through Christ.<a name=327:23></a> If I know Him thus, I know Him as God our Saviour; as one who has not spared His Son for me: as one who, when Christ was dead as having taken our sins, raised Him from the dead.<a name=327:24></a> In a word, I not only believe in Christ, but in Him who has given Christ and owned His work; who has given glory to man in Him; as a God who has come to save, not as one who is waiting to judge me.<a name=327:25></a> I believe in Him by Christ.<a name=327:26></a> When Israel had passed the Red Sea, they believed in a God who had delivered them and brought them to Himself; and so do I.<a name=327:27></a> I know no other God but that.<a name=327:28></a> If I believe in Him by Christ, I do wait for a

		It may be asked why I refer to all this.<a name=333:1></a> First, the divine perfection of scripture is interesting.<a name=333:2></a> It anticipated and met all the wandering speculations of the human mind.<a name=333:3></a> But there is another reason.<a name=333:4></a> The doctrines of the soul's mortality and of annihilation have their origin in these speculations -- were the doctrines of the Rabbis and Gnostics, of whom we have been speaking, and are met by the scriptures also.<a name=333:5></a> Some of the Rabbis, holding a little more to scripture, were not so far gone in their speculations as their fellow doctors and modern Annihilationists.<a name=333:6></a> They held that it was by the communication of the <i>neshama</i>, the highest kind of life, that man became a living soul; but that if he was not faithful, denied this life, he lost it.<a name=333:7></a>

		I shall now give the passages from Rabbis and Gnostics which confirm what I have just said.<a name=333:8></a> First, the general idea from the Rabbins.<a name=333:9></a> Rabbi Abr.<a name=333:10></a> Seba says, "God has created three parts [souls] of men, the <i>nephesh</i>, the <i>ruach</i>, the <i>neshama</i>.<a name=333:11></a>" In another mystic book, "Three forms of souls are in men: the first, the <i>neshama</i>, the intelligent soul; the second, the <i>ruach</i>, the speaking soul; the third, the <i>nephesh</i>, the animal soul, which always lusts.<a name=333:12></a>" There are other passages to which I have already alluded, but these will suffice to give the idea.<a name=333:13></a> The doctrine was, as I have already remarked, largely developed in the mystic Jewish writers.<a name=333:14></a> There were rewards suited to each.<a name=333:15></a> The Gnostics added their notions as to the evil of matter.<a name=333:16></a> The fleshly (<i>sarchichos</i>) connected itself with the soul life <i>psuchichos</i>); translated "natural man" in scripture, and "flesh.<a name=333:17></a>" For scripture, as I have said, meets all these questions, and gives the divine answer to them.<a name=333:18></a> Truth is one, but it meets consequently all error -- all that is not truth.<a name=333:19></a> The simple soul has only need of the truth itself -- thank God.<a name=333:20></a> But there is in it what meets gainsayers.<a name=333:21></a> So we read in Jude, "sensual [<i>psuchichoi</i>], not having the spirit.<a name=333:22></a>" The Gnostics treated the question according to their views of matter, using scripture of course.<a name=333:23></a> Man was <i>ulichos</i>, material (<i>ulich</i> -- from <i>ule</i>, matter), <i>choichos</i>, from <i>choos</i>.<a name=333:24></a> (1 Corinthians 15:47.<a name=333:25></a>) "The first man," translated "earthly," literally "of dust," from Genesis 2:7; 3:19.<a name=333:26></a> Then <i>psuchichos</i> "having a soul," and <i>pneumatichos</i>, "spiritual.<a name=333:27></a>" But all this with them was man as man; for they held, as Origen and Grecian philosophers, that the spirit, or <i>neshama</i>, being from the upper world, could not be connected with matter without taking the cover or embodiment of a soul -- a <i>ruach</i>, to speak with the Rabbins.<a name=333:28></a> This took then a <i>nephesh</i>, or animal soul and body.<a name=333:29></a> If this last soul (here was their religion) was not spiritually

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My reader will now see why I have referred to all these views.<a name=334:3></a> We are now exactly on the ground of modern Annihilationists, and, as will be seen, of both classes of them; for they differed then as now.<a name=334:4></a> The mystic Rabbis say men who have only <i>nephesh</i> die simply.<a name=334:5></a> The <i>nephesh</i> goes down and remains in the grave: if it got united to the <i>ruach</i>, then it did not.<a name=334:6></a> "There is a garment," they said, "which subsists and which does not subsist, is seen and is not seen; with this the <i>psuche</i> [animal soul, or <i>nephesh] is</i> clothed.<a name=334:7></a>" But the <i>nephesh</i> was not for them immortal, and where this only was there, the life of the soul was in the blood, and, as an infidel would draw from Ecclesiastes, "That which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them.<a name=334:8></a> As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they all have one breath.<a name=334:9></a> So that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity.<a name=334:10></a> All go unto one place, all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.<a name=334:11></a>" That is, indeed, all that is seen "under the sun," as to "the life of our vanity.<a name=334:12></a>" The Positivists, as one class of infidels are called, go no farther.<a name=334:13></a> They have not the sense to add with the Preacher, "Who knoweth the spirit of man?<a name=334:14></a> it goeth up on high; and the spirit of the beast?<a name=334:15></a> it goeth downward to the earth.<a name=334:16></a>" So one modern class believe death is simple death -- ceasing to exist.<a name=334:17></a> If a man has not received the divine life, the <i>neshama</i>, his <i>nephesh</i> dies with his body like a beast.<a name=334:18></a> They have answered the "Who knoweth?<a name=334:19></a>" of the Preacher -- have taken, as the Positivists, the ignorance they are in as a proof that there is nothing beyond it.<a name=334:20></a> The beast ceases to exist, and so does the man; <i>nephesh is</i> all one has, <i>nephesh is</i> all the other has, both go to dust alike.<a name=334:21></a> They lie in the hell like sheep: death gnaws upon them.<a name=334:22></a> The mystic Rabbis are found again and the ancient Gnostics.<a name=334:23></a> The <i>nephesh</i> has not put on the <i>enduma apstharsias</i>, the garment of incorruptibility and immortality.<a name=334:24></a> It has gone down under death, and there it lies.<a name=334:25></a> So in the Clementinae, 3: <i>20</i> (early Gnostic writings pretending to be Clement's), on Genesis 2: 7, he attributes to the breath of God, <i>Theou pnoe</i>, as an indescribable clothing of the <i>psuche</i>, its being able to be immortal.<a name=334:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I shall be told that all do not hold this.<a name=334:27></a> They believe in resurrection, judgment, punishment, and then destruction, or, if preferred, as one of their teachers once put it, "the soul will lose its personality and individuality and pass off into its elements; for nothing is ever annihilated.<a name=334:28></a>"

		But the scripture rejects the thought of the soul's not living distinct from the body, where it uses <i>nephesh</i> properly for the soul of a man, as it does (see 1 Kings 17: 21, 22), where Elijah prays that the child's soul may return to him again, and the Lord heard him and it returned.<a name=337:9></a> On the contrary, but proving the same point, Paul says of Eutychus, "his soul is in him.<a name=337:10></a>" (Acts 20.<a name=337:11></a>) What the creation, therefore, affords us is the most careful elaborate distinction between man and other animals: they, by God's will, springing up out of the earth to live by breathing, and being <i>nephesh chaia</i>, a living individual being with a body having breath, <i>neshama</i>, and a <i>ruach</i>, a life which lived by breathing; man having all this too, as every one on the face of the earth knows, without knowing Hebrew at all.<a name=337:12></a> But it teaches us that man got to be such on the earth in a totally different way from other living animals, namely, by God's breathing from Himself into him, when He had formed his body of the dust, a breath of life, and thus he became a living soul.<a name=337:13></a> Hence he was the offspring <i>genos</i>, offspring, race, kind, generation, is the only true meaning of this word, and it is so used in Acts 17) of God, lived and moved and had his being in Him, and was in responsible relationship with Him, intelligently subject to a law, and alas!<a name=337:14></a> not only disobedient, but capable of hating God, of such an apprehension of Him as ought to have drawn out love, but from his moral state brought out hatred; capable of receiving communications from God as in nature and place in relationship with Him; and that he has, in fact, received these communications, and God has dealt with him as acceptable, if good, or, if sinful, the object of a provided sin-offering when in that natural state, no question of the gift of eternal life having been raised.<a name=337:15></a> The whole scripture proceeds on

		What light may be thrown on the final result by the New Testament is another question.<a name=341:8></a> But in Ezekiel what is spoken of is a man belonging to this world dying in his sins.<a name=341:9></a> Death never means ceasing to exist.<a name=341:10></a> It is used for other things than physical death.<a name=341:11></a> The woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.<a name=341:12></a> The believer has passed from death unto life.<a name=341:13></a> He who loves the brethren has passed from death unto life.<a name=341:14></a> That is, when applied to the soul, it has nothing to do with ceasing to exist, but separation of the soul from God, as a state of a soul which was alive as to existence, not possessing divine life, but as much alive as a being as when he had.<a name=341:15></a> So Romans 7 (10, and verse 24) teaches us the same truth.<a name=341:16></a> Paul found the commandment to be to death; but he was just as much alive, as to existence, as ever.<a name=341:17></a> The sin unto death is physical death.<a name=341:18></a> In a word, death means either simple physical death as we see it, or separation from God -- not having divine life -- when a man is alive.<a name=341:19></a>

		We have now to see if physical death is the extinction, or even the sleep, of the soul.<a name=341:20></a> And, further, we must search the New Testament, where these things are brought to light.<a name=341:21></a> First, it is stated that all live to God.<a name=341:22></a> This is given as a general principle, when the living state of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is declared to the Sadducees, <i>who held annihilation doctrine</i>.<a name=341:23></a> God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<a name=341:24></a> Thus far it may be reasoned that it only applies to the saints, whose God God is.<a name=341:25></a> The Lord therefore adds "For all live unto him.<a name=341:26></a>" It is a general truth, not merely applicable to Abraham and those that had his faith.<a name=341:27></a> It is true of all: <i>pantes gar auto zosin</i>.<a name=341:28></a> And this, the more important because the Lord is speaking of saints.<a name=341:29></a> For, though they were born of God, He does not rest the truth of even <i>their</i> being alive on that, but says "God is not the God of <i>nechron</i>, but of <i>zonton</i>" -- not of dead men or bodies, but of living persons.<a name=341:30></a>

		It is alleged, I have been told since I wrote this, that there is another view held, namely, that the soul, having its life in Christ, is in Christ when a man dies, and is, so to speak, lost in Him, and then at the resurrection becomes a conscious person again.<a name=347:19></a> This is a mere notion and a foolish one too.<a name=347:20></a> It destroys, not consciousness nor has anything to do with sleeping, but personality.<a name=347:21></a> It applies only to saints, and as to them is in direct violation of the testimony of scripture, which attributes personality to the saints when gone hence.<a name=347:22></a> "To-day shalt thou be with me.<a name=347:23></a>" There are the distinct persons present with the Lord.<a name=347:24></a> There must be a distinct person to be present with the Lord.<a name=347:25></a> And so with other texts.<a name=347:26></a> That our life is hid with Christ in God (the only allusion to an idea approaching it in scripture) proves, as far as it goes, the contrary; because it is spoken of saints living on the earth, where their personality is unquestionable.<a name=347:27></a> But the best

		ON RECONCILIATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reconciliation is, to use familiar language, making all straight; and even primarily, I believe, used in money-changing as that which makes the sum even, so that there is satisfaction of the parties in the matter; and thence passing into the more ordinary sense of making all smooth between alienated parties, and reconciling one who is alienated or at enmity.<a name=350:1></a> But it is not simply the change of mind from the enmity, though that be included; nor is it justification.<a name=350:2></a> It is the bringing back to unity, peace, and fellowship what was divided and alienated.<a name=350:3></a> We must not confound in scripture "making reconciliation for the sins of the people" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:17">Hebrews  2:17</a>), with "reconciliation" in 2 Corinthians 5; Colossians 1; Romans 5: 10, 11.<a name=350:4></a> The former is making propitiation, atonement, <i>ilaschesthai</i> and <i>ilasmos</i>, propitiation (1 John 2: 2); while on the contrary "atonement" in Romans 5: 11 should be <i>reconciliation, chatallage</i>.<a name=350:5></a> Compare <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:11">1 Corinthians  7:11</a>, "Let her be reconciled to her husband;" where it is not merely her mind being restored to affection and good feeling, but matters made straight between them -- the relationship made good.<a name=350:6></a> So it is between us and God; but the alienation was on our part.<a name=350:7></a> It was not <i>alienation</i> on God's part, but righteous judgment against sin in His creature, and that righteousness must be met in order to bring back the alienated creature into relationship with God.<a name=350:8></a> Only now it is much more than bringing back, because of the purposes of God in Christ, and the infinite value of the work by which we are brought back to God.<a name=350:9></a> Still it is an establishing a blessed and peaceful relationship with God, and us in it.<a name=350:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reconciling God to us is quite unscriptural in expression and thought.<a name=350:11></a> No act of dealing could change God's mind, either in nature or in purpose; but He acts freely in what is before Him according to that nature, and in bringing about that purpose; and though His mind be not changed, yet the meeting, satisfying, and glorifying His righteousness, is according to that mind and the imperious claim of His nature and authority -- is necessary in the highest sense, that is, according to that nature.<a name=350:12></a> His holiness too is involved in reconciliation.<a name=350:13></a> Reconciliation is the full establishment in relationship with God according to His nature and according to the nature of that which is reconciled.<a name=350:14></a> It now acts in redemption and a new nature, and, as regards all around us, a new state of things, so that it is more than reestablishment.<a name=350:15></a> It is re-established inasmuch as the old relationship

		was broken and forfeited, but it is not the returning to that but the establishing a new one which has the stability of redemption and is the accomplishment of the purpose of God.<a name=351:1></a> Still it is a bringing back into the enjoyment of divine favour that which had lost it.<a name=351:2></a> This reconciliation is twofold in scripture -- of the state of things, and of sinners.<a name=351:3></a> Thus in Colossians 1 all the fulness was pleased to dwell in Him, "and, having made peace by the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, whether they be things on earth or things in heaven; and you, that were sometime enemies and alienated in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight.<a name=351:4></a>" The force of the word is evident from the first case.<a name=351:5></a> Then there is no question of changing the disposition of the reconciled things, because the purposed reconciliation spoken of in verse 20 refers to all created things as to the vast majority of which no such change can take place.<a name=351:6></a> It is the bringing of the whole created scene of heaven and earth into its true order and right relationship with God, and to its right standing and condition in that relationship.<a name=351:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first passage which suggests itself, when we come to enquire into the use of the word in scripture, is 2 Corinthians 5: 18-20, particularly verse 19: "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.<a name=351:8></a>" It is not God is in Christ reconciling.<a name=351:9></a> The passage states that the apostolic ministry had taken the place of Christ's personal ministry, founded on the blessed Lord having been made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=351:10></a> It is the aspect of Christ's ministry down here.<a name=351:11></a> God was in Him reconciling the world.<a name=351:12></a> Man would not have Him, but this was the service and aspect of His ministry.<a name=351:13></a> He was proposing to the world a return to God in order and blessing, not imputing their trespasses to them.<a name=351:14></a> If man had received Him, it would have proved that man in the flesh was recoverable, though he had sinned; though such indeed was not God's thought, the result proved he was not, and the Lord had to be made sin for us.<a name=351:15></a> Man had to be redeemed out of the state he was in, and justified on a new footing, not recovered from his ruin as man in the flesh still.<a name=351:16></a> Lawlessness and ease had both proved men sinners in fact.<a name=351:17></a> God was in Christ saying, I am not come to judge: return, and I will forgive; return to order and to God and nothing will be imputed.<a name=351:18></a> But the mind of the flesh was enmity against God, and the true state of man was brought out.<a name=351:19></a>

		The sin of the world was demonstrated by their not believing in Christ; righteousness, in their seeing Him no more and His going to His Father.<a name=352:1></a> No doubt a change in us is needed to our being in order and peace before God; but reconciling is more than a state of feeling, it is a being brought back to the condition of right relationship with God.<a name=352:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Colossians 1 already quoted, we find it the purpose of God to bring all things in heaven and earth into this order and condition.<a name=352:3></a> All things were created by the Son and for Him, and all the fulness of the Godhead which dwelt in Him will bring all created by and for Him into its due condition and order, into a normal state of relationship with itself.<a name=352:4></a> But we, the apostle adds, are reconciled, Christ being our righteousness, and we the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=352:5></a> We are, as regards the very nature of God, in our normal place with God, according to the efficacy of Christ's work.<a name=352:6></a> Being moral beings, a new mind was needed for this, and Christ is our life, perfect according to what He was for God, that we may have it.<a name=352:7></a> The believer is reconciled in the body of Christ's flesh through death.<a name=352:8></a> We are before God with the entire putting away in His sight of our old rebellious nature, and by a work and obedience which has perfectly glorified God Himself, so that we are the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=352:9></a> Nothing is wanting to our place and standing in Christ: our old state being gone, quickened together with Him; dead, and the old man put off; risen, and the new man put on, we are in Christ before God, according to the efficacy of His propitiation and work.<a name=352:10></a> We are so consciously by faith and the presence of the Holy Ghost by which we are sealed, for our being presented "holy, unblamable, and unreprovable in his sight.<a name=352:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, in Romans 5: 10, reconciliation is attributed to Christ's death; not to a change of mind in us.<a name=352:12></a> "If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.<a name=352:13></a>" And, "We have received the reconciliation.<a name=352:14></a>" (verse 11.<a name=352:15></a>) Remark here that the Christian is spoken of as being reconciled.<a name=352:16></a> Now it is quite true this does not and cannot take place without a work in man by which the peace Christ has made is appropriated, it cannot take place without faith.<a name=352:17></a> The Spirit of Christ works in quickening power in us, makes us know our state, gives new desires, makes us judge our old state, and finally shews us the value of Christ's death and our standing in Him; but peace was made, God glorified perfectly when Christ was made sin, so that His love can seek us and grace reign through righteousness.<a name=352:18></a> It is not that God is

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one passage which remains of these wherein the word is used, which has to be considered; but rightly apprehended, it confirms and clears the sense given.<a name=353:7></a> "If the casting them away be the reconciling of the world.<a name=353:8></a>" (Romans 11: 15.<a name=353:9></a>) Now the sense is more vague here, it is true, but it confirms what we have said.<a name=353:10></a> The Jews had been in ordered relationship with God though unfaithful to it, the world out of all relationship, men were utterly without God in the world, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope, without God in the world.<a name=353:11></a> On the fall of Israel this state of things ceased.<a name=353:12></a> God now called all persons everywhere to repent.<a name=353:13></a> God took up the world again, no longer winking at the ignorance.<a name=353:14></a> The world was again put in relationship with God, so that His grace and gospel went out to deal with it as that which thus far stood in relationship with Him, not as it did when Judaism was owned.<a name=353:15></a> These are all the passages where the word is used.<a name=353:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of two resurrections -- a first and a second -- has been treated of occasionally, in connection with the coming of the Lord, in more than one of the papers on that subject.<a name=355:1></a> But its importance, and the way in which unscriptural views on it mislead the mind as to the gospel itself, seem to me to call for a distinct paper on the point.<a name=355:2></a> The doctrine of a first resurrection does connect itself with the truth of our complete salvation in Christ, the part we have with Himself in glory and blessing, and with His coming again; and this will appear in the following lines; but my object now is to give the scriptural view of this particular subject.<a name=355:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He may be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=355:8></a> This is the full result of God's purpose as to us.<a name=355:9></a> This is evidently in our resurrection state.<a name=355:10></a> Hence we are raised in glory.<a name=355:11></a> Upon the face of it this shews that our resurrection is in its nature wholly distinct from that of the wicked, who are yet to be judged.<a name=355:12></a> It is, as to our present state, the full result of redemption, in which the wicked have no part whatever, but quite the contrary.<a name=355:13></a> It is not what leads to the decision of the state we are to be in by a judgment to be pronounced, but our being, by the power of God, in the state which the unspeakable grace of redemption has made ours.<a name=355:14></a> This single point at once shews the great importance of this question.<a name=355:15></a>

		The tenor of 1 Corinthians 15 applies only to believers, and more than that distinctly states that they <i>only</i> will rise when Christ comes.<a name=357:9></a> The resurrection described is the resurrection of the saints.<a name=357:10></a> "It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.<a name=357:11></a>" This clearly applies only to believers.<a name=357:12></a> The resurrection he is speaking of applies to believers only.<a name=357:13></a> So it is said, "Death is swallowed up in victory.<a name=357:14></a>" It is that act of power which causes us to bear the image of the heavenly (verses 42, 43, 49, 54).<a name=357:15></a> Nothing can be clearer than that it is a description of the resurrection of the saints.<a name=357:16></a> But more than this, the order of the resurrection is formally spoken of, and the wicked left out; and more than that (verses 20 and onward), "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.<a name=357:17></a>" Christ is not the firstfruits of the wicked adjudged to condemnation.<a name=357:18></a> But further, "Every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then they that are Christ's at his coming.<a name=357:19></a>" That is, when the order of resurrection is specifically declared, those only who are Christ's are declared to rise at His coming, those of whom He is the firstfruits.<a name=357:20></a> The end comes afterwards, "when he shall have delivered up the kingdom.<a name=357:21></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#357:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>In John 5 in the English version it is "damnation." This surely it will be, but the word is judgment. Much as we have to be thankful for, in general, in the English version, it is well it should be remembered that their avowed practice was, when the same word occurred often in a sentence, to translate it by different ones. Thus in John 5: 22, 24, 27, 29, we have "judgment," "condemnation," "judgment," "damnation." In all it is the same word, *krisis* "judgment;" a special way of shewing Christ's authority. Every one will feel the importance of this on only reading the passage.

		That is, we have a distinct revelation of the order of the resurrection, in which we are taught that those that are Christ's will rise when He comes, those of whom He is the firstfruits, who are to bear His image.<a name=358:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is fully confirmed in the book of Revelation (chapter 20), where we learn that at the end, when the wicked dead, who had not part in the first resurrection, are to stand before the throne, and the books are opened, and they are judged out of the things written in them, Christ does not come at all.<a name=358:2></a> One sits on the great white throne, and heaven and earth flee away from before His face.<a name=358:3></a> That is, He does not come at all.<a name=358:4></a>

		Turn now to 1 Thessalonians 4 where, again, we have direct instruction on the point.<a name=358:5></a> "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout .<a name=358:6></a>.<a name=358:7></a>.<a name=358:8></a> and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<a name=358:9></a>" The changed saints are associated with the raised to go and meet the Lord and be for ever with Him, as in 1 Corinthians 15: 51, 52; but it is only the dead in Christ, or living saints changed.<a name=358:10></a> Grace and faith had made the separation and make it, not judgment.<a name=358:11></a> Jesus comes to fetch them to be with Him for ever; and when He does that, He changes the body of their humiliation and fashions it like the body of His glory.<a name=358:12></a> (Philippians 3.<a name=358:13></a>) It is quite certain all this applies to the saints only, the wicked have no part in this resurrection.<a name=358:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Such then is the formal doctrine of the word; namely, that grace makes the separation here between the wicked and believers, and that Christ at His coming raises the just to have a part with Him.<a name=358:15></a>

		Remark how (in 1 Corinthians 15) the saints are associated with Christ.<a name=358:16></a> If we are not raised, Christ is not, says the apostle and insists on it.<a name=358:17></a> We are so connected that you cannot separate the two cases.<a name=358:18></a> If He is not raised, we are in our sins; clearly shewing that if He is, we are not.<a name=358:19></a> In the Adam all die; in the Christ all are made alive.<a name=358:20></a> Those connected with each of the two heads and the heads themselves have respectively the same portion.<a name=358:21></a> Christ is the firstfruits of those that are fallen asleep.<a name=358:22></a> As is the heavenly, such are the heavenly; and we shall bear the image of the heavenly.<a name=358:23></a> All this teaches, not a mixing up saints and unjust for judgment to distinguish, but the blessed truth of the association of the saints with Christ, and apart from the wicked.<a name=358:24></a>

		Let me add here that resurrection "from the dead" and "of the dead" are not confounded in scripture.<a name=365:10></a> Resurrection of the dead is a great general doctrine that the dead will rise, not be left in the grave.<a name=365:11></a> Resurrection from the dead (or, as it might be more clearly expressed, resurrection from among the dead) is taking some out from among others who are left behind, because of the perfect divine favour resting on the first, which does not on the others; so that the former are raised in glory to be with and like Christ for ever.<a name=365:12></a> It is evident that this is quite a different thought and truth from a supposed general resurrection to judgment.<a name=365:13></a> We are dissociated from the wicked and completely associated with Christ.<a name=365:14></a> At the same time it leaves all the great foundation <a name=366>[Page 366]</a>

		The value of the atonement, the complete efficacy of redemption, Christ being our life, our having received the Holy Ghost -- the value of these things comes out into much fuller relief.<a name=366:2></a> That we are risen with Christ, associated and identified with Him, stands out in its full and simple and scriptural force, instead of being practically set aside by mixing us up with the unbelieving mass who have rejected Him and come into judgment.<a name=366:3></a> The connection of Christ with His people is clearer, while His divine oneness with the Father, and similar foundation truths, remain at the foundation of all as ever.<a name=366:4></a> His humanity shines out clearer than ever through our connection with Him.<a name=366:5></a> The immortality of the soul retains all its vital importance, and the happy intermediate state of departed souls of believers is brought out more distinctly.<a name=366:6></a> For if the saints are to be subject to a judgment at the end to decide their state, how can they have been in heaven with Christ meanwhile?<a name=366:7></a> How take Paul, who has been 1800 years with Christ, to have it decided whether he is to be with Him?<a name=366:8></a> Whereas, if the resurrection of the saints is not that, but is the adding a glorified body by Christ's power to a blessed spirit, that is simple enough.<a name=366:9></a> The spirit departs and is with Christ, as scripture abundantly and clearly teaches; in due time the body will be raised glorious, and we shall be conformed to the image of the Son, bear His image, and be like Him in glory.<a name=366:10></a> To depart and be with Christ is far better; but we await His coming to have a glorious body.<a name=366:11></a> The first resurrection from among the dead (the only one which scripture recognizes of saints) associates the affections, the faith, the hope of the Christian, with Christ -- the greatest blessing we can have in this world.<a name=366:12></a>

		A striking instance of the effect of the thought of judgment according to scripture will be found in <i>2</i> Corinthians 5.<a name=379:4></a> The apostle first looks at the proper portion of the saint, not as death and judgment, or even death and happiness.<a name=379:5></a> It is mortality being swallowed up of life, the mortal body being changed into glory, without death's necessarily intervening at all.<a name=379:6></a> But death and judgment are fallen man's portion; and if death did thus intervene, confidence remained unmoved, for he had divine life, and, if he were absent from the body, he would be present with the Lord.<a name=379:7></a> Then he considers judgment, calls it the terror of the Lord, looks it fully in the face, knows it, states we shall all be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ; and then, what-trembles or thinks of himself?<a name=379:8></a> In no wise; he persuades men.<a name=379:9></a> Its terror produces no effect of terror at all on his own mind.<a name=379:10></a> It was a judgment which, as such, affected others.<a name=379:11></a> It had however a powerful influence on his heart and conscience.<a name=379:12></a> Others were not free as he was.<a name=379:13></a> And the thought of that day stirs up the love of Christ constrainingly, and he persuades men who were not ready for it; but then, secondly, it brings him into God's judgment as a present thing in a sanctifying way.<a name=379:14></a> We <i>are</i>, says he (not shall be), manifested to God.<a name=379:15></a> And this is a most important effect; nothing more, practically, than bringing us into the presence of God to judge ourselves, and to do so as to good and evil, as it will be judged of in that day.<a name=379:16></a> Such then was the effect on Paul: no terror for him in that day of terror, but a stimulus to his seeking unconverted sinners, and keeping his soul in the presence and fear of God.<a name=379:17></a>
