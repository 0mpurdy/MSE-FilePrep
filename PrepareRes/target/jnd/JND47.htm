		The epistle to the Colossians looks at the Christian as risen with Christ, but not, as in that to the Ephesians, as sitting in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=1:1></a> A hope is laid up for him in heaven; he is to set his affections on things above, not on things on the earth.<a name=1:2></a> He has died with Christ and he is risen with Him, but not sitting in heavenly places in Him yet.<a name=1:3></a> We have in it a proof of that which other epistles demonstrate, namely, the blessed way in which our God in His grace turns everything to the good of those that love Him.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Ephesians the Holy Ghost had developed the counsels of God with regard to the church -- its privileges.<a name=1:5></a> The Christians of Ephesus had nothing to be reproached with:(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:1">footnote</a></i>) therefore the Holy Ghost could use the occasion furnished by that faithful flock to unfold all the privileges which God had ordained for the church at large, by virtue of its union with Jesus Christ its Head, as well as the individual privileges of the children of God.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not so with the Colossians.<a name=1:7></a> They had in some measure slipped away from this blessed portion, and lost the sense of their union with the Head of the body; at least, if it was not actually so, they were assailed by the danger, and liable to the influence of those who sought to draw them away from it, and subject them to the influence of philosophy and Judaism, so that the apostle had to occupy himself with the danger, and not merely with their privileges.<a name=1:8></a> This union with our Head thank God!<a name=1:9></a>) cannot itself be lost; but as a truth in the church, or of realisation by individuals, it may.<a name=1:10></a> We know this but too well in the church of the day we live in.<a name=1:11></a> This however gives occasion to the Spirit of God to develop all the riches and all the perfection which are found in the Head and in His work, in order to recover the members of the body from their spiritual feebleness, or maintain them in the full practical enjoyment of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		their union with Christ, and in the power of the position gained for them by that union.<a name=2:1></a> For us this is abiding instruction with regard to the riches that are in the Head.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the epistle to the Ephesians delineates the privileges of the body, that to the Colossians reveals the fulness that is in the Head, and our completeness in Him.<a name=2:3></a> Thus in that to the Ephesians the church is the fulness of Him who filleth all in all; in that to the Colossians, all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, and we are complete in Him.<a name=2:4></a> There is another difference however, which it is important to remark.<a name=2:5></a> In the epistle to the Colossians we do not -- save in the expression, "love in the Spirit" -- find any mention of the Holy Ghost.<a name=2:6></a> He is fully brought forward in the Ephesians.<a name=2:7></a> But on the other hand, we have Christ as our life far more fully developed, of equal importance in its place.<a name=2:8></a> In Ephesians we have more largely the contrast of heathenism with christian privilege and state.<a name=2:9></a> The formation of the soul in living likeness to Christ is largely developed in Colossians.<a name=2:10></a> It is more, in the well-known expressions, Christ in us than we in Christ, though these cannot be separated.<a name=2:11></a> A further important difference is that in Ephesians the unity of Jew and Gentile in one body holds a large place.<a name=2:12></a> In Colossians the Gentiles only are in view, though in connection with the doctrine of the body.<a name=2:13></a> These differences well noted, we may say that the two epistles have a great resemblance in their general character.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They commence in nearly the same way.<a name=2:15></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:2">footnote</a></i>) Both are written from Rome, while the apostle was a prisoner in that city, and sent by the same messenger and on the same occasion, as well probably as that to Philemon: so the names and salutations give us reason to believe.<a name=2:16></a> The address to the Ephesians places them perhaps more immediately in connection with God Himself, instead of presenting them as in brotherly communion on earth.<a name=2:17></a> They are not called brethren in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:1">Ephesians  1:1</a>, only saints and faithful in Christ Jesus.<a name=2:18></a> They are viewed as walking on earth in Colossians, though risen.<a name=2:19></a> Hence there is a long prayer for their walk, though on high and holy ground as delivered.<a name=2:20></a> In Ephesians it begins with the full purpose and fruit of God's counsels.<a name=2:21></a> In that epistle the apostle's heart expands at once in the sense of the blessings enjoyed by the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians.<a name=3:1></a> They were blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ.<a name=3:2></a> For the Colossians there was a hope laid up in heaven.<a name=3:3></a> And there is a preface of many verses referring to the gospel they had heard, and introducing his prayer for their walk and state down here.<a name=3:4></a> This brings us where <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:7">Ephesians  1:7</a> brings us, but with a much more enlarged development of the personal glory of Christ, and more in an historical way of God's actual dealings.<a name=3:5></a> It is also a more personal church address than the Ephesians.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us consider more closely that which is said to the Colossians.<a name=3:7></a> The blessed calling of which the apostle speaks (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a> - 10), and the privileges of the inheritance (11 - 14), are wanting in Colossians; risen but on earth, they are not sitting in heavenly places, all things being thus their inheritance.<a name=3:8></a> It is not they in Christ there, but Christ in them the hope of glory, and the prayer referred to above fills up the chapter till we come to the common ground of Christ's glory in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:15">Colossians  1:15</a>; and even here the divine glory of Christ is brought out in Colossians, the simple fact of the purpose of God as to Christ in Ephesians.<a name=3:9></a> And not only we have not God's inheritance ours; but in Colossians the Spirit as earnest of it is not spoken of.<a name=3:10></a> This indeed we have seen is characteristic of Colossians.<a name=3:11></a> The Spirit is not spoken of, but life.<a name=3:12></a> We have the Person and divine glory of Christ, and our completeness in Him, more insisted on in Colossians; but not the saints' place with God in the same way.<a name=3:13></a> Further, as the saint is looked at as on earth, not in Christ on high, his responsibility is brought in (chapter 1: 23).<a name=3:14></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:3">Colossians  1:3</a> answers to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:16">Ephesians  1:16</a>: only one feels that there is more fulness in the joy of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:16">Ephesians  1:16</a>.<a name=3:15></a> Faith in Christ and love to all saints are found in each exordium, as the occasion of the writer's joy.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of his prayer is quite different.<a name=3:17></a> In the Ephesians, where he develops the counsels of God with regard to the church, he prays that the saints may understand them, as well as the power by means of which they participated in them.<a name=3:18></a> Here he prays that their walk may be guided by divine intelligence.<a name=3:19></a> But this belongs to another cause, to the point of view from which, in his discourse, he looks at the saints.<a name=3:20></a> We have seen that in the epistle to the Ephesians, he views them as sitting in the heavenlies.<a name=3:21></a> Their inheritance consequently is that of all things which are to be gathered together under Christ as Head.<a name=3:22></a> Here he prays for them in view of a hope laid
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		up for them in heaven; his prayer therefore refers to their walk, that it may be in harmony with the object which they had set before them.<a name=4:1></a> As on earth and in danger of not adhering to the Head, the believers in Colosse were in danger of departing from that object.<a name=4:2></a> He prayed therefore in view of that heavenly hope.<a name=4:3></a> They had heard of this perfect and glorious hope.<a name=4:4></a> The gospel had proclaimed it everywhere.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was this gospel preached in view of a hope laid up in heaven which had produced fruit among men, fruit that was characterised by its heavenly source.<a name=4:6></a> Their religion, that which governed their heart in these relationships with God, was heavenly.<a name=4:7></a> The Colossians were in danger of falling back into the current of ordinances, and of the religious customs of man living in the world, whose religion was in connection with the world in which he dwelt, and not enlightened, not filled with heavenly light.<a name=4:8></a> There is nothing but conscious union with Christ which can keep us securely there.<a name=4:9></a> Ordinances to reach Him can have no place where we are united to Him; the philosophy of human thoughts none, where we possess livingly divine ones in Christ.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless how precious it is -- even if we are not in the full height of our calling -- to have an object set before our hearts which delivers us from this world, and from the influences which hide God from us!<a name=4:11></a> Such is the apostle's object in this scripture.<a name=4:12></a> He directs the eyes of the Colossians to heaven, in order that they may see Christ there, and regain that sense of their union with the Head which they had in some measure lost, or were in danger of losing.<a name=4:13></a> The groundwork was however there -- faith in Christ and love to all saints.<a name=4:14></a> They only needed realising their union with the Head; which moreover could alone maintain them in the heavenly element above ordinances, above human and earthly religion.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, in order to raise them up, sets out as usual from the point where he found good in the saints to whom he wrote.<a name=4:16></a> This heavenly hope had reached them and had produced fruit.<a name=4:17></a> It is this which distinguishes Christianity from all other religions, and in particular from the Jewish system, which -- although individuals who were in it by grace sighed for heaven -- hid God behind the veil, and enveloped the conscience in a series of ordinances at a distance from Him.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, based upon this hope which placed the inner life of the Christians in connection with heaven, the apostle prays
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the Colossians may be filled with the knowledge of the will God in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.<a name=5:1></a> It is the fruit of a risen man's connection with God on the earth.<a name=5:2></a> This is very different from commandments and ordinances.<a name=5:3></a> It is the fruit of intimate communion with God, of knowledge of His character and of His nature by virtue of this communion; and, although it refers to practical life, as belonging to the inner life, it leaves ordinances completely behind.<a name=5:4></a> The apostle had to begin at this practical end, at christian life.<a name=5:5></a> Perhaps the Colossians did not at first understand the bearing of these instructions, but they contained a principle which, already planted in their heart and capable of being re-awakened, led them to the point which the apostle aimed at, and was at the same time a very precious privilege, the value of which they were in a position to apprehend.<a name=5:6></a> Such is charity.<a name=5:7></a> The apostle develops their privileges in this respect with force and clearness, as one to whom such a walk was well known, and moreover with the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=5:8></a> They are not in heaven but on earth, and this is the path that suited those risen with Christ and looking to heaven from the earth.<a name=5:9></a> It is divine life on earth, not the Holy Ghost putting the soul of the believer at the centre of divine counsels, as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>through Christ dwelling in the heart by faith.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first principle of this practical heavenly life was the knowledge of the will of God -- to be filled with it, not to run after it as a thing without us, nor in indecision, in uncertainty, as to what it was, but to be filled with it by a principle of intelligence which comes from Him, and which forms the understanding and the wisdom of the Christian himself.<a name=5:11></a> The character of God was livingly translated in the appreciation of everything that the Christian did.<a name=5:12></a> And remark here that the knowledge of God's will is based on the spiritual state of the soul -- wisdom and spiritual understanding.<a name=5:13></a> And this is of all practical importance.<a name=5:14></a> No particular direction by man as to conduct meets this at all -- rather saves us from the need of spiritual understanding.<a name=5:15></a> No doubt a more spiritual mind may help me in the discernment of God's will;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:5">footnote</a></i>) but God has connected the discovery of the path of His will, His way, with the inward state of the soul, and causes us to pass through

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		circumstances -- human life here below -- to test and to discover to ourselves what that state is, and to exercise us therein.<a name=6:1></a> The Christian has by his spiritual state to know God's ways.<a name=6:2></a> The word is the means (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:17">John  17:17</a>, 19).<a name=6:3></a> God has a way of His own which the vulture's eye hath not seen, known only to the spiritual man, connected with, flowing from, and to, the knowledge of God (compare <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:13">Exodus  33:13</a>).<a name=6:4></a> Thus the Christian walks worthy of the Lord; he knows what becomes Him,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:6">footnote</a></i>) and walks accordingly, that he may please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by the knowledge of God.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not then only the character of life: this life was productive; it bore fruit, and, as life grew up, by increasing knowledge of God.<a name=6:6></a> But this connection with God brings in another very precious consideration.<a name=6:7></a> Besides the character and the living energy which are in relationship with this knowledge, the strength of the Lord(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:6">footnote</a></i>) is developed in it also.<a name=6:8></a> They draw strength from Him.<a name=6:9></a> He gives it that they might walk thus.<a name=6:10></a> "Strengthened", he says, "with all power, according to the might of his glory".<a name=6:11></a> Such is the measure of the Christian's strength for a life in harmony with the character of God.<a name=6:12></a> Thus the character of this life is revealed in the heavenly glory on high -- Jesus Christ.<a name=6:13></a> On earth its manifestation -- as it had been in Jesus Christ -- is realised in all patience and longsuffering with joy, in the midst of the sorrow and afflictions of the life of God in this world.<a name=6:14></a> This form of the life too is striking: all divine strength according to His glory given in order to be patient, to endure.<a name=6:15></a> What a character it gives to the Christian's life in this world!<a name=6:16></a> And there is a generous bearing with others which it enables us to maintain.<a name=6:17></a> Nor is anything a more manifest fruit of power than this.<a name=6:18></a> Will too is here subdued.<a name=6:19></a> Thus, in spite of all we have to endure, we have with God constant joy.<a name=6:20></a> It is a blessed picture of the form in which divine life manifests itself.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here the apostle connects this life of endurance with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The means employed, and the practical character of the work which sets us in the light, are then presented, introducing us (as far as Colossians does) into the counsels of God, but in a practical way -- in their results future or present, not in counsel nor as the mystery of His will.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father has delivered us from the power of darkness, and transported us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.<a name=7:8></a> It is not a Jewish rule for man; it is an operation of the power of God, who treats us as altogether by nature the slaves of Satan and of darkness; and places us by an act of that power in an entirely new position and relationship with Himself.<a name=7:9></a> We see indeed here, if we examine the principles in their origin, the same thing as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a>, 5; 2: 1 - 6, as to our position before.<a name=7:10></a> But it is evident that the fulness and definiteness of a new creation are wanting.<a name=7:11></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:7">footnote</a></i>) "The inheritance of the saints in light", "the kingdom of the Son of his love", remind us of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a>, 5; but it is not the thing itself, as it is in God's mind, but our having been made meet for it when here; nor consequently the development of a position with which one is familiar as standing in it.<a name=7:12></a> The power and the love of the Father have made us meet for it, and although the character of God is necessarily there as light and love, according to His

		In Ephesians deliverance is brought in as a consequence of the position in which the heirs, the objects of the eternal counsels of God, are seen.<a name=8:5></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:8">footnote</a></i>) Here deliverance is the chief subject.<a name=8:6></a> How dangerous and disastrous it is to depart from the Head and to lose the full consciousness, in the light, of our union with Him!<a name=8:7></a> How perfect and precious is that grace which takes notice of our condition, and brings us out of it to God, to make us enjoy -- according to the power and grace of God -- the inestimable position which He has given us in Christ!<a name=8:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, having thus introduced the Son in His relationship to the Father, as the central and mighty object which was to attract the heart of the Colossians and set them free from the yoke of ordinances, sketches now the different parts of the glory of that Person.<a name=9:2></a> If therefore the assembly's own glory is wanting, that of Jesus is so much the rather set in stronger relief before us.<a name=9:3></a> Thus God brings good out of evil, and in every way feeds His beloved people.<a name=9:4></a>

		The Lord Jesus is the image of the invisible God.<a name=9:5></a> It is in the Son of His love that we see what God is (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>; and also <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:2">1 John  1:2</a>).<a name=9:6></a> This is the first character of His personal glory, the essential centre of all the rest.<a name=9:7></a> Now, in consequence of this proper character of His Person, He takes by right the position of representing God in the creation.<a name=9:8></a> Adam was created in some sort in the image of God, and placed as centre in a creation that was subjected to him.<a name=9:9></a> But, after all, he was only a figure of the Christ, of Him who was to come.<a name=9:10></a> The Son, in His very Person, in His nature (and for us as in the bosom of the Father), is He who makes God known, because He presents Him in His own Person and in a full revelation of His being and of His character before men and in the whole universe; for all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Him.<a name=9:11></a> Nevertheless He is a man.<a name=9:12></a> He is thus seen of angels.<a name=9:13></a> We have seen Him with our eyes or by faith.<a name=9:14></a> Thus He is the image of the invisible God.<a name=9:15></a> The perfect character and living representation of the invisible God have been seen in Him.<a name=9:16></a> Wondrous truth for us with regard to the Person of our Saviour!<a name=9:17></a>

		But then what place can He have in creation when He has come into it according to the eternal counsels of God?<a name=9:18></a> He could have but one, namely, that of supremacy without contestation and without controversy.<a name=9:19></a> He is the firstborn of all creation; this is a relative name, not one of date with regard to time.<a name=9:20></a> It is said of Solomon, "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth".<a name=9:21></a> Thus the Creator, when He takes a place in creation, is necessarily its Head.<a name=9:22></a> He has not yet made good His rights, because in grace He would accomplish redemption.<a name=9:23></a> We are speaking of His rights -- rights which faith recognises.<a name=9:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with this admirable truth, it was a part of God's counsels that man should have dominion over all the works of His hands.<a name=10:8></a> Thus Christ, as man, has it by right and will take possession of it in fact.<a name=10:9></a> This part of the truth of which we are speaking is treated in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>; we shall consider it in its place.<a name=10:10></a> I introduce it here merely that we may understand the circumstances under which the Son takes possession The Spirit speaks of the One who is man, but the One who is at the same time Creator of all things, the Son of God.<a name=10:11></a> They were created by Him, they were necessarily then created also for Him.<a name=10:12></a>

		Thus we have a double ministry, as well as a double pre-eminence of Christ, and a double reconciliation; and each having a similar relationship the one to the other: Christ, the Head of all things in heaven and earth, the Head of the assembly; all things in heaven and earth are to be reconciled, Christians are reconciled; Paul exercises his ministry in the whole creation under heaven, he is the minister of the assembly.<a name=16:6></a> Naturally his ministry was limited to the earth.<a name=16:7></a> In every respect the extent and bearing of the glory of Christ, and of the ministry, went beyond the limits of Judaism, and were in contrast with the whole system.<a name=16:8></a>

		Now that Christ the Head of the assembly, the Head of the body, was glorified, the mystery of this body was made known.<a name=17:1></a> The apostle here dwells on one particular side of this subject, which, after the Person of Christ, forms the centre of all God's ways.<a name=17:2></a> This side is Christ in us, especially as Gentiles, the hope of glory.<a name=17:3></a> And in this again we see how the saints are viewed as on earth, though in the power of resurrection.<a name=17:4></a> The aspect here given of the mystery is, Christ in us down here, not union with Him actually in glory, though inseparable from that.<a name=17:5></a> In fact, this mystery was in every way a new thought, a new truth.<a name=17:6></a> That which was known was a Messiah who should be manifested among the Jews, the accomplishment of glory in their midst; the Gentiles at most having part in it, as subordinate to the people of God.<a name=17:7></a> But according to the doctrine of the assembly, Christ invisibly dwelt in the midst of the Gentiles,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:17">footnote</a></i>) and even in them; and as to the glory He was only the hope of it.<a name=17:8></a> A Christ dwelling in the hearts of men, and of men formerly rejected and outside the promises, and filling their hearts with joy and glory in the consciousness of union with Himself -- this was the wondrous mystery prepared of God for the blessing of the Gentiles.<a name=17:9></a> It was this Christ, a Christ such as this, whom Paul preached, warning every man, and teaching every man according to the full development of the wisdom of God, which wrought mightily in the apostle by the Spirit, in order that he might present every man in a spiritual state answering to this revelation of Christ, as being also its fruit.<a name=17:10></a> Not that every man would receive it; but there was no longer any limit.<a name=17:11></a> All distinction between them was blotted out, alike by sin and by grace, and there was but one thing to do; that is, to seek that every man, by the power of the word and the Spirit, should reflect Christ and grow up unto the stature of His fulness, as revealed in the doctrine committed to the apostle.<a name=17:12></a> He laboured for this according to the working of Christ in him; for Christ was not only the object, but the power that wrought to form souls after His own image.<a name=17:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle felt that it was this which they needed and which would be a blessing to them.<a name=18:2></a> He knew that union with Christ, realised in the heart, was a safeguard from the wiles of the enemy, to which the Colossians were exposed.<a name=18:3></a> He knew the unutterable value of this union, and even of its realisation by faith.<a name=18:4></a> He laboured, he wrestled in prayer -- for it is indeed a conflict -- in order that the full sense of this union with the glorious Head might be wrought in their hearts, so that the Christ on high should be in them by faith.<a name=18:5></a> All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge were found in the mystery, of which this was to their souls the centre and the power.<a name=18:6></a> They had not to seek elsewhere.<a name=18:7></a> Science, falsely so called, might pretend to furnish them with heights to which the simplicity of the doctrines of Christ did not reach; but in fact the wisdom of God and the depths of His counsels left these cloudy efforts of the human mind at an infinite distance.<a name=18:8></a> Moreover they were truth -- reality -- instead of being but the creatures of imagination inspired by the enemy.<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For this reason the apostle had brought forward these marvellous revelations of God respecting the double glory of Christ, and with regard to His Person.<a name=18:10></a> He declared them in order that no one should beguile the Colossians with enticing words.<a name=18:11></a> He avails himself of the order that existed among them, and of their faith to guard them against the danger they were in from these thoughts, which might glide unperceived into their minds, while all was yet going on well, and the consciousness of their faith was not touched.<a name=18:12></a> This often happens.<a name=18:13></a> People have faith in Christ, they walk well, they do not perceive that certain ideas overthrow that faith; they admit them, while still maintaining the profession of faith together with these ideas; but the force of the truth and the sense of union with Christ and the simplicity that is in Him are lost.<a name=18:14></a> The enemy has so far attained his end.<a name=18:15></a> That which is received is not the development of Christ, but something outside Him.<a name=18:16></a>

		To make these instructions more plain by shewing their connection, we may remark that the apostle points out the double danger, namely, philosophy, and human tradition, in contrast with Christ (chapter 2: 3; see verse 9 - 15).<a name=25:3></a> While identifying us with Christ, he speaks of the bearing of the work of Christ Himself rather than of this identification.<a name=25:4></a> In verses 16 - 19 he applies it first (verse 16) to subjection to ordinances, that is, to the Jewish side of their danger; and then (verse 18) to the Gnostic philosophy,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:25">footnote</a></i>) science falsely so called, which linked itself with Judaism (or to which Judaism linked itself), reproducing itself under a new form.<a name=25:5></a> From verse 20 the apostle applies our death and resurrection with Christ to the same points, or to the deliverance of the Colossians by raising their thoughts on high.<a name=25:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which follows judges it after our position.<a name=26:4></a> The preceding verses had demonstrated that the system was false, because Christ and His work were such as is declared in them.<a name=26:5></a> The passage we are going to consider shews that this system is absurd, cannot be applied to us, has no possible application, because of our position.<a name=26:6></a> On the one hand it is a false system, null and void in all its parts, if Christ is true and is in heaven and, on the other hand, it is an absurd system in its application to us, if we are Christians.<a name=26:7></a> And for this reason: it is a system which supposes life in this world, and relationships to be acquired with God, having their foundation in that life, while it pretends to mortify flesh; and yet in addresses itself to persons who, for faith, are dead.<a name=26:8></a> The apostle says, that we are dead to the rudiments of this world, to all the principles on which its life acts.<a name=26:9></a> Why then, as though we were still living (alive) in it, as though we were still alive in this world, do we subject ourselves to ordinances which have to do with this life and which suppose its existence?<a name=26:10></a> -- ordinances which apply to things which perish in the use of them, and which have no connection with that which is heavenly and eternal.<a name=26:11></a> They have indeed a semblance of humility and self-denial as regards the body, but they have no link with heaven, which is the sphere of the new life -- of all its motives, and all its development; and they do not recognise the honour of the creature, as a creature come out of the hand of God, which, as such, has always its place and its honour.<a name=26:12></a> They put a man in and under the flesh, while pretending to deliver us from it, and they separate the believer from Christ by putting angels between the soul and the heavenly place and blessing; whereas we are

	<div class="paragraph">
		These ordinances had to do with merely corruptible things -- were not connected with the new life, but with man living in his life of flesh on the earth, to which life the Christian is morally dead; and as far as regarded this life, they did not recognise the body as a creature of God, as it ought to be recognised.<a name=27:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the system of ordinances had lost Christ, who was their substance.<a name=27:3></a> It was connected with the pride that pretended to penetrate heaven, in order to put itself in relation with beings whom we do not know in such a manner as to have any relations with them -- pride which in so doing separated from the Head of the body, Christ, and thus disowned all connection with the source of life, and with the only true position of the soul before God.<a name=27:4></a> This system falsified equally our position on earth by treating us as though still alive after the old man, whereas we are dead; and dishonoured the creature as such, instead of recognising it as coming from the hand of God.<a name=27:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be remarked, that the apostle does not speak here of our union with Christ, but of our life, of the fact that we are dead, and that our life is hid with Him in God.<a name=28:10></a> He does not speak of the assembly with regard to our position; he speaks, no doubt, of Christ as being its Head, as to His personal glory, but not of it as to us.<a name=28:11></a> He speaks of us individually.<a name=28:12></a> Each one has his own life in Christ truly, but as his own; it is not union with other Christians.<a name=28:13></a> We have this life in Christ, but it is not here our union as one body with Him.<a name=28:14></a> It is the individual character of the Christian, to whom Christ, the Head, is everything.<a name=28:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which is also highly important to observe in connection with this truth is that in this epistle there is nothing said of the Holy Ghost.<a name=28:16></a> The apostle speaks practically of their love in the Spirit, but in the instruction of the epistle he does not name Him.<a name=28:17></a> Even when he says, "there is neither Jew, nor Greek", etc.<a name=28:18></a>, it is in the new man, not because we are one in Christ.<a name=28:19></a> The individual was to cleave to the Head.<a name=28:20></a> He was no longer living in this world; he was dead, and his life hid with Christ in God.<a name=28:21></a> But this was for himself; he was to know it, and hold it fast for himself, as necessary truth, that he might be preserved from the wiles of the enemy.<a name=28:22></a> In a word, it is life in Christ.<a name=28:23></a> Elsewhere we see many of the things which the apostle here mentions spoken of as the fruit of the Spirit, by which communion and union are maintained; but here it is simply in the nature of the life that these fruits have their source.<a name=28:24></a> It is quite natural consequently, that the compass and the assemblage

		of all spiritual relationships in one, in Christ, which we find in the divine instruction when the Holy Ghost is introduced, are wanting here.<a name=29:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Ephesians this operation of the Holy Ghost is found everywhere, and characterises the whole of that which is developed in communion with the Head, Christ, with whom we are united in one body by the Spirit.<a name=29:2></a> Thus we are individually sealed by the Spirit of promise, the earnest of our inheritance; we all have access to the Father by one Spirit; we are also builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit; the union of the Gentiles in one body is now revealed by the Spirit; saints are strengthened by the Spirit in the inner man; there is one body and one Spirit; we are not to grieve the Spirit; we are to be filled with Him; the word itself is the sword of the Spirit.<a name=29:3></a> The union of the body with Christ, our resurrection with Him, that we are sitting in the heavenlies in Him -- all that flows from this union, is fully developed; but at the same time the Holy Ghost, who unites us to Him, and unites us all together as one body, and who here below characterises the presence of God in the church, who acts in us, secures our future, and becomes our strength in the present -- the Holy Ghost, I repeat, is found everywhere, to complete the truth and to give it its present force for us here below.<a name=29:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many of the exhortations in the epistle to the Ephesians are nearly the same as those to the Colossians.<a name=29:5></a> But in the epistle to the Ephesians they are connected with the Spirit; in that to the Colossians, with the action of the word and of grace in the heart.<a name=29:6></a> This gives an immense range and a connectedness to the doctrine of the epistle to the Ephesians, in that which regards our position here below, because it brings in God Himself, and as dwelling in us by the Spirit, and filling us, whether as in the individual or in the oneness of the body; and gives the full scope of the counsels of God.<a name=29:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet the possession of life is in its way as important as the presence and indwelling of the Holy Ghost.<a name=29:8></a> It makes the blessing ourselves, not merely an operation in us, and, as we have seen, the character of divine life is far more fully developed; whereas in Ephesians it is more contrast with the previous state.<a name=29:9></a>

		This character of the Colossians however, the dwelling on life or the new man, has its value for us all, and a great value, because the life, the new nature, and grace working in it, are much less brought forward in the epistle to the Ephesians, where the subject is the energy of God, who creates men in Christ and unites them to Him, fills the believer and the assembly here with the nature and the character of the new man.<a name=31:1></a> and thereby of Christ, yea, of God Himself.<a name=31:2></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:31">footnote</a></i>) One might suppose that there was only the Holy Ghost acting in the fulness of His power, and filling the individual and the assembly.<a name=31:3></a> But in this epistle to the Colossians we find that there is a new nature, an intrinsic change, not of the flesh indeed, but of the man.<a name=31:4></a> For we are viewed, not merely as quickened by the Son, but as dead and risen with Christ, the Man who had died, so as to have passed out of -- put off -- the old standing of a child of Adam, and into a risen one with Christ -- put on the new man.<a name=31:5></a> This is at once a standing and a state before God, a source of tastes, of sentiments, of desires, of arguments, and of moral capacities, which are in connection with the very nature of God, who has caused it to spring up in the heart.<a name=31:6></a> We are renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created us.<a name=31:7></a> But this source is a life, which needs that the Holy Ghost should reveal to it the objects that are suited to it, and that awaken these tastes and feelings, which satisfy them and cause them to grow.<a name=31:8></a> It needs that the Spirit of God should act in it to give it strength; but it is a real life, a nature which has its tastes attached to its

		Neither is it unimportant that we should learn, with regard to the life of the flesh, and when thinking of it, although it be on the negative side, that we are dead; that God recognises nothing belonging to the old man; that He takes pleasure in a new nature, which is indeed ours by grace, but which is of God Himself, and which is the moral reflection of His own.<a name=32:2></a>

		Before Christianity, which is the full revelation of God, there were indeed, as need not be said, souls born anew; but their rule, when a rule was definitely given, was man's responsibility (whatever piety and grace might inspire), and the law, which was the perfect measure of that which man, as a being responsible to God, ought to be.<a name=33:4></a> Saints then did not distinguish between a new and an old man, although of necessity they had the conscience of the old man and the tastes of the new in measure in many respects.<a name=33:5></a> The sense, for instance, of the evil of falsehood had not at all the same place as with the Christian.<a name=33:6></a> Now the new man is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who created him.<a name=33:7></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:33">footnote</a></i>) God Himself in His nature is the standard of good and evil, because the new man has the knowledge of what that nature is; he is made a partaker of it, and he has the light of God.<a name=33:8></a> It is an intelligent participation by grace in the nature of God, which is the marvellous and precious privilege of the Christian.<a name=33:9></a> God works in this nature; but by communicating it He has placed man in this position.<a name=33:10></a> Christ is the perfect model of this image, the type of the new man.<a name=33:11></a>

		Other differences have disappeared: there remains but the old man, which we only acknowledge as dead, and the new man.<a name=33:12></a> To the latter Christ is all; so that there is none but He whom they see and whom they acknowledge, and He is in all believers They put on therefore as such, as elect, holy, beloved (Christ being their life), the character of Christ, mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, patience, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another if offence has been given, even as Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		Several of these qualities may be resembled by things in nature; but the energy, the features, the bond of divine love, which acts in the sense of communion with God, are totally wanting in the latter; and this gives a character, a completeness, a righteousness of application, a perfection, a propriety, and an energy to the manifestation of these qualities, which love alone can give.<a name=34:8></a> For it is indeed God Himself who is there, acting in His nature which He has imparted to us.<a name=34:9></a> For He who dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.<a name=34:10></a> With regard to the state of the soul, there is a crown to this walk, wherewith they who follow it constantly are adorned.<a name=34:11></a> The peace of Christ reigns in the heart, that sweet and ineffable peace which nothing could disturb, though His spirit passed through everything to try it, for He walked ever with God.<a name=34:12></a> God has also called us to this; He is the God of peace.<a name=34:13></a> And here the apostle introduces the oneness of the body, not as to its privileges in Christ, but as to the fact that Christians are called to be together in the unity of which peace is the seal and the bond.<a name=34:14></a> And then there will be thanksgiving; for the soul is conscious of the love and the activity of God, and everything flows to it from that love.<a name=34:15></a>

		I know indeed that another power is required to deliver the heart from sin and to keep it from sin.<a name=37:3></a> Nature, even as God created it, does not give eternal life, not does it restore innocence or purify the conscience.<a name=37:4></a> We may, by the energy of the Spirit, consecrate ourselves to God outside these relationships, renounce them even, if God should call us by more powerful obligations, as Christ teaches us in the gospel.<a name=37:5></a> The rights of Christ over man lost by sin are sovereign, absolute, and complete.<a name=37:6></a> He has redeemed him; and the redeemed one is no longer his own, but belongs to Him who gave Himself for him.<a name=37:7></a> Where relationships exist, sin indeed has perverted everything, and corrupted the will; passions come in; but the relationships themselves are of God: woe to him who despises them as such!<a name=37:8></a> If grace has wrought and the new life exists, it acknowledges that which God has formed.<a name=37:9></a> It well knows that there is no good in man, it knows that sin has marred everything, but that which sin has marred is not itself sin.<a name=37:10></a> And where these relationships exist, the renunciation of self-will, death to sin, the bringing in of Christ, the operation of life in Him, restore their power; and if they cannot give back the character of innocence (lost for ever), they can make them a scene for the operations of grace, in which meekness, tenderness, mutual help, and self-denial, in the midst of the difficulties and sorrows which sin has introduced, lend them a charm and a depth (even as Christ did in every relationship) which innocence itself could not have presented.<a name=37:11></a> It is grace acting in the life of Christ in us which develops itself in them.<a name=37:12></a>

		It will be observed how the apostle consequently introduces Christ into them, and especially in regard to those who are subject in them, wives and children; in order to sanctify, by so exalted a motive, the obedience suited to their position.<a name=38:2></a> He does this still more where the tie is not of nature but one which has its origin in a sinful world -- and from sin itself -- that between slaves and their masters.<a name=38:3></a> Grace does not set itself to change the state of the world and of society, but to lead souls to heaven by renewing them after the image of God.<a name=38:4></a> I doubt not that it has very much altered for the better the social condition of man; because, through bringing the conscience immediately before the only true God whom it has revealed in His own perfections, and establishing by its authority that of the natural relationships in the human family, grace has had its effect upon that conscience even where the heart was not converted, and has furnished it with a rule in that which regards morality.<a name=38:5></a> But Christianity, as to its own doctrine, treats the world as alienated from God and lying in evil -- man as the child of wrath, and lost.<a name=38:6></a>

		We find in the epistles to the Thessalonians, and especially the first (for in the second it was already needful to guard that freshness from the perfidious attacks of the enemy), the condition and the hope of the Christian as such in this world all its freshness.<a name=43:1></a> These two epistles are the first that Paul wrote, unless we except that to the Galatians, the date of which is uncertain.<a name=43:2></a> Already long occupied with the work, it is only when this work was considerably advanced, that in watching over it he guards it by means of his writings -- writings as we have seen, various in character, according to the state of the churches, and according to the divine wisdom which, by this means, deposited in the scriptures that which would be necessary for all ages.<a name=43:3></a>

		Newly converted, the Christians at Thessalonica suffered much from the persecution of the world -- a persecution which the Jews of that place had already previously stirred up against Paul himself.<a name=43:4></a> Happy at the gracious work there, and rejoicing in the state of his dear children in the faith (a testimony to which was borne everywhere, even by the world), the apostle opens his heart; and the Holy Ghost sets forth by his mouth what that christian condition was upon the earth which was the source of his joy in the case of the Thessalonians; and what the hope which threw its light upon the believer's existence, shining around him through his whole life, and illuminating his path in the wilderness.<a name=43:5></a> In a word the christian character is unfolded to our eyes with all its motives and its joys, and that in connection with the testimony of God and the hope which is our strength in bearing it.<a name=43:6></a>

		In these two epistles only is an assembly said to be "in God the Father", that is to say, planted in this relationship, having its moral existence -- its mode of being -- in it.<a name=44:9></a> The life of the assembly developed itself in the communion that flowed from this relationship.<a name=44:10></a> The Spirit of adoption characterises it With the affection of little children the Thessalonians knew the Father.<a name=44:11></a> Thus John says, when speaking of the little children in Christ, "I write unto you because ye have known the Father".<a name=44:12></a> It is the first introduction into the position of liberty in which Christ has placed us -- liberty before God and in communion with Him.<a name=44:13></a> Precious position!<a name=44:14></a> to be as children to One who loves as a Father, with all the liberty and tender affection of that relationship, according to divine perfection.<a name=44:15></a> For here it is not the adaptation of Christ's human experience to the wants in which He acquired it (precious as that grace is); it is our introduction into the unmingled enjoyment of the light, and of the divine affections displayed in the character of the Father.<a name=44:16></a> It is our communion, tender and confiding but pure, with Him whose love is the source of all blessing.<a name=44:17></a> Nor do I doubt that, freshly brought out of heathenism as the Thessalonians were, the apostle refers to their knowledge of the one true God the Father in contrast with their idols.<a name=44:18></a>

		The apostle, in declaring (as was his custom) that which he felt respecting them -- the aspect in which they appeared to his heart and mind, speaks neither of gifts, as to the Corinthians, nor of the grand features of an exaltation that embraced the Lord and all saints, as to the Ephesians and even to the Colossians (with the addition of that which their state required); nor of the brotherly affection and fellowship of love which the Philippians had manifested in their connection with himself; nor of a faith that existed apart from his labours, and in communion

		Here it is the life itself of the Christian in its first fresh impressions, in its intrinsic qualities, as it developed itself by the energy of the Holy Ghost on earth, the life of God here below in them, which he remembers in his prayers with so much satisfaction and joy.<a name=45:2></a> Three great principles, he tells the Corinthians (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>) form the basis, and ever abide as the foundation of this life -- faith, hope and love.<a name=45:3></a> Now these three were the powerful and divine motives of the life of the Thessalonians.<a name=45:4></a> This life was not merely a habit; it flowed, in its outward activities, from immediate communion with its source.<a name=45:5></a> These activities were quickened and maintained by divine life, and by keeping the eye constantly fixed upon the object of faith.<a name=45:6></a> There was work, and labour, and endurance.<a name=45:7></a> There were the same in Ephesus, as we see it in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>.<a name=45:8></a> But here it was a work of faith, labour undertaken by love, endurance fed by hope.<a name=45:9></a> Faith, hope, and love are, we have seen, the springs of Christianity in this world.<a name=45:10></a> The work, the labour, the endurance continued at Ephesus, but ceased to be characterised by these great and mighty principles.<a name=45:11></a> The habit continued, but the communion was wanting.<a name=45:12></a> They had forsaken their first love.<a name=45:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it was with the Thessalonians; and the world, in spite of itself, became an additional witness to the power of the gospel.<a name=47:8></a> An ensample to believers in other places, they were the subject of report and conversation to the world, which was never weary of discussing this phenomenon, so new and so strange, of people who had given up all that governed the human heart, all to which it was subject, and worshipped one only living and true God, to whom even the natural conscience bore testimony.<a name=47:9></a> The gods of the heathen were the gods of the passions, not of the conscience.<a name=47:10></a> And this gave a living reality, an actuality, to the position of Christians and to their religion.<a name=47:11></a> They waited for His Son from heaven.<a name=47:12></a>

		That which the apostle points out, as the testimony borne by the faithful walk of the Thessalonians, contained three principal subjects: 1st, they had forsaken their idols to serve the living and true God; 2nd, they were waiting for His Son from heaven, whom He had raised from among the dead; 3rd, the Son was a safeguard from the wrath which was to be revealed.<a name=48:3></a>

		An immense fact -- simple but of vast import -- characterises Christianity.<a name=48:4></a> It gives us a positive object; and this object is nothing less than God Himself.<a name=48:5></a> Human nature may discover the folly of that which is false.<a name=48:6></a> We scorn false gods and graven images; but we cannot get beyond ourselves, we cannot reveal anything to ourselves.<a name=48:7></a> One of the most renowned names of antiquity is pleased to tell us, that all would go well if men followed nature (it is manifest that they could not rise above it); and, if fact, he would be in the right if man were not fallen.<a name=48:8></a> But to require man to follow nature is a proof that he is fallen, that he has degraded himself below the normal state of that nature.<a name=48:9></a> He does not follow it in the walk that suits its constitution.<a name=48:10></a> All is in disorder.<a name=48:11></a> Self-will carries him away and acts in his passions.<a name=48:12></a> Man has forsaken God, and has lost the power and centre of attraction that kept him in his place and everything in his own nature in its place.<a name=48:13></a> Man cannot recover himself, he cannot direct himself; for, apart from God, there is nothing but self-will that guides man.<a name=48:14></a> There are many objects that furnish occasion for the acting of the passions and the will; but there is no object which, as a centre, gives him a regular, constant, and durable moral position in relationship with that object, so that his character should bear its stamp and value.<a name=48:15></a> Man must either have a moral centre, capable of forming him as a moral being, by attracting him to itself and filling his affections, so that he shall be the reflex of that object; or he must act in self-will, and then he is the sport of his passions; or, which is the necessary consequence, he is the slave of any object that takes possession of his will.<a name=48:16></a> A

		The equilibrium which subsisted in the unconsciousness of good and evil is lost.<a name=49:3></a> Man no longer walks as man, having nothing in his mind outside his normal condition, outside that which he possessed; not having a will, or, which comes to the same thing, having a will that desired nothing more than it possessed, but that gratefully enjoyed all that was already appropriated to its nature, and especially the companionship of a being like himself, a help who had his own nature, and who answered to his heart -- blessing God for everything.<a name=49:4></a>

		Now man wills.<a name=49:5></a> While he has lost that which formed the sphere of his enjoyment, there is in him an activity which seeks, which is become unable to rest without aiming at, something farther; which, has already, as will, thrown itself into a sphere that it does not fill, in which it lacks intelligence to apprehend all that is there and power to realise even that which it desires.<a name=49:6></a> Man, and all that has been his, no longer suffices man as enjoyment.<a name=49:7></a> He still needs an object.<a name=49:8></a> This object will either be above or below the man.<a name=49:9></a> If it be below, he degrades himself below himself; and it is this indeed which has taken place.<a name=49:10></a> He no longer lives according even to nature (as he to whom I have alluded says), a state which the apostle has described in the beginning of the epistle to the Romans with all the horrors of the plain truth.<a name=49:11></a> If this object be above himself and below God, there is still nothing to govern his nature, nothing that puts him morally in his place.<a name=49:12></a> A good being could not take this place to exclude God from it.<a name=49:13></a> If a bad object gains it, he becomes to the man a god, who shuts out the true God, and degrades man in his highest relationship -- the worst of all degradations.<a name=49:14></a> This too has taken place.<a name=49:15></a> And since these beings are but creatures, they only can govern man by that which exists, and by that which acts upon him.<a name=49:16></a> This is to say, they are the gods of his passions.<a name=49:17></a> They degrade the idea of the Divinity: they degrade the practical life of humanity into slavery to the passions (which are never satisfied, and which invent evil when they are surfeited with excess in that which is natural to them) and are thus left without resource.<a name=49:18></a> Such in fact was the condition of man under Paganism.<a name=49:19></a>

		It is this which we have in Christ, our precious Saviour.<a name=52:7></a> He is an object near to us.<a name=52:8></a> He is not ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=52:9></a> He has called us friends; all that He has heard from His Father He has made known to us.<a name=52:10></a> Is He then a means of our eyes being turned away from God?<a name=52:11></a> On the contrary, it is in Him that God is manifested, in Him that even the angels see God.<a name=52:12></a> It is He who, being in the bosom of the Father, reveals to us His God and Father in this sweet relationship, and as He knows Him Himself.<a name=52:13></a> And not only this, but He is in the Father, and the Father in Him, so that He who has seen Him has seen the Father.<a name=52:14></a> He reveals God to us, instead of turning us away from Him.<a name=52:15></a> In grace He has already revealed Him, and we wait for the revelation of glory in Him.<a name=52:16></a> Already also on the earth, from the moment that He was born the angels celebrated the good pleasure of God in man, for the object of His eternal delight had become a man.<a name=52:17></a> And now He has accomplished the work which makes possible the introduction of others, of sinners, into the enjoyment with Himself of this favour of God.<a name=52:18></a> Once enemies, "we are reconciled to God by the death of his Son".<a name=52:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here comes in the application of the third truth of which the apostle speaks: "which delivered us from the wrath to come".<a name=53:11></a> The work of Christ has perfectly sheltered us from this wrath; He took our place in responsibility on the cross to put away sin for us by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=53:12></a>

		These then are the three great elements of christian life.<a name=53:13></a> We serve the living and the true God, having forsaken our idols outward or inward.<a name=53:14></a> We expect Jesus for glory; for this sight of God makes us feel what this world is, and we know Jesus.<a name=53:15></a> As to our sins and our conscience, we are perfectly cleansed; we fear nothing.<a name=53:16></a> The life and walk of the Thessalonians was a testimony to these truths.<a name=53:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having established these great principles, the apostle, with an open and overflowing heart, appeals to his whole walk among them as a proof of his having walked in the same spirit as in their own case he was rejoicing in.<a name=53:18></a> It was not that he exhorted others, while availing himself of their affection, for his own advantage.<a name=53:19></a> It was not that he encouraged them to endure afflictions, without having courage himself to undergo the same.<a name=53:20></a> Ill-treated and insulted at Philippi, he was bold in God to renew his attacks on the kingdom of darkness at Thessalonica, and that with great energy.<a name=53:21></a> He had not used flattering words to win them; he had set the truth before them, as being himself the servant of God.<a name=53:22></a> He had worked with his own hands that he might not be burdensome to them.<a name=53:23></a> All was before God in the light and by the energy of the Holy Ghost, and in a spirit of devotedness; even as he desired that they should

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see again in this expression the close relationship of the Christian, in his individual character, with God.<a name=54:2></a> He has his portion in God's own kingdom and glory, and his conduct should become such a position.<a name=54:3></a> Here it is his own position in relationship with God, as before it was his relationship with God and the Lord Jesus.<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then speaks of the means by which this world of new thoughts was acquired by the Christian.<a name=54:5></a> It was that God had spoken to reveal Himself and His counsels.<a name=54:6></a> God had committed the gospel to Paul (chapter 2: 4), and he had acted as being in the presence of God, and responsible to Him.<a name=54:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Thessalonians also, on their part, had received the word, not as the word of Paul, but as the word of God Himself addressed to them by the mouth of Paul.<a name=54:8></a> It is interesting, as for us also a serious thought, to observe that (with regard to the manifestation of the power of God down here), although the work is of God, the fruit of His servants' labours answers to the character and depth of that labour itself.<a name=54:9></a> Thus the bonds of grace are established, and communion; there is mutual understanding.<a name=54:10></a> The work manifests the workman.<a name=54:11></a> The labourer rejoices in that which his heart had desired for the souls that are the fruit of his labour; and these know how to appreciate the walk and the work of the labourer, acknowledging the power of grace in him who was the means of bringing them into this position; and the one and the others, knowing God, rejoice in the fellowship of His grace.<a name=54:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was very largely with God in his own soul and in his work.<a name=54:13></a> The Thessalonians had in consequence received the word in the same power; and they, with him, were thus in communion with God according to that power and that intimacy.<a name=54:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see here, in passing, the Jews deprived of this relationship with God, the remnant of that people received, and suffering from the enmity of the mass.<a name=54:15></a> The elect from among the Gentiles awakened, on their part, the hostility of their fellow-countrymen by the testimony which they bore against the prince of this world in their christian walk, and by their confession of a heavenly Christ -- a Christ whom the world had rejected.<a name=54:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The religion of the Jews had become pure jealousy of others.<a name=55:1></a> The pretension to the exclusive possession of religious privileges -- very precious when they enjoyed it with God as a testimony of His favour -- was nothing but a spring of hatred, when God in the fulness of His sovereign grace chose to bless others who had a right to nothing.<a name=55:2></a> By this exclusive pretension they denied the rights of God, who had formerly chosen them as a people; they denied His grace, according to which He acted towards sinners, and which would have been the source of better blessings for themselves.<a name=55:3></a> But meantime their refusal to come in had transferred the scene of our hopes and our joys from earth to heaven, where we know the Lord, and where He will remain until He comes to assert His claims over the earth.<a name=55:4></a> Before He asserts them, He will take us to Himself.<a name=55:5></a>

		Meanwhile the word of God is the source of our confidence -- the revelation of glory, of truth, and of love.<a name=55:6></a> It is mighty in them that believe.<a name=55:7></a> The Jews are set aside.<a name=55:8></a> By their opposition to grace towards the Gentiles, they had taken the position of enmity against God in grace, and wrath was come upon them to the uttermost.<a name=55:9></a> It was not yet executed; but they had put themselves in this position.<a name=55:10></a> It was not only that they had broken the law, they had already killed their prophets who were sent to them in grace; they had already slain the Christ, Jesus the Lord.<a name=55:11></a> Sovereign grace alone could bring in a remedy.<a name=55:12></a> This they resisted; because, according to that grace, God was good to the Gentiles, and granted to them, at the same time as to themselves, better privileges than those which they had forfeited.<a name=55:13></a> Wrath therefore was finally come upon them as a nation.<a name=55:14></a> Christians were now in the enjoyment of better privileges in place of the Jews.<a name=55:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not here the moment for explaining the future dealings of God with the remnant of that people.<a name=55:16></a> The apostle speaks of the people, in order to shew that the only ones in relation with God were Christians -- those who had received the word.<a name=55:17></a> It was the reception of the word by faith, and nothing else, which brought souls really into relationship with God.<a name=55:18></a> Hereditary privileges were found to be, in their nature, opposition to grace and sovereignty, and thus to the character and rights of God Himself; for God is sovereign, and God is love.<a name=55:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word reveals grace; it is obeyed by believing it.<a name=55:20></a> And, brought into relationship with God, the Christian walks in communion and in His ways, and waits for the Son, in

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle blessed God that it was thus with the Thessalonians; and, having made this point clear, he returns to the joy of his communion with them in the positive blessing which the revelation of God in their hearts by the word had brought them.<a name=56:3></a> He would gladly have seen them to enjoy this communion in intercourse with them face to face; but as long as it was by the word only that the knowledge of God was obtained -- in a word by faith -- as long as the Lord was absent, another result flowed from this fact; namely, that these joys were mingled with conflict -- conflict however, which, although to the eye of man interrupting enjoyment, made it more sweet, more real, preserved its heavenly character, and made the Lord Himself, from whom they could not be separated, the centre, the common point in which hearts were united, with the consciousness that they were in the wilderness, and that they were awaiting a scene and a time in which evil and the enemy's power would no longer be, but where Christ would be all.<a name=56:4></a> Joyful hope, holy happiness, powerful link of the heart to Christ!<a name=56:5></a> When He shall be all, our joy will be complete, and all saints will possess it.<a name=56:6></a> Paul wished to have seen them again, and had so even twice, but Satan hindered it.<a name=56:7></a> The time should come when he would fully enjoy both them and his labour among them, by seeing them in full possession of glory at the coming of Christ.<a name=56:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the apostle himself, when at Thessalonica, christian life was fully developed in love and in holiness.<a name=56:9></a> He had been among them in tenderness, as a mother cherishes her children; ready to impart not only the gospel to them, but even his own life, so dear were they to him.<a name=56:10></a> He had been at the same time holy and without blame in all his conduct.<a name=56:11></a> What energy of life and love springing up by the power of God, regardless of all the consequences save the blessing of the elect and the glory of God!<a name=56:12></a> This is true christian life.<a name=56:13></a> The heart, not filled with questionings through unbelief but strong in faith, counts on God in order to serve God.<a name=56:14></a> Thus love is free, beside oneself for God, prudent and full of consideration only for the good of others.<a name=56:15></a> And what bonds this creates!<a name=56:16></a> Persecution only hastens the work by compelling to go elsewhere, when perhaps the labourer would be tempted to enjoy the fruits of his labour

		in the society.<a name=57:1></a> of those who had been blessed through him (compare chapter 2: 2).<a name=57:2></a> Though absent, the apostle's heart was still bound to them; he remembered his beloved ones; he prayed for them; he blessed God for the grace bestowed on them; assuring himself with joy, when he thought of it, their portion in glory as the elect of God (chapter 1: 3, 4; 2: 13).<a name=57:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The bond remained firm; and, the way to present enjoyment personal communion being obstructed by the devices of Satan (by permission of God), his heart rose higher, and sought the full satisfaction of the want produced in it by love, in the moment when a Christ present in His power should have removed all obstacles and accomplished the purposes of God with respect to the saints; when His love should have borne all its precious fruits in them; and when Paul and his dear children in the faith should enjoy together all that grace and the power of the Spirit should have wrought in them.<a name=57:4></a> Unable for the moment to satisfy the desires of his heart by seeing them, it was to that hour that Paul looked.<a name=57:5></a> And observe that, if he does so, it is because his heart was already filled with it for himself.<a name=57:6></a> The power of the Spirit, acting in accordance with the truth, always leads the heart to that hour.<a name=57:7></a> It impels the heart to labour in love in the midst of this world, causes thus the opposition of the darkness of this world to the light (whether on the part of man or of the prince of darkness) to be realised, and makes us always feel the need of that day of light, when evil shall no longer be present to hinder the happiness of the new man in his enjoyment of that which is good, in his communion with those dear to God, and; above all, in the enjoyment of the presence of his glorified Saviour, who has loved him, and who (for the exercise of his faith) is at present hidden from him.<a name=57:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is He who is the source and object of all these affections, who sustains and nourishes them, who attracts them ever to Himself by His perfections and by His love, and, in the sorrows of the christian life, carries the heart onward thus to the day of our being with Himself, to the day of His coming, when the heart will be free to occupy itself with all that binds us to Him without interruption.<a name=57:9></a> This thought of His presence has the mastery, when the heart is fresh in the divine joy of redemption.<a name=57:10></a> We find this here.<a name=57:11></a> We are converted to wait for Him (chapter 1); we shall enjoy the communion of saints, and the fruit of our labours when He returns (chapter 2); that day gives its force and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		its measure to our thoughts respecting holiness (chapter 3); it destroys the anguish of heart which would otherwise accompany the death of the saints (chapter 4); it is for that day we are kept (chapter 5).<a name=58:1></a> The coming of the Lord, the presence of Jesus, fills therefore the believer's heart, when life is springing up in its freshness -- fills it with a joyous hope, the fulfilment of which shines bright before our eyes, there where all our desires will be accomplished.<a name=58:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To return to the end of chapter 2, the link which Satan sought to break by interrupting its enjoyment was but the rather strengthened by being connected with the coming of the Lord.<a name=58:3></a> The current of the Spirit, against which he had been allowed to set up this dike, though turned from its natural bed, could not be stopped, for its waters ever flow; they gushed out in waves that enriched all around them, taking their course towards that sea which contained the fulness of those waters and fed the source from which they sprang.<a name=58:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It should be observed here, that the special fruits of our labours are not lost; they are found again at the coming of Christ.<a name=58:5></a> Our chief personal joy is to see the Lord Himself and to be like Him.<a name=58:6></a> This is the portion of all saints; but there are particular fruits in connection with the work of the Spirit in us and by us.<a name=58:7></a> At Thessalonica the spiritual energy of the apostle had brought a number of souls to God and to wait for Jesus, and into a close union in the truth with Himself.<a name=58:8></a> This energy would be crowned at the coming of Christ by the presence of these believers in the glory as the fruit of his labours.<a name=58:9></a> God would thus crown the apostle's work by bearing a striking testimony to its faithfulness in the presence of all these saints in glory; and the love which had wrought in Paul's heart would be satisfied by seeing its object in glory and in the presence of Jesus.<a name=58:10></a> They would be his glory and joy.<a name=58:11></a> This thought drew yet closer the bonds that united them, and comforted the apostle in the midst of his toils and sufferings.<a name=58:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this forced removal of the apostle as the chief labourer, without weakening the bond between him and the disciples, formed other links which would consolidate and strengthen the assembly, knitting it together by that which every joint supplied.<a name=58:13></a> This is connected (all things are but the instruments of the power and wisdom of God) with the circumstances of which the Acts of the Apostles give us the principal details.<a name=58:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, learning this state of things from Silas and Timotheus, was concerned at the danger his new converts ran in being shaken in faith by the difficulties that beset their path while they were still young in the faith.<a name=59:5></a> His affection would not allow him to rest without putting himself in communication with them, and already from Athens he had sent Timotheus to inquire into their condition, and to establish their hearts by reminding them that while yet with them he had told them these things would happen.<a name=59:6></a> During his absence Paul left Athens and went to Corinth, where Timotheus again comforted him by the good tidings he brought from Thessalonica, and the apostle resumed his labours at Corinth with renewed energy and courage (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:5">Acts  18:5</a>).<a name=59:7></a>

		I would here call the reader's attention to the way in which the apostle speaks of the Lord's coming in the different chapters of this epistle.<a name=72:8></a> It will be noticed that the Spirit does not present the church here as a body.<a name=72:9></a> Life is the subject -- that of each Christian therefore individually: a very important point assuredly.<a name=72:10></a>

		Thus far then, we have the general expectation of the Lord in Person, His Son from heaven; love satisfied at His coming as regards others; holiness in its full value and full development.<a name=73:5></a> In chapter 4 it is not the connection of life with its full development in our being actually with Christ, but victory over death (which is no barrier to this); and, at the same time, the strengthening and establishment of hope in our common departure hence, similarly to that of Jesus, to be for ever with Him.<a name=73:6></a>

		The apostle desired that the disciples should acknowledge those who laboured among them and guided them in grace and admonished them, and esteem them greatly for their work's sake.<a name=74:2></a> The operation of God always attracts a soul that is moved by the Holy Ghost, and commands its attention and its respect: on this foundation the apostle builds his exhortation.<a name=74:3></a> It is not office which is in question here (if such existed), but the work which attracted and attached the heart.<a name=74:4></a> They ought to be known: spirituality acknowledged this operation of God.<a name=74:5></a> Love, devotedness, the answer to the need of souls, patience in dealing with them on the part of God -- all this commended itself to the believer's heart: and it blessed God for the care He bestowed upon His children.<a name=74:6></a> God acted in the labourer and in the hearts of the faithful.<a name=74:7></a> Blessed be God, it is an ever-existing principle, and one that never grows weaker!<a name=74:8></a>

		Now this renunciation of self-will, and this practical sense of the operation and presence of God, gives power to warn the unruly, to comfort the fearful, to help the weak, and to be patient towards all.<a name=74:12></a> The apostle exhorts them to it.<a name=74:13></a> Communion with God is the power and His word the guide in so doing.<a name=74:14></a> In no case were they to render evil for evil, but to follow that which was good among themselves and towards all.<a name=74:15></a> All this conduct depends on communion with God, on His presence with us, which makes us superior to evil.<a name=74:16></a> He is this in love; and we can be so by walking with Him.<a name=74:17></a>

		In the previous part we found the activity of love in the heart; that is to say, God present and acting in us, who are viewed as partaking, at the same time, of the divine nature, which is the spring of that holiness which will be manifested in all its perfection before God at the coming of Jesus with all His saints.<a name=75:11></a> Here it is the God of peace, to whom the apostle looks for the accomplishment of this work.<a name=75:12></a> There it was the activity of a divine principle in us -- a principle connected with the presence of God and our communion with Him.<a name=75:13></a> Here it is the perfect rest of heart in which holiness develops itself.<a name=75:14></a> The absence of peace in the heart arises from the activity of the passions and the will, increased by the sense of powerlessness to satisfy or even to gratify them.<a name=75:15></a>

		In general the words "soul and spirit" are used without making any distinction between them for the soul of man was formed very differently from that of animals in that God breathed into his nostrils the breath (spirit) of life, and it was thus that man became a living soul.<a name=77:15></a> Therefore it suffices to say soul as to man, and the other is supposed.<a name=77:16></a> Or, in saying spirit, in this sense the elevated character of his soul is expressed.<a name=77:17></a> The animal has also its natural affections, has a living soul, attaches itself, knows the persons who do it good, devotes itself to its master, loves him, will even give its life for him; but it has not that which can be in relationship with God (alas!<a name=77:18></a>

		The Spirit then wills that man, reconciled with God, should be consecrated, in every part of his being, to the God who has brought him into relationship with Himself by the revelation of His love, and by the work of His grace, and that nothing in the man should admit an object beneath the divine nature of which he is partaker; so that he should thus be preserved blameless unto the coming of Christ.<a name=78:2></a>

		Let us observe here, that it is in no wise beneath the new nature in us to perform our duties faithfully in all the various relationships in which God has placed us; but quite the contrary.<a name=78:3></a> That which is required is to bring God into them, His authority, and the intelligence which that imparts.<a name=78:4></a> Therefore it is said to husbands to live with their wives "according to knowledge", or intelligence; that is to say, not only with human and natural affections (which, as things are, do not by themselves even maintain their place), but as before God and conscious of His will.<a name=78:5></a> It may be that God may call us, in connection with the extraordinary work of His grace, to consecrate ourselves entirely to it; but otherwise the will of God is accomplished in the relationships in which He has placed us, and divine intelligence and obedience to God are developed in them.<a name=78:6></a> Finally God has called us to this life of holiness with Himself; He is faithful and He will accomplish it.<a name=78:7></a> May He enable us to cleave to Him, that we may realise it!<a name=78:8></a>

		Observe again here, how the coming of Christ is introduced, and the expectation of this coming, as an integral part of christian life.<a name=78:9></a> "Blameless", it says, "at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=78:10></a> The life which had developed itself in obedience and holiness meets the Lord at His coming.<a name=78:11></a> Death is not in question.<a name=78:12></a> The life which we have found is to be such when He appears.<a name=78:13></a> The man, in every part of his being, moved by this life, is found there blameless when Jesus comes.<a name=78:14></a> Death was overcome (not yet destroyed): a new life is ours.<a name=78:15></a> This life, and the man living of this life, are found, with their Head and Source, in the glory.<a name=78:16></a> Then will the weakness disappear which is connected with his present condition.<a name=78:17></a> That which is mortal shall be swallowed up of life: that is all.<a name=78:18></a> We are Christ's: He is our life.<a name=78:19></a> We wait for Him, that we may be with Him, and that He may perfect all things in the glory.<a name=78:20></a>

		teaches us with regard to sanctification.<a name=79:1></a> It is connected indeed with a nature, but it is linked with an object; and it depends for its realisation on the operation of another, namely, of God Himself; and it is founded on a perfect work of reconciliation with God, already accomplished.<a name=79:2></a> Inasmuch as it is founded on an accomplished reconciliation, into which we enter by the reception of a new nature, the scriptures consider Christians as already perfectly sanctified in Christ.<a name=79:3></a> It is practically carried out by the operation of the Holy Ghost, who, in imparting this nature, separates us -- as thus born again -- entirely from the world.<a name=79:4></a> It is important to maintain this truth, and to stand very clearly and distinctly on this ground: otherwise practical sanctification soon becomes detached from a new nature received, and is but the amelioration of the natural man and then it is quite legal, a return -- after reconciliation -- into doubt and uncertainty, because, though justified, the man is not accounted meet for heaven -- this depends on progress so that justification does not give peace with God.<a name=79:5></a> Scripture says, "Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet for the inheritance of the saints in light".<a name=79:6></a> Progress there is, but it is not in scripture connected with meetness.<a name=79:7></a> The thief was meet for Paradise and went there.<a name=79:8></a> Such views are an enfeebling, not to say destructive, of the work of redemption, that is, of its appreciation in our hearts by faith.<a name=79:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We <i>are</i> then sanctified (it is thus the scripture most frequently speaks) by God the Father, by the blood and the offering of Christ, and by the Spirit -- that is to say, we are set apart for God personally and for ever.<a name=79:10></a> In this point of view justification is presented in the word as consequent upon sanctification, a thing into which we enter through it.<a name=79:11></a> Taken up as sinners in the world, we are set apart by the Holy Ghost to enjoy all the efficacy of the work of Christ according to the counsels of the Father: set apart by the communication of a new life, no doubt, but placed by this setting apart in the enjoyment of all that Christ has gained for us.<a name=79:12></a> I say again, It is very important to hold fast this truth both for the glory of God and for our own peace: but the Spirit of God in this epistle does not speak of it in this point of view, but of the practical realisation of the development of this life of separation from the world and from evil.<a name=79:13></a> He speaks of this divine development in the inner man, which makes sanctification a real and intelligent condition of soul, a state of practical communion with God, according

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this respect we find indeed a principle of life which works in us -- that which is called a subjective state: but it is impossible to separate this operation in us from an object (man would be God if it were so), nor consequently from a continual work of God in us that holds us in communion with that object, which is God Himself.<a name=80:2></a> Accordingly it is through the truth by the word, whether at first in the communication of life, or in detail all along our path.<a name=80:3></a> "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth".<a name=80:4></a>

		Man, we know, has degraded himself.<a name=80:5></a> He has enslaved himself to the lusts of the animal part of his being.<a name=80:6></a> But how?<a name=80:7></a> By departing from God.<a name=80:8></a> God does not sanctify man apart from the knowledge of Himself, leaving man still at a distance from Him; but, while giving him a new nature which is capable of it, by giving to this nature (which cannot even exist without it) an object -- Himself, He does not make man independent, as he wished to be: the new man is the dependent man; it is his perfection -- Jesus Christ exemplified this in His life.<a name=80:9></a> The new man is a man dependent in his affections, who desires to be so, who delights in, and cannot be happy without being so, and whose dependence is on love, while still obedient as a dependent being ought to be.<a name=80:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus they who are sanctified possess a nature that is holy in its desires and its tastes.<a name=80:11></a> It is the divine nature in them, the life of Christ.<a name=80:12></a> But they do not cease to be men.<a name=80:13></a> They have God revealed in Christ for their object.<a name=80:14></a> Sanctification is developed in communion with God, and in affections which go back to Christ, and which wait for Him.<a name=80:15></a> But the new nature cannot reveal an object to itself; and still less could it have its object by setting God aside at its will.<a name=80:16></a> It is dependent on God for the revelation of Himself.<a name=80:17></a> His love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost whom He has given us; and the same Spirit takes of the things of Christ and communicates them to us.<a name=80:18></a> Thus we grow in the knowledge of God, being strengthened mightily by His Spirit in the inner man, that we may "comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge", and be filled unto the fulness of God.<a name=80:19></a> Thus, "we all with open face beholding the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as

		Our setting apart for God, which is complete (for it is by means of a nature that is purely of Himself, and in absolute responsibility to Him, for we are no longer our own, but are bought with a price, and sanctified by the blood of Christ according to the will of God, who will have us for His own), places us in a relationship, the development of which (by an increasing knowledge of God, who is the object of our new nature) is practical sanctification, wrought in us by the power of the Holy Ghost, the witness in us of the love of God.<a name=81:5></a> He attaches the heart to God, ever revealing Him more and more, and at the same time unfolding the glory of Christ and all the divine qualities that were displayed in Him in human nature, thus forming ours as born of God.<a name=81:6></a>

		We may here more particularly call the reader's attention to these objects.<a name=81:10></a> They are, God Himself, and the coming of Christ: on the one hand, communion with God; on the other, waiting for Christ.<a name=81:11></a> It is most evident that communion with God is the practical position of the highest sanctification.<a name=81:12></a> He who knows that we shall see Jesus as He now is, and be like Him, purifies himself even as He is pure.<a name=81:13></a> By our communion with the God of peace we are wholly sanctified.<a name=81:14></a> If God is practically our all, we are altogether holy.<a name=81:15></a> (We are not speaking of any change in the flesh, which can neither be subjected to God nor please Him).<a name=81:16></a> The thought of Christ and His coming preserves us practically, and in detail, and intelligently, blameless.<a name=81:17></a> It is God Himself who thus preserves us, and who works in us to occupy our hearts and cause us continually to grow.<a name=81:18></a>

		But this point deserves yet a few more words.<a name=82:1></a> The freshness of christian life in the Thessalonians made it, as it were, more objective; so that these objects are prominent, and very distinctly recognised by the heart.<a name=82:2></a> We have already said that they are God the Father, and the Lord Jesus.<a name=82:3></a> With reference to the communion of love with the saints as his crown and glory, he speaks only of the Lord Jesus.<a name=82:4></a> This has a special character of reward, although a reward in which love reigns.<a name=82:5></a> Jesus Himself had the joy that was set before Him as sustainment in His sufferings, a joy which thus was personal to Himself.<a name=82:6></a> The apostle also, as regarded his work and labour, waited with Christ for its fruit.<a name=82:7></a> Besides this case of the apostle (chapter 2), we find God Himself and Jesus as the object before us, and the joy of communion with God -- and this, in the relationship of Father -- and with Christ, whose glory and position we share through grace.<a name=82:8></a>

		Thus it is only in the two epistles to the Thessalonians that we find the expression "to the church which is in God the Father".<a name=82:9></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:82">footnote</a></i>) The sphere of their communion is thus shewn, founded on the relationship in which they found themselves with God Himself in the character of Father (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:3">1 Thessalonians  1:3</a>, 9, 10; 3: 13; 4: 15, 16; and here verse 23).<a name=82:10></a> It is important to remark, that the more vigorous and living Christianity is, the more objective it is.<a name=82:11></a> It is but saying that God and the Lord Jesus have a greater place in our thoughts; and that we rest more really upon them.<a name=82:12></a> This epistle to the Thessalonians is the part of scripture which instructs on this point; and it is a means of judging many a fallacy in the heart, and of giving a great simplicity to our Christianity.<a name=82:13></a>

		The apostle closes his epistle by asking for the prayers of the brethren, saluting them with the confidence of affection, and adjuring them to have his epistle read to all the holy brethren.<a name=82:14></a> His heart forgot none of them.<a name=82:15></a> He would be in relationship with all according to this spiritual affection and personal bond.<a name=82:16></a> Apostle towards all of them, he would have them recognise those who laboured among them, but he maintained withal his own relationship.<a name=82:17></a> His was a heart which embraced all the revealed counsels of God on the one hand, and did not lose sight of the least of His saints on the other.<a name=82:18></a>

		It remains to take notice of one interesting circumstance as to the manner in which the apostle instructs them.<a name=83:1></a> He takes, in the first chapter, the truths which were precious to their heart, but were still somewhat vaguely seized by their intelligence, and as to which they were indeed fallen into mistakes, and employs them (in the clearness in which he possessed them himself) in his practical instructions, and applies them to known and experienced relationships, that their souls might be well established on positive truth, and clear as to its use, before he touched on their error and the mistakes they had made.<a name=83:2></a> They waited for His Son from heaven.<a name=83:3></a> This they already possessed clearly in their hearts; but they would be in the presence of God when Jesus comes with all His saints.<a name=83:4></a> This was clearing up a very important point without directly touching the error.<a name=83:5></a> Their heart got straight as to the truth in its practical application to what the heart possessed.<a name=83:6></a> They understood what it was to be before God the Father.<a name=83:7></a> It was much more intimate and real than a manifestation of terrestrial and finite glory.<a name=83:8></a> Further they would be before God when Jesus came with an His saints; a simple truth which demonstrated itself to the heart by the simple fact that Jesus could not have some only of His assembly.<a name=83:9></a> The heart seized this truth without an effort; yet in doing so it was established, as was the understanding also, in what made the whole truth clear, and that in view of the relationship of the Thessalonians to Christ and those that were His.<a name=83:10></a> The joy even of the apostle in meeting them all (those who had died consequently, as well as the living) at the coming of Jesus, placed the soul on an entirely different ground from that of being found here, and blessed by the arrival of Jesus when they were here below.<a name=83:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus enlightened, confirmed, established, in the real bearing of the truth which they possessed already, by a development of it which connected itself with their best affections and with their most intimate spiritual knowledge, founded on their communion with God, they were ready with certain fixed basis of truth to enter on and set aside without difficulty an error which was not in accord with what they now knew how to appreciate at its just value, as forming part of their moral possessions.<a name=83:12></a> Special revelation made all clear as to details.<a name=83:13></a> This manner of proceeding is very instructive.<a name=83:14></a>

		2 THESSALONIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle corrects some errors into which these disciples had fallen with regard to the day of the Lord through certain false teachers; as in part of the first epistle he had enlightened the ignorance of the believers themselves respecting the portion of the saints at the coming of Christ to take them to Himself -- a point on which they were evidently but little instructed.<a name=84:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A measure of Jewish darkness was on their minds; and they were, in some points, still subjected to the influence of that unhappy nation, which was ever struggling to maintain a position lost through its unbelief.<a name=84:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This Jewish influence enables us to understand why the apostle spoke as he did in chapter 2: 15, 16, of the first epistle.<a name=84:3></a> At that time this influence shewed itself in the tendency of the Thessalonians to lose sight of the heavenly side of the Lord's coming, to think that He would return to the earth and that they should then be glorified with Him -- as a Jew might have believed -- and that the dead saints would therefore not be present to share this glory.<a name=84:4></a> I do not say that this thought had assumed a definite form in the minds of the Thessalonians.<a name=84:5></a> To them the principal and living object was the Lord Himself, and they were awaiting His return with hearts full of joy and life; but the heavenly side of this expectation had not its place clearly marked in their minds, and they connected the coming too much with the manifestation, so that the earthly character predominated, and the dead seemed to be shut out from it.<a name=84:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the second epistle was written, this Jewish influence had another character; and the false teachers were more directly concerned in it.<a name=84:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The faithful at Thessalonica had learnt to contemplate "the day of the Lord" as a day of judgment.<a name=84:8></a> The Old Testament had spoken much of this day of the Lord, a day of darkness and unparalleled judgment, a day of trial to men (compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#13">Isaiah  13</a>, <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2">Joel  2</a>, <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#5:18">Amos  5:18</a>).<a name=84:9></a> Now the Thessalonians were undergoing dreadful persecution.<a name=84:10></a> Perhaps their hope of an earthly intervention of the Lord, during their lifetime, was weakened The apostle at least rejoiced at the increase of their faith, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the abundant exercise of their love, while he is silent with regard to their hope; and the joy of christian life is not found here as it was manifested in the first epistle.<a name=85:1></a> Nevertheless they were walking well, and the apostle gloried in them(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:85">footnote</a></i>) in the churches of God.<a name=85:2></a> But the false teachers profited by their condition to mislead them by means of their sufferings, which weighed more heavily on their hearts from the joy of hope being a little weakened; and at the same time the remains of the influence of Judaising thoughts, or of habits of mind formed through them, furnished occasion to the assaults of the enemy.<a name=85:3></a> The instrument of the subtle malice told them that the day of the Lord, that fearful time, was already come -- the word (chapter 2: 2) is not "at hand", but "come", "present"(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:85">footnote</a></i>) -- and all that the Thessalonians were suffering, and by which their hearts were shaken, appeared like a testimony to prove it and to confirm the words of the false teachers.<a name=85:4></a> Was it not written that it should be a day of trial and anguish?<a name=85:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The words of these teachers, moreover, had the pretension of being more than human reasoning; it was a word of the Lord, it was the Spirit who spoke, it was a letter from an inspired channel: and so bold and wicked were they in regard to this matter, that they did not fear to adduce the apostle's own name as their authority for declaring that the day was come.<a name=85:6></a> Now the dominion of fear, which Satan can exercise over the mind, when it is not kept of God in peace and joy, is astonishing.<a name=85:7></a> "In nothing terrified by your adversaries", is the apostle's word to the Philippians, "which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God".<a name=85:8></a> In such a state of mind as this everything is believed; or rather everything is feared, and nothing is believed.<a name=85:9></a> The heart gives itself up to this fear, and is ready to believe anything; for it is in darkness and knows not what to believe.<a name=85:10></a> Thus the apostle exhorts the Thessalonians (chapter 2) not to be soon shaken in mind so as to lose their stability in the truth, and not to be troubled.<a name=85:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle deals with the case in the same manner as in the first epistle.<a name=85:12></a> Before entering on the error he treats the same

		subject in its true light, building upon the knowledge which the Thessalonians already possessed.<a name=86:1></a> Only he sets it forth with clearness in its application to the circumstances of the moment.<a name=86:2></a> By this means they were delivered from the influence of the error, and from the disturbance of mind which it had caused; and were rendered capable of looking at the error, as being themselves outside it, and of judging it according to the instruction that the apostle gave them.<a name=86:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were persecuted and were in distress and suffering, and the enemy took advantage of it.<a name=86:4></a> The apostle puts that fact in its right place.<a name=86:5></a> He encourages them with the thought that it was a kind of seal upon them of their being worthy of the kingdom for which they were suffering.<a name=86:6></a> But more, the "day of the Lord" was the coming of the Lord in judgment; but it was not to make His own suffer that He was coming -- it was to punish the wicked.<a name=86:7></a> Persecution therefore could not be the day of the Lord; for in persecution the wicked had the upper hand and did their own will and inflicted suffering on those whom the Lord loved.<a name=86:8></a> Could that be His day!<a name=86:9></a> The apostle does not apply this argument to the question, but he puts the facts in their place; so that all the use which the enemy made of them fell of itself to the ground.<a name=86:10></a> The truth of the facts was there in its simplicity, giving them their evident and natural character.<a name=86:11></a> When God should take the thing in hand, He would recompense tribulation to those who troubled His children, and these should have rest -- should be in peace.<a name=86:12></a> The moment of their entering into this rest is not at all the subject here, but the contrast between their actual condition and that which it would be if Jesus were come.<a name=86:13></a> It was not to persecute and harass His own that He was coming.<a name=86:14></a> In His day they should be at rest, and the wicked in distress; for He was coming to punish the latter by driving them away for ever from the glory of His presence.<a name=86:15></a> When we understand that the Thessalonians had been induced to believe that the day of the Lord was already come, the import of this first chapter is very plain.<a name=86:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two principles are here established.<a name=86:17></a> First, the righteous judgment of God: it is righteous in His eyes, on the one hand, to reward those who suffer for His kingdom's sake: and, on the other, to requite those who persecute His children.<a name=86:18></a> In the second place, the glorious manifestation of the Lord Jesus: His own should be in rest and happiness with Him, when His power should be in exercise.<a name=86:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see also here two reasons for judgment -- they did not know God, and they did not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=87:1></a> All being without excuse as to the testimony that God had ever given concerning Himself, some among them had added the rejection of the positive revelation of His grace in the gospel of Christ to their abuse of their natural relationship with God and their forgetfulness of His Majesty.<a name=87:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile the apostle presents the positive result in blessing of the manifestation of Jesus in glory.<a name=87:3></a> He will come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them that have believed in Him, and therefore in the Thessalonians: a thorough proof, at least that they were not to view their persecuted condition as a demonstration that the day was come.<a name=87:4></a> With regard to themselves, they were thus entirely delivered from the confusion by which the enemy sought to disquiet them; and the apostle could treat the question of this error with hearts which, as to their own condition, were set free from it and at rest.<a name=87:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These considerations characterised his prayers on their behalf.<a name=87:6></a> He sought from God that they might always be worthy of this vocation, and that the Lord might be glorified in them by the power of faith, which would shine the brighter through their persecutions; and that afterwards they might be glorified in Him at the manifestation of His glory according to the grace of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=87:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that the apostle has placed their souls on the ground of truth, he enters upon the subject of the error, shewing that which had occasioned his remarks.<a name=87:8></a> Of this we have already spoken.<a name=87:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In answering this error, and in guarding them from the wily efforts of seducers, he puts everything in its place here by appealing to precious truths of which he had already spoken.<a name=87:10></a> Their gathering together unto Christ in the air was a demonstration of the impossibility of the day of the Lord being already come.<a name=87:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover with regard to this last he presents two considerations: first, the day could not be already come, since Christians were not yet gathered to the Lord, and they were to come with Him; second, the wicked one who has then to be judged had not yet appeared, so that the judgment could not be executed.<a name=87:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle had already instructed the Thessalonians with regard to this wicked one, when at Thessalonica; and in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=88>[Page 88]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		former epistle he had taught them concerning the rapture of the church.<a name=88:1></a> In order that the Lord should come in judgment, iniquity must have reached its height, and open opposition to God have been manifested.<a name=88:2></a> But the truth had another and a more precious side: the saints were to be in the same position as Christ, to be gathered together unto Him, before He could manifest Himself in glory to those outside.<a name=88:3></a> But these truths require a more connected examination.<a name=88:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Their gathering together unto Christ before the manifestation was a truth known to the Thessalonians; it is not revealed here, it is used as an argument.<a name=88:5></a> The Lord Jesus was coming, but it was impossible that He should be without His church in the glory.<a name=88:6></a> The King would indeed punish His rebellious subjects; but, before doing so, He would bring to Himself those who had been faithful to Him amid the unfaithful, in order to bring them back with Him and publicly to honour them in the midst of the rebels.<a name=88:7></a> But the apostle here speaks only of the rapture itself, and he adjures them only by that truth not to allow themselves to be shaken in mind as though the day were come.<a name=88:8></a> What an assured truth must this have been to Christians, since the apostle could appeal to it as to a known point, on which the heart could rest!<a name=88:9></a> The relationship of the church to Christ, its being necessarily in the same position with Him, rendered the idea that the day was already come a mere folly.<a name=88:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second place, the already known fact is asserted, that the apostasy must previously take place, and then the man of sin be revealed.<a name=88:11></a> Solemn truth!<a name=88:12></a> Everything takes its place.<a name=88:13></a> The forms and the name of Christianity have long been maintained; true Christians have been disowned; but now there should be a public renunciation of the faith -- an apostasy.<a name=88:14></a> True Christians should have their true place in heaven.<a name=88:15></a> But, besides this, there should be a person who would fully realise in sin the character of man without God.<a name=88:16></a> He is the man of sin.<a name=88:17></a> He does his own will -- it is but Adam fully developed; and, incited by the enemy, he opposes himself to God (it is open enmity against God) and he exalts himself above all that bears the name of God; he assumes the place of God in His temple.<a name=88:18></a> So that there is apostasy, that is, the open renunciation of Christianity in general, and an individual who concentrates in his own person (as to the principles of iniquity) the opposition that is made against God.<a name=88:19></a>

		This thought does not rest upon great principles only: the passage itself supplies elements which shew the state of things when the power of evil develops itself.<a name=92:8></a> 1st, The apostasy has already taken place.<a name=92:9></a> This could hardly be said if the testimony of the assembly still subsisted, as it had in time past, or even yet more distinctly as being freed from all false and corrupting elements.<a name=92:10></a> 2nd, Authority -- as established of God, so far as exercising a restraint on man's will in God's name -- has disappeared from the scene, for the wicked one exalts himself against all that is called God and to which homage is paid, and presents himself as God in the temple of God.<a name=92:11></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#82">Psalm  82</a>, where God stands among the gods (the judges) to judge them before He inherits the nations.<a name=92:12></a> Before that solemn hour when God will judge the judges of the earth, this wicked one, despising all authority that comes from Him, sets himself up as God: and that on the earth, where the judgment will be manifested.<a name=92:13></a> And then, 3rd, In place of the Holy Ghost and His power manifested on the earth, we find the power of Satan, and with precisely the same tokens that bore witness to the Person of Christ.<a name=92:14></a> So that the passage itself, whether as to man or as to the enemy, gives us (in the three points of which we have spoken) the full confirmation of that which we have ventured to set forth.<a name=92:15></a>

		God had been manifested in the flesh; marvellous truth in fact!<a name=112:2></a> There, where all is confusion and sin, in the nature of him in whom all this sin and all this confusion are introduced, the Centre of all blessing, He who is Light itself, He who as the light puts everything morally in its place, and who by the fact of His presence shews that love is above everything, God who is love, has been manifest in the flesh.<a name=112:3></a> Where sin was, there was love above the sin.<a name=112:4></a> Man, who is the slave of evil, sees here in his own nature the source and the power of all good.<a name=112:5></a> In the centre of evil and of weakness, in human nature, God Himself has been manifested.<a name=112:6></a> Was there then evil in Him who was such?<a name=112:7></a> Did He undergo the lot of the common bondage?<a name=112:8></a> By no means.<a name=112:9></a> Truly in the same circumstances, in the same nature, He proved superior to all evil, perfect in all respects.<a name=112:10></a> The absence of all sin was made evident by the power of the Holy Ghost during His whole life (if men had been able to discern it; and, in fact, it was manifest to the conscience of every man, for He was pure light shining upon all), and with power by the resurrection (compare <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:4">Romans  1:4</a>).<a name=112:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus God was made visible to the angels, was preached to the Gentiles (not merely the God of the Jews), became the object of faith in the world (it was not the manifestation of visible power, claiming His rights and His glory), and at last took a place on high in the glory whence He had descended.<a name=112:12></a> It is thus that God is known in the assembly according to the truth.<a name=112:13></a> There is no truth outside the maintenance of this revelation of the Person of Christ.<a name=112:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is worthy of notice that in this epistle, and even in the second, the apostle speaks nowhere of the relationship of Christians with God as His children, of the privileges of children, or of that which is known within in the intimacy of the family.<a name=112:15></a> He speaks of truths that are essential as testimony before the world; that which the assembly is externally, that which it is as witness of God towards men.<a name=112:16></a> It is the house of God, the assembly of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth: that which it is as responsible in the world, and in order that all should learn what God is.<a name=112:17></a> The mystery of piety, of which the assembly is the vessel for testimony, answers to this.<a name=112:18></a> It is the grand essential truth on which all relation

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not here the privileges of children, nor the heavenly bride of Christ, but the foundation of God's relations with all men.<a name=113:3></a> Thus the Father is not named, nor even the Spirit, except here in connection with the Lord's Person, as the justification of His testimony.<a name=113:4></a> It is God, the Mediator, and man, and the assembly as the vessel and depositary of this truth of the testimony of God; or else evil spirits turning men away from the faith.<a name=113:5></a> This deserves all attention.<a name=113:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only, as we have seen elsewhere, the testimony of the grace of the gospel maintains the great eternal principles of the nature and glory of God, and His relations according to that glory with men; but even in the pains the apostle takes that the assembly may be cared for and guarded, during his absence, from the assaults of the enemy and from disorder and improprieties within; it is not of its internal privileges that he speaks.<a name=113:7></a> God is set before us, and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=113:8></a> God, in the majesty of His immutable truth, in His relations with men as such, and in the revelation of Himself in the flesh -- God was in Christ, reconciling the world; dwelling in the assembly, in order that it should present and maintain the truth before the world -- the truth (as we have seen) with regard to Christ, of the revelation of God in Him.<a name=113:9></a> God desires to be in relation with men: it is thus that He accomplishes it.<a name=113:10></a> The assembly maintains the rights of the Creator and Saviour-God on the earth.<a name=113:11></a> The assembly itself must be maintained in moral order, that it may confront the enemy who is in the world, and be able to sustain this testimony.<a name=113:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the restraint of the fear of God was lost, and the door opened to licence and dissoluteness.<a name=114:4></a> The Spirit of God warned the assembly of this, and the faithful apostle communicates it to Timothy and through him puts the faithful on their guard.<a name=114:5></a> He does not therefore speak of privilege.<a name=114:6></a> Faithful to the glory of God, he returns to the first principles of His glory, and maintains the incontestable rights of the one and only God; faithful to God, not making boast of his knowledge, but seeking in love to guard the assembly from all departure from God.<a name=114:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not confound the few here who forsake the faith with the general apostasy of 2 Thessalonians.<a name=114:8></a> Here a few depart from the truth, seduced by demons; and the assembly still subsists to be guarded from the invasion of these hurtful principles.<a name=114:9></a> Quite another thing is the general apostasy, and the manifestation of the man of sin, which is not mentioned here at all.<a name=114:10></a>

		Here we have the faithfulness which repels error by truth, reminding the brethren of the latter, in order that they may not be seduced.<a name=114:11></a> There it is the manifestation of the one who sits in the temple of God, and who is destroyed by the brightness of the Lord's presence.<a name=114:12></a> Here all that had to be done was to recall in simplicity the goodness of the Creator, and that His gifts, received with thanksgiving, were always good, and not to be refused: assuredly not that they were to use them for the gratification of their lusts, but as sanctified by the word of God, which brought them to us as God's gifts, and by prayer, which connects us with God in using them.<a name=114:13></a> They were to be received as from Him, as the gift of His hand; and they were sanctified, as is the case with everything that comes from

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This in fact the apostle shews in that which follows.<a name=115:6></a> By teaching thus Timothy would be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished in the truth: bodily exercise profited little, but godliness much -- both here below and for eternity; warning him again against the idle and profitless speculation of the human mind, to the danger of which he continually recurs.<a name=115:7></a> It is for this doctrine of God -- true and worthy of all acceptation -- that the apostle laboured and suffered reproach; because he had faith in the living God, who, by His providence and by His supreme power,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:115">footnote</a></i>) governed, preserved, and took care of all men, and especially of those that believed.<a name=115:8></a> It was this same only God, Creator and Saviour, in whom he trusted while labouring for the Lord.<a name=115:9></a> Timothy was to teach this and enforce it with authority.<a name=115:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Afterwards, in connection with this authoritative instruction, the apostle speaks of the person and position of Timothy himself.<a name=115:11></a> He was young, but he was to maintain his place, and gain by his conduct that weight which years did not yet give him.<a name=115:12></a> He was to be an example to the believers, and occupy himself, till Paul came, with reading, exhortation, and instruction.<a name=115:13></a> Moreover, in his case God had given a special preparation for his work; he was not to forget or neglect it.<a name=115:14></a> A gift had been imparted to him: God had pointed him out to this end by prophecy; and this immediate testimony from God, to which the operation of His power was united, had been accompanied by the seal of testimony from man, that is, that of the elders among the Christians (compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:1">Acts  13:1</a> - 3).<a name=115:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=116>[Page 116]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus all things concurred to strengthen Timothy in his service, and in the authority that he exercised at that moment in place of the apostle.<a name=116:1></a> He should always present the weight of an irreproachable conduct, which would have its influence over hearts and consciences; but he was inwardly strengthened by the consciousness of having been formally set apart by God for the work; the gift of God had been imparted to him, and the sanction of all that had weight in the assembly had been laid, as a seal, upon him.<a name=116:2></a> Thus strengthened, he was to devote himself to the things of the Lord in such a manner, that his progress should be evident to all men -- a demonstration of his communion with the Lord.<a name=116:3></a> At the same time he was to take heed to himself and to the doctrine, and that continually, which should be the means of salvation both to himself and to those who heard him.<a name=116:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus considered the labourer, the apostle returns to the details of the work, in which Timothy was to display his diligence and watchful care.<a name=116:5></a> Everywhere here the subject is that which is suitable outwardly to an upright walk, that which is seemly, whether with regard to the position of individuals, or with respect to the world.<a name=116:6></a> The apostle speaks of elders; of widows, of that which is becoming for younger widows; of the honour due to faithful elders, those among them especially who were teachers also.<a name=116:7></a> There is nothing inward, nothing of the soul's relationships to God; but everything refers to the public testimony which suited the position of men in this world before God.<a name=116:8></a> It is important to remark this, that although our joy lies in our heavenly privileges, in our communion, yet we can never with impunity neglect ordinary duties or moral proprieties; we must take knowledge of the practical dangers that would beset us, owing to that which the flesh is.<a name=116:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may notice that provision was made for all widows who had no relatives able to maintain them; and also that there were elders who did not teach.<a name=116:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Against an elder, Timothy was not to receive an accusation, unless there were two or three witnesses.<a name=116:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this bears testimony to the fact, that the apostle gives these directions with a view to outward order; for the maintenance of that which is respectable in the eyes of all, and of respect for all that ought to be respected.<a name=116:12></a> At the same time, Timothy was to be careful not to give by the laying on of hands his

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sanction to any one who did not offer moral guarantees that, in the position he had taken, he deserved this mark of respect from others.<a name=117:1></a> It would be, on Timothy's part, to become a partaker in the sins of which such a one might be guilty.<a name=117:2></a> He was not to lay hands hastily on any one.<a name=117:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some men's sins were open, and proclaimed beforehand the judgment that awaited them.<a name=117:4></a> The sins of others were hidden: they would find them again at the great day.<a name=117:5></a> But this was a reason why he should do nothing in his charge with precipitation; he was also to keep himself pure.<a name=117:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Timothy's habitual temperance is here seen: weak in body, the apostle recommends him to use his liberty by taking a little wine -- a pleasing instance of grace.<a name=117:7></a> We have here a proof of the habits of this faithful servant.<a name=117:8></a> The Spirit shews us how carefully he kept himself from exciting or satisfying his passions in the least thing (at the same time that there is perfect liberty to use everything that is good when there is a true reason for it), and also the apostle's tender interest in his fellow-labourer in the gospel.<a name=117:9></a> It is a little parenthesis attached to the expression, "be not a partaker of other men's sins", but it has great beauty.<a name=117:10></a> This affectionate watchfulness became the apostle; he desired holiness in his representative, but he well knew how to respect Timothy, and to maintain the decorum which he had enjoined, and to exhibit his heartfelt tenderness.<a name=117:11></a> The 24th verse is connected with the 22nd.<a name=117:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then goes equally into detail with regard to servants, that is, slaves.<a name=117:13></a> They were to respect their masters, in order that the doctrine of the Lord should not be blasphemed.<a name=117:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the masters were believers, there was naturally more familiarity, for they were one in Christ, and thence the danger (for the flesh is crafty) that the servants might not treat their masters with the respect due to them.<a name=117:15></a> The apostle guards against this abuse of christian love, and of the just intimacy and confidence which ought to exist between brethren; but which, on the contrary, was a motive for the servant to render all honour to his master, by treating him with more love and with the same respect.<a name=117:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was necessary that the apostle should be firm.<a name=117:17></a> All other instruction -- all refusal to receive the wholesome words of christian doctrine, the words of Christ and the doctrine which is according to practical godliness -- proceeded from the flesh, from human pride in those who wished to take advantage of

	<div class="paragraph">
		godliness, and make it a means of gain.<a name=118:1></a> From such persons Timothy was to turn away.<a name=118:2></a> Godliness was indeed gain, if they were contented with what they had; and the Christian, who does not belong to this world, if he has food and raiment, ought to be content therewith.<a name=118:3></a> He brought nothing into this world, and will certainly carry nothing out of it.<a name=118:4></a> And the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil.<a name=118:5></a> Seduced by this covetousness, some had wandered away from christian faith, and had pierced their hearts with sorrow.<a name=118:6></a> The desire to be rich was the path of snares and temptation, of foolish and hurtful lusts.<a name=118:7></a> Timothy was to flee these things, as a man of God.<a name=118:8></a> This is always the thought here: he was in the world on the part of God; he represented Him for his part in the work.<a name=118:9></a> He was therefore to follow after other things than earthly riches -- the character of a man of God -- righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness: these were the things which, in man, presented God to the world and glorified Him.<a name=118:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile there was conflict: he must fight the good fight of faith.<a name=118:11></a> If anyone represents God in the world, there must be warfare, because the enemy is there.<a name=118:12></a> The energy of faith was also necessary, in order to lay hold of eternal life in the midst of the seduction and difficulties which the "things that are seen" presented.<a name=118:13></a> God, moreover, had called Timothy to this, and he had made a good confession before many witnesses.<a name=118:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the apostle charges him most solemnly in the presence of God, the Source of life for all things, and of Christ Jesus who had Himself borne witness without wavering before the powers of this world, placing him under the responsibility of keeping the commandment without spot, unrebukeable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=118:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be noticed here that, as Paul had not spoken in the epistle of the privileges of the assembly, but of its responsibility, so neither does he here speak of its being caught up but of its manifestation, when the fruits of faithfulness (or of failure in it) will be gathered, and every one be in his place in the visible glory according to his work.<a name=118:16></a> All are like Christ, all enter into His joy; but to sit at His right and left hand in His kingdom is the portion of those for whom it is prepared by His Father, who bestows it according to the work which He has granted each to perform, giving him power to accomplish it, although in grace He reckons it as our own.<a name=118:17></a> Christ Himself is here viewed as the faithful man (verse 13), whom God will manifest

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This character of the epistle is very remarkable.<a name=119:4></a> Nowhere else is the inaccessible majesty of God, as God, thus presented.<a name=119:5></a> His character is often the subject of instruction and manifestation.<a name=119:6></a> Here He alone has essential immortality.<a name=119:7></a> He dwells in inaccessible light.<a name=119:8></a> He is ever invisible to the eyes of men.<a name=119:9></a> He alone has power.<a name=119:10></a> He has dominion over all who reign.<a name=119:11></a> It is God in the abstraction of His essence, in the proper immutability of His being, in the rights of His majesty, veiled to all men.<a name=119:12></a>

		I do not doubt that, in the manner in which the apostle here sets God before us, he refers to the foolish imaginations to which, under the influence of the enemy, men were abandoning themselves.<a name=120:3></a> Thus he speaks of these with relation to the majesty of His Being as the one only God in whom is all fulness, and with regard to the sobriety of practical morality, which keeps the heart under the influence of that truth, and apart from the false and vain speculations in which the pride of man indulged itself.<a name=120:4></a> He maintained souls by the majesty of the only God, in the practical sobriety in which peace dwells.<a name=120:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second epistle to Timothy has a very peculiar character.<a name=121:1></a> It is the expression of his heart, who outside Palestine had, under God, founded and built the assembly of God on earth, and it was written in sight of its failure, and its departure from the principles on which he had established it.<a name=121:2></a> God remained faithful; His foundation was sure and immovable; but the work committed into the hands of men was already enfeebled and decaying.<a name=121:3></a> The consciousness of this state of things, which moreover betrayed itself in the way in which the apostle himself was then forsaken, oppressed his heart; and he pours it out into the bosom of his faithful Timothy.<a name=121:4></a> By this means the Spirit instructs us in the solemn truth, that the church has not kept its first estate, and sets before us the ways of safety for those who seek God, and desire to please Him, in such a state of things as this.<a name=121:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John gives the history of the fall of the assembly here below, and of its judgment, and that of the world likewise.<a name=121:6></a> He also sets before us a life which, apart from all questions of the assembly's condition, abides ever the same, which renders us capable of enjoying God, and makes us resemble Him in His nature and character.<a name=121:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a witness John was to remain until the Lord came: but Paul sees for himself the ruin of that which he had built and watched over so faithfully.<a name=121:8></a> He had spent himself for the assembly, accomplishing that which was behind of the sufferings of Christ; and he had to see that which he had so much loved (which he had cared for even as a mother cherishes her nursling which he had planted as God's plant on the earth) grow feeble as to its condition and testimony in the world, depart from the source of strength, and become corrupt.<a name=121:9></a> What a painful experience!<a name=121:10></a> But it is that of the servant of God in all ages and in all dispensations.<a name=121:11></a> He sees indeed the power of God acting to plant the testimony on earth, but he sees that men soon fail in it.<a name=121:12></a> The house inhabited by the Holy Ghost becomes dilapidated and in disorder.<a name=121:13></a> Nevertheless (and we love to repeat it with the apostle) the sure foundation of the Lord abides for ever.<a name=121:14></a> Whatever may be the condition of the whole company, the individual is always to depart from

	<div class="paragraph">
		Truth as it was taught by the apostles and expressed by them, the manner in which they presented the truth, "the form of sound words", is the inspired expression of that which God was pleased to reveal; and that, in all the relationships in which the truth is linked together, in all its different parts, according to the living nature and power of God, who is necessarily its centre as He is its source.<a name=127:7></a> Nothing except revelation could be this expression.<a name=127:8></a> God expresses everything as it is, and in a living way; and by His word all exists.<a name=127:9></a> He is the source and the centre of all things.<a name=127:10></a> All flow from Him -- are in relation with a living Person, namely Himself, who is their source, from whom all hold their existence.<a name=127:11></a> This existence only subsists in connection with Him; and the relationship of all things to Him, and between themselves, is found in the expression of His mind -- in that measure at least in which He puts Himself in relation with man in all these things.<a name=127:12></a> If evil comes in, as regards will or its consequences in judgment, it is because this relationship is broken; and the relationship that is broken is the measure of the evil.<a name=127:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we consider the word, the more we shall see its importance.<a name=128:2></a> Analogously to Christ the living Word, it has its source on high, and reveals what is there, and is perfectly adapted to man down here, giving a perfect rule according to what is up there, and, if we are spiritual, leading us up there: our conversation is in heaven.<a name=128:3></a> We must distinguish between the relationship in which man stood as child of Adam, and as child of God.<a name=128:4></a> The law is the perfect expression of the requirements of the former, the rule of life to him; it is found to be to death.<a name=128:5></a> Once we are sons of God, the life of the Son of God as man down here becomes our rule of life.<a name=128:6></a> "Be ye imitators of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ hath loved us".<a name=128:7></a>

		In His nature, as the author of all existence, and the centre of all authority and subsistence outside Himself, God is the centre of all, and the upholder of all.<a name=128:8></a> As to His counsels, Christ is the centre, and here man has a peculiar place; wisdom's good pleasure was eternally in Him, and all is to be under His feet.<a name=128:9></a> In order that the nature and the counsels of God should not be separated (which indeed is impossible, but what was in His counsels in order that it might not be), God became man.<a name=128:10></a> Christ is God made manifest in flesh, the Word made flesh.<a name=128:11></a> Thus the divine nature, the expression of that nature, is found in that which is the object of His counsels, that which forms their centre.<a name=128:12></a> Thus Christ is the truth -- is the centre of all existing relationships: all have reference to Him.<a name=128:13></a> We are, through Him, for Him, or we are against Him; all subsist by Him.<a name=128:14></a> If we are judged, it is as His enemies.<a name=128:15></a> He is the life (spiritually) of all that enjoy the communication of the divine nature; even as He sustains all that exists.<a name=128:16></a> His manifestation brings to light the true position of all things.<a name=128:17></a> Thus He is the truth.<a name=128:18></a> All that He says, being the words of God, are spirit and life; quickening, acting according to grace, judging with regard to the responsibility of His creatures.<a name=128:19></a>

		But there is yet more than this.<a name=128:20></a> He is the revelation of love.<a name=128:21></a> God is love, and in Jesus love is in action and is known by the heart that knows Him.<a name=128:22></a> The heart that knows Him lives in love, and knows love in God.<a name=128:23></a> But He is also the object in whom God is revealed to us, and has become the object of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus faith and love have their birth, their source, in the object which by grace has created them in the soul: the object in which it has learnt what love is, and with regard to which faith is exercised.<a name=129:5></a> By Him we believe in God.<a name=129:6></a> No one has ever seen God: the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has revealed Him.<a name=129:7></a>

		But there is another aspect of the accomplishment of the work and of the counsels of God, which we have not yet spoken of: that is, the communication of the truth and of the knowledge of God.<a name=129:10></a> This is the work of the Holy Ghost, in which the truth and the life are united, for we are begotten by the word.<a name=129:11></a> It is divine energy in the Deity, acting in all that connects God with the creature or the creature with God.<a name=129:12></a> Acting in divine perfection as God, in union with the Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost reveals the counsels of which we have spoken, and makes them effectual in the heart, according to the purpose of the Father, and by the revelation of the Person and work of the Son.<a name=129:13></a> I have said, divine energy, not as a theological definition -- which is not my object here -- but as a practical truth, for, while attributing all that regards the creature to the Father (except judgment, which is entirely committed to the Son, because He is the Son of man) and to the Son, the immediate action in creation and on the creature, wherever it takes place, is attributed to the Spirit.<a name=129:14></a>

		When the power of the Spirit of God produces the truth, it develops itself in union with its source, whether in revelation or even in the life and in the service of the individual; although in the two latter cases there is a mixture of other elements, owing to the weakness of the man.<a name=132:7></a> When a man's mind apprehends the truth, and he seeks to give it a form, he does it according to the capacity of man, which is not its source; the truth as he expresses it, even were it pure, is separated in him from its source and its totality; but, besides this, the shape that a man gives it always bears the stamp of the man's weakness.<a name=132:8></a> He has only apprehended it partially, and he only produces a part of it.<a name=132:9></a> Accordingly it is no longer the truth.<a name=132:10></a> Moreover, when he separates it from the whole circle of truth in which God has placed it, he must necessarily clothe it in a new form, in a garment which proceeds from man: at once error mixes with it.<a name=132:11></a> Thus it is no longer a vital part of the whole, it is partial, and thereby not the truth; and it is in fact mixed with error.<a name=132:12></a> That is theology.<a name=132:13></a>

		When the Holy Ghost acts energetically and triumphs over the power of the enemy, these individuals who are gathered together in the assembly develop their life in it according to God and His presence, and the spiritual power which exists in the whole body acts upon the conscience, if needed, and guides the heart of the believer: so that the individual and the assembly flow on together under the same influence.<a name=141:17></a> The Holy Ghost, who is present in the assembly, sustains the individual at the height of God's own presence.<a name=141:18></a> Strangers even are obliged to confess that God is there.<a name=141:19></a> Love and holiness reign.<a name=141:20></a> When the effect of this power is no longer found in the assembly, and by degrees Christendom no longer answers to the character of the assembly as God formed it, yet the responsibility of the individual to God has not ceased on that account.<a name=141:21></a> It can never either cease or diminish, for the authority and the rights of God Himself over the soul are at stake.<a name=141:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which follows shews the sanctifying character of this exhortation.<a name=142:11></a> The apostle says, "Flee also youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=142:12></a> This is to breathe the pure atmosphere which is found in the Lord's presence; in which the soul enjoys health and strength.<a name=142:13></a> All that corrupts is far away.<a name=142:14></a> And, further, we find, what is so often contested, that we can and are to distinguish those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=142:15></a> We do not decide who are the Lord's: He knows them.<a name=142:16></a> But we are to associate ourselves with those who manifest themselves, such as call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=142:17></a> Those I am to know, own, and walk with.<a name=142:18></a> The statement that I cannot know who these are, is in defiance of an express rule of scripture, applicable to a state where, through corruption, many who may possess Christianity are not so manifested.<a name=142:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of God is not a thing of human understanding; it is the revelation of that which God is, and of His counsels.<a name=143:4></a> Now we cannot have to do with God without the heart and conscience being engaged.<a name=143:5></a> It is not the revelation to us of God, if this is not the case.<a name=143:6></a> Christians are brought into connection with the divine Being Himself, and in acts which ought to have the most powerful effect on the heart and conscience; if they do not, both the one and the other are in a bad state and hardened.<a name=143:7></a> The Spirit of God, no doubt, acts on the understanding and by it; but the truth lodged in it is addressed to the conscience and to the heart, and if these are not reached by the truth, nothing is done.<a name=143:8></a> Nor indeed is anything really understood till they are.<a name=143:9></a> For in divine truth things are understood before words, as "born again" (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:43">John  8:43</a>).<a name=143:10></a> On the other hand, by means of error, by occupying the mind with the error, Satan shuts God out of it, and leads the whole man captive, so that he does the will of that enemy to the soul.<a name=143:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this evil influence would too surely be exercised.<a name=143:12></a> The power of the holy truth of God would be lost in the assembly and among Christians; and those who bore this name would become (under the influence of the enemy) the expression of the will and passions of man, while still maintaining the forms of godliness; a peculiar condition, which betrays in a remarkable way the influence and the work of the enemy.<a name=143:13></a> This was to be expected; and they would be perilous days.<a name=143:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The open opposition of the enemy is doubtless a painful thing, but he deceives souls by the specious appearances of which the apostle here speaks -- that which bears the name of Christianity, that which before men has the character of godliness, and which the flesh will accept as such much more readily than that which, because it is true godliness, is contrary to the flesh.<a name=143:15></a> Nevertheless all the worst features of the human heart are linked with the name of Christianity.<a name=143:16></a> What then does the testimony become?<a name=143:17></a> It is, so to speak, an individual prophecy, clothed in sackcloth.<a name=143:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark here that which evidences the sad and dangerous character of the days of which the apostle is speaking If we compare the lists of sins and abominations, which Paul gives at the beginning of the epistle to the Romans, as characterising heathen life and the moral degradation of men during those times of darkness and demon-worship, with the catalogue of sins that characterise those who have the form of godliness, we shall find that it is nearly the same, and morally quite the same; only that some of the open sins which mark the man who has no outward restraint are wanting here, the form of godliness precluding them and taking their place.<a name=144:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a solemn thought, that the same degradation which existed among heathens is reproduced under Christianity, covering itself with that name, and even assuming the form of godliness.<a name=144:8></a> But in fact it is the same nature, the same passions, the same power of the enemy, with but the addition of hypocrisy.<a name=144:9></a> It is only the departure from, and corruption of, the true doctrine of the Mediator; as Paganism was that of the true doctrine of the only God.<a name=144:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Different directions are given for the conduct of the man of God, with regard to the vessels unto dishonour, and the men who act in the spirit of the last days.<a name=144:11></a> From the former he is to purge himself: he is to think of faithfulness in his own walk; and by cleansing himself from those vessels which do not honour the name of Christ, which (although in the great house) do not bear the stamp of a pure desire for His glory, he shall be a vessel unto honour, fit for the Master's use.<a name=144:12></a> By keeping apart from such vessels, he is sheltered from the influences that impoverish and degrade the testimony he has to render to

		In the other case -- that of the men who gave the character of "perilous" to the last days, the corrupt opposers of the truth, bearing the name of godliness -- with regard to these his testimony is to be distinct and plain.<a name=145:2></a> Here he is not merely to cleanse himself; he testifies his moral abhorrence, his loathing, of those who, being the instruments of the enemy, bear this character of formal piety.<a name=145:3></a> He turns away from them, and leaves them to the judgment of God.<a name=145:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Timothy had the walk and spirit of the apostle for his pattern.<a name=145:5></a> He had been much with him; he had seen, in times of trial, his patience and his sufferings, the persecutions he had endured; but the Lord had delivered him out of all.<a name=145:6></a> It would be the same with all who sought to live according to godliness, which is in Christ Jesus:(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:145">footnote</a></i>) they should endure persecution.<a name=145:7></a> Evil men and seducers would wax worse and worse, deceiving others, and being, at the same time, deceived themselves.<a name=145:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of the last days is strongly marked here, and gives no hope for Christianity as a whole.<a name=145:9></a> The progress of evil is described as developing itself in two distinct characters, to which we have already alluded.<a name=145:10></a> The great house -- Christendom as a whole -- in which there are vessels to dishonour, from which we are to purge ourselves, and the positive activity of corruption, and of the instruments who propagate it and resist the truth, although they who corrupt themselves assume the form of godliness.<a name=145:11></a> Under this last aspect the wicked will go on growing worse and worse; nevertheless the hand of God in power will demonstrate their folly.<a name=145:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may distinguish, in this second category, the general character of pride and corruptness in all who submit to this malignant influence, and those who themselves labour to extend it.<a name=145:13></a> Of the latter of this class, the apostle says, are they who creep into houses.<a name=145:14></a> The character is that of the mass who are seduced; but there are seducers.<a name=145:15></a> These resist the truth, and their folly shall be manifested.<a name=145:16></a> It may be that God may demonstrate it, wherever there is faithfulness, in order to save His own from it; but, in general, their evil work will go on, and the seduction grow worse and worse, until the end, when God will

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then tells Timothy of the safeguard on which he may rely to preserve himself, through grace, stedfast in the truth, and in the enjoyment of the salvation of God.<a name=146:2></a> Security rests upon the certainty of the immediate origin of the doctrine which he had received; and upon the scriptures received, as authentic and inspired documents, which announced the will, the acts, the counsels, and even the nature of God.<a name=146:3></a> We abide in that which we have learnt, because we know from whom we have learnt it.<a name=146:4></a> The principle is simple and very important.<a name=146:5></a> We advance in divine knowledge, but (so far as we are taught of God) we never give up, for new opinions, that which we have learnt from an immediately divine source, knowing that it is so.<a name=146:6></a> By a source immediately divine, I mean, a person to whom God Himself has communicated the truth by revelation with authority to promulgate it.<a name=146:7></a> In this case I receive what he says (when I know him to be such) as a divine communication.<a name=146:8></a> It is true that the scriptures always remain as a counter proof, but when -- as in the case of the apostles -- a man is proved to be the minister of God, gifted by Him for the purpose of communicating His mind, I receive what he says in the exercise of his ministry as coming from God.<a name=146:9></a> It is not the assembly that is in view in this case.<a name=146:10></a> It cannot be the vessel of divine truth directly communicated to it from God.<a name=146:11></a> Individuals are always that.<a name=146:12></a> We have seen that its part is to confess the truth when communicated, not to communicate it.<a name=146:13></a> But we here speak of a person to whom and by whom God immediately reveals the truth -- such as the apostles and prophets.<a name=146:14></a> God has communicated to them, as elect vessels for this purpose, that which He desired to communicate to the world, and they have so communicated.<a name=146:15></a> None could do it who had not received it himself from God as a revelation: if this is not the case, the man himself has some part in it.<a name=146:16></a> I could not then say, "I know of whom I have learnt it", as knowing that it came immediately from God and by divine revelation.<a name=146:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God had something to communicate to the assembly itself, He did it by means of such persons as Paul, Peter, etc.<a name=146:18></a> The assembly is composed of individuals; it cannot receive a divine revelation in a mass, as the assembly, except it be by hearing in common a divine voice, which is not God's way.<a name=146:19></a>

		Here, then, is the first foundation of certainty, strength, and assurance for the man of God with regard to divine truth.<a name=147:5></a> It has not been revealed to him immediately.<a name=147:6></a> It was Paul and other instruments, whom God chose for this special favour.<a name=147:7></a> But he knows of whom he has learnt it; even of one (here it was Paul) to whom it had been directly made known by inspiration, and who has authority from God to impart; so that they who learn of him know that it is divine truth, exactly as God communicated it (compare <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>), and in the form in which He was pleased to communicate it.<a name=147:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another means, which has a character of its own; the scriptures, which are as such the foundation of faith to the man of God, and which direct him in all his ways.<a name=147:9></a> The Lord Jesus Himself said (speaking of Moses), "If ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=147:10></a>" His words were the words of God; He does not contrast the authority of what He said with that of the written word, but the means of communication.<a name=147:11></a> God has been pleased to employ that means as a permanent authority.<a name=147:12></a> Peter says "No prophecy of scripture .<a name=147:13></a>.<a name=147:14></a>.<a name=147:15></a>".<a name=147:16></a> There have been many prophecies which are not written; they had the authority of God for those persons to whom they were addressed.<a name=147:17></a> For the word speaks more than once of prophets -- who must therefore have prophesied -- without communicating their prophecies to us.<a name=147:18></a> They were instruments for making known the will of God, at the moment, in order to guide His people in their actual circumstances, without its being a revelation necessary to the people of God at all times, or applicable either to the world, to Israel, or to the assembly in all ages.<a name=147:19></a> It was not a general and permanent revelation from God for the instruction of the soul at all periods.<a name=147:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A multitude of things, spoken by Jesus Himself, are not reproduced in the scriptures; so that it is not only a question of from whom we have heard a truth, but also of the character of that which has been communicated.<a name=147:21></a> When it is for the permanent profit of the people or the assembly of God, God caused it to be written in the scriptures, and it abides for the instruction and the food of His children in all ages.<a name=147:22></a>

		The expression, "knowing of whom thou hast learned them", establishes us on personal apostolic authority, viewing the apostles as teachers authorised by the Lord.<a name=148:1></a> John says, "They who are of God hear us".<a name=148:2></a> It is not necessary that scripture should be written by apostles; God has made known therein His will and the truth, and has committed the sacred deposit to His people for the profit of all ages.<a name=148:3></a> The scriptures have authority as such.<a name=148:4></a> And it is not that which, as a spiritual man, one may receive from them, that by which we have profited (as to application to one's soul that is indeed all); but it is the entire holy scripture, such as we possess it, which has this authority.<a name=148:5></a>

		From his childhood Timothy had read the holy scriptures; and these writings, such as he had read them as a child, guarded him -- as divine authority -- against error, and furnished him with the divine truths needful for his instruction.<a name=148:6></a> To use them aright, faith in Christ was requisite: but that which he used was the scripture known from his youth.<a name=148:7></a> The important thing to observe here is that the apostle is speaking of the scriptures, as they are in themselves, such as a child reads them; not even of that which a converted or spiritual man finds in them, but simply the holy writings themselves.<a name=148:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may perhaps be said, that Timothy as a child possessed only the Old Testament.<a name=148:9></a> Agreed: but what we have here is the character of all that has a right to be called holy scripture As Peter says as to the writings of Paul, these, "They wrest; as they do also THE OTHER SCRIPTURES".<a name=148:10></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:148">footnote</a></i>) From the moment that we acknowledge the New Testament as having a title to that name, its writings possess the same character and have the same authority as the Old Testament.<a name=148:11></a>

		Does this perfect and supreme authority of the scriptures set aside ministry?<a name=149:9></a> By no means; it is the foundation of the ministry of the word.<a name=149:10></a> One is a minister of the word; one proclaims the word -- resting on the written word -- which is authority for all, and the warrant for all that a minister says, and imparting to his words the authority of God over the conscience of those whom he teaches or exhorts.<a name=149:11></a> There is, in addition to this, the activity of love in the heart of him who exercises this ministry (if it be real), and the powerful action of the Spirit, if he be filled with the Holy Ghost.<a name=149:12></a> But that which the word says silences all opposition in the heart or mind of the believer.<a name=149:13></a>
	</div>

		He who does not submit to the words of God thereby shews himself to be a rebel against God.<a name=149:15></a> The rule given of God is in the scriptures; the energetic action of His Spirit is in ministry, although God can equally act upon the heart immediately by the word itself.<a name=149:16></a> Nevertheless ministry, since the revelations of God were completed, could not be an authority, or there would be two authorities; and if two, one must be a needless repetition of the other, or else, if they differed, no authority at all.<a name=149:17></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, that the apostle insists, as a matter of responsibility, that Timothy should devote himself to his ministry with so much the more energy that the assembly was declining, and self-will in Christians was gaining the ascendancy; not that he throws any doubt upon its being a constant duty to do so at all times, whether happy or unhappy.<a name=150:4></a> The apostle, as we have seen, has two different periods in view; the decline of the assembly, which had already begun, and the still worse condition that was yet future.<a name=150:5></a> The special application of the exhortation here is to the first period, "Be instant", he says, "in season, out of season .<a name=150:6></a>.<a name=150:7></a>.<a name=150:8></a> for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine .<a name=150:9></a>.<a name=150:10></a>.<a name=150:11></a> and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables".<a name=150:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In how positive and distinct a way the apostle sets the fall of the assembly before us!<a name=150:13></a> Its impaired condition in his day was to him but a point of progress (according to his judgment in the Spirit) towards a yet more entire fall; when, although still calling itself christian, the mass of those who assumed the name of Christ would no longer endure the sound doctrine of the Holy Ghost.<a name=150:14></a> But, come what might, labouring with patience and diligence and energy as long as they would hearken, he was to be watchful, to endure afflictions, to seek after souls still unconverted (a great proof of faith when the heart is burdened with the unfaithfulness of those within), and fully to exercise his ministry; with this additional motive, that apostolic energy was disappearing from the scene (chapter 4: 6).<a name=150:15></a>

		But there is yet something to notice at the beginning of this chapter.<a name=150:16></a> Fulness of grace, it is apparent, does not here characterise the epistle.<a name=150:17></a> His exhortation to Timothy is "before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the quick and dead at his appearing and his kingdom".<a name=150:18></a> We have already spoken of this: the appearing of Jesus is in connection with responsibility; His coming is with the object of calling us to Himself in connection with our privileges.<a name=150:19></a> Here it is the first of these two cases; not the assembly, or the Father's house, but God the appearing, and the kingdom.<a name=150:20></a> All that is in relation to

	<div class="paragraph">
		This has an important place in scriptural instruction with regard to the life of the apostle.<a name=154:6></a> Paul was lost, so to speak, for the greater part, in the power of the Spirit; but when alone, with sober mind, he occupies himself intelligently and carefully about the things of God.<a name=154:7></a>

		It is evident that this epistle was written when the apostle thought his departure near at hand, and when the faith of Christians had grievously declined, which was proved by their having forsaken the apostle.<a name=155:4></a> His faith was sustained by grace.<a name=155:5></a> He did not hide from himself that all was going wrong: his heart felt it -- was broken by it; he saw that it would grow worse and worse.<a name=155:6></a> But his own testimony stood firm; he was strong for the Lord through grace.<a name=155:7></a> The strength of the Lord was with him to confess Christ, and to exhort Timothy to so much the more diligent and devoted an exercise of his ministry, because the days were evil.<a name=155:8></a>

		May we remember this.<a name=155:12></a> Insensibility to the state of the assembly is not a proof that we are near the Lord, or that we have confidence in Him; but in the consciousness of this ruin, faith, the sense of what Christ is, will give confidence in Him amidst the ruin which we mourn.<a name=155:13></a> Nevertheless it will be observed, that the apostle speaks here of the individual, of righteousness, of judgment, and not of the assembly.<a name=155:14></a> If the latter is spoken of outwardly as the great house, it contains vessels to dishonour, from which we are to purge ourselves.<a name=155:15></a> Yet the apostle foresaw a still worse state of things -- which has now set in.<a name=155:16></a> But the Lord can never fail in His faithfulness.<a name=155:17></a>

		TITUS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to Titus is occupied with the maintenance of order in the churches of God.<a name=156:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The especial object of those written to Timothy was the maintenance of sound doctrine, although speaking of other things with regard to which the apostle gives directions for the conduct of Timothy.<a name=156:2></a> This the apostle himself tells us.<a name=156:3></a> In the first epistle to Timothy we see that Paul had left his beloved son in the faith at Ephesus, in order to watch that no other doctrine was preached there; the assembly is the pillar and support of the truth.<a name=156:4></a> In the second epistle we find the means by which Christians are to be strengthened in the truth, when the mass have departed from it.<a name=156:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, in Titus, the apostle says expressly that he had left him in Crete to set in order things that were yet wanting, and to establish elders in every city.<a name=156:6></a> Although more or less the same dangers presented themselves to the mind of Paul as when writing to Timothy, yet we find that the apostle enters at once upon his subject, with a calmness which shews that his mind was not pre-occupied in the same way with those dangers, and that the Spirit could engage him more entirely with the ordinary walk of the assembly; so that this epistle is much more simple in its character.<a name=156:7></a> The walk that becomes Christians, with regard to the maintenance of order in their relationships to each other, and the great principles on which this walk is founded, form the subject of the book.<a name=156:8></a> The state of the assembly comes but little before us.<a name=156:9></a> Truths that flow more entirely from the christian revelation, and that characterise it, have more place in this epistle than in those addressed to Timothy.<a name=156:10></a> On the other hand, prophecies concerning the future condition of Christianity, and the development of the decline that had already commenced, are not repeated here.<a name=156:11></a> While stating in a remarkable way certain truths with respect to Christianity, the tone of the epistle is more calm, more ordinary.<a name=156:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The promise of life is particularly spoken of here as well as in Timothy.<a name=156:13></a> Moreover this promise distinguishes Christianity, and the revelation of God (as the Father) in Christ, from Judaism.<a name=156:14></a>

		set forth at the outset.<a name=157:1></a> The faith of the elect, the truth which is according to godliness, the promise before the world began of eternal life, and the manifestation of the word of God through preaching, are the subjects of the introduction.<a name=157:2></a> The title of "Saviour" is here, as in Timothy, added to the name of God as well as to that of Christ.<a name=157:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This introduction is not without importance.<a name=157:4></a> That which it contains is presented to Titus by the apostle as characterising his apostleship, and as the special subject of his ministry.<a name=157:5></a> It was not a development of Judaism, but the revelation of a life and of a promise of life which subsisted (that is, in Christ, the object of the divine counsels) before the world was.<a name=157:6></a> Accordingly faith was found, not in the confession of the Jews, but in the elect brought by grace to the knowledge of the truth.<a name=157:7></a> It was the faith of the elect: this is an important truth, and that which characterises faith in the world.<a name=157:8></a> Others may indeed adopt it as a system; but faith is in itself the faith of the elect.<a name=157:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Among the Jews this was not the case.<a name=157:10></a> The public confession of their doctrine, and confidence in the promises of God, belonged to every one who was born an Israelite.<a name=157:11></a> Others may pretend to the christian faith; but it is the faith of the elect.<a name=157:12></a> Its character is such that human nature neither embraces it nor conceives it, but finds it to be a stumbling-stone.<a name=157:13></a> It discloses a relationship with God, which to nature is inconceivable and at the same time presumptuous and insupportable.<a name=157:14></a> To the elect it is the joy of their soul, the light of their understanding, and the sustainment of their heart.<a name=157:15></a> It places them in a relationship with God which is all that their heart can desire, but which depends entirely on that which God is; and this the believer desires.<a name=157:16></a> It is a personal relationship with God Himself; therefore it is the faith of God's elect.<a name=157:17></a> Hence also it is for all the Gentiles as well as the Jews.<a name=157:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This faith of God's elect has an intimate character in relation to God Himself.<a name=157:19></a> It rests on Him, it knows the secret of His eternal counsels -- that love which made the elect the object of His counsels.<a name=157:20></a> But there is another character connected with it, namely, confession before men.<a name=157:21></a> There is the revealed truth by which God makes Himself known, and claims the submission of man's mind and the homage of his heart.<a name=157:22></a> This truth places the soul in a true relationship with God.<a name=157:23></a> It is truth according to godliness.<a name=157:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The confession of the truth therefore is an important character

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that which formed the hope of this faith was not earthly prosperity, a numerous posterity, the earthly blessing of a people whom God acknowledged as His own.<a name=158:3></a> It was life eternal, promised of God in Christ before the world was, outside the world and the divine government of the world and the development of the character of Jehovah in that government.<a name=158:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was eternal life.<a name=158:5></a> It is in connection with the nature and with the character of God Himself; and, having its source in Him, proceeding from Him, it was the thought of His grace, and declared to be such in Christ, before a world existed into which the first man was introduced in responsibility (his failure in which is his history up to Christ the second Man, and the cross in which He bore its consequences for us, and obtained that eternal life for us in its full glory with Himself), and which was the sphere of the development of God's government over that which was subject to Him -- a very different thing from the communion of a life by which one participates in His nature, and which is its reflection.<a name=158:6></a> This is the hope of the gospel (for we are not speaking of the assembly here), the secret treasure of the faith of the elect, of which the revealed word assures us.<a name=158:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Promised before the world began" is a remarkable and important expression.<a name=158:8></a> One is admitted into the thoughts of God before the existence of this changing and mingled scene, which bears witness of the frailty and sin of the creature -- of the patience of God, and His ways in grace and in government.<a name=158:9></a> Eternal life is connected with the unchangeable nature of God; with counsels which are as abiding as His nature, with His promises, in which He cannot deceive us, and to which He cannot be unfaithful.<a name=158:10></a> Our portion in life existed before the foundation of the world, not only in the counsels of God, not only in the Person of the Son, but in the promises made to the Son as our portion in Him.<a name=158:11></a> It was the subject of those communications from the Father to the Son, of which we were the objects, the Son being their depositary.<a name=158:12></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:158">footnote</a></i>) Marvellous knowledge which has been given us of the heavenly communication

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which the word is becomes also more clear to us through this passage.<a name=159:2></a> The word is the communication, in time, of the eternal thoughts of God Himself in Christ.<a name=159:3></a> It finds man under the power of sin, and reveals peace and deliverance, and it shews how he can have part in the result of God's thoughts.<a name=159:4></a> But these thoughts themselves are nothing else than the plan, the eternal purpose, of His grace in Christ, to bestow on us everlasting life in Christ -- a life which existed in God before the world was.<a name=159:5></a> The word is preached, manifested (that is, the revelation of the thoughts of God in Christ).<a name=159:6></a> Now those thoughts gave us eternal life in Christ; and this was promised before the ages.<a name=159:7></a> The elect, believing, know it, and possess the life itself.<a name=159:8></a> They have the witness in themselves; but the word is the public revelation on which faith is founded, and which has universal authority over the consciences of men, whether they receive it or not.<a name=159:9></a> Just as in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:9">2 Timothy  1:9</a>, 10, it is presented as salvation, but then made manifest.<a name=159:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be observed that faith here, is faith in a personally held, known, truth; a faith which only the elect can have, who possess the truth as God teaches it.<a name=159:11></a> "The faith" is used also for Christianity as a system in contrast with Judaism.<a name=159:12></a> Here it is the secret of God in contrast with a law promulgated to an outward people.<a name=159:13></a> This promise, which dated from before the revealed ages, and which was sovereign in its application, was especially committed to the apostle Paul that he might announce it by preaching.<a name=159:14></a> To Peter the gospel was committed more as the fulfilment of the promises made to the fathers, which Paul also recognises, with the evangelical events that confirmed and developed them by the power of God manifested in the resurrection of Jesus, the witness of the power of this life.<a name=159:15></a>

		Titus, who was not only to appoint others for the purpose, but, being there clothed with authority, was himself to watch over the order and moral walk of the Christians, was charged (as is the case throughout these three epistles) to see that every one, according to his position, walked in agreement with moral and relative propriety -- an important thing, and which shelters from the attacks of Satan, and from confusion in the assembly.<a name=161:13></a> True liberty reigns in the assembly; moral order secures this; and the enemy finds no better occasion to dishonour the Lord and ruin the testimony and throw all into disorder, thus giving the world occasion to blaspheme, than the forgetfulness of grace and holy order among Christians.<a name=161:14></a> Let us not deceive ourselves: if these proprieties are not maintained (and they are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Often, in perceiving that the weakness of man has given occasion to disorder where christian liberty reigns, instead of seeking the true remedy, men have destroyed the liberty; they banish the power and operation of the Spirit -- for where the Spirit is, there is liberty in every sense -- the joy of the new relationships in which all are one.<a name=162:2></a> But, while severing every bond for the Lord's sake when necessary, the Spirit recognises every relationship which God has formed; even when we break them -- as death does -- through the exigency of the call of Christ, which is superior to them all.<a name=162:3></a> But while we are in them (the call of Christ apart), we are to act suitably to the relationship.<a name=162:4></a> Age and youth, husband and wife, child and parent, slave and master, all have their own proprieties to maintain towards each other, a behaviour in accordance with the position in which we stand.<a name=162:5></a>

		"Sound doctrine" takes account of all this, and, in its warnings and exhortations, maintains all these proprieties.<a name=162:6></a> This is the instruction which the apostle here gives to Titus, with regard to aged men, aged women, young women (relatively to their husbands, their children, and their whole life, which should be domestic and modest); young men, to whom Titus was to be always a pattern; slaves, with their masters; and then the duties of all towards magistrates, and indeed towards all men.<a name=162:7></a> But, before taking up this last point, he establishes the great principles which are the foundation of the conduct of the saints amongst themselves in this world.<a name=162:8></a> Their conduct towards magistrates and the world has a different motive.<a name=162:9></a>

		The Holy Ghost does not only give a new nature; He gives it us in connection with an entirely new order of things ("a new creation"), and fills us as to our thoughts with the things that are in this new creation.<a name=166:7></a> This is the reason, that, although we are placed in it once for all, this work -- as to the operation of the Holy Ghost -- continues; because He ever communicates to us more and more of the things of this new world into which He has brought us.<a name=166:8></a> He takes of the things of Christ and shews them to us; and all that the Father has is Christ's.<a name=166:9></a> I think that the "renewing of the Holy Ghost" embraces all this; because He says, "which he has shed on us abundantly".<a name=166:10></a> So that it is not only that we are born of Him, but that He works in us, communicating to us all that is ours in Christ.<a name=166:11></a>

		The Holy Ghost is shed on us abundantly by means of Jesus Christ our Saviour, in order that, having been justified by the grace of this Saviour, we should be heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<a name=166:12></a> I think that the antecedent of "that", verse 7, is "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost"; and that the sentence, "which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", is an accessory parenthesis introduced to shew us that we have the fulness of the enjoyment of these things by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=166:13></a>

		Observe also that we have the two kinds of labourers: those who were in personal connection with the apostle as fellow-labourers, who accompanied him, and whom he sent elsewhere to continue the work he had begun, when he could no longer carry it on himself; and those who laboured freely and independently of him.<a name=168:3></a> But there was no jealousy of this double activity.<a name=168:4></a> He did not neglect the flock that were dear to him He was glad that any who were sound in the faith should water the plants which he himself had planted.<a name=168:5></a> He encourages Titus to shew them all affection, and to provide whatever they needed in their journey.<a name=168:6></a> This thought suggests to him the counsel that follows; namely, that it would be well for Christians to learn how to do useful work in order to supply the wants of others as well as their own.<a name=168:7></a>

		It is a fine picture of the way in which the tenderness and the strength of the love of God, working in the heart, occupies itself with every detail wherein that love might be wounded, or that might be an occasion for its growth and manifestation.<a name=169:3></a> In this point of view the epistle is as important as beautiful; for this development of tender and delicate consideration in the midst of the apostle's gigantic labours, and of the immense truths that formed the basis of relationship between all creatures and God in Christ, gives a very peculiar character to Christianity and shews its divine nature; since He who reveals the most profound truths, and puts them in their right place in the circle of divine thought, does so as speaking of a known thing, as communicating His own thoughts; and can (being the Spirit of the God of love) fill the heart with considerations which love only can suggest, with a dignity which manifests their source, and with a delicacy of application which shews that, whatever be the grandeur of His thoughts, He is at liberty to consider everything.<a name=169:4></a>

		Paul (as was his custom) recognises all the good that was in Philemon, and uses it as a motive to Philemon himself, that he might let the feelings of grace flow out freely, in spite of anything that the return of Onesimus might excite in the flesh or any displeasure that Satan might try to re-awaken in him.<a name=170:12></a> The apostle would have that which he desired for Onesimus to be Philemon's own act.<a name=170:13></a> The enfranchisement of his former slave, or even his kind reception as a brother, would have quite a different bearing in that case, than if it had arisen from a command on the apostle's part; for christian affection and the bonds of love were in question.<a name=170:14></a> He gives due weight to the right he had to command, but only in order to abandon it, and to give more force to his request; and at the same time he suggests that the communion of Philemon's faith with the whole

		It is beautiful to see the mixture of affection for Onesimus -- which shews itself in an anxiety that makes him plead every motive which could act on the heart of Philemon -- with the christian feeling that inspired him with full confidence in the kindly affections of this faithful and excellent brother.<a name=171:3></a> The return of his fugitive slave was indeed likely to stir up something in his natural heart; the apostle interposes his letter on behalf of his dear child in the faith, born in the time of his captivity.<a name=171:4></a> God had interposed the work of His grace, which ought to act on the heart of Philemon, producing altogether new relationships with Onesimus.<a name=171:5></a> The apostle beseeches him to receive his former slave as a brother, but it is evident (verse 12), although Paul wished it to be the spontaneous act of the master whom Onesimus had wronged, that the apostle expected the affranchisement of the latter.<a name=171:6></a> Be that as it may, he takes everything upon himself for his dear son.<a name=171:7></a> According to grace Onesimus was more profitable to Philemon, as well as to Paul, than formerly, when the flesh had made him an unfaithful and valueless servant; and this he should rejoice in (verse 11).<a name=171:8></a> Paul alludes to the name of "Onesimus", which means "profitable".<a name=171:9></a> Finally, he reminds Philemon that he was indebted to him for his own salvation -- for his life as a Christian.<a name=171:10></a>

		HEBREWS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The important nature of the epistle to the Hebrews demands that we should examine it with peculiar care.<a name=173:1></a> It has its own very distinct place.<a name=173:2></a> It is not the presentation of christian position in itself, viewed as the fruit of sovereign grace, and of the work and the resurrection of Christ, or as the result of the union of Christians with Christ, the members of the body with the Head -- a union which gives them the enjoyment of every privilege in Him.<a name=173:3></a> It is an epistle in which one who has apprehended indeed the whole scope of Christianity, considered as placing the Christian in Christ before God, whether individually or as a member of the body, looks nevertheless at the Lord from here below; and presents His Person and His offices as between us and God in heaven, while we are in feebleness on earth, for the purpose of detaching us (as walking on earth) from all that would attach us in a religious way to the earth; even when -- as was the case among the Jews -- the bond had been ordained by God Himself.<a name=173:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle shews us Christ in heaven, and consequently that our religious bonds with God are heavenly, although we are not yet personally in heaven ourselves nor viewed as united to Christ there.<a name=173:5></a> Every bond with the earth is broken, even while we are walking on the earth.<a name=173:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These instructions naturally are given in an epistle addressed to the Jews, because their religious relationships had been earthly, and at the same time solemnly appointed by God Himself.<a name=173:7></a> The heathen, as to their religions, had no formal relationships except with demons.<a name=173:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of the Jews this rupture with the earth was in its nature so much the more solemn, the more absolute and conclusive, from the relationship having been divine.<a name=173:9></a> This relationship was to be fully acknowledged and entirely abandoned, not here because the believer is dead and risen again in Christ, but because Christ in heaven takes the place of all earthly figures and ordinances.<a name=173:10></a> God Himself, who had instituted the ordinances of the law, now established other bonds, different indeed in character; but it was still the same God.<a name=173:11></a>

		being resumed by Him hereafter when the nation shall be, re-established and in the enjoyment of the promises.<a name=174:1></a> Not that this epistle views them as actually on that ground; on the contrary it insists on what is heavenly, and walking by faith as Abraham and others who had not the promises, but it lays down principles which can apply to that position, and in one or two passages it leaves (and ought to leave) a place for this ultimate blessing of the nation.<a name=174:2></a> The epistle to the Romans, in the direct instruction which it furnishes, cannot leave this place for the blessings proper to the Jewish people.<a name=174:3></a> In its point of view all are alike sinners, and all in Christ are justified together before God in heaven.<a name=174:4></a> Still less in the epistle to the Ephesians, with the object which it has in view, could there be room for speaking of the future blessing of God's people on the earth.<a name=174:5></a> It only contemplates Christians as united to their heavenly Head, as His body; or as the habitation of God on earth by the Holy Ghost.<a name=174:6></a> The epistle to the Romans, in the passage that shews the compatibility of this salvation (which, because it was of God, was for all without distinction) with the faithfulness of God to His promises made to the nation, touches the chord of which we speak even more distinctly than the epistle to the Hebrews; and shews us that Israel will -- although in a different way from before -- resume their place in the line peculiar to their heirs of promise; a place which, through their sin, was partially left vacant for a time to allow the bringing in of the Gentiles on the principle of faith into this blessed succession.<a name=174:7></a> We find this in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=174:8></a> But the object in both epistles is to separate the faithful entirely from earth, and to bring them into relationship religiously with heaven; the one (that to the Romans) as regards their personal presentation to God by means of forgiveness and divine righteousness; the other, with respect to the means that God has established, in order that the believer, in his walk here below, may find his present relationships with heaven maintained and his daily connection with God preserved in its integrity.<a name=174:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said preserved, because this is the subject of the epistle;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:174">footnote</a></i>) but it must be added, that these relationships are

		established on this ground by divine revelations, which communicate the will of God and the conditions under which He is pleased to connect Himself with His people.<a name=175:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should also remark, that in the epistle to the Hebrews, although the relationship of the people with God is established on a new ground, being founded on the heavenly position of the Mediator, they are considered as already existing.<a name=175:2></a> God treats with a people already known to Him.<a name=175:3></a> He addresses persons in relationship with Himself, and who for a long period have held the position of a people whom God had taken out from the world unto Himself.<a name=175:4></a> It is not, as in Romans, sinners without law or transgressors of the law, between whom there is no difference, because all have alike come entirely short of the glory of God, all alike are the children of wrath, or, as in Ephesians, an entirely new creation unknown before.<a name=175:5></a> They were in need of some better thing; but those here addressed were in that need because they were in relationship with God, and the condition of their relationship with Him brought nothing to perfection.<a name=175:6></a> That which they possessed was in fact nothing but signs and figures; still, the people were, I again say, a people in relationship with God.<a name=175:7></a> Many of them might refuse the new method of blessing and grace, and consequently would be lost; but the link between the people and God is accounted to subsist: only that, Messiah having been revealed, a place among that people could not be had but in the recognition of Messiah.<a name=175:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important for the understanding of this epistle to apprehend this point, namely, that it is addressed to Hebrews on the ground of a relationship which still existed,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:175">footnote</a></i>) although it only retained its force in so far as they acknowledged the Messiah, who was its corner-stone.<a name=175:9></a> Hence the first words connect their present state with previous revelations, instead of

		breaking off all connection and introducing a new thing as yet unrevealed.<a name=176:1></a> Some remarks on the form of the epistle will help us to understand it better.<a name=176:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It does not contain the name of its author.<a name=176:3></a> The reason of this is touching and remarkable.<a name=176:4></a> It is that the Lord Himself, according to this epistle, was the Apostle of Israel.<a name=176:5></a> The apostles whom He sent were only employed to confirm His words by transmitting them to others, God Himself confirming their testimony by miraculous gifts.<a name=176:6></a> This also makes us understand that, although as Priest the Lord is in heaven for the exercise of His priesthood there, and in order to establish on new ground the relationship of the people with God, yet the communications of God with His people by means of the Messiah had begun when Jesus was on earth living in their midst.<a name=176:7></a> Consequently the character of their relationship was not union with Him in heaven; it was relationship with God on the ground of divine communications and of the service of a Mediator with God.<a name=176:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover this epistle is a discourse, a treatise, rather than a letter addressed in the exercise of apostolic functions to saints with whom the writer was personally in connection.<a name=176:9></a> The author takes the place of a teacher rather than of an apostle.<a name=176:10></a> He speaks doubtless from the height of the heavenly calling, but in connection with the actual position of the Jewish people; nevertheless, it was for the purpose of making believers at length understand that they must abandon that position.<a name=176:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time for judgment on the nation was drawing near; and with regard to this the destruction of Jerusalem had great significance, because it definitely broke off all outward relationship between God and the Jewish people.<a name=176:12></a> There was no longer an altar or sacrifice, priest or sanctuary.<a name=176:13></a> Every link was then broken by judgment, and remains broken until it shall be formed again under the new covenant according to grace.<a name=176:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it will be found that there is more contrast than comparison.<a name=176:15></a> The veil is compared, but then, closing the entrance to the sanctuary, now, a new and living way into it; a sacrifice, but then repeated, so as to say sins were still there, now once for all so that there is no remembrance of sins; and so of every important particular.<a name=176:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The author of this epistle (Paul, I doubt not, but this is of
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		little importance) employed other motives than that of the approaching judgment to induce the believing Jews to abandon their Judaic relationships.<a name=177:1></a> It is this last step however which he engages them to take; and the judgment was at hand.<a name=177:2></a> Until now they had linked Christianity with Judaism; there had been thousands of Christians who were very zealous for the law.<a name=177:3></a> But God was about to destroy that system altogether -- already in fact judged by the Jews' rejection of Christ, and by their resistance to the testimony of the Holy Ghost.<a name=177:4></a> Our epistle engages believers to come forth entirely from that system and to bear the Lord's reproach, setting before them a new foundation for their relationship with God in a High Priest who is in the heavens.<a name=177:5></a> At the same time it links all that it says with the testimony of God by the prophets through the intermedium of Christ, the Son of God, speaking during His life on earth, though now speaking from heaven.<a name=177:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the new position is plainly set forth, but continuity with the former is also established; and we have a glimpse, by means of the new covenant, of continuity also with that which is to come -- a thread by which another state of things, the millennial state, is connected with the whole of God's dealings with the nation, although that which is taught and developed in the epistle is the position of believers (of the people), formed by the revelation of a heavenly Christ on whom depended all their connection with God.<a name=177:7></a> They were to come forth from the camp; but it was because Jesus, in order to sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered without the gate.<a name=177:8></a> For here there is no continuing city: we seek one that is to come.<a name=177:9></a> The writer places himself among the remnant of the people as one of them.<a name=177:10></a> He teaches with the full light of the Holy Ghost, but not those to whom he had been sent as an apostle, with the apostolic authority which such a mission would have given him over them.<a name=177:11></a> It will be understood that in saying this we speak of the relationship of the writer, not of the inspiration of the writing.<a name=177:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While developing the sympathies of Christ and His sufferings, in order to shew that He is able to compassionate the suffering and the tried, the epistle does not bring forward His humiliation nor the reproach of the cross, till quite at the end when -- His glory having been set forth -- the author engages the Jew to follow Him and to share His reproach.<a name=177:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must look then in this epistle for the character of relationships with God, formed upon the revelation of the Messiah in the position which He had taken on high, and not for the doctrine of a new nature; approach to God in the holiest, impossible in Judaism, but no revelation of the Father, nor union with Christ on high.<a name=178:2></a>

		God had spoken to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways; and now, at the end of those days, that is to say, at the end of the days of the Israelite dispensation, in which the law ought to have been in vigour; at the end of the times during which God maintained relationship with Israel (sustaining them with a disobedient people by means of the prophets) -- at the end then of those days God had spoken in the Person of the Son.<a name=178:4></a> There is no breach to begin a wholly new system.<a name=178:5></a> The God who had spoken before by the prophets now went on to speak in Christ.<a name=178:6></a>

		It was not only by inspiring holy men (as He had done before), that they might recall Israel to the law and announce the coming of the Messiah.<a name=178:7></a> Himself had spoken as the Son -- in [His] Son.<a name=178:8></a> We see at once that the writer connects the revelation made by Jesus(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:178">footnote</a></i>) of the thoughts of God, with the former words addressed to Israel by the prophets.<a name=178:9></a> God has spoken, he says, identifying himself with His people, to us, as He spake to our fathers by the prophets.<a name=178:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And here we must always remember, that it is the Messiah of whom he is speaking -- He who once spoke on the earth.<a name=179:2></a> He declares indeed His divine glory; but it is the glory of Him who has spoken which he declares, the glory of that Son who had appeared according to the promises made to Israel.<a name=179:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This glory is twofold, and in connection with the twofold office of Christ.<a name=179:4></a> It is the divine glory of the Person of the Messiah, the Son of God.<a name=179:5></a> The solemn authority of His word is connected with this glory.<a name=179:6></a> And then there is the glory with which His humanity is invested according to the counsels of God -- the glory of the Son of man; a glory connected with His sufferings during His sojourn here below, which fitted Him for the exercise of a priesthood both merciful and intelligent with regard to the necessities and the trials of His people.<a name=179:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two chapters are the foundation of all the doctrine of the epistle.<a name=179:8></a> In chapter 1 we find the divine glory of the Messiah's Person; in chapter 2: 1 - 4 (which continues the subject), the authority of His word; and from 5 - 18 His glorious humanity.<a name=179:9></a> As Man, all things are put in subjection under Him; nevertheless, before being glorified, He took part in all the sufferings and in all the temptations to which the saints, whose nature He had assumed, are subjected.<a name=179:10></a> With this glory His priesthood is connected: He is able to succour them that are tempted, in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted.<a name=179:11></a> Thus He is the Apostle and the High Priest of the "called" people.<a name=179:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To this twofold glory is joined an accessory glory: He is Head, as Son, over God's house, possessing this authority as the One who created all things, even as Moses had authority as a servant in the house of God on earth.<a name=179:13></a> Now the believers, whom the inspired writer was addressing, were this house, if at least they held fast their confession of His name unto the end.<a name=179:14></a> For the danger of the Hebrew converts was that of losing their confidence, because there was nothing before their eyes as the fulfilment of the promises.<a name=179:15></a> Consequently exhortations follow (chapter 3: 7 to 4: 13) which refer to the voice of the Lord, as carrying the word of God into the midst of the people, in order that they might not harden their hearts.<a name=179:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From chapter 4: 14 the subject of the priesthood is treated, leading to the value of the sacrifice of Christ, but introducing

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From chapter 12: 3 he enters more closely into the trials found in the path of faith, and gives the most solemn warning with regard to the danger of those who draw back, and the most precious encouragements to those who persevere in it, setting forth the relationship into which we are brought by grace: and finally in chapter 13 he exhorts the faithful Hebrews on several points of detail, and in particular on that of unreservedly taking the christian position under the cross, laying stress on the fact that Christians alone had the true worship of God, and that they who chose to persevere in Judaism had no right to take part in it.<a name=180:5></a> In a word, he would have them to separate themselves definitely from a Judaism which was already judged, and to lay hold of the heavenly calling, bearing the cross here below.<a name=180:6></a> It was now a heavenly calling, and the path a path of faith.<a name=180:7></a>

		Now it is heavenly glory, this true position of the Messiah and His people, in connection with His divine right to their attention and to the worship of the angels themselves, which is so admirably presented here, where the Spirit of God brings out, in so infinitely precious a manner, the divine glory of Christ, for the purpose of exhorting His people to belief in a heavenly position; at the same time setting forth in what follows His perfect sympathy with us, as Man, in order to maintain their communion with heaven in spite of the difficulties of their path on earth.<a name=181:4></a>

		Thus, although the assembly is not found in the epistle to the Hebrews, save in an allusion to all comprised in the millennial glory in chapter 12, the Saviour of the assembly is there presented in His Person, His work, and His priesthood, most richly to our hearts and to our spiritual intelligence; and the heavenly calling is in itself very particularly developed.<a name=181:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is also most interesting to see the way in which the work of our Saviour, accomplished for us, forms a part of the manifestation of His divine glory.<a name=181:6></a>

		"God has spoken in the Son", says the inspired author of our epistle.<a name=181:7></a> He is then this Son.<a name=181:8></a> First He is declared Heir of all things.<a name=181:9></a> It is He who is to possess gloriously as Son everything that exists.<a name=181:10></a> Such are the decrees of God.<a name=181:11></a> Moreover it is by Him that God created the worlds.<a name=181:12></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:181">footnote</a></i>) All the vast system of this universe, those unknown worlds that trace their paths in the vast regions of space in divine order to manifest the glory of a Creator-God, are the work of His hand who has spoken to us, of the divine Christ.<a name=181:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now those who attached themselves to Him found themselves, in another respect also, above the Jewish system.<a name=182:15></a> That system was ordained in connection with angels; but Christ has taken a position much higher than that of angels, because He has for His own proper inheritance a name (that is, a revelation of what He is) which is much more excellent than that of angels.<a name=182:16></a> Upon this the author of this epistle quotes several passages from the Old Testament which speak of the Messiah, in order to shew that which He is in contrast with the nature and the relative position of angels.<a name=182:17></a> The significance of these passages to a converted Jew is evident, and we readily perceive the adaptation of the argument to such, for the Jewish economy was under the administration of angels, according to their own belief -- a belief fully grounded on the word.<a name=182:18></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:182">footnote</a></i>) And, at the same time, it was their own scriptures which proved that the Messiah was to have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a position much more excellent and exalted than that of angels, according to the rights that belonged to Him by virtue of His nature, and according to the counsels and the revelation of God: so that they who united themselves to Him were brought into connection with that which entirely eclipsed the law and all that related to it, and to the Jewish economy which could not be separated from it, and whose glory was angelic in character.<a name=183:1></a> The glory of Christianity -- and he speaks to those who acknowledged Jesus to be the Christ -- was so much above the glory of the law, that the two could not be really united.<a name=183:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The quotations begin by that from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=183:3></a> God, it is written, has never said to any of the angels, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee".<a name=183:4></a> It is this character of Sonship, proper to the Messiah, which, as a real relationship, distinguishes Him.<a name=183:5></a> He was from eternity the Son of the Father; but it is not precisely in this point of view that He is here considered.<a name=183:6></a> The name expresses the same relationship, but it is to the Messiah born on earth that this title is here applied.<a name=183:7></a> For <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, as establishing Him as King in Zion, announces the decree which proclaims His title.<a name=183:8></a> "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee", is His relationship in time, with God.<a name=183:9></a> It depends, I doubt not, on His glorious nature; but this position for man was acquired by the miraculous birth of Jesus here below, and demonstrated as true and determined in its true import by His resurrection.<a name=183:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>the testimony borne to this relationship is in connection with His kingship in Zion, but it declares the personal glories of the King acknowledged of God.<a name=183:11></a> By virtue of the rights connected with this title, all kings are summoned to submit themselves to Him.<a name=183:12></a> This Psalm then is speaking of the government of the world, when God establishes the Messiah as King of Zion, and not of the gospel.<a name=183:13></a> But in the passage quoted (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:5">Hebrews  1:5</a>), it is the relationship of glory in which He subsists with God, the foundation of His rights, which is set forth, and not the royal rights themselves.<a name=183:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is likewise the case in the next quotation: "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son".<a name=183:15></a> Here we plainly see that it is the relationship in which He is with God, in which God accepts and owns Him, and not His eternal relationship with the Father: "I will be to him a Father", etc.<a name=183:16></a> Thus it is still the Messiah, the King of Zion, the Son of David, for these words are applied in the first place to Solomon, as

		<a name=184>[Page 184]</a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But still more: -- when God introduces the Firstborn into the world, all the angels are called to worship Him.<a name=184:6></a> God presents Him to the world; but the highest of created beings must then cast themselves at His feet.<a name=184:7></a> The angels of God Himself -- the creatures that are nearest to Him -- must do homage to the Firstborn.<a name=184:8></a> This last expression also is remarkable.<a name=184:9></a> The Firstborn is the Heir, the beginning of the manifestation of the glory and power of God.<a name=184:10></a> It is in this sense that the word is used.<a name=184:11></a> It is said of the Son of David, "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:27">Psalm  89:27</a>), Thus the Messiah is introduced into the world as holding this place with regard to God Himself.<a name=184:12></a> He is the Firstborn -- the immediate expression of the rights and the glory of God.<a name=184:13></a> He has universal pre-eminence.<a name=184:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is, so to speak, the positional glory of the Messiah.<a name=184:15></a> Not only Head of the people on earth, as Son of David, nor even only the acknowledged Son of God on the earth, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, but the universal Firstborn; so that the chief and most exalted of creatures, those nearest to God, the angels of God, the instruments of His power and government, must do homage to the Son in this His position.<a name=184:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet this is far from being all; and this homage itself would be out of place if His glory were not proper to Himself and personal, if it were not connected with His nature.<a name=184:17></a> Nevertheless that which we have before us in this chapter is still the Messiah as owned of God.<a name=184:18></a> God tells us what He is.<a name=184:19></a> Of the angels He says, "He maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire".<a name=184:20></a> He does not make His Son anything: He recognises that which He is, saying, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever".<a name=184:21></a> The Messiah may have an earthly throne (which also is not taken from Him, but which ceases by His taking possession of an eternal throne), but He has a throne which is for ever and ever.<a name=184:22></a>

		Also He has, when here below, personally loved righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His fellows.<a name=185:1></a> These companions are the believing remnant of Israel, whom He has made by grace His fellows, although (perfectly well-pleasing to God by His love of righteousness -- and that, at all costs) He is exalted above them all.<a name=185:2></a> This is a remarkable passage, because, while on the one hand the divinity of the Lord is fully established as well as His eternal throne, on the other hand the passage comes down to His character as the faithful man on earth, where He made pious men -- the little remnant of Israel who waited for redemption, His companions; at the same time it gives Him (and it could not be otherwise) a place above them.<a name=185:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The text then returns to the glory given Him as Man, having the pre-eminence here as in all things.<a name=185:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already remarked elsewhere that while, as we read in Zechariah, Jehovah recognises as His fellow the humbled Man, against whom His sword awakes to smite; here, where the divinity of Jesus is set forth, the same Jehovah owns the poor remnant of believers as the fellows of the divine Saviour.<a name=185:5></a> Marvellous links between God and His people!<a name=185:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Already then in these remarkable testimonies He has the eternal throne and the sceptre of righteousness: He is recognised as God although a Man, and glorified above all others as the reward of righteousness.<a name=185:7></a> But the declaration of His divinity, the divinity of the Messiah, must be more precise.<a name=185:8></a> And the testimony is of the greatest beauty.<a name=185:9></a> The Psalm that contains it is one of the most complete expressions we find in scripture of the sense which Jesus had of His humiliation on earth, of His dependence on Jehovah, and that, having been raised up as Messiah from among men, He was cast down and His days shortened.<a name=185:10></a> If Zion were re-built (and the Psalm speaks prophetically of the time when it shall take place), where would He be, Messiah as He was, if, weakened and humbled, He was cut off in the midst of His days (as was the case)?<a name=185:11></a> In a word, it is the prophetic expression of the Saviour's heart in the prospect of that which happened to Him as a Man on the earth, the utterance of His heart to Jehovah, in those days of humiliation, in presence of the renewed affection of the remnant for the dust of Zion -- an affection which the Lord had produced in their hearts, and which was therefore a token of His good-will and His purpose to re-establish it.<a name=185:12></a> But how

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=186>[Page 186]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		could a Saviour who was cut off have part in it?<a name=186:1></a> (a searching question for a believing Jew, tempted on that side).<a name=186:2></a> The words here quoted are the answer to this question.<a name=186:3></a> Humbled as He might be, He was the Creator Himself.<a name=186:4></a> He was ever the same;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:186">footnote</a></i>) His years could never fail.<a name=186:5></a> It was He who had founded the heavens: He would fold them up as a garment, but He Himself would never change.<a name=186:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such then is the testimony rendered to the Messiah by the scriptures of the Jews themselves -- the glory of His position above the angels who administered the dispensation of the law; His eternal throne of righteousness; His unchangeable divinity as Creator of all things.<a name=186:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing remained to complete this chain of glory -- that is, the place occupied at present by Christ, in contrast still with the angels (a place that depends, on the one hand, upon the divine glory of His Person; on the other, upon the accomplishment of His work).<a name=186:8></a> And this place is at the right hand of God, who called Him to sit there until He had made His enemies His footstool.<a name=186:9></a> Not only in His Person glorious and divine, not only does He hold the first place with regard to all creatures in the universe (we have spoken of this, which will take place when He is introduced into the world), but He has His own place at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens.<a name=186:10></a> To which of the angels has God ever said this?<a name=186:11></a> They are servants on God's part to the heirs of salvation.<a name=186:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<b>Chapter 2.<a name=186:13></a></b> This is the reason why it is so much the more needful to hearken to the word spoken, in order that they should not let it pass away from life and memory.<a name=186:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God had maintained the authority of the word that was communicated by means of angels, punishing disobedience to it, for it was a law.<a name=186:15></a> How then shall we escape if we neglect a salvation which the Lord Himself has announced?<a name=186:16></a> Thus the service of the Lord among the Jews was a word of salvation, which the apostles confirmed, and which the mighty testimony of the Holy Ghost established.<a name=186:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already remarked that the testimony of which this epistle treats, is attributed to the Lord Himself.<a name=187:2></a> Therefore we must not expect to find in it the assembly (as such), of which the Lord had only spoken prophetically; but His testimony in relation to Israel, among whom He sojourned on the earth, to whatever extent that testimony reached.<a name=187:3></a> That which was spoken by the apostles is only treated here as a confirmation of the Lord's own word, God having added His testimony to it by the miraculous manifestations of the Spirit, who distributed His gifts to each according to His will.<a name=187:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory of which we have been speaking is the personal glory of the Messiah, the Son of David; and His glory in the time present, during which God has called Him to sit at His right hand.<a name=187:5></a> He is the Son of God, He is even the Creator; but there is also His glory in connection with the world to come, as Son of man.<a name=187:6></a> Of this chapter 2 speaks, comparing Him still with the angels; but here to exclude them altogether.<a name=187:7></a> In the previous chapter they had their place: the law was given by angels; they are servants, on God's part, of the heirs of salvation.<a name=187:8></a> In chapter 2 they have no place, they do not reign; the world to come is not made subject to them -- that is, this habitable earth, directed and governed as it will be when God shall have accomplished that which He has spoken of by the prophets.<a name=187:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The order of the world, placed in relationship with Jehovah under the law, or "lying in darkness", has been interrupted by the rejection of the Messiah, who has taken His place at the right hand of God on high, His enemies being not yet given into His hand for judgment, because God is carrying on His work of grace, and gathering out the assembly.<a name=187:10></a> But He will yet establish a new order of things on the earth; this will be "the world to come".<a name=187:11></a> Now that world is not made subject to angels.<a name=187:12></a> The testimony given in the Old Testament with regard to this is as follows: "What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the son of man that thou visitest him?<a name=187:13></a> Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour; thou hast set him over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet".<a name=187:14></a> Thus all things without exception (save He who has made them subject to Him), are, according to the purpose of God, put under the feet of man, and in particular of the Son of man.<a name=187:15></a>

		When studying the Book of Psalms, we saw that which I recall here, namely, that this testimony in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is, with regard to the position and dominion of Christ as man, an advance upon <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=188:1></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>sets before us the righteous man, accepted of God, the godly remnant with which Christ connected Himself; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, the counsels of God respecting His Messiah, in spite of the efforts made by the kings and governors of the earth.<a name=188:2></a> God establishes Him as King in Zion, and summons all the kings to do homage to Him whom He proclaimed to be His Son on the earth.<a name=188:3></a> Afterwards we see that being rejected the remnant suffer, and this <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is what Peter quotes to prove the rising up of the powers of the earth, Jewish and Gentile, against Messiah (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:25">Acts  4:25</a>).<a name=188:4></a> But <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>shews that all this only served to enlarge the sphere of His glory.<a name=188:5></a> Christ takes the position of man and the title of Son of man, and enjoys His rights according to the counsels of God; and, made lower than the angels, He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=188:6></a> And not only are the kings of the earth made subject to Him, but all things, without exception, are put under His feet.<a name=188:7></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:188">footnote</a></i>) It is this which the apostle quotes here.<a name=188:8></a> The Christ had already been rejected, and His being established as King in Zion put off to be accomplished at a later period.<a name=188:9></a> He had been exalted to the right hand of God, as we have seen; and the wider title had accrued to Him, although the result was not yet accomplished.<a name=188:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To this the epistle here calls our attention.<a name=188:11></a> We see not yet the accomplishment of all that this Psalm announces, namely, that all things should be put under His feet; but a part is already fulfilled, a guarantee to the heart of the fulfilment of the whole.<a name=188:12></a> Made a little lower than the angels in order to suffer death, He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=188:13></a> He has suffered death, and He is crowned in reward for His work, by which He perfectly glorified God in the place where He had been dishonoured, and saved man (those who believe in Him) where man was lost.<a name=188:14></a> For He was made lower than the angels, in order that, by the grace of God, He should taste death for all things.<a name=188:15></a> It appears to me that the words "for the suffering of death", and "a little lower than the angels" go together;

	<div class="paragraph">
		This passage then, which is thus applied to the Lord, presents Him as exalted to heaven when He had undergone the death which gave Him a right to all in a new way while waiting till all is put under His feet.<a name=189:2></a> But there is another truth connected with this.<a name=189:3></a> He had undertaken the cause of the sons whom God is bringing to glory, and therefore He must enter into the circumstances in which they were found, suffer the consequences thereof, and be treated according to the work He had undertaken.<a name=189:4></a> It was a reality; and it was fitting that God should vindicate the rights of His glory, and should maintain it with reference to those who had dishonoured Him, and that He should treat the One who had taken their cause in hand, and who stood before Him in their name, as representing them in that respect.<a name=189:5></a> God would bring the captain of their salvation to perfection through sufferings.<a name=189:6></a> He was to undergo the consequences of the situation into which He had come.<a name=189:7></a> His work was to be a reality, according to the measure of the responsibility which He had taken upon Himself, and it involved the glory of God where sin was.<a name=189:8></a> He must therefore suffer; He must taste death.<a name=189:9></a> It is by the grace of God that He did so -- we, because of sin; He, because of grace for sin.<a name=189:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This shews us the Christ standing in the midst of those who are saved, whom God brings to glory, although at their head.<a name=189:11></a> It is this which our epistle sets before us -- He who sanctifies (the Christ), and they who are sanctified (the remnant set apart for God by the Spirit) are all of one: an expression, the force of which is easily apprehended, but difficult to express, when one abandons the abstract nature of the phrase itself.<a name=189:12></a> Observe that it is only of sanctified persons that this is said.<a name=189:13></a> Christ and the sanctified ones are all one company, men together in the same position before God.<a name=189:14></a> But the idea goes a little farther.<a name=189:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we say "of the same mass" the expression may be pushed too far, as though He and the others were of the same nature as children of Adam, sinners together.<a name=189:18></a> In this case He would have to call every man His brother; whereas it is only the children whom God has given Him, "sanctified" ones, that He so calls.<a name=189:19></a> But He and the sanctified ones are all as men in

		This position is entirely gained by resurrection; for although, in principle, the children were given to Him before, yet He only called them His brethren when He had finished the work which enabled Him to present them with Himself before God.<a name=190:4></a> He said indeed "mother, sister, brother"; but He did not use the term "my brethren", [as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>] until He said to Mary of Magdala, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=190:5></a> Also in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>it is when He had been heard from the horns of the unicorn, that He declared the name of a Deliverer-God to His brethren, and that He praised God in the midst of the assembly.<a name=190:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must always remember that which has been already remarked, namely, that in this epistle we have not the assembly as the body of Christ in union with Himself; nor even the Father either, except as a comparison in chapter 12.<a name=194:15></a> It is God, a heavenly Christ (who is the Son of God), and a people, the Messiah being a heavenly Mediator between the people and God.<a name=194:16></a> Therefore the proper privileges of the assembly are not found in this epistle -- they flow from our union with Christ; and here Christ is a Person apart, who is between us and God, on high while we are here.<a name=194:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are still a few remarks which we may add here in order to throw light on this point, and to assist the reader in understanding the first two chapters, as well as the principle of the instructions throughout the epistle.<a name=194:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 Christ accomplishes by Himself as a part of His divine glory the purification of sins, and seats Himself at the right hand of God.<a name=194:19></a> This work, observe, is done by Himself.<a name=194:20></a> We have nothing to do with it, save to believe in and enjoy it.<a name=194:21></a> It is a divine work which this divine Person has accomplished

		by Himself; so that it has all the absolute perfection, all the force, of a work done by Him, without any mixture of our weakness, of our efforts, or of our experiences.<a name=195:1></a> He performed it by Himself, and it is accomplished.<a name=195:2></a> Thereupon He takes His seat.<a name=195:3></a> He is not placed there -- He seats Himself upon the throne on high.<a name=195:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 we see another point which characterises the epistle -- the present state of the glorified Man.<a name=195:5></a> He is crowned with glory and honour; but it is with a view to an order of things which is not yet accomplished.<a name=195:6></a> It is the Person of the Man Christ which is presented, not the assembly in union with Him, even when He is beheld as glorified in the heavens.<a name=195:7></a> This glory is viewed as a partial accomplishment of that which belongs to Him, according to the counsels of God, as the Son of man.<a name=195:8></a> Hereafter this glory will be complete in all its parts by the subjugation of all things.<a name=195:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The present glory therefore of Christ makes us look forward to an order of things yet future, which will be full rest, full blessing.<a name=195:10></a> In a word, besides the perfection of His work, the epistle sets before us the sequel of that which belongs to the Christ in Person, the Son of man, not the perfection of the assembly in Him.<a name=195:11></a> And this embraces the present time, the character of which, to the believer, depends on Christ's being now glorified in heaven while waiting for a future state, in which all things will be subjected to Him.<a name=195:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter 2 we see also that He is crowned.<a name=195:13></a> He is not seen sitting there as in His own original right, though He had that glory before the world was, but, having been made a little less than the angels, God crowns Him.<a name=195:14></a> We also plainly see that although the believing Hebrews are especially in view, and even all Christians are classed under the title of Abraham's seed on the earth, yet that Christ is viewed nevertheless as the Son of man, and not as the Son of David; and the question is put, "What is man?<a name=195:15></a>" The answer (the precious answer for us) is, Christ glorified, once dead on account of man's condition.<a name=195:16></a> In Him we see the mind of God with regard to man.<a name=195:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that Christians themselves are viewed as the seed of Abraham plainly shews the way in which they are considered as forming part of the chain of the heirs of promise on earth (as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>), and not as the assembly united to Christ as His body in heaven.<a name=195:18></a>

		The remnant of the Jews, as we have said, are considered as continuing the chain of the people blessed on earth, whatever heavenly privileges they may also possess or whatever their especial state may be in connection with the Messiah's exaltation to heaven.<a name=196:4></a> We have been grafted into the good olive-tree, so that we share all the advantages here spoken of.<a name=196:5></a> Our highest position, and the privileges belonging to it, are not here in view.<a name=196:6></a> Accordingly, as writing to Hebrews and as one among them, he addresses them, that is to say, Christians and believing Israelites.<a name=196:7></a> This is the force of the word "us" in the epistle; we must bear it in mind, and that the Hebrew believers always form the word "us", of which the writer is also a part.<a name=196:8></a>

		No one ought to harden his heart; but this word is especially addressed to Israel, and that until the day when Christ shall appear.<a name=196:10></a> In speaking of it, the author returns to the word that had formerly been addressed to Israel; not now in order to warn them of the danger they would incur by neglecting it, but of the consequences of departing from that which they had acknowledged to be true.<a name=196:11></a> Israel, when delivered out of Egypt, had provoked God in the wilderness (it was indeed the case also of Christians in this world), because they were not at once, and without difficulty, in Canaan.<a name=196:12></a> Those to whom he wrote were in danger of forsaking the living God in the same way; that is, the danger was there before their eyes.<a name=196:13></a> They should rather exhort each other, while it was still called today, in order that they might not be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.<a name=196:14></a> This word "today" is the expression of the patient activity of God's grace towards Israel even unto the end.<a name=196:15></a> The people were unbelieving; they have hardened their hearts; they have done so, and will alas!<a name=196:16></a> do so to the end, until judgment come in the Person of the Messiah-Jehovah, whom they have despised.<a name=196:17></a>

		<b>Chapter 4.<a name=198:8></a></b> The apostle goes on to apply this part of Israel's history to those whom he was addressing, laying stress on two points: 1st, That Israel had failed of entering into rest through unbelief; 2nd, That the rest was yet to come, and that believers (those who were not seeking rest here, but who accepted the wilderness for the time being) should enter into it.<a name=198:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins by saying, "Let us fear lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any should seem to come short of it", not attain to it.<a name=198:10></a> For we have been the objects of the proclamation of glad tidings, as they were in times past.<a name=198:11></a> But the word addressed to them remained fruitless, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it: for we which have believed do enter into rest.<a name=198:12></a> The rest itself is yet to come, and it is believers who enter into it.<a name=198:13></a> For a rest of God there is, and there are some who enter into it: inasmuch as it is written, "They", that is, those (pointing out a certain class who are to be excluded) "shall not enter into my rest".<a name=198:14></a>

		Here a natural objection occurs to which the passage gives a complete answer, without speaking of the objection itself.<a name=199:4></a> The Israelites had indeed fallen in the wilderness, but Joshua had brought the people into Canaan which the unbelievers never reached; the Jews were there, so that they did enter into the rest as to which the others failed.<a name=199:5></a> The answer is evident.<a name=199:6></a> It was long after this that God said by David, "I sware in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest".<a name=199:7></a> If Joshua had given rest to Israel, David could not afterwards have spoken of another day.<a name=199:8></a> There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.<a name=199:9></a> It is yet to come; but it is assured by the word of God -- a truth, the bearing of which is immediately seen with regard to the connection of the believing Jews with the nation, in the midst of which they were tempted to seek a rest that, for the moment, faith did not afford them, and being enfeebled saw but dimly before it.<a name=199:10></a> To have God's rest one must persevere in faith.<a name=199:11></a> Present apparent rest was not the true rest.<a name=199:12></a> God's rest was still to be waited for.<a name=199:13></a> Faith alone acknowledged this, and sought for none in the wilderness, trusting to the promise.<a name=199:14></a> God still said "Today".<a name=199:15></a>

		As to the order of the verses, the exhortation in verse 11 depends on the whole course of what precedes, the argument having been completed by the testimony of David coming after Joshua.<a name=199:17></a> After the creation God indeed rested; but He said after that, "If they shall enter into my rest".<a name=199:18></a> So that men had not entered into that rest.<a name=199:19></a> Joshua entered into the land; but the word by David, coming long after, proves that the rest of God was not yet attained.<a name=199:20></a> Nevertheless this same testimony, which forbade the entrance into rest because of unbelief, shewed that some are to enter in: otherwise there was no need of declaring the exclusion of others for an especial cause, nor warning men that they might escape what hindered their entering in.<a name=199:21></a> No parenthesis is needed.<a name=199:22></a>

		had not entered into rest; he who has entered into it has ceased from work, even as God ceased from His own works when He entered into His rest.<a name=200:1></a> "Let us therefore use diligence" is the exhortation of the faithful witness of God, "that we may enter into that rest" -- the rest of God -- in order that we may not fall after the same example of unbelief.<a name=200:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should especially observe here, that it is the rest of God which is spoken of.<a name=200:3></a> This enables us to understand the happiness and perfection of the rest.<a name=200:4></a> God must rest in that which satisfies His heart.<a name=200:5></a> This was the case even in creation -- all was very good.<a name=200:6></a> And now it must be in a perfect blessing that perfect love can be satisfied with, with regard to us, who will possess a heavenly portion in the blessing which we shall have in His own presence, in perfect holiness and perfect light.<a name=200:7></a> Accordingly all the toilsome work of faith, the exercise of faith in the wilderness, the warfare (although there are many joys), the good works practised there, labour of every kind will cease.<a name=200:8></a> It is not only that we shall be delivered from the power of indwelling sin; all the efforts and all the troubles of the new man will cease.<a name=200:9></a> We are already set free from the law of sin; then our spiritual exercise for God will cease.<a name=200:10></a> We shall rest from our works -- not evil ones.<a name=200:11></a> We have already rested from our works with regard to justification, and therefore in that sense we have now rest in our consciences; but that is not the subject here -- it is the Christian's rest from all his works.<a name=200:12></a> God rested from His works -- assuredly good ones -- and so shall we also then with Him.<a name=200:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are now in the wilderness; we also wrestle with wicked spirits in heavenly places.<a name=200:14></a> A blessed rest remains for us, in which our hearts will repose in the presence of God, where nothing will trouble the perfection of our rest, where God will rest in the perfection of the blessing He has bestowed on His people.<a name=200:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great thought of the passage is, that there remains a rest (that is to say, that the believer is not to expect it here) without saying where it is.<a name=200:16></a> And it does not speak in detail of the character of the rest, because it leaves the door open to an earthly rest for the earthly people on the ground of the promises, although to christian partakers of the heavenly calling God's rest is evidently a heavenly one.<a name=200:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then sets before us the instrument which God employs to judge the unbelief and all the workings of the heart
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which tend, as we have seen, to lead the believer into departure from the position of faith, and to hide God from him by inducing him to satisfy his flesh and to seek for rest in the wilderness.<a name=201:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the believer who is upright in heart this judgment is of great value, as that which enables him to discern all that has a tendency to hinder his progress or make him slacken his steps.<a name=201:2></a> It is the word of God, which -- being the revelation of God, the expression of what He is, and of all that surrounds Him, and of what His will is in all the circumstances that surround us -- judges everything in the heart which is not of Him.<a name=201:3></a> It is more penetrating than a two-edged sword.<a name=201:4></a> Living and energetic, it separates all that is most intimately linked together in our hearts and minds.<a name=201:5></a> Whenever nature -- the "soul" and its feelings -- mingles with that which is spiritual, it brings the edge of the sword of the living truth of God between the two, and judges the hidden movements of the heart respecting them.<a name=201:6></a> It discerns all the thoughts and intentions of the heart.<a name=201:7></a> But it has another character, coming from God (being, as it were, His eye upon the conscience), it brings us into His presence; and all that it forces us to discover, it sets in our conscience before the eye of God Himself.<a name=201:8></a> Nothing is hidden, all is naked and manifested to the eye of Him with whom we have to do.<a name=201:9></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:201">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the true help, the mighty instrument of God to judge everything in us that would hinder us from pursuing our course through the wilderness with joy, and with a buoyant heart strengthened by faith and confidence in Him.<a name=201:10></a> Precious instrument of a faithful God, solemn and serious in its operation; but of priceless and infinite blessing in its effects, in its consequences.<a name=201:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an instrument which, in its operations, does not allow "the desires of the flesh and of the mind" liberty to act; which does not permit the heart to deceive itself; but which procures us strength, and places us without any consciousness of evil in the presence of God, to pursue our course with joy and spiritual energy.<a name=201:12></a> Here the exhortation, founded on the power of the word, concludes.<a name=201:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another succour, one of a different character, to aid us in our passage through the wilderness; and that is priesthood -- a subject which the epistle here begins and carries on through several chapters.<a name=201:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have a High Priest who has passed through the heavens -- as Aaron through the successive parts of the tabernacle -- Jesus, the Son of God.<a name=202:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He has, in all things, been tempted like ourselves, sin apart; so that He can sympathise with our infirmities.<a name=202:2></a> The word brings to light the intents of the heart, judges the will, and all that has not God for its object and its source.<a name=202:3></a> Then, as far as weakness is concerned, we have His sympathy.<a name=202:4></a> Christ of course had no evil desires: He was tempted in every way, apart from sin.<a name=202:5></a> Sin had no part in it at all.<a name=202:6></a> But I do not wish for sympathy with the sin that is in me; I detest it, I wish it to be mortified -- judged unsparingly.<a name=202:7></a> This the word does.<a name=202:8></a> For my weakness and my difficulties I seek sympathy; and I find it in the priesthood of Jesus.<a name=202:9></a> It is not necessary, in order to sympathise with me, that a person should feel at the same moment that which I am feeling -- rather the contrary.<a name=202:10></a> If I am suffering pain, I am not in a condition to think as much of another's pain.<a name=202:11></a> But in order to sympathise with him I must have a nature capable of appreciating his pain.<a name=202:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is with Jesus, when exercising His priesthood.<a name=202:13></a> He is in every sense beyond the reach of pain and trial, but He is man; and not only has He the human nature which in time suffered grief, but He experienced the trials a saint has to go through more fully than any of ourselves; and His heart, free and full of love, can entirely sympathise with us, according to His experience of ill, and according to the glorious liberty which He now has, to provide and care for it.<a name=202:14></a> This encourages us to hold fast our profession in spite of the difficulties that beset our path; for Jesus concerns Himself about them, according to His own knowledge and experience of what they are, and according to the power of His grace.<a name=202:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore, our High Priest being there, we can go with all boldness to the throne of grace, to find mercy and the grace suited to us in all times of need: mercy, because we are weak and wavering; needful grace, because we are engaged in a warfare which God owns.<a name=202:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, it is not that we go to the High Priest.<a name=202:17></a> It is often done, and God may have compassion; but it is a proof that we do not fully understand grace.<a name=202:18></a> The Priest, the Lord Jesus, occupies Himself about us -- sympathises with us, on the one hand; and on the other, we go directly to the throne of grace.<a name=202:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit does not here speak positively of falls; we find
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		that in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>.<a name=203:1></a> There also it is in connection with communion with His Father, here with access to God.<a name=203:2></a> His purpose here is to strengthen us, to encourage us to persevere in the way, conscious of the sympathies which we possess in heaven, and that the throne is always open to us.<a name=203:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<b>Chapter 5.<a name=203:4></a></b> The epistle then develops the priesthood of the Lord Jesus, comparing it with that of Aaron; but, as we shall see, with a view to bring out the difference rather than the resemblance between them, although there is a general analogy, and the one was a shadow of the other.<a name=203:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This comparison is made in chapter 5: 1 - 10.<a name=203:6></a> The line of argument is then interrupted, though the ground of argument is enlarged and developed, till the end of chapter 7, where the comparison with Melchisedec is pursued; and the change of law, consequent on the change of priesthood, is stated, which introduces the covenants and all that relates to the circumstances of the Jews.<a name=203:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A priest then as taken from among men (he is not here speaking of Christ, but of that with which he compares Him) is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; he is able to feel the miseries of others, because he is himself compassed with infirmity, and offers therefore for himself as well as for the people.<a name=203:8></a> Moreover no one takes this honour to himself, but receives it, as Aaron did, being called of God.<a name=203:9></a> The epistle will speak farther on of the sacrifice -- here of the person of the priest, and of the order of the priesthood.<a name=203:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Christ glorified not Himself to become a High Priest.<a name=203:11></a> The glory of His Person, manifested as man on the earth, and that of His function, are both of them plainly declared of God: the first, when He said, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee" (<a href="../bible/Chronicles.htm#2">Chronicles  2</a>); the second, in these words, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec" (<a href="../bible/Chronicles.htm#110">Chronicles  110</a>).<a name=203:12></a> Such then in both personal and official glory is the High Priest, the expected Messiah, Christ.<a name=203:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But His glory (although it gives Him His place in honour before God, and consequent on redemption, so that He can undertake the people's cause before God according to His will) does not bring Him near to the miseries of men.<a name=203:14></a> It is His history on earth which makes us feel how truly able He is to take part in them.<a name=203:15></a> "In the days of his flesh", that is, here below, He went into all the anguish of death in dependence on

		God, making His request to Him who was able to save Him from it.<a name=204:1></a> For, being here in order to obey and to suffer, He did not save Himself.<a name=204:2></a> He submitted to everything, obeyed in everything, and depended on God for everything.<a name=204:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was heard because of His fear.<a name=204:4></a> It was proper that He who took death on Himself, as answering for others, should feel its whole weight upon His soul.<a name=204:5></a> He would neither escape the consequences of that which He had undertaken (compare chapter 2), nor fail in the just sense of what it was thus to be under the hand of God in judgment.<a name=204:6></a> His fear was His piety, the right estimation of the position in which sinful man was found, and what must come from God because of it.<a name=204:7></a> For Him however to suffer the consequences of this position was obedience.<a name=204:8></a> And this obedience was to be perfect, and to be tried to the utmost.<a name=204:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was the Son, the glorious Son of God.<a name=204:10></a> But though this was so, He was to learn obedience (and to Him it was a new thing), what it was in the world, by all that He suffered.<a name=204:11></a> And, having deserved all glory, He was to take His place as the glorified Man -- to be perfected; and in that position to become the cause of eternal salvation (not merely temporal deliverances) to them that obey Him; a salvation which should be connected with the position that He had taken in consequence of His work of obedience, saluted by God as "High Priest after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=204:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which follows to the end of chapter 6 is a parenthesis which refers to the condition of those to whom the epistle is addressed.<a name=204:13></a> They are blamed for the dullness of their spiritual intelligence, and encouraged at the same time by the promises of God; the whole with reference to their position as Jewish believers.<a name=204:14></a> Afterwards the line of instruction with regard to Melchisedec is resumed.<a name=204:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the time, they ought to have been able to teach: nevertheless they needed that some one should teach them the elements of the oracles of God -- requiring milk instead of meat.<a name=204:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may observe that there is no greater hindrance to progress in spiritual life and intelligence than attachment to an ancient form of religion, which, being traditional and not simply personal faith in the truth, consists always in ordinances, and is consequently carnal and earthly.<a name=204:17></a> Without this people may be unbelievers; but under the influence of such a system piety itself -- expended in forms -- makes a barrier between the soul

	<div class="paragraph">
		and the light of God: and these forms which surround, preoccupy, and hold the affections captive, prevent them from enlarging and becoming enlightened by means of divine revelation.<a name=205:1></a> Morally (as the apostle here expresses it) the senses are not exercised to discern both good and evil.<a name=205:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Holy Ghost will not limit Himself to the narrow circle and the weak and futile sentiments of human tradition, nor even to those truths which, in a state like this, one is able to receive.<a name=205:3></a> In such a case Christ has not His true place.<a name=205:4></a> And this our epistle here develops.<a name=205:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Milk belongs to babes, solid food to those who are of full age.<a name=205:6></a> This infancy was the soul's condition under the ordinances and requirements of the law (compare <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:1">Galatians  4:1</a> - 7).<a name=205:7></a> But there was a revelation of the Messiah in connection with these two states -- of infancy and of manhood.<a name=205:8></a> And the development of the word of righteousness, of the true practical relationships of the soul to God according to His character and ways, was in proportion to the revelation of Christ, who is the manifestation of that character, and the centre of all those ways.<a name=205:9></a> Therefore it is that, in chapter 5: 12, 13, the epistle speaks of the elements, the beginning, of the oracles of God, and of the word of righteousness; in chapter 6: 1, of the word of the beginning, or of the first principles, of Christ.<a name=205:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<b>Chapter 6.<a name=205:11></a></b> Now the Spirit will not stop at this point with Christians, but will go on to that full revelation of His glory which belongs to them that are of full age and indeed forms us for that state.<a name=205:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We easily perceive that the inspired writer tries to make the Hebrews feel that he was placing them on higher and more excellent ground, by connecting them with a heavenly and invisible Christ; and that Judaism kept them back in the position of children.<a name=205:13></a> This moreover characterises the whole epistle.<a name=205:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless we shall find two things here: on the one hand, the elements and the character of doctrine that belonged to infancy, to "the beginning of the word of Christ", in contrast with the strength and heavenly savour that accompanied the christian revelation; and, on the other hand, what the revelation of Christ Himself is in connection with this last spiritual and christian system.<a name=205:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the epistle distinguishes between this system and the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=206>[Page 206]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		doctrine of the Person of Christ, even looked at as man,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:206">footnote</a></i>) although the present position of Christ gives its character to the christian system.<a name=206:1></a> The distinction is made -- not that the condition of souls does not depend on the measure of the revelation of Christ and of the position He has taken, but -- because the doctrine of His Person and glory goes much farther than the present state of our relationship with God.<a name=206:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The things spoken of in chapter 6: 1, 2, had their place, because the Messiah was then yet to come: all was in a state of infancy.<a name=206:3></a> The things spoken of in verses 4, 5 are the privileges that Christians enjoyed in virtue of the work and the glorification of the Messiah.<a name=206:4></a> But they are not in themselves the "perfection" mentioned in verse 1, and which relates rather to the knowledge of the Person of Christ Himself.<a name=206:5></a> The privileges in question were the effect of the glorious position of His Person in heaven.<a name=206:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to attend to this, in order to understand these passages.<a name=206:7></a> In the infancy spoken of in verses 1, 2, the obscurity of the revelations of the Messiah, announced at most by promises and prophecies, left worshippers under the yoke of ceremonies and figures, although in possession of some fundamental truths.<a name=206:8></a> His exaltation made way for the power of the Holy Ghost here below: and on this the responsibility of souls which had tasted it depended.<a name=206:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of the Person and the glory of Jesus forms the subject of revelation in the epistle, and was the means of deliverance for the Jews from the whole system which had been such a heavy burden on their hearts; it should prevent their forsaking the state described in verses 4 and 5, in order to return into the weakness and (Christ having come) the carnal state of verses and 2.<a name=206:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle then does not desire to establish again the true but elementary doctrines which belonged to the times when Christ was not manifested, but to go forward to the full revelation of His glory and position according to the counsels of God revealed in the word.<a name=206:11></a>

		The power of the Holy Ghost, the miracles wrought in the bosom of Christianity, were testimonies that the power which was to accomplish that deliverance -- although still hidden in heaven -- existed nevertheless in the glorious Person of the Son of God.<a name=207:14></a> The power did not yet accomplish the deliverance of this world oppressed by Satan, because another thing was being done meanwhile.<a name=207:15></a> The light of God was shining, the good word of grace was being preached, the heavenly gift (a better thing than the deliverance of the world) was being tasted; and the sensible power of the Holy Ghost made itself known, while waiting for the return in glory of the Messiah to bind Satan, and thus accomplish the deliverance of the world under His dominion.<a name=207:16></a>

		But, after having been the subject of this influence of the presence of the Holy Ghost, after having tasted the revelation thus made of the goodness of God, and experienced the proofs of His power, if any one then forsook Christ, there remained no other means for restoring the soul, for leading it to repentance.<a name=208:5></a> The heavenly treasures were already expended: he had given them up as worthless; he had rejected the full revelation of grace and power, after having known it.<a name=208:6></a> What means could now be used?<a name=208:7></a> To return to Judaism, and the first principles of the doctrine of Christ in it, when the truth had been revealed, was impossible: and the new light had been known and rejected.<a name=208:8></a> In a case like this there was only the flesh; there was no new life.<a name=208:9></a> Thorns and briars were being produced as before.<a name=208:10></a> There was no real change in the man's state.<a name=208:11></a>

		We may also remark how the epistle, in speaking of christian privileges, does not lose sight of the future earthly state, the glory and the privileges of the millennial world.<a name=209:4></a> The miracles are the miracles of the world to come; they belong to that period.<a name=209:5></a> The deliverance and the destruction of Satan's power should then be complete; those miracles were deliverances, samples of that power.<a name=209:6></a> We saw this point brought into notice (chapter 2: 5) at the beginning of the doctrine of the epistle; and in chapter 4 the rest of God left vague in its character, in order to embrace both the heavenly part and the earthly part of our Lord's millennial reign.<a name=209:7></a> Here the present power of the Holy Ghost characterises the ways of God, Christianity; but the miracles are a foretaste of the coming age, in which the whole world will be blessed.<a name=209:8></a>

		In the encouragements that it gives them, the epistle already calls to mind the principles by which the father of the faithful and of the Jewish nation had walked, and the way in which God had strengthened him in his faith.<a name=209:9></a> Abraham had to rest on promises, without possessing that which was promised; and this, with regard to rest and glory, was the state in which the Hebrew Christians then were.<a name=209:10></a> But at the same time, in order to give full assurance to the heart, God had confirmed His word by an oath, in order that they who build upon this hope of promised glory might have strong and satisfying consolation.<a name=209:11></a> And this assurance has received a still greater confirmation.<a name=209:12></a> It entered into that within the veil, it found its sanction in the sanctuary itself, whither a forerunner had entered, giving not only a word, an oath, but a personal guarantee for the fulfilment of these promises, and the sanctuary of God as a refuge for the heart; thus giving, for those who had spiritual understanding, a heavenly character to the hope which they cherished; while shewing, by the character of Him who had entered into heaven,

		Although there is no difficulty here, it is important to have light with regard to these two covenants, because some have very vague ideas on this point, and many souls, putting themselves under covenants -- that is, in relationship with God under conditions in which He has not placed them -- lose their simplicity, and do not hold fast grace and the fulness of the work of Christ, and the position He has acquired for them in heaven.<a name=214:10></a>

		<b>Chapter 9.<a name=215:6></a></b> The epistle, recounting some particular circumstances which characterised the first covenant, shews that neither were sins put away, nor was the conscience purged by its means, nor the entrance into the holiest granted to the worshippers.<a name=215:7></a> The veil concealed God.<a name=215:8></a> The high priest went in once a year to make reconciliation -- no one else.<a name=215:9></a> The way to God in holiness was barred.<a name=215:10></a> Perfect, as pertaining to the conscience, they could not be through the blood of bulls and of goats.<a name=215:11></a> These were but provisionary and figurative ordinances, until God took up the real work itself, in order to accomplish it fully and for ever.<a name=215:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this brings us to the focus of the light which God gives us by the Holy Ghost in this epistle.<a name=215:13></a> Before proving by the scriptures of the Old Testament the doctrine that he announced, and the discontinuance of the legal sacrifices -- of all sacrifice for sin, the writer, with a heart full of the truth and of the importance of that truth, teaches the value and the extent of the sacrifice of Christ (still in contrast with the former offerings, but a contrast that rests on the intrinsic value of the offering of Christ).<a name=215:14></a> These three results are presented: -- first, the opened way into the sanctuary was manifested; that is, access to God Himself, where He is; second, the purification of the conscience; third, an eternal redemption; I may add the promise of an eternal inheritance.<a name=215:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One feels the immense importance, the inestimable value, of the first.<a name=215:16></a> The believer is admitted into God's own presence by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh; has constant access to God, immediate access to the place where He is, in the light.<a name=215:17></a> What complete salvation, what blessedness, what security!<a name=215:18></a> For how could we have access to God in the light, if everything that would separate us from Him, were not entirely taken away through Him who was once offered to bear the sins of many?<a name=215:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here it is the precious and perfect result, in this respect, which is revealed to us, and formally proved in chapter 10, as a right that we possess, that access to God Himself is entirely and freely open to us.<a name=216:1></a> We are not indeed told in this passage that we are seated there, for it is not our union with Christ that is the subject of this epistle, but our access to God in the sanctuary.<a name=216:2></a> And it is important to note this last, and it is as precious in its place as the other.<a name=216:3></a> We are viewed as on earth, and being on earth we have free and full access to God in the sanctuary.<a name=216:4></a> We go in perfect liberty to God, where His holiness dwells, and where nothing that is contrary to Him can be admitted.<a name=216:5></a> What happiness!<a name=216:6></a> What perfect grace!<a name=216:7></a> What a glorious result, supreme and complete!<a name=216:8></a> Could anything better be desired, remembering too that it is our dwelling-place?<a name=216:9></a> This is our position in the presence of God through the entrance of Christ into the sanctuary.<a name=216:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second result shews us the personal state we are brought into, in order to the enjoyment of our position; that we may on our part, enter in freely.<a name=216:11></a> It is that our Saviour has rendered our conscience perfect, so that we can go into the sanctuary without an idea of fear, without one question as to sin arising in our minds.<a name=216:12></a> A perfect conscience is not an innocent conscience which, happy in its unconsciousness, does not know evil, and does not know God revealed in holiness.<a name=216:13></a> A perfect conscience knows God; it is cleansed, and, having the knowledge of good and evil according to the light of God Himself, it knows that it is purified from all evil according to His purity.<a name=216:14></a> Now the blood of bulls and goats, and the washings repeated under the law, could never make the conscience perfect.<a name=216:15></a> They could sanctify carnally, so as to enable the worshipper to approach God outwardly, yet only afar off, with the veil still unrent.<a name=216:16></a> But a real purification from sin and sins, so that the soul can be in the presence of God Himself in the light without spot, with the consciousness of being so, the offerings under the law could never produce.<a name=216:17></a> They were but figures.<a name=216:18></a> But, thanks be to God, Christ has accomplished the work; and, present for us now in the heavenly and eternal sanctuary, He is the witness there that our sins are put away; so that all conscience of sin before God is destroyed, because we know that He who bore our sins is in the presence of God, after having accomplished the work of expiation.<a name=216:19></a> Thus we have the consciousness of being in the light without spot.<a name=216:20></a> We have the purification not only of sins

	<div class="paragraph">
		The third result, which seals and characterises the two others, is that Christ, having once entered in, abides in heaven.<a name=217:2></a> He has gone into the heavenly sanctuary to remain there by virtue of an eternal redemption, of blood that has everlasting validity.<a name=217:3></a> The work is completely done, and can never change in value.<a name=217:4></a> If our sins are effectually put away, God glorified, and righteousness complete, that which once availed to effect this can never not avail.<a name=217:5></a> The blood shed once for all is ever efficacious.<a name=217:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Three points remain to be noticed before entering on the subjects of the covenants, which is here resumed.<a name=217:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, Christ is a High Priest of good things to come.<a name=217:13></a> In saying "things to come", the starting-point is Israel under the law before the advent of our Lord.<a name=217:14></a> Nevertheless, if these good things were now acquired, if it could be said, "we have them", because Christianity was their fulfilment, it could hardly be still said -- when Christianity was established -- "good things to come".<a name=217:15></a> They are yet to come.<a name=217:16></a> These "good things" consist of all that the Messiah will enjoy when He reigns.<a name=217:17></a> This also is the reason that the earthly things have their place.<a name=217:18></a> But our present relationship with Him is only and altogether heavenly.<a name=217:19></a> He acts as Priest in a tabernacle which is not of this creation: it is heavenly, in the presence of God, not made with hands.<a name=217:20></a> Our place is in heaven.<a name=217:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second place, "Christ offered himself, by the eternal Spirit,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:217">footnote</a></i>) without spot, to God".<a name=217:22></a> Here the precious offering

	<div class="paragraph">
		up of Christ is viewed as an act that He performed as man, though in the perfection and value of His Person.<a name=218:1></a> He offered Himself to God -- but as moved by the power, and according to the perfection of the eternal Spirit.<a name=218:2></a> All the motives that governed this action, and the accomplishment of the fact according to those motives, were purely and perfectly those of the Holy Ghost; that is, absolutely divine in their perfection, but of the Holy Ghost acting in a man (a man without sin who, born and living ever by the power of the Holy Ghost, had never known sin; who, being exempt from it by birth, never allowed it to enter into Him); so that it is the Man Christ who offers Himself.<a name=218:3></a> This was requisite.<a name=218:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the offering was in itself perfect and pure, without defilement; and the act of offering was perfect, whether in love or in obedience, or in the desire to glorify God, or to accomplish the purpose of God.<a name=218:5></a> Nothing mingled itself with the perfection of His intent in offering Himself.<a name=218:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, it was not a temporary offering, which applied to one sin with which the conscience was burdened and which went no farther than that one, an offering which could not, by its nature, have the perfection spoken of, because it was not the Person offering up Himself, nor was it absolutely for God, because there was in it neither the perfection of will nor of obedience.<a name=218:7></a> But the offering of Christ was one which, being perfect in its moral nature, being in itself perfect in the eyes of God, was necessarily eternal in its value.<a name=218:8></a> For this value was as enduring as the nature of God who was glorified in it.<a name=218:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was made, not of necessity, but of free will, and in obedience.<a name=218:10></a> It was made by a Man for the glory of God, but through the eternal Spirit, ever the same in its nature and value.<a name=218:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All being thus perfectly fulfilled for the glory of God, the conscience of every one that comes to Him by this offering is purged; dead works are blotted out and set aside; we stand before God on the ground of that which Christ has done.<a name=218:12></a>

		Two consequences flow from these views of atonement and reconciliation to God.<a name=223:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, it was necessary that there should be a better sacrifice, a more excellent victim, than those which were offered under the old covenant, because it was the heavenly things themselves, and not their figures, that were to be purified.<a name=223:17></a> For it is into the presence of God in heaven itself that Christ has entered.<a name=223:18></a>

		Secondly, Christ was not to offer Himself often, as the high priest went in every year with the blood of others.<a name=223:19></a> For He offered up Himself.<a name=223:20></a> Hence, if all that was available in the sacrifice was not brought to perfection by a single offering once made, He must have suffered often since the foundation of the world.<a name=223:21></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:223">footnote</a></i>) This remark leads to the clear and simple declaration of the ways of God on this point -- a declaration of priceless value.<a name=223:22></a> God allowed ages to pass (the different distinct periods in which man has in divers ways been put to the test, and in which he has had time to shew what he is) without yet accomplishing His work of grace.<a name=223:23></a> This trial of man has served to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God had made this plain, before the law, under the law, by promises, by the coming and presence of His Son, then the work of God takes the place, for our salvation and God's glory, of man's responsibility -- on the ground of which faith knows man is entirely lost.<a name=224:4></a> This explains the expression (verse 26) "in the consummation of the ages".<a name=224:5></a>

		Observe, here, that which is very important, that the conscience is cleansed, our sins being expiated, the worshipper drawing nigh by virtue of the sacrifice.<a name=229:4></a> The meaning of the Jewish service was that guilt was still there; that of the Christian, that it is gone.<a name=229:5></a> As to the former, precious as the type is, the reason is evident: the blood of bulls and of goats could not take away sin.<a name=229:6></a> Therefore those sacrifices have been abolished, and a work of another character (although still a sacrifice) has been accomplished -- a work which excludes all other, and all the repetition of the same, because it consists of nothing less than the self-devotedness of the Son of God to accomplish the will of God, and the completion of that to which He was devoted: an act impossible to be repeated, for all His will cannot be accomplished twice, and, were it possible, it would be a testimony of the inadequacy of the first, and so of both.<a name=229:7></a>

		This is what the Son of God says in this most solemn passage (verse 5 - 9), in which we are admitted to know, according to the grace of God, that which passed between God the Father and Himself, when He undertook the fulfilment of the will of God -- that which He said, and the eternal counsels of God which He carried into execution.<a name=229:8></a> He takes the place of submission and of obedience, of performing the will of another.<a name=229:9></a> God would no longer accept the sacrifices that were offered under the law (the four classes of which are here pointed out), He had no pleasure in them.<a name=229:10></a> In their stead He had prepared a body for His Son; vast and important truth!<a name=229:11></a> for the place of man is obedience.<a name=229:12></a> Thus, in taking this place, the Son of God put Himself into the position to obey perfectly.<a name=229:13></a> In fact He undertakes the duty of fulfilling all the will of God, be it what it may -- a will which is ever "good, acceptable, and perfect".<a name=229:14></a>

		In reality, from chapter 1 of this epistle, the Holy Ghost always presents Christ in this way.<a name=232:4></a> But this revelation in the psalm was requisite to explain how He became a servant, what the Messiah really was; and to us it opens an immense view of the ways of God, a view, the depths of which -- clearly as it is revealed, and through the very clearness of the revelation -- display to us things so divine and glorious that we bow the head and veil our faces, as having had part as it were in such communications, on account of the majesty of the Persons whose acts and whose intimate relationships are revealed.<a name=232:5></a> It is not here the glory that dazzles us.<a name=232:6></a> But even in this poor world there is nothing to which we are greater strangers than the intimacy of those who are, in their modes of life, much above ourselves.<a name=232:7></a> What then, when it is that of God!<a name=232:8></a> Blessed be His name!<a name=232:9></a> there is grace that brings us into it, and that has drawn nigh to us in our weakness.<a name=232:10></a> We are then admitted to know this precious truth, that the Lord Jesus undertook of His own free will the accomplishment of all the will of God, and that He was pleased to take the body prepared for Him in order to accomplish it.<a name=232:11></a> The love, the devotedness to the glory of God, and the way in which He undertook to obey, are fully set forth.<a name=232:12></a> And this -- the fruit of God's eternal counsels -- displaces (by its very nature) every provisional sign: and contains, in itself alone, the condition of all relationship with God, and the means by which He glorifies Himself.<a name=232:13></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:232">footnote</a></i>)

		We shall observe that the epistle does not here speak of the communication of life, or of a practical sanctification wrought by the Holy Ghost:(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:233">footnote</a></i>) the subject is the Person of Christ ascended on high, and the efficacy of His work.<a name=233:5></a> And this is important with regard to sanctification, because it shews that sanctification is a complete setting apart to God, as belonging to Him at the price of the offering of Jesus, a consecration to Him by means of that offering.<a name=233:6></a> God took the unclean Jews from among men and set them apart -- consecrated them to Himself; so now the called ones, from that nation; and, thank God ourselves also, by means of the offering of Jesus.<a name=233:7></a>

		The priests among the Jews -- for this contrast is still carried on -- stood before the altar continually to repeat the same sacrifices which could never take away sins.<a name=234:1></a> But this Man, when He had offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down for ever(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:234">footnote</a></i>) at the right hand of God.<a name=234:2></a> There -- having finished for His own all that regards their presentation without spot to God -- He awaits the moment when His enemies shall be made His footstool, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>"Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=234:3></a> And the Spirit gives us the important reason so infinitely precious to us: "For he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".<a name=234:4></a>

		Here (verse 14) as in verse 12, on which the latter depends, the word "for ever" has the force of permanence -- uninterrupted continuity.<a name=234:5></a> He is ever seated, we are ever perfected, by virtue of His work and according to the perfect righteousness in which, and conformably to which, He sits at the right hand of God upon His throne, according to that which He is personally there, His acceptance on God's part being proved by His session at His right hand.<a name=234:6></a> And He is there for us.<a name=234:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that this position has its origin in the will, the good-will of God (a will which combines the grace and the purpose of God), and that it has its foundation and present certainty in the accomplishment of the work of Christ, the perfection of which is demonstrated by the session at the right hand of God of Him who accomplished it.<a name=234:12></a> But the testimony -- for to enjoy this grace we must know it with divine certainty, and the greater it is, the more would our hearts be led to doubt it -- the testimony upon which we believe it must be divine.<a name=234:13></a> And this it is.<a name=234:14></a> The Holy Ghost bears witness to us of it.<a name=234:15></a> The will of God is the source of the work; Christ, the Son of God, accomplished it; the Holy Ghost bears witness to us of it.<a name=234:16></a>

		We may remark here the way in which the covenant is introduced; for although, as writing to "the holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling", he says, "a witness to us", the form of his address is always that of an epistle to the Hebrews (believers, of course, but Hebrews, still bearing the character of God's people).<a name=235:7></a> He does not speak of the covenant in a direct way, as a privilege in which Christians had a direct part.<a name=235:8></a> The Holy Ghost, he says, declares, "I will remember no more", etc.<a name=235:9></a> It is this which he quotes.<a name=235:10></a> He only alludes to the new covenant, leaving it aside consequently as to all present application.<a name=235:11></a> For after having said, "This is the covenant", etc.<a name=235:12></a>, the testimony is cited as that of the Holy Ghost, to prove the capital point which he was treating, that is, that God remembers our sins no more.<a name=235:13></a> But he alludes to the covenant (already known to the Jews as declared before of God) which gave the authority of the scriptures to this testimony, that God remembered no more the sins of His people who are sanctified and admitted into His favour, and which, at the same time, presented these two thoughts; first, that this complete pardon did not exist under the first covenant: and, second, that the door is left open for the blessing of the nation when the new covenant shall be formally established.<a name=235:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another practical consequence is drawn: sins being remitted, there is no more oblation for sin.<a name=235:15></a> The one sacrifice having obtained remission, no others can be offered in order to obtain it.<a name=235:16></a> Remembrance of this one sacrifice there may indeed be, whatever its character; but a sacrifice to take away the sins which are already taken away, there cannot be.<a name=235:17></a> We are therefore in reality on entirely new ground -- on that of the fact, that by the sacrifice of Christ our sins are altogether put away, and that for us, who are sanctified and partakers of the heavenly calling, a perfect and everlasting permanent cleansing has been

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus all liberty is ours to enter into the holy place (all boldness) by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, that is His flesh, to admit us without spot into the presence of God Himself, who is there revealed.<a name=236:3></a> For us the veil is rent, and that which rent the veil in order to admit us has likewise put away the sin which shut us out.<a name=236:4></a>
	</div>

		We have also a great High Priest over the house of God, as we have seen, who represents us in the holy place.<a name=236:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On these truths are founded the exhortations that follow.<a name=236:6></a> One word before we enter on them, as to the relation that exists between perfect righteousness and the priesthood.<a name=236:7></a> There are many souls who use the priesthood as the means of obtaining pardon when they have failed.<a name=236:8></a> They go to Christ as a priest, that He may intercede for them and obtain the pardon which they desire, but for which they dare not ask God in a direct way.<a name=236:9></a> These souls -- sincere as they are -- have not liberty to enter into the holy place.<a name=236:10></a> They take refuge with Christ that they may afresh be brought into the presence of God.<a name=236:11></a> Their condition practically is that in which a pious Jew stood.<a name=236:12></a> They have lost, or rather they have never had by faith, the real consciousness of their position before God in virtue of the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=236:13></a> I do not speak here of all the privileges of the assembly: we have seen that the epistle does not speak of them.<a name=236:14></a> The position it makes for believers is this: those whom it addresses are not viewed as placed in heaven, although partakers of the heavenly calling; but a perfect redemption is accomplished, all guilt entirely put away for the people of God, who remembers their sins no more.<a name=236:15></a> The conscience is made perfect -- they have no more conscience of sins -- by virtue of the work accomplished once for all.<a name=236:16></a> There is no more question of sin; that is, of its imputation, of its being upon them before God, between them and God.<a name=236:17></a> There cannot be, because of the work accomplished upon the cross.<a name=236:18></a> The conscience therefore is perfect; their Representative and High Priest is in heaven, a witness there to the work already accomplished for them.<a name=236:19></a>

		Thus we have (chapters 6, 10) the two great privileges of Christianity, what distinguishes it from Judaism, presented in order to warn those who made profession of the former, that the renunciation of the truth, after enjoying these advantages, was fatal; for if these means of salvation were renounced, there was no other.<a name=239:13></a> These privileges were the manifested presence and power of the Holy Ghost, and the offering which, by its intrinsic and absolute value, left no place for any other.<a name=239:14></a> Both of these possessed a mighty efficacy, which, while it gave divine spring and force, and the manifestation of the presence of God on the one hand, made known on the other hand the eternal redemption and the perfection of the worshipper; leaving no means for repentance, if any one abandoned the manifested and known power of that presence; no place for another sacrifice (which, moreover, would have denied the efficacy of the first), after the perfect work of God in salvation, perfect whether

		Having named Sion below, the author turns naturally to Jerusalem above, but this carries him into heaven, and he finds himself with all the people of God, in the midst of a multitude of angels, the great universal assembly(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:257">footnote</a></i>) of the invisible world.<a name=257:8></a> There is however one peculiar object on which his eye rests in this marvellous and heavenly scene.<a name=257:9></a> It is the assembly of the firstborn whose names are inscribed in heaven.<a name=257:10></a> They were not born there, not indigenous like the angels, whom God preserved from falling.<a name=257:11></a> They are the objects of the counsels of God.<a name=257:12></a> It is not merely that they reach heaven: they are the glorious heirs and firstborn of God, according to His eternal counsels, in accordance with which they are registered in heaven.<a name=257:13></a> The assembly composed of the objects of grace, now called in Christ, belongs to heaven by grace.<a name=257:14></a> They are not the objects of the promises, who, not having received the fulfilment of the promises on earth, do not fail to enjoy them in heaven.<a name=257:15></a> They have the anticipation of no other country or citizenship than heaven.<a name=257:16></a> The promises were not addressed to them.<a name=257:17></a> They have no place on earth.<a name=257:18></a> Heaven is prepared for them by God Himself.<a name=257:19></a> Their names are inscribed there by Him.<a name=257:20></a> It is the highest place in heaven above the dealings of God in government,

		It was the purpose of God nevertheless to bless the earth.<a name=258:7></a> He could not do so according to man's responsibility: His people even were but as grass.<a name=258:8></a> He would therefore establish a new covenant with Israel, a covenant of pardon, and according to which He would write the law in the hearts of His people.<a name=258:9></a> The Mediator of this covenant had already appeared and had done all that was required for its establishment.<a name=258:10></a> The saints among the Hebrews were come to the Mediator of the new covenant: blessing was thus prepared for the earth and secured to it.<a name=258:11></a>

		Finally, the blood of Christ had been shed on earth, as that of Abel by Cain; but, instead of crying from the earth for vengeance, so that Cain became a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth (a striking type of the Jew, guilty of the death of Christ), it is grace that speaks; and the shed blood cries to obtain pardon and peace for those who shed it.<a name=258:12></a>

		It will be observed that, although speaking of the different parts of millennial blessing, with its foundations, all is given according to the present condition of things, before the coming of that time of blessing from God.<a name=258:13></a> We are in it as to our relationships; but the spirits of the just men of the Old Testament only are here spoken of, and only the Mediator of this new covenant: the covenant itself is not established.<a name=258:14></a> The blood cries, but the answer in earthly blessing has not yet come.<a name=258:15></a> This is easily understood.<a name=258:16></a> It is exactly according to the existing state of things, and even throws considerable light on the position of the Hebrew Christians and on the doctrine of the epistle.<a name=258:17></a> The important thing for them was, that they should not turn away from Him who spoke from heaven.<a name=258:18></a> It was with

	<div class="paragraph">
		Meanwhile the first fruits of this new creation were being formed; and in Christianity God was forming the heavenly part of the kingdom that cannot be moved; and Judaism -- the centre of the earthly system and of human responsibility -- was passing away.<a name=259:11></a> The apostle therefore announces the shaking of all things -- that everything which exists as the present creation shall be set aside.<a name=259:12></a> With regard to the present fact he says only, "we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved"; and calls us to serve God with true piety, because our God is a consuming fire; not -- as people say -- God out of Christ, but our God.<a name=259:13></a> This is His character in holy majesty and in righteous judgment of evil.<a name=259:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with regard to Judaism, in which the Hebrews were naturally inclined to seek satisfaction for the flesh, the apostle goes farther.<a name=260:13></a> They were no longer Jews in the possession of the true worship of God, a privileged worship in which others had no right to participate.<a name=260:14></a> The altar of God belonged now to the Christians.<a name=260:15></a> Christians only had a right to it.<a name=260:16></a> An earthly worship, in which there was no entering within the veil, into God's own presence in the sanctuary, could no longer subsist -- a worship that had its worldly glory, that belonged to the elements of this world and had its place there.<a name=260:17></a> Now, it is either heaven, or the cross and shame.<a name=260:18></a> The great sacrifice for sin has been offered; but by its efficacy, it brings us into the

		JAMES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle of James is not addressed to the assembly, and does not take the ground of apostolic authority over the persons to whom it is sent.<a name=263:1></a> It is a practical exhortation which still recognises the twelve tribes and the connection of the christian Jews with them, as Jonah addressed the Gentiles, although the Jewish people had their place before God.<a name=263:2></a> Thus the Spirit of God still acknowledges here the relationship with Israel, as in the other case the relationship with Gentiles, and the rights of God which are unchangeable, whatever may be the special privileges granted to the assembly or to Israel respectively.<a name=263:3></a> We know that historically the christian Jews remained Jews to the end of the New Testament history, and were even zealous for the law -- to us a strange thing, but which God endured for a time.<a name=263:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of Christianity is not the subject of this epistle.<a name=263:5></a> It gives God His place in the conscience, and with regard to all that surrounds us.<a name=263:6></a> It thus girds up the lions of the Christian, presenting also the near coming of the Lord and His present discipline -- a discipline with respect to which the assembly of God ought to possess intelligence, and activity founded thereon.<a name=263:7></a> The world also, and all that makes an appearance in it, is judged from God's point of view.<a name=263:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A few remarks on the position of Christians (that is, on the way in which this position is viewed with respect to Israel) will help us to understand this portion of the Word.<a name=263:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel is still regarded as the people of God.<a name=263:10></a> To the faith of James the nation has still the relationship which God had given it towards Himself.<a name=263:11></a> The Christians in it are addressed as still forming part of a people whose links with God were not yet judicially broken; but it was only the Christians among them who possessed the faith which the Spirit gave in the true Messiah.<a name=263:12></a> These only among the people, with the writer, acknowledged Jesus as the Lord of glory.<a name=263:13></a> With the exception of verses 14, 15, in chapter 5, this epistle contains no exhortation which, in its spiritual height, goes beyond that which might be addressed to a godly Jew.<a name=263:14></a> It supposes indeed that the persons to whom it speaks have faith in the Lord Jesus; but it does not call them to that which is exclusively proper to Christianity and depends

		on its privileges.<a name=264:1></a> The exhortations flow from that higher source and breathe the more heavenly atmosphere, but the effect they aim at producing consists in real proofs of religion here below; they are such as might be heard in the professing church -- a vast body like Israel, in the midst of which some Christians existed.<a name=264:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle is not founded on christian relationships here below.<a name=264:3></a> It acknowledges them; but only as one fact in the midst of others, which have rights over the conscience of the writer.<a name=264:4></a> It supposes those whom it addresses to be in a relationship with God, which is known, unquestioned, and of ancient date; in the midst of which Christianity has been introduced.<a name=264:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to notice the moral measure of the life which this epistle presents.<a name=264:6></a> As soon as we apprehend the position in which it views believers, the discernment of the truth on this point is not difficult.<a name=264:7></a> It is the same as that which Christ presented when walking in the midst of Israel and setting before His disciples the light, and the relationships with God, which resulted to them from His presence.<a name=264:8></a> Now indeed He was absent; but that light and those relationships are retained as the measure of responsibility.<a name=264:9></a> And this the Lord's return would vindicate by judgment on those who refused to accept and walk in it.<a name=264:10></a> Until that day the faithful were to be patient in the midst of the oppression they were suffering from on the part of the Jews, who still blasphemed the holy name by which they were called.<a name=264:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the converse of the epistle to the Hebrews with regard to their relationship with the Jewish nation; not morally, but because of the nearness of the judgment when the epistle to the Hebrews was written.<a name=264:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fundamental principles of the position that we have been speaking of are as follows: the law in its spirituality and perfection, as stated and summed up by Christ; a life imparted, which has the moral principles of the law, itself a divine life; the revelation of the Father's name.<a name=264:13></a> All this was true when the Lord was on the earth, and was the ground on which (however poorly they understood it) He then placed His disciples.<a name=264:14></a> He told them that they were to be witnesses of it, as of all He had said, after His death, distinguishing this testimony from that of the Holy Ghost.<a name=264:15></a>

		It is this which James teaches here, with the addition of that which the Lord had also said -- that He would come again.<a name=264:16></a> It

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=265>[Page 265]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is the doctrine of Christ with regard to walk in the midst of Israel, according to the light and the truths which He had introduced; and -- seeing that He was still absent -- an exhortation to perseverance and patience in that walk, waiting for the moment when, by judgment on those who oppressed them, He would vindicate the principles on which they walked.<a name=265:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although the judgment executed on Jerusalem changed the position of the remnant of Israel in this respect, yet the life of Christ remains ever our model: and we have to wait with patience until the Lord come.<a name=265:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not in this epistle the association of the Christian with Christ exalted on high, nor consequently the thought of going to meet Him in the air, as Paul taught.<a name=265:3></a> But that which it contains ever remains true: and he who says that he abides in Him (Christ) ought also to walk even as He walked.<a name=265:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The judgment that was coming makes us understand the way in which James speaks of the world, of the rich who rejoice in their portion in the world, and the position of the believing remnant oppressed and suffering in the midst of the unbelieving nation; why he begins with the subject of the tribulations and so often recurs to it: why also he insists on practical evidences of faith.<a name=265:5></a> He still sees all Israel together; but some had received faith in the Lord of glory, and these were tempted to value the rich and the great in Israel.<a name=265:6></a> All being still Jews, we can easily understand that, while some truly believed and confessed their belief that Jesus was the Christ, yet, as these Christians followed the Jewish ordinances, mere professors might do as much without the least vital change being proved by their works.<a name=265:7></a> It is evident that a faith like this has no value whatever.<a name=265:8></a> It is precisely the faith of those who clamour for works in the present day -- a mere dead profession of the truth of Christianity.<a name=265:9></a> To be begotten by the word of truth is as foreign and strange to them as to the Jews of whom James is speaking.<a name=265:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Believers being thus placed in the midst of Israel with some who merely professed faith, we can readily understand the apostle's address to the mass as those who might share in the privileges that existed in their midst; his address to Christians as having a special place of their own; and his warning to those who called themselves believers in Christ.<a name=265:11></a> Most easy and perfectly clear is the practical application to all times, and in particular when a mass of persons assume a right by inheritance to the privileges of the people of God.<a name=265:12></a> Besides this, the epistle
	</div>

		has peculiar force for the individual conscience; it judges the position one is in, and the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=266:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle then begins with an exhortation to rejoice in trial, as a means of producing patience.<a name=266:2></a> This subject in the main continues to the end of verse 20, where the idea turns towards the necessity of curbing everything that opposes itself to patience and towards the true character of one who stands in the presence of God.<a name=266:3></a> This address, as a whole, ends with the chapter.<a name=266:4></a> The connection of the reasoning is not always easy to find; the key to it is the moral condition with which the apostle's mind is occupied.<a name=266:5></a> I will endeavour to make the connection more apparent.<a name=266:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject in the main is, that we ought to walk before God to shew the reality of our profession in contrast with union with the world -- practical religion.<a name=266:7></a> Patience then must have its perfect work; thus self-will is subdued, and the whole of God's will is accepted; consequently nothing is wanting to the practical life of the soul.<a name=266:8></a> The believer may suffer; but he patiently waits on the Lord.<a name=266:9></a> This Christ did; it was His perfection.<a name=266:10></a> He waited for the will of God, and never did His own will thus obedience was perfect, man thoroughly tested.<a name=266:11></a> But in fact we often lack wisdom to know what we ought to do.<a name=266:12></a> Here it says the resource is evident: we are to ask wisdom from God.<a name=266:13></a> He gives to all liberally; only we must count upon His faithfulness and upon an answer to our prayers.<a name=266:14></a> Otherwise the heart is double; there is dependence elsewhere than on God; our desires have another object.<a name=266:15></a> If we only seek that which God wills and that which God does, we depend securely on Him to accomplish it; and as to the circumstances of this world, which might make one believe that it was useless to depend on God, they vanish away as the flower of the field.<a name=266:16></a> We ought to have the consciousness that our place according to God is not that which is of this world.<a name=266:17></a> He who is in a low station should rejoice that Christianity exalts him; the rich, that it humbles him.<a name=266:18></a> It is not in riches that we are to rejoice (they pass away), but in the exercises of heart of which the apostle had been speaking; for after having been tried we shall receive the crown of life.<a name=266:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The life of one who is thus tried, and in whom this life develops itself in obedience to the entire will of God, is well worth that of a man who indulges all the desires of his heart in luxury.<a name=266:20></a>

		Now with regard to temptations of this last character, into which the lusts of the heart cause men to fall, it must not be said that these lusts come from God: the heart of man is their source -- its lusts which lead through sin to death.<a name=267:1></a> Let no one deceive himself on this point.<a name=267:2></a> That which inwardly tempts the heart comes from oneself.<a name=267:3></a> All good and perfect gifts come from God, and He never changes, He does nothing but good.<a name=267:4></a> Accordingly He has given us a new nature, the fruit of His own will working in us by the word of truth, in order that we should be as it were first-fruits of His creatures.<a name=267:5></a> The Father of lights, that which is darkness does not come from Him.<a name=267:6></a>

		This law is the law of liberty, because the same word which reveals what God is and what He wills has made us partakers by grace of the divine nature; so that not to walk according to that word would be not to walk according to our own new nature.<a name=268:2></a> Now to walk according to our own new nature, and that the nature of God, and guided by His word, is true liberty.<a name=268:3></a>

		The law given on Sinai was the expression in man, written not on the heart but outside man, of what man's conduct and heart ought to be according to the will of God.<a name=268:4></a> It represses and condemns all the motions of the natural man, and cannot allow him to have a will, for he ought to do the will of God But he has another will, and therefore the law is bondage to him, a law of condemnation and death.<a name=268:5></a> Now, God having begotten us by the word of truth, the nature that we have, as thus born of God, possesses tastes and desires according to that word; it is of that very word.<a name=268:6></a> The word in its own perfection develops this nature, forms it, enlightens it, as we have said; but the nature itself has its liberty in following it.<a name=268:7></a> Thus it was with Christ; if His liberty could have been taken away (which spiritually was impossible), it would have been by preventing Him from doing the will of God the Father.<a name=268:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the same with the new man in us (which is Christ as life in us) which is created in us according to God in righteousness and true holiness, produced in us by the word, which is the perfect revelation of God -- of the whole divine nature in man of which Christ, the living Word, the image of the invisible God, is the manifestation and the pattern.<a name=268:9></a> The liberty of the new man is liberty to do the will of God, to imitate God in character, as being His dear child, according as that character was presented in Christ.<a name=268:10></a> The law of liberty is this character, as it is revealed in the word, in which the new nature finds its joy and satisfaction; even as it drew its existence from the word which reveals Him, and from the God who is therein revealed.<a name=268:11></a>

		Chapter 2.<a name=269:4></a> The apostle now enters on the subject of those who professed to believe that Jesus was Christ the Lord.<a name=269:5></a> Before, in chapter 1, he had spoken of the new nature in connection with God: here the profession of faith in Christ is brought to the same touchstone -- the reality of the fruits produced by it in contrast with this world.<a name=269:6></a> All these principles -- the value of the name of Jesus, the essence of the law as Christ presented it, and the law of liberty -- are brought forward to test the reality of their professed faith, or to convince the professor that he did not possess it.<a name=269:7></a> Two things are reprobated: having respect to the outward appearance of persons; and the absence of good works as a proof of the sincerity of the profession.<a name=269:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, he blames respect for outward appearance of persons.<a name=269:9></a> They profess faith in the Lord Jesus, and yet hold with the spirit of the world!<a name=269:10></a> He replies that God has chosen the poor, making them rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom.<a name=269:11></a> These professors had despised them; these rich men blasphemed the name of Christ and persecuted Christians.<a name=269:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second place he appeals to the practical summary of the law, of which Jesus had spoken -- the royal law.<a name=269:13></a> They broke the law itself in favouring the rich.<a name=269:14></a> Now the law did not allow of any infraction whatsoever of its commands, because the authority of the legislator was concerned.<a name=269:15></a> In despising the poor, they were assuredly not loving their neighbour as themselves.<a name=269:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third place they ought to walk as those whose responsibility was measured by the law of liberty, in which -- possessing a nature which tasted and loved that which was of God -- they were set free from all that was contrary to Him; so that they

		could not excuse themselves if they admitted principles which were not those of God Himself.<a name=270:1></a> This introduction of the divine nature leads the apostle on to speak of the mercy by which God glorifies Himself.<a name=270:2></a> The man who shews no mercy will find himself the object of the judgment which he has loved.<a name=270:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second part of the chapter is connected with this; for he begins his discourse on works, as proofs of faith, by speaking of this mercy which answers to the nature and character of God, of which, as born of Him, the true Christian is made a partaker.<a name=270:4></a> The profession of having faith without this life -- the existence of which is proved by works -- can profit no one.<a name=270:5></a> This is plain enough.<a name=270:6></a> I say the profession of having faith, because the epistle says it: "If a man say he hath faith".<a name=270:7></a> This is the key to this part of the epistle.<a name=270:8></a> He says it: where is the proof of it?<a name=270:9></a> Works are the proof; and it is in this way that the apostle uses them.<a name=270:10></a> A man says he hath faith.<a name=270:11></a> It is not a thing that we can see.<a name=270:12></a> I say therefore with reason, "Shew it me".<a name=270:13></a> This is the evidence of faith which is required for man -- it is only by its fruits that we make it evident to men; for the faith itself cannot be seen.<a name=270:14></a> But if I produce these fruits, then assuredly I have the root, without which there could not be the fruits.<a name=270:15></a> Thus faith does not shew itself to others, nor can I recognise it, without works; but works, the fruit of faith, prove the existence of faith.<a name=270:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which follows shews that he is speaking of the profession of a doctrine, true perhaps in itself -- of certain truths being confessed; for it is a real faith looked at -- certainty of knowledge and conviction -- which devils have of the unity of the Godhead.<a name=270:17></a> They do not doubt it; but there is no link at all between their heart and God by means of a new nature -- far indeed from it.<a name=270:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the apostle confirms this, by the case of men in whom the opposition to the divine nature is not so apparent.<a name=270:19></a> Faith, the recognition of the truth with respect to Christ, is dead without works; that is, such a faith as produces none is dead.<a name=270:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see (verse 16) that the faith of which the apostle speaks is a profession devoid of reality; verse 19 shews that it may be an unfeigned certainty that the thing is true: but the life begotten by the word, so that a relationship is formed between the soul and God, is entirely wanting.<a name=270:21></a> Because this takes place through the word, it is faith; being begotten of God we have a new life.<a name=270:22></a> This life acts, that is to say, faith acts, according to the relationship

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 20 to the end he presents a fresh proof of his thesis, founded on the last principle that I have mentioned.<a name=271:2></a> Now these proofs have nothing at all to do with the fruits of a kindly nature (for there are such), appertaining to us as creatures, but not to that life which has for its source the word of God, by which He begets us.<a name=271:3></a> The fruits of which the apostle speaks, bear testimony by their very character to the faith that produced them.<a name=271:4></a> Abraham offered up his son; Rahab received the messengers of Israel, associating herself with the people of God when everything was against them, and separating herself from her own people by faith.<a name=271:5></a> All sacrificed for God, all given up for His people before they had gained one victory, and while the world was in full power, such were the fruits of faith.<a name=271:6></a> One referred to God; and believed Him in the most absolute way, against all that is in nature or on which nature can count; the other owned God's people, when all was against them; but neither was the fruit of an amiable nature or natural good, such as men call good works.<a name=271:7></a> One was a father going to put his son to death, the other a bad woman betraying her country.<a name=271:8></a> Certainly the scripture was fulfilled which said that Abraham believed God.<a name=271:9></a> How could he have acted as he did, if he had not believed Him?<a name=271:10></a> Works put a seal on his faith: and faith without works is but like the body without the soul, an outward form devoid of the life that animates it.<a name=271:11></a> Faith acts in the works (without it the works are a nullity, they are not those of the new life), and the works complete the faith which acts in them; for in spite of trial, and in the trial, faith is in activity.<a name=271:12></a> Works of law have no part in it.<a name=271:13></a> The outward law which exacts, is not a life which produces (apart from this divine nature) these holy and loving dispositions which, having God and His people for their object, value nothing else.<a name=271:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James, remark, never says that works justify us before God; for God can see the faith without its works.<a name=271:15></a> He knows that life is there.<a name=271:16></a> It is in exercise with regard to Him, towards Him, by trust in His word, in Himself, by receiving His testimony in spite of everything within and without.<a name=271:17></a> This God sees and knows.<a name=271:18></a> But when our fellow-creatures are in question, when it must be said "shew me", then faith, life, shews itself in works.<a name=271:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wisdom that comes from above, having its place in the life, in the heart, has three characteristics.<a name=272:5></a> First of all, the character of purity, for the heart is in communion with God -- has intercourse with Him; therefore, there must needs be this purity.<a name=272:6></a> Next, it is peaceable, gentle, ready to yield to the will of another.<a name=272:7></a> Then, full of good works, acting by a principle which, as its origin and motives are from above, does good without partiality; that is to say, its action is not guided by the circumstances which influence the flesh and the passions of men.<a name=272:8></a> For the same reason it is sincere and unfeigned.<a name=272:9></a> Purity, absence of will and self, activity in good, such are the characteristics of heavenly wisdom.<a name=272:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These directions to bridle the tongue, as the first movement and expression of the will of the natural man, extend to believers.<a name=272:11></a> There are not to be (as to the inward disposition of the man) many teachers.<a name=272:12></a> We all fail; and to teach others and fail ourselves only increases our condemnation.<a name=272:13></a> For vanity can easily be fed in teaching others; and that is a very different thing from having the life quickened by the power of truth.<a name=272:14></a> The Holy Ghost bestows His gifts as He pleases.<a name=272:15></a> The apostle speaks here of the propensity in any one to teach, not of the gift he may have received for teaching.<a name=272:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all that follows (chapter 4) we have still the judgment of unbridled nature, of will in its different forms: contentions that arise from the lusts of the natural heart; requests made to God proceeding from the same source; the desires of the flesh and of the mind developing themselves and finding their sphere in the friendship of the world, which is thus enmity against God.<a name=272:17></a> The nature of man covets enviously, is full of envy with regard to others.<a name=272:18></a> But God gives more grace: there is counteracting power, if one is content to be little and humble, to be as nothing in the world.<a name=272:19></a> The grace and favour of God are with such a one; for He resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.<a name=272:20></a>

		Upon this, the apostle unfolds the action of a soul directed by the Spirit of God, in the midst of the unbelieving and selfish multitude with whom it was associated (verse 6 - 10).<a name=273:1></a> For he still supposes the believers whom he addressed to be in connection with the law.<a name=273:2></a> If they spoke evil of their brother, to whom the law gave a place before God, they spoke evil of the law,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:273">footnote</a></i>) according to which his value was so great.<a name=273:3></a> Judgment belonged to God, who had given the law, and who would vindicate His own authority as well as grant deliverance and salvation.<a name=273:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle gives the coming of the Lord as the term of their condition, both to the unbelieving rich oppressors in Israel, and to the poor believing remnant.<a name=273:12></a> The rich have heaped up treasures for the last days; the oppressed poor are to be patient until the Lord Himself shall come to deliver them.<a name=273:13></a> Moreover, he says, deliverance would not be delayed.<a name=273:14></a> The husbandman waits for the rain and the time of harvest; the Christian for his Master's coming.<a name=273:15></a> This patience characterises, as we have seen, the walk of faith.<a name=273:16></a> It had been witnessed in the prophets; and in the case of others we count them happy which endure afflictions for the Lord's sake.<a name=273:17></a> Job shews us the ways of the Lord: he needed to have patience, but the end of the Lord was blessing and tender mercy towards him.<a name=273:18></a>

		Oaths displayed still more the forgetfulness of God, and the actings consequently of the self-will of nature.<a name=274:5></a> "Yea", ought to be yea, and "Nay", nay.<a name=274:6></a> The actings of the divine nature in the consciousness of the presence of God, and the repression of all human will and of sinful nature, is what the writer of this epistle desires.<a name=274:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there were resources in Christianity both for joy and sorrow.<a name=274:8></a> If any were afflicted, let them pray (God was ready to hear); if happy, let them sing; if sick, send for the elders of the assembly, who would pray for the sufferer and anoint him, and the chastisement would be removed, and the sins for which, according to God's government, he was thus chastised, would be forgiven as regards that government; for it is that only which is here spoken of.<a name=274:9></a>

		The imputation of sin for condemnation has no place here.<a name=274:10></a> The efficacy of the prayer of faith is set before us; but it is in connection with the maintenance of sincerity of heart.<a name=274:11></a> The government of God is exercised with regard to His people.<a name=274:12></a> He chastises them by sickness; and it is important that truth in the inner man should be maintained.<a name=274:13></a> Men hide their faults; they desire to walk as if all were going on well; but God judges His people.<a name=274:14></a> He tries the heart and the reins.<a name=274:15></a> They are held in bonds of affliction.<a name=274:16></a> God shews them their faults, or their unbroken self-will.<a name=274:17></a> Man "is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:19">Job  33:19</a>.<a name=274:18></a> And now the church of God intervenes in charity, and according to its own order, by means of the elders; the sick man commits himself to God, confessing his state of need; the charity of the church acts and brings him who is chastised, according to this relationship, before God -- for that is where the church is.<a name=274:19></a> Faith pleads this relationship of grace; the sick man is healed.<a name=274:20></a> If sins -- and not merely the need of discipline -- were the cause of his chastisement, those sins will not hinder his being healed, they shall be forgiven him.<a name=274:21></a>

		The apostle then presents the principle in general as the course for all, namely, to open their hearts to each other, in order to maintain truth in the inner man as to oneself; and to pray for each other in order that charity should be in full exercise with regard to the faults of others; grace and truth being thus spiritually formed in the church, and a perfect union of heart among Christians, so that even their faults are an occasion for the exercise of charity (as in God towards us), and entire confidence in each other, according to that charity, such as is felt towards a restoring and pardoning God.<a name=275:1></a> What a beautiful picture is presented of divine principles animating men and causing them to act according to the nature of God Himself, and the influence of His love upon the heart.<a name=275:2></a>

		We may remark, that it is not confession to the elders that is spoken of.<a name=275:3></a> That would have been confidence in men -- official confidence.<a name=275:4></a> God desires the operation of divine charity in all.<a name=275:5></a> Confession to one another shews the condition of the church, and God would have the church to be in such a state, that love should so reign in it, that they should be so near to God, as to be able to treat the transgressor according to the grace they know in Him: and that this love should be so realised, that perfect inward sincerity should be produced by the confidence and operation of grace.<a name=275:6></a> Official confession destroys all this -- is contrary to it.<a name=275:7></a> How divine the wisdom which omitted confession when speaking of the elders, but which commands it as the living and voluntary impression of the heart!<a name=275:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us also to the value of the energetic prayers of the righteous man.<a name=275:9></a> It is his nearness to God, the sense that he has consequently of that which God is, which (through grace and the operation of the Spirit) gives him this power.<a name=275:10></a> God takes account of men, and that according to the infinitude of His love.<a name=275:11></a> He takes account of the trust in Himself, the faith in His word, shewn by one who thinks and acts according to a just appreciation of what He is.<a name=275:12></a> That is always faith, which makes sensible to us that which we do not see -- God Himself, who acts in accordance with the revelation that He has given of Himself.<a name=275:13></a> Now the man who in the practical sense is righteous through grace, is near to God; as being righteous, he has not to do with God for himself with regard to sin, which would keep his heart at a distance; his heart is thus free to draw nigh to God, according to His holy nature on behalf of others; and, moved by the divine nature, which animates him and which enables

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God acts, we know, in all this; but the apostle does not here speak of Him, being occupied with the practical effect, and presenting the man as he is seen, acting under the influence of this nature in its positive energy with regard to God, and near to Him, so that it acts in all its intensity, moved by the power of that nearness.<a name=276:3></a> But if we consider the action of the Spirit, these thoughts are confirmed.<a name=276:4></a> The righteous man does not grieve the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit works in him according to His own power, not having to set his conscience right with God, but acting in the man according to the power of his communion.<a name=276:5></a>

		1 PETER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first epistle of Peter is addressed to believers among the dispersed of Israel found in those provinces of Asia Minor which are named in the first verse; the second epistle declares itself to be a second addressed to the same persons: so that the one and the other were destined for the Jews of Asia Minor (that is, to those among them who had the same precious faith as the apostle).<a name=278:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first epistle is founded on the doctrine of the heavenly calling (I do not say of the assembly on earth,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:278">footnote</a></i>) which is not brought before us here) in contrast with the portion of the Jews on the earth.<a name=278:2></a> It presents Christians, and in particular Christians among the Jews, as pilgrims and strangers on earth.<a name=278:3></a> The conduct suited to such is more largely developed than the doctrine.<a name=278:4></a> The Lord Jesus, who was Himself a pilgrim and a stranger here, is presented as a pattern in more than one aspect.<a name=278:5></a> Both epistles pursue the righteous government of God from the beginning to the consummation of all things, in which the elements melt with fervent heat, and there are new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.<a name=278:6></a> The first gives the government of God in favour of believers, the second in the judgment of the wicked.<a name=278:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless, in presenting the heavenly calling, the apostle necessarily presents salvation -- the deliverance of the soul in contrast with the temporal deliverance of the Jews.<a name=278:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following is the description which the Spirit gives of these believers.<a name=278:9></a> They are elect, and that according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.<a name=278:10></a> Israel was a nation elected on the earth by Jehovah.<a name=278:11></a> Here, it is those who were foreknown of the Father.<a name=278:12></a> The means by which their election is carried out is sanctification of the Holy Ghost.<a name=278:13></a> They are really set apart by the power of the Spirit.<a name=278:14></a> Israel was set apart by ordinances; but these are sanctified unto the obedience of Jesus Christ and for the sprinkling of His blood, that is to say, on the one hand to obey as He obeyed, and on the other to be sprinkled with His blood and thus to be perfectly clear before

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such was the Christian's position.<a name=279:3></a> The apostle wishes them grace and peace -- the known portion of believers.<a name=279:4></a> He reminds them of the blessings with which God had blessed them, blessing God who had bestowed them.<a name=279:5></a> Believing Israelites knew Him now, not in the character of Jehovah, but as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=279:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which the apostle presents as the fruit of His grace, is a hope beyond this world; not the inheritance of Canaan, appropriate to man living on the earth, which was the hope of Israel, and is still that of the unbelieving nation.<a name=279:7></a> The mercy of God had begotten them again for a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from out of the dead.<a name=279:8></a> This resurrection shewed them a portion in another world, and the power which brought man into it, although he had been subjected to death: he would enter it by resurrection, through the glorious triumph of the Saviour, to share an inheritance that is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.<a name=279:9></a> The apostle is not speaking of our resurrection with Christ; he views the Christian as a pilgrim here, encouraged by the triumph of Christ Himself in resurrection, which animated him by the consciousness that there was a world of light and happiness before him, and a power which would bring him into this world.<a name=279:10></a> Consequently the inheritance is spoken of as "reserved in heaven".<a name=279:11></a> In the epistle to the Ephesians we are seated in the heavens in Christ, and the inheritance is that of all things of which Christ Himself is heir.<a name=279:12></a> But the Christian is also in fact a pilgrim and a stranger on the earth; and it is a strong consolation to us, in our pilgrimage, to see this heavenly inheritance before us, as a certain pledge of our own entrance into it.<a name=279:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another inestimable consolation is added.<a name=279:14></a> If the inheritance is preserved in heaven for us, we are kept by the power of God all through our pilgrimage that we may enjoy it at the end.<a name=279:15></a> Sweet thought!<a name=279:16></a> -- we are kept here below through all our dangers and difficulties; and, on the other hand, the inheritance there, where there is no defilement or possibility of decay.<a name=279:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is by moral means that this power preserves us (and it is in this way that Peter always speaks), by the operation in us of grace, which fixes the heart on objects that keep it in connection with God and with His promise (compare <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:4">2 Peter  1:4</a>).<a name=279:18></a> We

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is salvation ready to be revealed in the last times.<a name=280:5></a> This word "ready" is important.<a name=280:6></a> Our apostle says also that the judgment is ready to be revealed.<a name=280:7></a> Christ is glorified personally, has conquered all His enemies, has accomplished redemption.<a name=280:8></a> He only waits for one thing, namely, that God should make His enemies His footstool.<a name=280:9></a> He has taken His seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high, because He has accomplished everything as to glorifying God where sin was.<a name=280:10></a> It is the actual salvation of souls -- the gathering together of His own, which is not yet finished (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:9">2 Peter  3:9</a>, 15); but when once all they who are to share it are brought in, there is nothing to wait for as regards the salvation, that is to say, the glory in which the redeemed will appear;(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:280">footnote</a></i>) nor consequently as regards the judgment of the wicked on earth, which will be consummated by the manifestation of Christ.<a name=280:11></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:280">footnote</a></i>) All is ready.<a name=280:12></a> This thought is sweet for us in our days of patience, but full of solemnity when we reflect upon the judgment.<a name=280:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is our portion: abundant joy in the salvation about to be revealed, and in which we may always rejoice; although, if it be needed for our good, we may be in sorrow through divers temptations.<a name=281:2></a> But it is only for a very little while -- only a light affliction, which passes away, and which only comes upon us if it be needful, in order that the precious trial of faith may have its result in praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ, for whom we are waiting.<a name=281:3></a> That is the end of all our sorrows and trials; transitory and light as they are, in comparison with the vast result of the excellent and eternal glory towards which they are leading us, according to the wisdom of God and the need of our souls.<a name=281:4></a> The heart attaches itself to Jesus: He will appear.<a name=281:5></a>

		We love Him, although we have never seen Him.<a name=281:6></a> In Him, though now we see Him not, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.<a name=281:7></a> It is this which decides and forms the heart, which fixes it and fills it with joy, however it may be with us in this life.<a name=281:8></a> To our hearts it is He who fills all the glory.<a name=281:9></a> By grace I shall be glorified, I shall have the glory; but I love Jesus, my heart pants for His presence -- desires to see Him.<a name=281:10></a> Moreover we shall be like Him, and He perfectly glorified.<a name=281:11></a> The apostle may well say, "unspeakable and full of glory".<a name=281:12></a> The heart can desire nothing else: and if some light afflictions are needful for us, we endure them gladly, since they are a means of forming us for the glory.<a name=281:13></a> And we can rejoice at the thought of Christ's appearing; for in receiving Him, unseen, into our heart we receive the salvation of our soul.<a name=281:14></a> This is the object and the end of faith; far more precious than the temporal deliverances that Israel enjoyed, although the latter were tokens of the favour of God.<a name=281:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle goes on to develop the three successive steps of the revelation of this grace of salvation -- the full and entire deliverance from the consequences, the fruits, and the misery of sin: the prophecies; the testimony of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; the manifestation of Jesus Christ Himself, when the deliverance that had been already announced should be fully accomplished.<a name=281:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to see here how the rejection of the Messiah, according to Jewish hopes, already anticipated and announced in the prophets, necessarily made way for a salvation which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=282>[Page 282]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		brought with it that of the soul likewise.<a name=282:1></a> Jesus was no more seen; the earthly portion was not realised by His first coming; salvation was to be revealed in the last times.<a name=282:2></a> But thus a salvation of the soul was unfolded, the whole extent of which would be realised in the glory about to be revealed; for it was the spiritual joy of the soul in a heavenly Jesus who was not seen, and who in His death had accomplished expiation for sin, and in His resurrection, according to the power of the life of the Son of God, had begotten again to a living hope.<a name=282:3></a> By faith then this salvation was received -- this true deliverance.<a name=282:4></a> It was not yet the glory and the outward rest; that salvation would indeed take place when Jesus appeared, but meantime the soul already enjoyed by faith this perfect rest, and in hope even the glory itself.<a name=282:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the prophets had announced the grace of God which was to be accomplished for believers, and which even now imparts to the soul the enjoyment of that salvation; and they had searched into their own prophecies, which they had received by inspiration from God, seeking to understand what time, and what manner of time, the Spirit indicated, when He testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.<a name=282:6></a> For the Spirit spoke of them both by the prophets, and signified consequently more than a temporal deliverance in Israel; for the Messiah was to suffer.<a name=282:7></a> And they discovered that it was not for themselves nor for their own times, that the Spirit of Christ announced these truths with regard to the Messiah, but for Christians.<a name=282:8></a> But Christians, while receiving the salvation of the soul by the revelation of a Christ seated in heaven after His sufferings and coming again in glory, have not received those glories which were revealed to the prophets.<a name=282:9></a> These things have been reported with great and divine plainness by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven after the death of Jesus: but the Spirit does not bestow the glory itself in which the Lord will appear; He has only declared it.<a name=282:10></a> Christians have therefore to gird up the loins of their mind, to be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that (in effect) will be brought to them at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=282:11></a> Such are the three successive steps in God's dealings: the prediction of the events relating to Christ, which went altogether beyond Jewish blessings; the things reported by the Spirit; the accomplishment of the things promised when Christ is revealed.<a name=282:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That, then, which the apostle presents, is a participation in the glory of Christ when He shall be revealed; that salvation, of which the prophets had spoken, which was to be revealed in the last days.<a name=283:1></a> But meantime God had begotten again the believing Jews to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead; and by means of His sufferings had made them comprehend that even now, while waiting for the revelation of the glory, realising it in the Person of Jesus, they enjoyed a salvation of the soul before which the deliverances of Israel faded away and might be forgotten.<a name=283:2></a> It was indeed the salvation "ready to be revealed" in all its fulness; but as yet they only possessed it in respect of the soul.<a name=283:3></a> But, being detached from the manifestation of the earthly glory, this salvation had a yet more spiritual character.<a name=283:4></a> Therefore they were to gird up their loins, while waiting for the revelation of Jesus, and to acknowledge with thanksgiving that they were in possession of the end of their faith.<a name=283:5></a> They were in relationship with God.<a name=283:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When announcing these things by the ministry of the prophets, God had Christians in view, and not the prophets themselves.<a name=283:7></a> This grace was in due time to be communicated to believers; but meantime, for faith and for the soul, the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven bore testimony to it.<a name=283:8></a> It was to be brought at the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=283:9></a> The resurrection of Jesus Christ, which was the guarantee of the accomplishment of all the promises and the power of life for their enjoyment, had begotten them again unto a living hope; but the right to enjoy the effect of the promise was founded on another truth.<a name=283:10></a> To this the exhortations conduct us.<a name=283:11></a> They were to walk as obedient children, no longer following the lusts that had led them in the days of their ignorance.<a name=283:12></a> Called by Him who is holy, they were to be holy in all their conversation, as it is written.<a name=283:13></a> Moreover, if they called on the Father, who, regardless of man's pretension to respect, judged according to every one's work, they were to pass the time of their sojourn here in fear.<a name=283:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe, here, that he is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul.<a name=283:15></a> In that sense "the Father judgeth no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son".<a name=283:16></a> The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God's government in this world, exercised with regard to His children.<a name=283:17></a> Accordingly it says, "the time of your sojourn here".<a name=283:18></a> It is a judgment applied

		<a name=284>[Page 284]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to christian life.<a name=284:1></a> The fear spoken of is not an uncertainty as to salvation and redemption.<a name=284:2></a> It is a fear founded on the certainty that one is redeemed; and the immense price, the infinite value of the means employed for our redemption -- namely, the blood of the Lamb, without blemish and without spot -- is the motive for fearing God during our pilgrimage.<a name=284:3></a> We have been redeemed at the cost of the blood of Jesus from our vain conversation: can we then still walk according to the principles from which we have been thus delivered?<a name=284:4></a> Such a price for our deliverance demands that we should walk with circumspection and gravity before the Father, with whom we desire to have intercourse both as privilege and spiritual relationship.<a name=284:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then applies this truth to the Christians whom he was addressing.<a name=284:6></a> The Lamb had been ordained in the counsels of God before the world was made; but He was manifested in the last days for believers: and these are presented in their true character, they believe in God by Jesus -- by this Lamb.<a name=284:7></a> It is not by means of the creation that they believe: although creation is a testimony to His glory, it gives no rest to the conscience and does not tell of a place in heaven.<a name=284:8></a> It is not by means of providence, which, even while directing all things, yet leaves the government of God in such profound darkness.<a name=284:9></a> Nor is it by means of the revelation of God on Mount Sinai under the name of Jehovah and the terror connected with a broken law.<a name=284:10></a> It is by means of Jesus, the Lamb of God, that we believe; observe that it is not said, in Him, but, "by Him" in God.<a name=284:11></a> We know God as the One who, when we were sinners and dead in our trespasses and sins, loved us, and gave this precious Saviour to come down even into the death in which we were, to take part in our position as lying under this judgment, and die as the Lamb of God.<a name=284:12></a> We believe in God who by His power, when Jesus was there for us -- in our stead -- raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory.<a name=284:13></a> It is in a Saviour-God therefore, a God who exercises His power in our behalf, that we believe by Jesus, so that our faith and our hope are in God.<a name=284:14></a> It does not say in something before God, but in God Himself.<a name=284:15></a> Where then shall any cause for fear or distrust arise as regards God, if our faith and hope are in Himself?<a name=284:16></a> This changes everything.<a name=284:17></a> The aspect in which we view God Himself is entirely changed; and this change is founded on that which establishes the righteousness of God in accepting us as cleansed from all sin, the love of God in blessing us perfectly in Jesus,

		whom His power has raised from the dead and glorified -- the power according to which He blesses us.<a name=285:1></a> Our faith and our hope are in God Himself.<a name=285:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This places us in the most intimate of relationships with the rest of the redeemed: objects of the same love, washed by the same precious blood, redeemed by the same Lamb, they become -- to those whose hearts are purified by the reception of the truth through the Spirit -- the objects of a tender brotherly love, a love unfeigned.<a name=285:3></a> They are our brethren.<a name=285:4></a> Let us then love one another fervently with a pure heart.<a name=285:5></a> But this is based on another essentially vital principle.<a name=285:6></a> It is a new nature which acts in this affection.<a name=285:7></a> If we are redeemed by the precious blood of the Lamb without spot, we are born of the incorruptible seed of the word of God, which lives and abides for ever.<a name=285:8></a> For the flesh is but grass, the glory of man as the flower of grass.<a name=285:9></a> The grass withers, its flower falls, but the word of the Lord abides for ever.<a name=285:10></a> This is the word of the gospel which has been preached unto us.<a name=285:11></a> It is an eternal principle of blessing.<a name=285:12></a> The believer is not born after the flesh to enjoy temporary rights and blessings, as was the case with a Jew, but of an incorruptible seed, a principle of life as unchangeable as the word of God Himself.<a name=285:13></a> The prophet had told them so, when comforting the people of God; all flesh, the nation itself, was but withered grass.<a name=285:14></a> God was unchangeable, and the word which by its immutable certainty secured divine blessings to the objects of God's favour, wrought in the heart to beget a life as immortal and incorruptible as the word which is its source.<a name=285:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus cleansed therefore and born of the word, they were to put off all fraud, hypocrisy, envy, slander; and, as new-born babes, to seek for this milk of the understanding, in order to grow thereby (for the word is the milk of the child, as it was the seed of its life); and we are to receive it as babes in all simplicity, if in truth we have felt that the Lord is good and full of grace.<a name=285:16></a> It is not Sinai (where the Lord God declared His law from the midst of the fire, so that they entreated not to hear His voice any more), to which I am come, or from which the Lord is speaking.<a name=285:17></a> If I have tasted and understood that the Lord acts in grace, that He is love towards me, and that His word is the expression of that grace, even as it communicates life, I shall desire to feed on this milk of the understanding, which the believer enjoys in proportion to his simplicity; that good word which announces to me nothing but grace, and the God who

		The apostle, therefore, applies the character of "holy nation" to the elect remnant, investing them in the main with the titles bestowed in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>on condition of obedience, but here in connection with the Messiah, their enjoyment of these titles being founded on His obedience and rights acquired by their faith in Him.<a name=287:9></a>

		But, the privileges of the believing remnant being founded on the Messiah, the apostle goes farther, and applies to them the declarations of Hosea, which relate to Israel and Judah when re-established in the fulness of blessing in the last days, enjoying those relationships with God into which grace will bring them at that time.<a name=287:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of obedience was settled -- on Israel's disobedience -- by grace, and by the obedience of Christ, the foundation laid by God in Zion.<a name=288:8></a> But this principle of grace abounding over sin -- by which is shewn the inability of disobedience to frustrate the purposes of God, for this grace came after the completion of disobedience -- this principle, so glorious and so comforting to the convinced sinner, is confirmed in a striking way by the quotation from Hosea.<a name=288:9></a> In this passage from the prophet, Israel is presented, not merely as guilty, but as having already undergone judgment.<a name=288:10></a> God had declared that He would no more have mercy (with regard to His patience toward the ten tribes); and that Israel was no longer His people (in His judgment on unfaithful Judah).<a name=288:11></a> But afterwards, when the judgment had been executed, He returns to His irrevocable purposes of grace, and allures Israel as a forsaken wife, and gives her the valley of Achor -- the valley of trouble, in which Achan was stoned, the first judgment on unfaithful Israel after their entrance into the promised land -- for a door of hope.<a name=288:12></a> For judgment is changed into grace, and God begins all afresh upon a new principle.<a name=288:13></a> It was as though Israel had again come up out of Egypt, but upon an entirely new principle.<a name=288:14></a> He betroths her to Him for ever, in righteousness, in judgment, in grace, in mercy, and all is blessing.<a name=288:15></a> Then He calls her "Ruhamah", or, "the object of mercy"; and "Ammi", "my people".<a name=288:16></a>

		Two parts of the christian life -- so far as it is the manifestation of spiritual power -- result from this, in the double priesthood; of which the one answers to the present position of Christ on high, and the other anticipatively to the manifestation of His glory on earth -- the priesthoods of Aaron, and of Melchisedec.<a name=289:8></a> For He is now within the veil according to the type of Aaron; hereafter He will be a priest on His throne -- it will be the public manifestation of His glory on earth.<a name=289:9></a> Thus the saints exercise "a holy priesthood" (verse 5) to offer up spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving.<a name=289:10></a> Sweet privilege of the Christian, thus brought as near as possible to God!<a name=289:11></a> He offers -- sure of being accepted, for it is by Jesus that he offers them -- his sacrifices to God.<a name=289:12></a>

		After this (chapter 2: 11), the apostle begins his exhortations.<a name=290:13></a> Whatever may be the privileges of the Christian, in his position as such, he is always viewed as a pilgrim, on the earth; and, as we have seen, the constant government of God is the object which presents itself to the mind of the apostle.<a name=290:14></a> But he warns them first, with regard to that which is inward, against those sources from which the corruptions spring, that (in the scene of this government) would dishonour the name of God and even bring in judgment.<a name=290:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Their conversation was to be honest among the Gentiles.<a name=290:16></a> Christians bore the name of God.<a name=290:17></a> The mind of men, hostile to His name, sought to bring disgrace upon it, by attributing to Christians the evil conduct which they themselves followed without remorse, while at the same time complaining (chapter 4: 4) that they would not go with them in the same excesses and disorder.<a name=290:18></a> The Christian had only to follow the path of faithfulness to God.<a name=290:19></a> In the day when God would visit men these calumniators, with their will broken and their pride subdued by the visitation of God, should be brought to confess -- by means of the good works which, in spite of their calumnies, had always reached their consciences -- that God had acted in these Christians, that He had been present among them.<a name=290:20></a>

		Likewise, wives were to be subject to their husbands in all modesty and purity, in order that this testimony to the effect of the word by its fruits might take the place of the word itself, if their husbands would not listen to it.<a name=291:13></a> They were to rest, in patience and meekness, on the faithfulness of God, and not be alarmed at seeing the power of the adversaries (compare <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:28">Philippians  1:28</a>).<a name=291:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		readers of scripture; but it appears to me simple, if we perceive the object of the Spirit of God.<a name=293:1></a> The Jews expected a Messiah corporeally present, who should deliver the nation, and exalt the Jews to the summit of earthly glory.<a name=293:2></a> But He was not present, we know, in that manner, and the believing Jews had to endure the scoffs and the hatred of the unbelieving, on account of their trust in a Messiah who was not present, and who had wrought no deliverance for the people.<a name=293:3></a> Believers possessed the salvation of their soul, and they knew Jesus in heaven; but unbelieving men did not care for that.<a name=293:4></a> The apostle therefore cites the case of Noah's testimony.<a name=293:5></a> The believing Jews were few in number, and Christ was theirs only according to the Spirit.<a name=293:6></a> By the power of that Spirit He had been raised up from the dead.<a name=293:7></a> It was by the power of the same Spirit that He had gone -- without being corporeally present -- to preach in Noah.<a name=293:8></a> The world was disobedient (like the Jews in the apostle's days), and eight souls only were saved; even as the believers were now but a little flock.<a name=293:9></a> But the spirits of the disobedient were now in prison, because they did not obey Christ present among them by His Spirit in Noah.<a name=293:10></a> The long-suffering of God waited then, as now, with the Jewish nation; the result would be the same.<a name=293:11></a> It has been so.<a name=293:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This interpretation is confirmed (in preference to that which supposes that the Spirit of Christ preached in hades to souls which had been confined there ever since the flood) by the consideration that in Genesis it is said, "My spirit shall not always strive with men, but their days shall be a hundred and twenty years".<a name=293:13></a> That is to say, His Spirit should strive, in the testimony of Noah, during a hundred and twenty years and no longer.<a name=293:14></a> Now it would be an extraordinary thing that with those persons only (for he speaks only of them) the Lord should strive in testimony after their death.<a name=293:15></a> Moreover, we may observe that, in considering this expression to mean the Spirit of Christ in Noah, we only use a well-known phrase of Peter's; for he it is, as we have seen, who said, "The Spirit of Christ which was in the prophets".<a name=293:16></a>

		As regards the relations of God with the world in government, the destruction of Jerusalem, although it was not "the end", was of immense importance, because it destroyed the very seat of that government on the earth in which the Messiah ought to have reigned, and shall yet reign.<a name=297:9></a>

		God watches over all things, takes care of His own, counts the hairs of their heads, makes everything contribute to their highest good; but this is in the midst of a world which He no longer owns.<a name=297:10></a> For not only is the earthly and direct government of God set aside, which took place in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, and, in a certain sense, in those of Saul; but the Messiah, who ought to reign in it, has been rejected, and has taken the heavenly place in resurrection, which forms the subject of this epistle.<a name=297:11></a>

		In view of this end of all that we see, we ought to be sober, and watch in order to pray.<a name=298:5></a> We ought to have the heart thus exercised towards God, who changes not, who will never pass away, and who preserves us through all the difficulties and temptations of thus passing scene until the day of deliverance which is coming.<a name=298:6></a> Instead of allowing ourselves to be carried away by present and visible things, we must bridle self and will and commune with God.<a name=298:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second epistle of Peter is even more simple than the first.<a name=304:1></a> Like those of Jude and John, it is written essentially with a view to the seducers, who, with large promises of liberty, beguiled souls into sin and licentiousness, denying the coming of Christ, and in fact disowning all His rights over them.<a name=304:2></a> The epistle admonishes the same Christians to whom the first was written, pointing out the characteristic features of these false teachers; denouncing them with the utmost energy; explaining the long-sufferance of God, and announcing a judgment which, like His patience, would befit the majesty of Him who was to execute it.<a name=304:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before giving these warnings, which begin with chapter 2, the apostle exhorts Christians to make their own calling and election sure -- not evidently in the heart of God, but as a fact in their own hearts, and in practical life, by walking in such a manner as not to stumble; so that testimony to their portion in Christ should be always evident, and an abundant entrance be ministered to them.<a name=304:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These exhortations are founded, firstly, on that which is already given to Christians; secondly, on that which is future -- namely, the manifestation of the glory of the kingdom.<a name=304:5></a> In touching upon this last subject, he indicates a still more excellent portion -- the bright morning star, the heavenly Christ Himself and our association with Him before He appears as the Sun of righteousness.<a name=304:6></a> Thirdly, we shall see that the warnings are founded also on another basis -- namely, the dissolution of the heavens and the earth, proving the instability of all that unbelief rested upon, and furnishing for the same reason a solemn warning to the saints to induce them to walk in holiness.<a name=304:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle describes his brethren as having obtained the same precious faith as himself through the faithfulness of God(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:304">footnote</a></i>) to the promises made to the fathers, for that surely is the force of the word "righteousness" in this place.<a name=304:8></a> The faithfulness of the God of Israel had bestowed on His people this faith (that is to say, Christianity), which was so precious to them.<a name=304:9></a>

		Faith here is the portion we have now in the things that God gives, which in Christianity are revealed as truths, while the things promised are not yet come.<a name=305:1></a> It was in this way that the believing Jews were to possess the Messiah, and all that God gave in Him, as the Lord had said, "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.<a name=305:2></a> There are many mansions in my Father's house; I go to prepare a place for you".<a name=305:3></a> That is to say, "You do not visibly possess God; you enjoy Him by believing in Him.<a name=305:4></a> It is the same with respect to Me: you will not possess Me corporeally, but you shall enjoy all that is in Me -- righteousness, and all the promises of God -- by believing".<a name=305:5></a> It was thus that these believing Jews, to whom Peter wrote, possessed the Lord: they had received this precious faith.<a name=305:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He wishes them, as is the custom, "Grace and peace", adding, "through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord".<a name=305:7></a> It is the knowledge of God and of Jesus, which is the centre and the support of faith, that which nourishes it, and in which it is developed and divinely enlarged, and which guards it from the vain imaginings of seducers.<a name=305:8></a> But there is a living power with this knowledge -- a divine power in that which God is to believers -- as He is revealed in this knowledge to faith; and this divine power has given to us all that pertains to life and godliness.<a name=305:9></a> By the realising knowledge which we possess of Him who has called us, this divine power becomes available and efficacious for all that appertains to life and godliness -- "the knowledge of him who hath called us by glory and by virtue".<a name=305:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have here, the call of God to pursue glory as our object, gaining the victory by virtue -- spiritual courage -- over all the enemies that we find in our path.<a name=305:11></a> It is not a law given to a people already gathered together, but glory proposed in order to be reached by spiritual energy.<a name=305:12></a> Moreover we have divine power acting according to its own efficacy, for the life of God in us, and for godliness.<a name=305:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How precious it is to know that faith can use this divine power, realised in the life of the soul, directing it towards glory as its end!<a name=305:14></a> What a safeguard from the efforts of the enemy, if we are really established in the consciousness of this divine power acting on our behalf in grace!<a name=305:15></a> The heart is led to make glory its object; and virtue, the strength of spiritual life, is developed on the way to it.<a name=305:16></a> Divine power has given us all needed.<a name=305:17></a>

		glory and with the energy of life -- very great and precious promises are given us; for all the promises in Christ are developed either in the glory, or in the life which leads to it.<a name=306:1></a> By means of these promises, we are made partakers of the divine nature; for this divine power, which is realised in life and godliness, is connected with these great and precious promises that relate either to the glory, or to virtue in the life that leads to it -- that is to say, it is divine power which develops itself, in realising the glory and heavenly walk which characterises it in its own nature.<a name=306:2></a> We are thus made morally partakers of the divine nature, by divine power acting in us and fixing the soul on what is divinely revealed.<a name=306:3></a> Precious truth!<a name=306:4></a> Privilege so exalted!<a name=306:5></a> and which renders us capable of enjoying God Himself, as well as all good.<a name=306:6></a>

		By the same action of this divine power, we escape the corruption that is in the world through lust; for the divine power delivers us from it.<a name=306:7></a> Not only do we not yield to it, but we are occupied elsewhere, and the action of the enemy upon the flesh is kept off; the desires from which one could not cleanse oneself are removed; the corrupt relationship of the heart with its object ceases.<a name=306:8></a> It is a real deliverance; we have the mastery over ourselves in this respect; we are set free from sin.<a name=306:9></a>

		But it is not enough to have escaped by faith from even the inward dominion of the desires of the flesh; we must add to faith -- to that faith which realises divine power, and the glory of Christ that shall be revealed -- we must add to faith, virtue.<a name=306:10></a> This is the first thing.<a name=306:11></a> It is, as we have said, the moral courage which overcomes difficulties, and governs the heart by curbing all action of the old nature.<a name=306:12></a> It is an energy by which the heart is master of itself, and is able to choose the good, and to cast aside the evil, as a thing conquered and unworthy of oneself.<a name=306:13></a> This indeed is grace; but the apostle is here speaking of the thing itself, as it is realised in the heart, and not of its source.<a name=306:14></a> I have said that this is the first thing; because, practically, this self-government -- this virtue, this moral energy -- is deliverance from evil, and renders communion with God possible It is the one thing which gives reality to all the rest, for without virtue we are not really with God.<a name=306:15></a> Can divine power develop itself in the laxity of the flesh?<a name=306:16></a> And if we are not really with God -- if the new nature is not acting -- knowledge is but the puffing up of the flesh; patience but a natural quality, or else hypocrisy; and so on with the rest.<a name=306:17></a> But where there is this

		virtue, it is very precious to add knowledge to it.<a name=307:1></a> We have then divine wisdom and intelligence to guide our walk: the heart is enlarged, sanctified, spiritually developed, by a more complete and profound acquaintance with God, who acts in the heart and is reflected in the walk.<a name=307:2></a> We are guarded from more errors -- we are more humble, more sober-minded: we know better where our treasure is, and what it is, and that everything else is but vanity and a hindrance.<a name=307:3></a> It is therefore a true knowledge of God that is here meant.<a name=307:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus walking in the knowledge of God, the flesh, the will, the desires, are bridled; all their practical power diminishes, and they disappear as habits of the soul; they are not fed.<a name=307:5></a> We are moderate; there is self-restraint; we do not give way to our desires; temperance is added to knowledge.<a name=307:6></a> The apostle is not speaking of the walk, but of the state of the heart in the walk.<a name=307:7></a> Still, being thus governed, and the will bridled, one bears patiently with others; and the circumstances that must be passed through are, in all respects, borne according to the will of God, be they what they may.<a name=307:8></a> We add patience to temperance.<a name=307:9></a> The heart, the spiritual life, is then free to enjoy its true objects -- a principle of deep importance in the christian life.<a name=307:10></a> When the flesh is at work in one way or another (even if its action is purely inward), if there is anything whatever that the conscience ought to be exercised about, the soul cannot be in the enjoyment of communion with God in the light, because the effect of the light is then to bring the conscience into exercise.<a name=307:11></a> But when the conscience has nothing that is not already judged in the light, the new man is in action with regard to God, whether in realising the joy of His presence or in glorifying Him in a life characterised by godliness.<a name=307:12></a> We enjoy communion with God; we walk with God; we add to patience godliness.<a name=307:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The heart being thus in communion with God, affection flows out freely towards those who are dear to Him, and who, sharing the same nature, necessarily draw out the affections of the spiritual heart: brotherly love is developed.<a name=307:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another principle, which crowns and governs and gives character to all others: it is charity, love properly so called.<a name=307:15></a> This, in its root, is the nature of God Himself, the source and perfection of every other quality that adorns christian life.<a name=307:16></a> The distinction between love and brotherly love is of deep importance; the former is indeed, as we have just said,

		the source whence the latter flows; but as this brotherly love exists in mortal men, it may be mingled in its exercise with sentiments that are merely human, with individual affection, with the effect of personal attractions, or that of habit, of suitability in natural character.<a name=308:1></a> Nothing is sweeter than brotherly affections; their maintenance is of the highest importance in the assembly; but they may degenerate, as they may grow cool; and if love, if God, does not hold the chief place, they may displace Him -- set Him aside -- shut Him out.<a name=308:2></a> Divine love, which is the very nature of God, directs, rules, and gives character to brotherly love; otherwise it is that which pleases us -- that is, our own heart -- that governs us.<a name=308:3></a> If divine love governs me, I love all my brethren; I love them because they belong to Christ; there is no partiality.<a name=308:4></a> I shall have greater enjoyment in a spiritual brother; but I shall occupy myself about my weak brother with a love that rises above his weakness and has tender consideration for it.<a name=308:5></a> I shall concern myself with my brother's sin, from love to God, in order to restore my brother, rebuking him, if needful; nor, if divine love be in exercise, can brotherly love, or its name, be associated with disobedience.<a name=308:6></a> In a word, God will have His place in all my relationships.<a name=308:7></a> To exact brotherly love in such a manner as to shut out the requirements of that which God is, and of His claims upon us, is to shut out God in the most plausible way, in order to gratify our own hearts.<a name=308:8></a> Divine love then, which acts according to the nature, character, and will of God, is that which ought to direct and characterise our whole christian walk, and have authority over every movement of our hearts.<a name=308:9></a> Without this, all that brotherly love can do is to substitute man for God.<a name=308:10></a> Divine love is the bond of perfectness, for it is God, who is love, working in us and making Himself the governing object of all that passes in the heart.<a name=308:11></a>

		Now, if these things are in us, the knowledge of Jesus will not be barren in our hearts.<a name=308:12></a> But if, on the contrary, they are wanting, we are blind; we cannot see far into the things of God; our view is contracted; it is limited by the narrowness of a heart governed by its own will, and turned aside by its own lusts.<a name=308:13></a> We forget that we have been cleansed from our old sins; we lose sight of the position Christianity has given us.<a name=308:14></a> This state of things is not the loss of assurance, but the forgetfulness of the true christian profession into which we are brought -- purity in contrast with the ways of the world.<a name=308:15></a>

		The apostle desires, therefore, to remind them of these things, although they knew them, purposing, so long as he was in his earthly tabernacle, to stir up their pure hearts to keep them in remembrance; for soon would he have laid aside his earthly vessel, as the Lord had told him, and by thus writing to them, he took care that they should always bear them in mind.<a name=309:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The bright morning star is Christ Himself, when (before the day, which will be produced by His appearing) He is ready to receive the assembly, that she may enter into His own peculiar joy.<a name=312:7></a> Thus it is said, "I am the bright and morning star" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=312:8></a> This is what He is for the assembly, as He is the root and offspring of David for Israel.<a name=312:9></a> Consequently, as soon as He says "the morning star", the Spirit, who dwells in the assembly and inspires her thoughts, and the bride, the assembly itself which waits for her Lord, say, "Come!<a name=312:10></a>" Thus, in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:28">Revelation  2:28</a>, the faithful in Thyatira are promised by the Lord that He will give them the morning star; that is to say, joy with Himself in heaven.<a name=312:11></a> The kingdom and the power had been already promised them according to Christ's own rights (verse 26, 27); but the assembly's proper portion is Christ Himself.<a name=312:12></a> In addition to the declaration of the prophets, with regard to the kingdom, it is thus that the assembly expects Him.<a name=312:13></a>

		The apostle goes on to warn the faithful, that the prophecies of scripture were not like the utterances of human will, and were not to be interpreted as though each had a separate solution -- as though every prophecy were sufficient to itself for the explanation of its full meaning.<a name=312:14></a> They were all parts of one whole, having one and the same object, even the kingdom of God; and each event was a preliminary step towards this object, and a link in the chain of God's government which led to it, impossible to be explained, unless the aim of the whole were apprehended -- the revealed aim of the counsels of God in the glory of His Christ.<a name=312:15></a> For holy men, moved by the Holy Ghost, pronounced these oracles, one and the same Spirit directing and co-ordaining

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have here (chapter 1) these three things: -- Firstly, divine power for all that appertains to life and godliness, a declaration of infinite value, the pledge of our true liberty.<a name=313:2></a> Divine power acts in us, it gives to us all needed to enable us to walk in the christian life.<a name=313:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, there is the government of God, in connection with the faithfulness of the believer, in order that a wide and abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom may be granted us, and that we may not stumble.<a name=313:4></a> The great result of this government will be manifested in the establishment of the kingdom, the glory of which was seen on the holy mount by the three apostles.<a name=313:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, thirdly, for the Christian there was something better than the kingdom, something to which the apostle merely alludes, for it was not the especial subject of the communications of the Holy Ghost to him as it was to the Apostle Paul, namely, Christ taking the assembly to Himself, a point not found either in the promises or the prophecies, but which forms the precious and inestimable joy and hope of the Christian taught of God.<a name=313:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This first chapter has thus taught us the divine aspect of the christian position, given to the apostle for the instruction, in the last days, of believers from among the circumcision.<a name=313:7></a> The next two chapters set before us, on the other hand, the two forms of evil that characterise the last days -- the false and corrupt teaching of bad men, and the unbelief which denies the return of the Lord on the ground of the stability of the visible creation.<a name=313:8></a> The former really denies the Master who bought them.<a name=313:9></a> It is no question here as to the title of the Lord, nor of redemption.<a name=313:10></a> The simile is of a master who has purchased slaves at the market, and they disown and refuse to obey him.<a name=313:11></a> Thus among the converted Jews there would be false teachers, who disowned the authority of Christ -- His rights over them.<a name=313:12></a> Many would be led away by them; and as they bore the name of Christians, the way of truth would be brought into disrepute by their means; while in fact, by their covetousness and hypocritical words, they would make merchandise of Christians for their private gain, count them as mere instruments of it.<a name=313:13></a> But the resource of faith is always in God.<a name=313:14></a> Judgment would overtake

	<div class="paragraph">
		That which would characterise this class of evildoers would be the unbridled license of their conduct.<a name=314:3></a> They would indulge their carnal lusts, and despise all authority in a way that angels would not dare to do.<a name=314:4></a> Still they would call themselves Christians and associate with Christians in their love-feasts, deceiving their own hearts, addicting themselves continually to evil, promising liberty to others, but themselves the slaves of corruption.<a name=314:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to be thus re-entangled in evil, after having escaped it through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, was worse than if they had never known anything of the way of truth.<a name=314:6></a> But it was according to the true proverb -- The dog had returned to his own vomit, and the sow that had been washed, to her wallowing in the mire.<a name=314:7></a> They were apostates therefore; but here the Spirit of God does not so much point out the apostasy as the evil, because the government of God is still in view.<a name=314:8></a> In Jude the apostasy is the prominent thing.<a name=314:9></a> Peter tells us that the angels sinned; Jude, that they kept not their first estate.<a name=314:10></a> But God will judge the wicked.<a name=314:11></a>

		In the last chapter, as we have said, it is materialism: trust in the stability of that which can be seen, in contrast with trust in the word of God which teaches us to look for the coming of Jesus, the return of the Lord.<a name=314:12></a> They judge by their senses.<a name=314:13></a> There is, say they, no appearance of change.<a name=314:14></a> This is not the case.<a name=314:15></a> To the eye of man it is indeed true that there is none.<a name=314:16></a> But these unbelievers are wilfully ignorant of the fact that the world has been already judged once; that the waters, out of which by the mighty word of God the earth came, had for the moment swallowed it up again, all perishing except those whom God preserved in the ark.<a name=314:17></a> And by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.<a name=314:18></a> It is not that the Lord is slack concerning the promise of His return, but that He is still exercising grace, not wishing any to perish, but that all should come to repentance.<a name=314:19></a> And a thousand years are to Him but as a day, and a day as a thousand years.<a name=314:20></a> But the day of the Lord shall come, in which all things will pass away, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and all that is on the earth will be

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in following out the ways of God in government that the apostle carries them on to the eternal state, in which the promise will be finally accomplished.<a name=315:6></a> The millennium itself was the restitution, of which the prophets had spoken; and, morally, the heavens and the earth had been changed by the imprisonment of Satan and the reign of Christ (see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#65:17">Isaiah  65:17</a>, 18, Jerusalem having been made a rejoicing); and the heavens indeed entirely cleared by power, never to be defiled by Satan again, the saints on high too in their eternal state, the earth delivered, but not yet finally freed.<a name=315:7></a> But, materially, the dissolution of the elements was necessary for the renewal of all things.<a name=315:8></a>

		It is interesting to see that Peter, who had been openly rebuked before all by Paul, introduces him here with entire affection.<a name=316:3></a> He notices that Paul's epistles contained an exalted doctrine, which they who were unstable, and not taught of God, perverted.<a name=316:4></a> For Peter in fact does not follow Paul in the field on which the latter had entered.<a name=316:5></a> This however does not prevent his speaking of Paul's writings as forming a part of the scriptures; "as also the other scriptures", he says.<a name=316:6></a> This is an important testimony; which moreover gives the same character to the writings of one who is able to bestow this title on the writings of another.<a name=316:7></a>

		The epistle of John has a peculiar character.<a name=317:1></a> It is eternal life manifested in Jesus, and imparted to us -- the life which was with the Father, and which is in the Son.<a name=317:2></a> It is in this life that believers enjoy the communion of the Father, that they are in relationship with the Father by the Spirit of adoption, and that they have fellowship with the Father and the Son.<a name=317:3></a> God's own character is that which tests it; because it proceeds from Himself.<a name=317:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first chapter establishes these two latter points: namely, communion with the Father and the Son, and that this communion must be according to the essential character of God.<a name=317:5></a> The name of Father is that which gives character to the second chapter.<a name=317:6></a> Afterwards it is that which God is, which tests the reality of imparted life.<a name=317:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistles of Paul, although speaking of this life, are in general occupied with setting before Christians the truth respecting the means of standing in the presence of God justified and accepted.<a name=317:8></a> The epistle of John, that is to say, his first, shews us the life that comes from God by Jesus Christ.<a name=317:9></a> John sets God before us, the Father revealed in the Son, and eternal life in Him.<a name=317:10></a> Paul sets us before God accepted in Christ.<a name=317:11></a> I speak of what characterises them.<a name=317:12></a> Each respectively touches on the other point.<a name=317:13></a>

		Now, this life is so precious, manifested as it is in the Person of Jesus, that the epistle now before us has in this respect quite a peculiar charm.<a name=317:14></a> When I, too, turn my eyes to Jesus, when I contemplate all His obedience, His purity, His grace, His tenderness, His patience, His devotedness, His holiness, His love, His entire freedom from all self-seeking, I can say, That is my life.<a name=317:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		But He who was the life which came from the Father, has brought us the knowledge of God.<a name=320:7></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:320">footnote</a></i>) The apostle had heard from His lips that which God was -- knowledge of priceless value, but which searches the heart.<a name=320:8></a> And this also the apostle, on the Lord's part, announces to believers.<a name=320:9></a> This then is the message which they had heard from Him, namely, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness.<a name=320:10></a> With regard to Christ, He spoke that which He knew, and bore testimony to that which He had seen.<a name=320:11></a> No one had been in heaven, save He who came down from thence.<a name=320:12></a> No one had seen God.<a name=320:13></a> The Only-begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, He had declared Him.<a name=320:14></a> No one had seen the Father, save He who was of God; He had seen the Father.<a name=320:15></a> Thus He could, of His own and perfect knowledge, reveal Him.<a name=320:16></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:320">footnote</a></i>) Now God was light, perfect purity, which makes manifest at the same time all that is pure, and all that is not so.<a name=320:17></a> To have communion with light, one must oneself be light, be of its nature, and fit to be seen in the perfect light.<a name=320:18></a> It can only be linked with that which is of itself.<a name=320:19></a> If there is anything else that mingles with it, light is no longer light.<a name=320:20></a> It is absolute in its nature, so as to exclude all that is not itself.<a name=320:21></a>

		Therefore, if we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise truth: our life is a perpetual lie.<a name=320:22></a> But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we (believers) have communion with one another, and

		Moreover, walking in the light, as God is in the light, believers have communion with each other.<a name=321:16></a> The world is selfish.<a name=321:17></a> The flesh, the passions, seek their own gratification; but, if I walk in the light, self has no place there.<a name=321:18></a> I can enjoy the light, and all I seek in it, with another, and there is no jealousy.<a name=321:19></a> If another possess a carnal thing, I am deprived of it.<a name=321:20></a> In the light we have fellow-possession of that which He gives us, and we enjoy it the more by sharing it together.<a name=321:21></a> This is a touchstone to all that is of the flesh.<a name=321:22></a> As much as one is in the light, so much will we have fellow-enjoyment with another who is in it.<a name=321:23></a> The apostle, as we have said, states this in an abstract and absolute way.<a name=321:24></a> This is the truest way to know the thing itself.<a name=321:25></a> The rest is only a question of realisation.<a name=321:26></a>

		There are two remarks to be made here.<a name=325:20></a> First, that the apostle takes things always as they are in themselves in an abstract way, without the modifications that are occasioned by other things, in the midst of which, or in relation with which, the former are found.<a name=325:21></a> Second, that the chain of consequences which the apostle deduces is not that of outward reasoning, the force of which is consequently on the surface of the argument itself.<a name=325:22></a> He reasons from a great inward principle, so that one does not see the force of the argument unless one knows the fact, and even the scope, of that principle; and, in particular, that which the life of God is in its nature, in its character, and in its action.<a name=325:23></a> But, without possessing it, we do not and cannot understand anything about it.<a name=325:24></a> There is, indeed, the authority of the apostle and of the word to tell us that the thing is so,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I return to the text.<a name=326:3></a> "Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected".<a name=326:4></a> It is in this way that we are conscious that we know Him.<a name=326:5></a> His "word" has rather a wider sense than His "commandments".<a name=326:6></a> That is to say, while it equally implies obedience, the word is less outward.<a name=326:7></a> "Commandments" are here details of the divine life.<a name=326:8></a> His "word" contains its whole expression -- the spirit of that life.<a name=326:9></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:326">footnote</a></i>) It is universal and absolute.<a name=326:10></a> Now this life is the divine life manifested in Jesus, and which is imparted to us.<a name=326:11></a> Have we seen it in Christ?<a name=326:12></a> Do we doubt that this is love; that the love of God has been manifested in it?<a name=326:13></a> If then I keep His word; if the scope and meaning of the life which that word expresses is thus understood and realised, the love of God is perfect in me.<a name=326:14></a> The apostle, as we have seen, always speaks abstractedly.<a name=326:15></a> If in fact at any given moment I do not observe the word, in that point I do not realise His love; happy intercourse with God is interrupted.<a name=326:16></a> But so far as I am moved and governed absolutely by His word, His love is completely realised in me; for His word expresses what He is, and I am keeping it.<a name=326:17></a> This is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consequently we know thus that we are in Him, for we realise that which He is in the communion of His nature.<a name=327:2></a> Now if we say that we abide in Him, it is evident, from what we have now seen in the instruction the apostle gives us, that we ought to walk as He walked.<a name=327:3></a> Our walk is the practical expression of our life; and this life is Christ known in His word.<a name=327:4></a> And since it is by His word, we who possess this life are under an intelligent responsibility to follow it; that is to say, to walk as He walked.<a name=327:5></a> For that word is the expression of His life.<a name=327:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Obedience then, as obedience, is thus far the moral characteristic of the life of Christ in us.<a name=327:7></a> But it is proof of that which, in Christianity, is inseparable from the life of Christ in us: we are in Him (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:20">John  14:20</a>).<a name=327:8></a> We know, not merely that we know Him, but that we are in Him.<a name=327:9></a> The enjoyment of the perfect love of God in the path of obedience, gives us by the Holy Ghost the consciousness that we are in Him.<a name=327:10></a> But if I am in Him, I cannot indeed be what He was, for He was without

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 7 and 8 the two forms of the rule of this life are presented -- forms which, moreover, answer to the two principles which we have just announced.<a name=328:5></a> It is not a new commandment which the apostle writes unto them but an old one; it is the word of Christ from the beginning.<a name=328:6></a> Were it not so, were it in this sense new, so much the worse for him who set it forth, for it would no longer be the expression of the perfect life of Christ Himself, but some other thing, or a falsification of that which Christ had set forth.<a name=328:7></a> This corresponds with the first principle, that is, obedience to commandments, to the commandments of Christ.<a name=328:8></a> What He said was the expression of what He was.<a name=328:9></a> He could command that they should love one another as He had loved them.<a name=328:10></a> Compare the Beatitudes.<a name=328:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In another sense it was a new commandment; for (by the power of the Spirit of Christ, being united to Him and drawing our life from Him) the Spirit of God manifested the effect of this life by revealing a glorified Christ in a new way.<a name=328:12></a> And now it was not only a commandment, but as the thing itself was true in Christ, it was so in His own as partakers of His nature and in Him; He also in them.<a name=328:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By this revelation, and by the presence of the Holy Ghost, the darkness disappeared,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:328">footnote</a></i>) passed away, and in fact the true light shone.<a name=328:14></a> There will be no different light in heaven: only then the light will be publicly displayed in glory without a cloud.<a name=328:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 9.<a name=328:16></a> The life, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>, is now found to be the light of men, only the brighter for faith that Christ is gone, for it is through the rent veil it shines most brightly.<a name=328:17></a> We have had the pretension to know Him discussed -- to be in Him; now that of being in the light, and this before the Spirit of God applies in detail the qualities of this life, as a proof of its existence, to the heart, in answer to seducers who sought to terrify them by new notions, as though Christians were not really in possession

		of life, and, with life, of the Father and the Son.<a name=329:1></a> The true light now shines.<a name=329:2></a> And this light is God; it is the divine nature; and, as that which was a means of judging the seducers themselves, he brings out another quality connected with our being in the light, that is with God fully revealed.<a name=329:3></a> Christ was it in the world.<a name=329:4></a> We are set to be it, in that we are born of God.<a name=329:5></a> And one who has this nature loves his brother; for is not God love?<a name=329:6></a> Has not Christ loved us, not being ashamed to call us brethren?<a name=329:7></a> Can I have His life and His nature, if I do not love the brethren?<a name=329:8></a> No.<a name=329:9></a> I am then walking in darkness; I have no light on my path.<a name=329:10></a> He who loves his brother dwells in the light; the nature of God acts in him; and he dwells in the bright spiritual intelligence of that life, in the presence and in the communion of God.<a name=329:11></a> If any one hates, it is evident that he has not divine light.<a name=329:12></a> With feelings according to a nature opposed to God, how can it be pretended that he is in the light?<a name=329:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, there is no occasion of stumbling in one who loves, for he walks according to divine light.<a name=329:14></a> There is nothing in him which causes another to stumble, for the revelation of the nature of God in grace will assuredly not do so: and it is this which is manifested in him who loves his brother.<a name=329:15></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:329">footnote</a></i>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This closes as an introductory statement the first part of the epistle.<a name=329:16></a> It contains in the former half, the privileged place of Christians, the message giving us the truth of our state here, and the provision for failure: that ends with chapter 2, verse 2; in the second half, the proofs the Christian has of the true possession of the privilege according to the message: obedience, and love of the brethren, knowing Christ, being in Christ, enjoying the perfect love of God, abiding in Him, being in the light, forming the condition which is thus proved.<a name=329:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having established the two great principles, obedience and love, as proofs of the possession of the divine nature, of Christ known as life, and of our abiding in Him, the apostle goes on to address Christians personally and to shew us the position, on the ground of grace, in three different degrees of ripeness.<a name=329:18></a> This parenthetical but most important address we will now consider.<a name=329:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=330>[Page 330]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins by calling all the Christians to whom he was writing, "children", a term of affection in the loving and aged apostle.<a name=330:1></a> And as he writes to them (chapter 2: 1) in order that they should not sin, so he writes also because all their sins were forgiven for Jesus' name's sake.<a name=330:2></a> This was the assured condition of all Christians: that which God had granted them in giving them faith, that they might glorify Him.<a name=330:3></a> He allows no doubt as to the fact of their being pardoned.<a name=330:4></a> He writes to them because they are so.<a name=330:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We next find three classes of Christians: fathers, young men, and babes.<a name=330:6></a> He addresses them each twice, fathers, young men, and babes (verse 13): fathers, in the first half of verse 14; young men from the second half, to the end of verse 17; and babes from verse 18 to the end of verse 27.<a name=330:7></a> In verse 28 he returns to all Christians under the name of "children".<a name=330:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which characterises fathers in Christ is that they have known Him who is from the beginning; that is, Christ.<a name=330:9></a> This is all that he has to say about them.<a name=330:10></a> All had resulted in that.<a name=330:11></a> He only repeats the same thing again, when, changing his form of expression, he begins anew with these three classes.<a name=330:12></a> The fathers have known Christ.<a name=330:13></a> This is the result of all christian experience.<a name=330:14></a> The flesh is judged, discerned, wherever it has mixed itself with Christ in our feelings; it is recognised, experimentally, as having no value; and, as the result of experience, Christ stands alone, free from all alloy.<a name=330:15></a> They have learnt to distinguish that which has only the appearance of good.<a name=330:16></a> They are not occupied with experience -- that would be being occupied with self, with one's own heart.<a name=330:17></a> All that has passed away; and Christ alone remains as our portion, unmingled with aught besides, even as He gave Himself to us.<a name=330:18></a> Moreover He is much better known; they have experienced what He is in so many details, whether of joy in communion with Him, or in the consciousness of weakness, or in the realisation of His faithfulness, of the riches of His grace, of His adaptation to our need, of His love, and in the revelation of His own fulness; so that they are able now to say, "I know whom I have believed".<a name=330:19></a> Attachment to Himself characterises them.<a name=330:20></a> Such is the character of "fathers" in Christ.<a name=330:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Young men" are the second class.<a name=330:22></a> They are distinguished by spiritual strength in conflict: the energy of faith.<a name=330:23></a> They have overcome the wicked one.<a name=330:24></a> For he speaks of what their
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=331>[Page 331]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		character is as in Christ.<a name=331:1></a> Conflict they have as such, but the strength of Christ manifested in them.<a name=331:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third class is "babes".<a name=331:3></a> These know the Father.<a name=331:4></a> We see here that the Spirit of adoption and of liberty characterises the youngest child in the faith of Christ, that it is not the result of progress.<a name=331:5></a> It is the commencement.<a name=331:6></a> We possess it because we are Christians; and it is ever the distinguishing mark of beginners.<a name=331:7></a> The others do not lose it, but other things distinguish them.<a name=331:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In again addressing these three classes of Christians, the apostle, as we have seen, has only to repeat that which he at first said with regard to the fathers.<a name=331:9></a> It is the result of christian life.<a name=331:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of the young men he develops his idea and adds some exhortations.<a name=331:11></a> "Ye are strong", he says, "and the word of God abideth in you" -- an important characteristic.<a name=331:12></a> The word is the revelation of God, and the application of Christ, to the heart, so that we have thus the motives which form and govern it, and a testimony founded on the state of the heart, and on convictions which have a divine power in us.<a name=331:13></a> It is the sword of the Spirit in our relations with the world.<a name=331:14></a> We have been ourselves formed by those things to which we bear testimony in our relations with the world, and those things are in us according to the power of the word of God.<a name=331:15></a> The wicked one is thus overcome; for he has only the world to present to our lusts: and the word abiding in us keeps us in an altogether different sphere of thought in which a different nature is enlightened and strengthened by divine communications.<a name=331:16></a> The tendency of the young man is toward the world: the ardour of his nature, and the vigour of his age, tend to draw him away on that side.<a name=331:17></a> He has to guard against this by separating himself entirely from the world and the things that are in it; because if any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him, for those things do not come from the Father.<a name=331:18></a> He has a world of His own, of which Christ is the centre and glory.<a name=331:19></a> The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life -- these are the things that are in the world and that characterise it.<a name=331:20></a> There are really no other motives besides these in the world.<a name=331:21></a> Now these things are not of the Father.<a name=331:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father is the source of all that is according to His own heart -- every grace, every spiritual gift, the glory, the heavenly holiness of all that was manifested in Christ Jesus, and that will

		be -- all the world of glory to come, of which Christ is the centre.<a name=332:1></a> And all this had only the cross for its portion here below.<a name=332:2></a> But the apostle is speaking here of the source; and assuredly the Father is not the source of those other things.<a name=332:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the world passes away; but he who does the will of God, he who, in going through this world, takes for his guide, not the desires of nature, but the will of God -- a will which is according to His nature and which expresses it -- such a one shall abide for ever according to the nature and the will that he has followed after.<a name=332:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find that the world, and the Father with all that is of Him, the flesh and the Spirit, the Son and the devil, are put respectively in opposition.<a name=332:5></a> Things are spoken of in their source and moral nature, the principles that act in us and that characterise our existence and our position, and the two agents in good and evil that are opposed to each other, without (thanks be to God!<a name=332:6></a>) any uncertainty as to the issue of the conflict; for the weakness of Christ, in death, is stronger than the strength of Satan.<a name=332:7></a> He has no power against that which is perfect.<a name=332:8></a> Christ came that He might destroy the works of the devil.<a name=332:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the babes the apostle speaks principally of the dangers to which they were exposed from seducers.<a name=332:10></a> He warns them with tender affection, reminding them at the same time that all the sources of intelligence and strength were open to them and belonged to them.<a name=332:11></a> "It is the last time"; not exactly the last days, but the season which had the final character that belonged to the dealings of God with this world.<a name=332:12></a> The Antichrist was to come, and already there were many antichrists: by this it might be known it was the last time.<a name=332:13></a> It was not merely sin, nor the transgression of the law; but, Christ having already been manifested, and being now absent and hidden from the world, there was a formal opposition to the especial revelation that had been made.<a name=332:14></a> It was not a vague and ignorant unbelief; it took a definite shape as having a will directed against Jesus.<a name=332:15></a> They might for instance believe all that a Jew believed, as it was revealed in the word; but as to the testimony of God by Jesus Christ they opposed it.<a name=332:16></a> They would not own Him to be the Christ; they denied the Father and the Son.<a name=332:17></a> This, as to religious profession, is the true character of the Antichrist.<a name=332:18></a> He may indeed believe or pretend to believe, that there shall be a Christ; yea, set himself up to be it.<a name=332:19></a> But the two aspects of Christianity (that which, on the one hand, regards the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=333>[Page 333]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		accomplishment in the Person of Jesus of the promises made to the Jew; and, on the other hand, the heavenly and eternal blessings presented in the revelation of the Father by the Son), this the Antichrist does not accept.<a name=333:1></a> That which characterises him as Antichrist is that he denies the Father and the Son.<a name=333:2></a> To deny that Jesus is the Christ is indeed the Jewish disbelief that forms part of his character.<a name=333:3></a> That which gives him the character of Antichrist is that he denies the foundation of Christianity.<a name=333:4></a> He is a liar in that he denies Jesus to be the Christ; consequently it is the work of the father of lies.<a name=333:5></a> But all the unbelieving Jews had done as much without being Antichrist.<a name=333:6></a> To deny the Father and the Son characterises him.<a name=333:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is something more.<a name=333:8></a> These antichrists came out from among the Christians.<a name=333:9></a> There was apostasy.<a name=333:10></a> Not that they were really Christians, but they had been among the Christians and had come out from them.<a name=333:11></a> (How instructive for our days also is this epistle!<a name=333:12></a>) It was thus made manifest that they were not truly of the flock of Christ.<a name=333:13></a> All this had a tendency to shake the faith of babes in Christ.<a name=333:14></a> The apostle endeavours to strengthen them.<a name=333:15></a> There were two means of confirming their faith, which also inspired the apostle with confidence.<a name=333:16></a> Firstly, they had the unction of the Holy One; secondly, that which was from the beginning was the touchstone for all new doctrine, and they already possessed that which was from the beginning.<a name=333:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The indwelling of the Holy Ghost as an unction and spiritual intelligence in them, and the truth which they had received at the beginning -- the perfect revelation of Christ -- these were the safeguards against seducers and seductions.<a name=333:18></a> All heresy and all error and corruption will be found to strike at the first and divine revelation of the truth, if the unction of the Holy One is in us to judge them.<a name=333:19></a> Now this unction is the portion of even the youngest babes in Christ, and they ought to be encouraged to realise it, however tenderly they may be cared for as they were here by the apostle.<a name=333:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What important truths we discover here for ourselves!<a name=333:21></a> The last time already manifested, so that we have to be on our guard against seducers -- persons moreover issuing from the bosom of Christianity.<a name=333:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of this Antichrist is that he denies the Father and the Son.<a name=333:23></a> Unbelief in its Jewish form is also again manifested -- owning that there is a Christ, but denying that Jesus is

	<div class="paragraph">
		He.<a name=334:1></a> Our security against these seductions is the unction from the Holy One -- the Holy Ghost, but in especial connection with the holiness of God, which enables us to see clearly into the truth (another characteristic of the Spirit); and, secondly, that that abide in us which we have heard from the beginning.<a name=334:2></a> It is this evidently which we have in the written word.<a name=334:3></a> "Development", note it well, is not that which we have from the beginning.<a name=334:4></a> By its very name it sins radically against the safeguard pointed out by the apostle.<a name=334:5></a> That which the church has taught, as development of the truth, whencesoever she may have received it, is not that which has been heard from the beginning.<a name=334:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point indicated here by the apostle that ought to be noticed.<a name=334:7></a> People might pretend by giving God in a vague way the name of Father, that they possessed Him without the true possession of the Son, Jesus Christ.<a name=334:8></a> This cannot be.<a name=334:9></a> He who has not the Son has not the Father.<a name=334:10></a> It is by Him that the Father is revealed, in Him that the Father is known.<a name=334:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the truth that we have received from the beginning abides in us, we abide in the Son and in the Father; for this truth is the revelation of the Son, and is revealed by the Son, who is the truth.<a name=334:12></a> It is living truth, if it abides in us; thus, by possessing it, we possess the Son, and in the Son, the Father also.<a name=334:13></a> We abide in it, and thereby we have eternal life (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>).<a name=334:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle had happy confidence that the unction which they had received of Him abode in them, so that they needed not to be taught of others, for this same unction taught them with respect to all things.<a name=334:15></a> It was the truth, for it was the Holy Ghost Himself acting in the word, which was the revelation of the truth of Jesus Himself, and there was no lie in it.<a name=334:16></a> Thus should they abide in Him according to that which it had taught them.<a name=334:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Observe also, here, that the effect of this teaching by the unction from on high is twofold with regard to the discernment of the truth.<a name=334:18></a> They knew that no lie was of the truth; possessing this truth from God, that which was not it was a lie.<a name=334:19></a> They knew that this unction which taught them of all things was the truth, and that there was no lie in it.<a name=334:20></a> The unction taught them all things, that is to say, all the truth, as truth of God.<a name=334:21></a> Therefore that which was not it was a lie, and there was no lie in the unction.<a name=334:22></a> Thus the sheep hear the voice of the good Shepherd;

		With verse 27 ends the second series of exhortations to the three classes.<a name=335:3></a> The apostle begins again with the whole body of Christians (verse 28).<a name=335:4></a> This verse appears to me to correspond with verse 8 of the second epistle, and with chapter 3 of the first epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=335:5></a>

		The apostle, having ended his address to those who were all in the communion of the Father, applies the essential principles of the divine life, of the divine nature as manifested in Christ, to test those who claimed participation in it; not in order to make the believer doubt, but for the rejection of that which was false.<a name=335:6></a> I say, "not to make the believer doubt"; for the apostle speaks of his position, and of the position of those to whom he was writing, with the most perfect assurance (chapter 3: 1, 2).<a name=335:7></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:335">footnote</a></i>) He had spoken, in re-commencement at verse 28, of the appearing of Jesus.<a name=335:8></a> This introduces the Lord in the full revelation of His character, and gives rise to the scrutiny of the pretensions of those who called themselves by His name.<a name=335:9></a> There are two proofs which belong essentially to the divine life, and a third which is accessory as privilege: righteousness or obedience, and love, and the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=335:10></a>

		This is the measure of our practical purification.<a name=336:8></a> We are not pure as He is pure; but we take Christ, as He is in heaven, for the pattern and measure of our purification, we purify ourselves according to His purity, knowing that we shall be perfectly like Him when He is manifested.<a name=336:9></a> Before marking the contrast between the principles of the divine life and of the enemy, he sets before us the true measure of purity (he will give that of love in a moment) for the children, inasmuch as they are partakers of His nature and have the same relationship with God.<a name=336:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two remarks to be made here.<a name=336:11></a> First, "hope in him" does not mean in the believer; but a hope that has Christ for its object.<a name=336:12></a> Second, it is striking to see the way in which the apostle appears to confound God and Christ together in this epistle; and uses the word "Him" to signify Christ, when he had just been speaking of God, and vice versa.<a name=336:13></a> We may see the principle of this at the end of chapter 5: "We are in him that is true, [that is to say] in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=336:14></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=336:15></a> In these few words we have the key to the epistle: Christ is the life.<a name=336:16></a> It is evidently the Son; but it is God Himself who is manifested, and the perfection of His nature, which is the source of life to us also, as that life was found in Christ as man.<a name=336:17></a> Thus I can speak of God and say, "Born of him"; but it is in Jesus that God was manifested, and from

		He who commits sin (not transgresses the law,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:337">footnote</a></i>) but) acts lawlessly.<a name=337:9></a> His conduct is without the restraint, without the rule of law.<a name=337:10></a> He acts without curb; for sin is the acting without the curb of law or restraint of another's authority, acting from our own will.<a name=337:11></a> Christ came to do His Father's will, not His own.<a name=337:12></a> But Christ was manifested that He might take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin; so that he who commits sin acts against the object of the manifestation of Christ, and in opposition to the nature of which, if Christ is our life, we are partakers.<a name=337:13></a> Therefore he who abides in Christ does not practise sin; he who sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.<a name=337:14></a> All depends, we see, on participation in the life and nature of Christ.<a name=337:15></a> Let us not then deceive ourselves.<a name=337:16></a> He who practises righteousness is righteous, as He is righteous: for, by partaking in the life of Christ, one is before God according to the perfection of Him who is there, the head and source of that life.<a name=337:17></a> But we are thus as Christ before God, because He Himself is really our life.<a name=337:18></a> Our actual life is not the measure of our acceptance; it is Christ who is so.<a name=337:19></a> But Christ is our life, if we are accepted

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, he who is born of God does not practise sin.<a name=338:5></a> The reason is evident; he is made a partaker of the nature of God; he derives his life from Him.<a name=338:6></a> This principle of divine life is in him.<a name=338:7></a> The seed of God remains in him; he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<a name=338:8></a> This new nature had not in it the principle of sin, so as to commit it.<a name=338:9></a> How could it be that the divine nature should sin?<a name=338:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus designated the two families, the family of God and that of the devil, the apostle adds the second mark, the absence of which is a proof that one is not of God.<a name=338:11></a> He had already spoken of righteousness; he adds the love of the brethren.<a name=338:12></a> For this is the message that they had received from Christ Himself, that they should love one another.<a name=338:13></a> In verse 12 he shews the connection between the two things: that hatred of a brother is fed by the sense one has that his works are good, and one's own evil.<a name=338:14></a> Moreover we are not to wonder that the world hates us: for we know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.<a name=338:15></a> If this love is an essential proof of being renewed, it is quite natural that it should not be found in the men of the world.<a name=338:16></a> But, this being the case, he who does not love his brother (solemn thought!<a name=338:17></a>), abides in death.<a name=338:18></a> In addition to this, he who does not love his brother is a murderer, and a murderer has not eternal life.<a name=338:19></a> There is the absence of the divine nature, death; but more, the activity of the old man in the opposite nature is there, he hates, and is in spirit the activity of death -- a murderer.<a name=338:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, as in the case of righteousness and of purity, we have Christ as the measure of this love.<a name=338:21></a> We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; we ought to lay down ours for the brethren.<a name=338:22></a> Now, if our brother has need, and we possess this world's good, but do not provide for his necessity, is that the divine love which made Christ lay down His life for us?<a name=338:23></a> It is by this real and practical love that we know we are in the truth, and that our heart is confirmed and assured before God.<a name=338:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We also receive all that we ask for, when we walk thus in love before Him, doing that which is pleasing in His sight; for thus walking in His presence with confidence, the heart and its desires respond to this blessed influence, being formed by the enjoyment of communion with Him in the light of His countenance.<a name=339:4></a> It is God who animates the heart; this life, and this divine nature, of which the epistle speaks, being in full activity and enlightened and moved by the divine presence in which it delights.<a name=339:5></a> Thus our requests are only for the accomplishment of desires that arise when this life, when our thoughts are filled with the presence of God and with the communication of His nature.<a name=339:6></a> And He lends His power to the fulfilment of these desires, of which He is the source, and which are formed in the heart by the revelation of Himself (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:7">John  15:7</a>).<a name=339:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		Now he who keeps His commandments dwells in Him; and He dwells also in this obedient man.<a name=339:10></a> It will be asked whether God or Christ is here meant?<a name=339:11></a> The apostle, as we have seen, confounds them together in his thought.<a name=339:12></a> That is to say, the Holy Ghost unites them in our minds.<a name=339:13></a> We are in Him who is true, that is, in His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=339:14></a> It is Christ, who is the presentation of God to men in life in man; and to the believer He is the communication of that life, so that God too dwells in him, in the revelation, in its divine excellence and perfection, of the nature which the believer shares in the power of the Holy Ghost who dwells in him, so that love is alike enjoyed and exercised.<a name=339:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Practical righteousness, then, is a proof that we are born of Him who, in His nature, is its source.<a name=340:6></a> In presence also of the world's hatred, we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren.<a name=340:7></a> Thus, having a good conscience, we have confidence in God, and we receive from Him whatsoever we ask, walking in obedience and in a way that is pleasing to Him.<a name=340:8></a> Thus walking, we dwell in Him(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:340">footnote</a></i>) and He in us.<a name=340:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A third proof of our christian privileges arises here.<a name=340:10></a> The Spirit whom He has given us is the proof that He Himself dwells in us, the manifestation of the presence of God in us.<a name=340:11></a> He does not here add that we abide in Him, because the subject here is the manifestation of the presence of God.<a name=340:12></a> The presence of the Spirit demonstrates it.<a name=340:13></a> But in abiding in Him there is as we shall see farther on, the enjoyment of that which He is, and consequently moral communion with His nature.<a name=340:14></a> He who obeys enjoys this also, as we have seen.<a name=340:15></a> Here the presence of the Holy Ghost in us is spoken of as demonstration of one part only of this truth, namely, that God is in us.<a name=340:16></a> But the presence of God in us according to grace, and according to the power of the Spirit, involves also communion with that nature; we dwell also in Him from whom we derive this grace, and all the spiritual forms of that nature, in communion and practical life.<a name=340:17></a> It is in verses 12 and 16 of chapter 4 that our apostle speaks of this.<a name=340:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Practical righteousness or obedience, the love of the brethren, the manifestation of the Spirit of God, are the proofs of our

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to make use of this last proof, caution was required, for many false prophets would assume, and even in the time of the apostle had already assumed, the semblance of having received communications from the Spirit of God, and insinuated themselves among the Christians (chapter 4).<a name=341:4></a> It was necessary therefore to put them on their guard, by giving them the sure mark of the real Spirit of God.<a name=341:5></a> The first of these was the confession of Jesus come in the flesh.<a name=341:6></a> It is not merely to confess that He is come, but to confess Him thus come.<a name=341:7></a> The second was that He who really knew God hearkened to the apostles.<a name=341:8></a> In this way the writings of the apostles become a touchstone for those who pretend to teach the assembly.<a name=341:9></a> All the word is so, doubtless; but I confine myself here to that which is said in this place.<a name=341:10></a> The teaching of the apostles is formally a touchstone for all other teaching -- I mean that which they themselves taught immediately.<a name=341:11></a> If any one tells me that others must explain or develop it to have the truth and certainty of faith, I reply, "You are not of God, for he who is of God hearkens to them; and you would have me not to hearken to them; and whatever may be your pretext, you prevent my doing so".<a name=341:12></a> The denial of Jesus come in the flesh is the spirit of Antichrist.<a name=341:13></a> Not to hear the apostles is the provisional and preparatory form of the evil.<a name=341:14></a> True Christians had overcome the spirit of error by the Spirit of God who dwelt in them.<a name=341:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three tests of true Christianity are now distinctly laud down, and the apostle pursues his exhortations, developing the fulness and intimacy of our relationships with a God of love, maintaining that participation of nature in which love is of God, and he who loves is born of God -- partakes therefore of His nature, and knows Him (for it is by faith that he received it) as partaking of His nature.<a name=341:16></a> He who loves not does not know God.<a name=341:17></a> We must possess the nature that loves in order to know what love is.<a name=341:18></a> He then who does not love does not know God, for God is love.<a name=341:19></a> Such a person has not one sentiment in connection with the nature of God; how then can he know Him?<a name=341:20></a> No more than an animal can know what a man's mind or understanding is when he has not got it.<a name=341:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=342>[Page 342]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		flows from the whole doctrine of the epistle.<a name=342:1></a> The eternal life which was with the Father has been manifested and has been imparted to us: thus we are partakers of the divine nature.<a name=342:2></a> The affections of that nature acting in us rest, by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the enjoyment of communion with God who is its source; we dwell in Him and He in us.<a name=342:3></a> The first thing is the statement of the truth in us.<a name=342:4></a> The actings of this nature prove that He dwells -- that, if we thus love, God Himself dwells in us.<a name=342:5></a> He who works this love is there.<a name=342:6></a> But He is infinite and the heart rests in Him; we know at the same time that we dwell in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.<a name=342:7></a> But this passage, so rich in blessing, demands that we should follow it with order.<a name=342:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins with the fact that love is of God.<a name=342:9></a> It is His nature: He is its source.<a name=342:10></a> Therefore he who loves is born of God, is a partaker of His nature.<a name=342:11></a> Also he knows God, for he knows what love is, and God is its fulness.<a name=342:12></a> This is the doctrine which makes everything depend on our participation in the divine nature.<a name=342:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this might be transformed on the one hand into mysticism, by leading us to fix our attention on our love for God, and love in us, that being God's nature, as if it was said, love is God, not God is love, and by seeking to fathom the divine nature in ourselves; or to doubt on the other, because we do not find the effects of the divine nature in us as we would.<a name=342:14></a> In effect, he who does not love (for the thing, as ever in John, is expressed in an abstract way) does not know God, for God is love.<a name=342:15></a> The possession of the nature is necessary to the understanding of what that nature is, and for the knowledge of Him who is its perfection.<a name=342:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, if I seek to know it and have or give the proof of it, it is not to the existence of the nature in us that the Spirit of God directs the thoughts of the believers as their object.<a name=342:17></a> God, he has said, is love; and this love has been manifested towards us in that He has given His only Son, that we might live through Him.<a name=342:18></a> The proof is not the life in us, but that God has given His Son in order that we might live, and further to make propitiation for our sins.<a name=342:19></a> God be praised!<a name=342:20></a> we know this love, not by the poor results of its action in ourselves, but in its perfection in God, and that even in a manifestation of it towards us, which is wholly outside ourselves.<a name=342:21></a> It is a fact outside ourselves which is the manifestation of this perfect love.<a name=342:22></a> We enjoy it by participating in the divine nature; we know it by

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The full scope of this principle and all the force of its truth are stated and demonstrated in that which follows.<a name=343:3></a> It is striking to see how the Holy Spirit, in an epistle which is essentially occupied with the life of Christ and its fruits in us, gives the proof and full character of love in that which is wholly without ourselves.<a name=343:4></a> Nor can anything be more perfect than the way in which the love of God is here set forth, from the time it is occupied with our sinful state till we stand before the judgment-seat.<a name=343:5></a> God has thought of all: love towards us as sinners, verses 9, 10; in us as saints, verse 12; with us as perfect in our condition in view of the day of judgment, verse 17.<a name=343:6></a> In the first verses, the love of God is manifested in the gift of Christ; firstly, to give us life -- we were dead; secondly, to make propitiation -- we were guilty.<a name=343:7></a> Our whole case is taken up.<a name=343:8></a> In the second of these verses the great principle of grace, what love is, where and how known, is clearly stated in words of infinite importance as to the very nature of Christianity.<a name=343:9></a> Herein is love, not that we have loved God (that was the principle of the law), but in that He has loved us, and has given His Son to make propitiation for our sins.<a name=343:10></a> Here, then, it is that we have learnt that which love is.<a name=343:11></a> It was perfect in Him when we had no love for Him; perfect in Him in that He exercised it towards us when we were in our sins, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for them.<a name=343:12></a> The apostle then affirms, no doubt, that he who loves not knows not God.<a name=343:13></a> The pretension to possess this love is judged by this means; but in order to know love we must not seek for it in ourselves, but seek it manifested in God when we had none.<a name=343:14></a> He gives the life which loves, and He has made propitiation for our sins.<a name=343:15></a>

		And now with regard to the enjoyment and the privileges of this love: -- if God has so loved us (this is the ground that He takes) we ought to love one another.<a name=343:16></a> No one has ever seen God: if we love one another, God dwells in us.<a name=343:17></a> His presence, Himself dwelling in us, rises in the excellency of His nature above all the barriers of circumstances, and attaches us to those who are His.<a name=343:18></a> It is God in the power of His nature which is the source of thought and feeling, and diffuses itself among them in whom it is.<a name=343:19></a> One can understand this.<a name=343:20></a> How is it that I love strangers from another land, persons of different habits whom I have never known, more

		The apostle has not yet said, "We know that we dwell in him".<a name=344:15></a> He will say it now.<a name=344:16></a> But, if the love of the brethren is in us, God dwells in us.<a name=344:17></a> When it is in exercise, we are conscious of the presence of God, as perfect love in us.<a name=344:18></a> It fills the heart, and thus is exercised in us.<a name=344:19></a> Now this consciousness is the effect of the presence of His Spirit, as the source and power of life and nature, in us.<a name=344:20></a> He has given us, not here "his Spirit" -- the proof that He dwells in us, but "of his Spirit"; we participate by His presence in us in divine affection through the Spirit, and thus we not only know that He dwells in us, but the presence of the Spirit, acting in a nature which is that of God in us, makes us conscious that we dwell in Him.<a name=344:21></a> For He is the infiniteness and perfection of that which is now in us.<a name=344:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The heart rests in this, and enjoys Him, and is hidden from all that is outside Him, in the consciousness of the perfect love in which (thus dwelling in Him) one finds oneself.<a name=344:23></a> The Spirit makes us dwell in God, and gives us thus the consciousness that He dwells in us.<a name=344:24></a> Thus we, in the savour and consciousness of the love that was in it, can testify of that in which it was manifested beyond all Jewish limits, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<a name=344:25></a> We shall see further another character of it.<a name=344:26></a>

		If we compare verse 12 of our chapter 4 with chapter 1: 18 of the Gospel by John, we shall better apprehend the scope of the apostle's teaching here.<a name=344:27></a> The same difficulty, or if you will, the same truth is presented in both cases.<a name=344:28></a> No one has ever seen God.<a name=344:29></a> How is this met?<a name=344:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see, also, the distinction between God dwelling in us and we in God, even in that which Christ says of Himself.<a name=345:13></a> He abode always in the Father, and the Father in Him; but He says, "The Father who dwelleth in me, he doeth the works".<a name=345:14></a> Through His word the disciples ought to have believed in them both; but in that which they had seen -- in His works -- they had rather seen the proof that the Father dwelt in Him.<a name=345:15></a> They who had seen Him had seen the Father.<a name=345:16></a> But when the Comforter was come, at that day they should know that Jesus was in His Father -- divinely one with the Father.<a name=345:17></a>

		He does not say that we are in God, nor in the Father,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:345">footnote</a></i>) but that we dwell in Him, and we know it, because He has given us of His Spirit.<a name=345:18></a> We have already noticed that He says (chapter 3: 24)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark here that, while God's dwelling in us is a doctrinal fact and true of every real Christian, our dwelling in Him, though involved in it, is connected with our state.<a name=346:7></a> Thus chapter 3: 24, "He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him".<a name=346:8></a> Chapter 4: 16, "He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him".<a name=346:9></a>

		Love one to another is indeed taken as the proof that God is there, and His love is perfected in us -- this to contrast the manner of His presence with that of Christ (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=346:10></a> But what we thus know is dwelling in Him and He in us.<a name=346:11></a> In each case this knowledge is by the Spirit.<a name=346:12></a> Verse 15 is the universal fact; verse 16 brings it fully up to its source.<a name=346:13></a> We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=346:14></a> His nature is there declared in itself (for we joy in God); God is love, and he who dwells in love dwells in God and God in him.<a name=346:15></a> There is none anywhere else: if we partake of His nature, we partake of it, and he who abides in it abides in God who is the fulness of it.<a name=346:16></a> But then remark that while what He is is insisted on, His personal being is carefully insisted on.<a name=346:17></a> He dwells in us.<a name=346:18></a>

		And here comes in a principle of deep importance.<a name=346:19></a> It might perhaps be said that this dwelling of God in us and our dwelling in Him depended on a large measure of spirituality, the apostle having in fact spoken of the highest possible joy.<a name=346:20></a> But although the degree in which we intelligently realise it is in effect a matter of spirituality, yet the thing in itself is the portion of every Christian.<a name=346:21></a> It is our position, because Christ is our life, and because the Holy Ghost is given us.<a name=346:22></a> "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle explains this high position by the possession of the divine nature -- the essential condition of Christianity.<a name=347:5></a> A Christian is one who is a partaker of the divine nature, and in whom the Spirit dwells.<a name=347:6></a> But the knowledge of our position does not flow from the consideration of this truth, though it depends on its being true, but of that of God's own love, as we have already seen.<a name=347:7></a> And the apostle goes on to say, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=347:8></a> This is the source of our knowledge and enjoyment of these privileges, so sweet and so marvellously exalted, but so simple and so real to the heart when they are known.<a name=347:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, the Christian has believed for himself in this love, and he enjoys it according to its fulness.<a name=348:3></a> There is only this modification of the expression of the glorious fact of our portion -- that the confession of Jesus as the Son of God is primarily here the proof that God dwells in us, although the other part of the truth equally says that he who confesses Him dwells also in God.<a name=348:4></a>

		When speaking of our portion in communion, as believing in this love, it is said, that he who dwells in love dwells in God; for in effect that is where the heart is.<a name=348:5></a> Here also the other part of the truth is equally true; God dwells in him likewise.<a name=348:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken of the consciousness of this dwelling in God, for it is thus only that it is known.<a name=348:7></a> But it is important to remember that the apostle teaches it as a truth that applies to every believer.<a name=348:8></a> These might have excused themselves for not appropriating these statements as too high for them; but this fact judges the excuse.<a name=348:9></a> This communion is neglected.<a name=348:10></a> But God dwells in every one who confesses that Jesus is Son of God, and he in God.<a name=348:11></a> What an encouragement for a timid believer!<a name=348:12></a> What a rebuke for a careless one!<a name=348:13></a>

		The apostle returns to our relative position, viewing God as outside ourselves, as Him before whom we are to appear and with whom we have always to do.<a name=348:14></a> This is the third great proof and character of love in which it is complete, testifying, as I have already said, that God has thought on all as to us from our sinful state to the day of judgment.<a name=348:15></a>

		If we inquire practically into the history, so to speak, of these affections; if we seek to separate that which in the enjoyment is united, because the divine nature in us, which is love, enjoys love in its perfection in God (His love shed abroad in the heart by His presence therefore); if we wish to specify the relationship in which our hearts find themselves with God in regard to this, here it is: "we love him because he first loved us".<a name=349:17></a> It is grace and it must be grace, because it is God who is to be glorified.<a name=349:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first passage, where the apostle speaks of the manifestation of this love, he does not go beyond the fact that one who loves is born of God.<a name=350:7></a> The nature of God (which is love) being in us, he who loves knows Him, for he is born of Him -- has His nature and realises what it is.<a name=350:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is that which God has been with regard to the sinner which demonstrates His nature of love.<a name=350:9></a> Afterwards, that which we learnt as sinners we enjoy as saints.<a name=350:10></a> The perfect love of God is shed abroad in the heart, and we dwell in Him.<a name=350:11></a> As already with Jesus in this world, and as He is, fear has no place in one to whom the love of God is a dwelling-place and rest.<a name=350:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 20: the reality of our love to God, fruit of His love to us, is now tested.<a name=350:13></a> If we say that we love God and do not love the brethren, we are liars; for if the divine nature, so near us (in the brethren near us), and Christ's value for them, does not awaken our spiritual affections, how then can He who is afar off do so?<a name=350:14></a> This also is His commandment, that he who loves God love his brother also.<a name=350:15></a> Obedience is found here also (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:31">John  14:31</a>).<a name=350:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love for the brethren proves the reality of our love for God.<a name=350:17></a> And this love must be universal, must be in exercise towards all Christians, for whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and he who loves a person will love one who is born of Him.<a name=350:18></a> And if the being born of Him is the motive, we shall love all that are born of Him (chapter 5: 1).<a name=350:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But a danger exists on the other side.<a name=350:20></a> It may be, that we love the brethren because they are pleasant to us; they furnish us with agreeable society, in which our conscience is not wounded.<a name=350:21></a> A counter-proof is therefore given us.<a name=350:22></a> "Hereby we know that we love the children of God, if we love God and keep his commandments".<a name=350:23></a> It is not as children of God that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is a touchstone even for this love of God, namely, obedience to His commands.<a name=351:4></a> If I walk with the brethren themselves in disobedience to their Father, it is certainly not because they are His children that I love them.<a name=351:5></a> If it were because I loved the Father and because they were His children, I should assuredly like them to obey Him.<a name=351:6></a> To walk then in disobedience with the children of God, under the pretext of brotherly love, is not to love them as the children of God.<a name=351:7></a> If I loved them as such, I should love their Father and my Father, and I could not walk in disobedience to Him and call it a proof that I loved them because they were His.<a name=351:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I also loved them because they were His children, I should love all who are such, because the same motive engages me to love them all.<a name=351:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The universality of this love with regard to all the children of God; its exercise in practical obedience to His will: these are the marks of true brotherly love.<a name=351:10></a> That which has not these marks is a mere carnal party spirit, clothing itself with the name and the forms of brotherly love.<a name=351:11></a> Most certainly I do not love the Father if I encourage His children in disobedience to Him.<a name=351:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is an obstacle to this obedience, and that is the world.<a name=351:13></a> The world has its forms, which are very far from obedience to God.<a name=351:14></a> When we are occupied only with Him and His will, the world's enmity soon breaks out.<a name=351:15></a> It also acts, by its comforts and its delights, on the heart of man as walking after the flesh.<a name=351:16></a> In short, the world and the commandments of God are in opposition to each other; but the commandments of God are not grievous to those who are born of Him, for he who is born of God overcomes the world.<a name=351:17></a> He possesses a nature and a principle that surmount the difficulties that the world opposes to his walk.<a name=351:18></a> His nature is the divine nature, for he is born of God; his principle is that of faith.<a name=351:19></a> His nature is insensible to the attractions which this world offers to the flesh,

		Now what is the testimony rendered to this gift of life eternal?<a name=352:14></a> The witnesses are three: the Spirit, the water, and the blood.<a name=352:15></a> This Jesus, the Son of God, is He who came by water and by blood; not by water only, but by water and by blood.<a name=352:16></a> The Spirit also bears witness because He is truth.<a name=352:17></a> That to which they bear witness is that God has given us eternal life, and that this life is in His Son.<a name=352:18></a> But whence did this water and the blood flow?<a name=352:19></a> It was from the pierced side of Jesus.<a name=352:20></a> It is the judgment of death pronounced and executed (compare <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>) on the flesh, on all that is of the old man, on the first Adam.<a name=352:21></a> Not that the sin of the first Adam was in the flesh of Christ, but that Jesus died in it as a sacrifice for sin.<a name=352:22></a> "In that he died he died unto sin once".<a name=352:23></a> Sin in the flesh was condemned in the death of Christ in the flesh.<a name=352:24></a> There was no other remedy.<a name=352:25></a> The flesh could not be modified nor subjected to the law.<a name=352:26></a> The life of the first Adam was nothing but sin in the principle of its will; it could not be subject to the law.<a name=352:27></a> Our purification as to the old man is its death.<a name=352:28></a> He who is dead is justified from sin.<a name=352:29></a> We are therefore baptised to have part in the death of Jesus.<a name=352:30></a> We are crucified with Christ; nevertheless we live, but not we, it is Christ who lives in us.<a name=352:31></a> Participating in the life of Christ risen, we reckon ourselves as dead with Him; for why live of this new life, this life of the last Adam, if we

		could live before God in the life of the first Adam?<a name=353:1></a> No; by living in Christ we have accepted by faith the sentence of death, passed by God on the first Adam.<a name=353:2></a> This is christian purification: even the death of the old man, because we are made partakers of life in Christ Jesus.<a name=353:3></a> "We are dead" -- crucified with Him.<a name=353:4></a> We need a perfect purification before God; we have it, for that which was impure no longer exists: what exists, as born of God, as perfectly pure.<a name=353:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He came by water -- a powerful testimony, as flowing from the side of a dead Christ, that life is not to be sought for in the first Adam; for Christ, as coming for man, taking up his cause, the Christ come in the flesh, had to die: else He had remained alone in His own purity.<a name=353:6></a> Life is to be sought for in the Son of God risen from among the dead.<a name=353:7></a> Purification is by death.<a name=353:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was not by water only that He came; it was also by blood.<a name=353:9></a> The expiation of our sins was as necessary as the moral purification of our souls.<a name=353:10></a> We possess it in the blood of a slain Christ.<a name=353:11></a> Death alone could expiate them and blot them out, and Jesus died for us.<a name=353:12></a> The guilt of the believer no longer exists before God; Christ has put Himself in his place.<a name=353:13></a> The life is on high, and we are raised up together with Him, God having forgiven us all our trespasses.<a name=353:14></a> Expiation is by death.<a name=353:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third witness is the Spirit: put first in the order of their testimony on earth, as He alone gives witness in power so that we know the other two; last, in their historic order, for such in fact was that order, death first and only thereafter the Holy Ghost.<a name=353:16></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:353">footnote</a></i>) In effect it is the testimony of the Spirit, His presence in us, which enables us to appreciate the value of the water and the blood.<a name=353:17></a> We should never have understood the practical bearing of the death of Christ, if the Holy Ghost were not to the new man a revealing power of its import and its efficacy.<a name=353:18></a> Now the Holy Ghost came down from a risen and ascended Christ; and thus we know that eternal life is given us in the Son of God.<a name=353:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of these three witnesses meets together in this same truth, namely, that grace -- that God Himself -- has given us eternal life; and that this life is in the Son.<a name=353:20></a> Man had nothing to do in it, except by his sins.<a name=353:21></a> It is the gift of God, and the life that He gives is in the Son.<a name=353:22></a> The testimony is

		We have then the three things: the cleansing, the expiation, and the presence of the Holy Ghost as the witness that eternal life is given us in the Son, who was slain for man when in relationship with man here below.<a name=354:3></a> He could but die for man as he is.<a name=354:4></a> Life is elsewhere, namely, in Himself.<a name=354:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the doctrine of the epistle ends.<a name=354:6></a> The apostle wrote these things in order that they who believed in the Son might know that they had eternal life.<a name=354:7></a> He does not give means of examination to make the faithful doubt whether they had eternal life; but -- seeing that there were seducers who endeavoured to turn them aside as deficient in something important, and who presented themselves as possessing some superior light -- he points out to them the marks of life, in order to re-assure them; developing the excellence of that life, and of their position as enjoying it; and in order that they might understand that God had given it to them, and that they might be in no wise shaken in mind.<a name=354:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He then speaks of the practical confidence in God which flows from all this -- confidence exercised with a view to all our wants here below, all that our hearts desire to ask of God.<a name=354:9></a> We know that He always listens to everything that we ask in accordance with His will.<a name=354:10></a> Precious privilege!<a name=354:11></a> The Christian himself would not desire anything to be granted him that was contrary to the will of God.<a name=354:12></a> But for everything that is according to His will, His ear is ever open to us, ever attentive.<a name=354:13></a> He always hearkens; He is not like man, often occupied so that he cannot listen, or careless so that he will not.<a name=354:14></a> God always hears us, and assuredly He does not fail in power: the attention He pays us is a proof of His good-will.<a name=354:15></a> We receive therefore the things that we ask of Him.<a name=354:16></a> He grants our requests.<a name=354:17></a> What a sweet relationship!<a name=354:18></a> What a high privilege!<a name=354:19></a> And it is one also of which we may avail ourselves in charity for others.<a name=354:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If a brother sins and God chastises him, we may petition for that brother, and life shall be restored him.<a name=354:21></a> Chastisement tends to the death of the body (compare <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33">Job  33</a>and 34; <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:14">James  5:14</a>, 15); we pray for the offender and he is healed.<a name=354:22></a> Otherwise the sickness takes its course.<a name=354:23></a> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is such sin as is unto death.<a name=354:24></a> This does not seem to me to be some particular sin, but all sin which has such a character that, instead of awakening christian charity, it awakens

		The apostle ends his epistle by specifying these two things: our nature, our mode of being, as Christians; and the object that has been communicated to us in order to produce and nourish faith.<a name=355:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know that we are of God; and that not in a vague way, but in contrast with all that is not us -- a principle of immense importance, which makes christian position exclusive by its very nature.<a name=355:12></a> It is not merely good, or bad, or better; but it is of God.<a name=355:13></a> And nothing which is not of God (that is to say, which has not its origin in Him) could have this character and this place.<a name=355:14></a> The whole world lies in the wicked one.<a name=355:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian has the certainty of these two things by virtue of his nature, which discerns and knows that which is of God, and thereby judges all that is opposed to it.<a name=355:16></a> The two are not merely good and bad, but of God and of the enemy.<a name=355:17></a> This as to the nature.<a name=355:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the object of this nature, we know that the Son of God is come -- a truth of immense importance also.<a name=355:19></a> It is not merely that there is good and that there is evil; but the Son of God has Himself come into this scene of misery, to present an object to our hearts.<a name=355:20></a> But there is more than this.<a name=355:21></a> He has given us an understanding that in the midst of all the falsehood of this world, of which Satan is the prince, we may know Him that is true -- the true One.<a name=355:22></a> Immense privilege which alters our whole position!<a name=355:23></a> The power of the world by which Satan blinded us is completely broken, and we are brought into the true light; and in that light we see and know Him who is true, who is in Himself perfection; that by which all things can be perfectly discerned and judged according to truth.<a name=355:24></a> But

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may again remark here -- that which gives a character to the whole epistle -- the manner in which God and Christ are united in the apostle's mind.<a name=356:5></a> It is on account of this that he so frequently says, "He", when we must understand "Christ", although he had previously spoken of God: for instance, chapter 4: 20.<a name=356:6></a> And here, "We are in him that is true [that is to say], in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=356:7></a> This is the true God and eternal life".<a name=356:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Behold then the divine links of our position!<a name=356:9></a> We are in Him who is true; this is the nature of Him in whom we are.<a name=356:10></a> Now, in reality as to the nature, it is God Himself; as to the Person, and as to the manner of being in Him, it is His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=356:11></a> It is in the Son, in the Son as man, that we are in fact as to His Person; but He is the true God, the veritable God.<a name=356:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second and third epistles of John insist on the truth.<a name=357:1></a> The second warns the faithful against the reception of those who do not teach the doctrine of Christ, especially the truth respecting the Person of Christ.<a name=357:2></a> The third encourages believers to receive and help those who teach it.<a name=357:3></a> Accordingly they both (and the second especially) lay stress on "the truth".<a name=357:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle loved this elect lady, "in the truth"; as did also all those who had known the truth, and that for the truth's sake.<a name=357:5></a> He wished her blessing in truth and in love.<a name=357:6></a> He rejoiced that he had found some who were her children walking in the truth.<a name=357:7></a> He desired that there should be mutual love among Christians, but this was love, that they should keep the commandments; for many deceivers were come into the world.<a name=357:8></a> Now whosoever transgressed, and did not abide in the doctrine of Christ, had not God.<a name=357:9></a> He ends his epistle, of which we have given an almost complete summary, by exhorting this lady, in case any one should come and not bring this doctrine, not to receive him into our house, nor say to him, "God bless you, or be with you", or "I salute you".<a name=357:10></a> For to do so would be to make herself a partaker in the evil he was doing.<a name=357:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The false doctrine which was abroad at that moment was the denial of the truth of Christ come in the flesh; but the apostle says in a general way that, if any one transgressed and did not abide in the doctrine of Christ, he had not God.<a name=357:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn several important things in this little epistle.<a name=357:13></a> The mission of a man who went about preaching was never brought into question, but the doctrine which he brought; if he brought sound doctrine he was welcome.<a name=357:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A woman having the word -- as this epistle, for example -- was capable of judging his doctrine, and responsible to do so.<a name=357:15></a> Inexorable rigour was to be maintained, if the doctrine as to the Person of Christ was touched.<a name=357:16></a> The door was to be shut against whoever falsified it.<a name=357:17></a> They were not even to say to him, "I salute you"; for they who did so became partakers of his evil work.<a name=357:18></a> It would be to help on the deceits of Satan.<a name=357:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover the semblance of love which does not maintain the truth, but accommodates itself to that which is not the truth, is not love according to God.<a name=357:20></a> It is the taking advantage of the

		3 JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third epistle encourages the believer to the exercise of hospitality, whether towards the known brethren or strangers, and to all benevolent care in furthering their journey when departing, provided that they come with the truth and for the truth's sake without salary or provision.<a name=359:1></a> Gaius received them, as it appears, and was helpful to them both in his own house and on their journey.<a name=359:2></a> Diotrephes, on the contrary, did not love these strangers, who went about, it is said, without a formal mission and without any visible means of subsistence.<a name=359:3></a> They had gone forth for the Lord's sake and had received nothing from the Gentiles.<a name=359:4></a> If they in reality came out of love to that name, one did well to receive them.<a name=359:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again the apostle insists on the truth, as characterising real love: "Whom I love in the truth", he says to Gaius.<a name=359:6></a> He rejoiced when the brethren (those, I imagine, whom Gaius had received into his house and helped on their journey) testified of the truth that was in him, as in effect he walked in the truth.<a name=359:7></a> The apostle had no greater joy than that of hearing that his children walked in the truth.<a name=359:8></a> In receiving those who went forth to preach the truth, they helped the truth itself; they were co-workers with it.<a name=359:9></a> Diotrephes would have nothing to do with this; he not only refused to receive these itinerant preachers, but excommunicated those who did so.<a name=359:10></a> He claimed authority for himself.<a name=359:11></a> The apostle would remember it.<a name=359:12></a> It was their duty to do good.<a name=359:13></a> "He that doeth good is of God".<a name=359:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He goes so far, with regard to the truth, as to say, that the truth itself bore witness to Demetrius.<a name=359:15></a> I suppose that the latter had propagated it, and that the establishment and confirmation of the truth everywhere -- at least where he had laboured -- was a testimony with regard to himself.<a name=359:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This insistence on the truth, as the test for the last days, is very remarkable; and so is this preaching itinerary by persons who took nothing of the Gentiles when they came forth, leaving it to God to cause them to be received of those who had the truth at heart, the truth being their only passport among Christians, and the only means by which the apostle could guard the faithful.<a name=359:17></a> It appears that they were of the Jewish race, for he says, "receiving nothing of the Gentiles", the apostle thus

		JUDE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle of Jude develops the history of the apostasy of Christendom, from the earliest elements that crept into the assembly to corrupt it, down to its judgment at the appearing of our Lord, but as moral apostasy by turning the grace of God into lasciviousness.<a name=361:1></a> In John they are gone out; here they have crept in, corrupting.<a name=361:2></a> It is a very short epistle, and containing instruction presented with much brevity, and with the energetic rapidity of the prophetic style, but of immense weight and extensive bearing.<a name=361:3></a>

		We have already noticed this difference between the epistle of Jude and the second of Peter, that Peter speaks of sin, Jude of apostasy, the departure of the assembly from its primitive state before God.<a name=361:5></a> Departure from the holiness of faith is the subject that Jude treats.<a name=361:6></a> He does not speak of outward separation.<a name=361:7></a> He views Christians as a number of persons professing a religion on the earth, and originally true to that which they professed.<a name=361:8></a> Certain persons had crept in among them unawares.<a name=361:9></a> They fed themselves without fear at the love-feasts of the Christians; and although the Lord would come attended by all His saints (so that the faithful will have been already caught up), yet in the judgment these persons are still accounted to be in the same class -- "to convince", he says, "all that are ungodly among them".<a name=361:10></a> They may indeed be in open rebellion at the moment of judgment, but they were individuals who had once formed a part of the company of Christians; they were really apostates, enemies left behind.<a name=361:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When it is said, "These be they who separate themselves", it does not mean openly from the visible assembly, for he speaks of them as in the midst of it; but they set themselves apart, being in it, as more excellent than others, like the Pharisees among the Jews.<a name=361:12></a> Jude points them out as being in the midst of the Christians, and presenting themselves as such.<a name=361:13></a> The judgment falls upon this class of persons; the taking up of the saints has left them behind for judgment.<a name=361:14></a>

		The evil was, not only that certain men had crept in among them -- in itself an immense evil, because the action of the Holy Ghost is thereby hindered among Christians -- but that, definitely, the entire testimony before God, the vessel which held this testimony, would become (as had been already the case with the Jews) corrupt to such a degree that it would bring down upon itself the judgment of God.<a name=362:14></a> And it has become thus corrupt.<a name=362:15></a>

		This is the great principle of the downfall of the testimony, established by God in the world, by means of the corruption of the vessel which contains it, and which bears its name.<a name=362:16></a> In pointing out moral corruption as characterising the state of professors, Jude cites, as examples of this downfall and of its judgment, the case of Israel, who fell in the wilderness (with the exception of two, Joshua and Caleb), and that of the angels who, not having kept their first estate, are reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day.<a name=362:17></a>

		Jude then sums up the three kinds or characters of the evil and of estrangement from God; first, that of nature, the opposition of the flesh to the testimony of God and His true people, the impetus which this enmity gives to the will of the flesh; in the second place, ecclesiastical evil, teaching error for reward, knowing all the while that it is contrary to the truth and against the people of God; third, open opposition, rebellion, against the authority of God in His true King and Priest.<a name=363:7></a>

		It is important to observe the way in which the Spirit of God speaks in the epistles of a power that can keep us from every fall, and unblamable; so that a thought only of sin is never excusable.<a name=365:13></a> It is not that the flesh is not in us, but that, with the Holy Ghost acting in the new man, it is never necessary that the flesh should act or influence our life (compare <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:22">1 Thessalonians  5:22</a>).<a name=365:14></a> We are united to Jesus: He represents us before God, He is our righteousness.<a name=365:15></a> But at the same time He who in His perfection is our righteousness is also our life; so that the Spirit aims at the manifestation of this same perfection, practical perfection, in the daily life.<a name=365:16></a> He who says "I abide in Him", ought to walk as He walked.<a name=365:17></a> The Lord also says, "Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect".<a name=365:18></a>

		The saints then express their own consciousness of what He has done for them, yet still in reference to the kingdom, not as the body or bride, or their own heavenly joys, but the highest possible as regards the given glory and place.<a name=372:8></a> This is the necessary consequence of the consciousness of a near and blessed relationship.<a name=372:9></a> Whatever the glory of the One we are in relationship with, it is what He is for oneself, one's own nearness to Him, that comes to the mind when the glory is declared.<a name=372:10></a> Were a general to march in triumph into a town, the feeling of a child or wife would be, 'That is my father', -- 'That is my husband'.<a name=372:11></a> Here the feeling, though of this

		Such is the introduction to this book.<a name=374:1></a> We now enter on its contents.<a name=374:2></a> John was in the Spirit on the Lord's day.<a name=374:3></a> It is his place and privilege however then, as a Christian, which is spoken of, not the prophetic period into which he entered.<a name=374:4></a> In the day of resurrection -- his own place -- the day on which Christians meet, the apostle, removed from the society of Christians, still enjoyed the special elevating power of the Holy Ghost, though alone; and is thus used of God, allowed to be banished for the purpose, for what He could not, in an ordinary way, have communicated to the assembly for its edification.<a name=374:5></a> The persecuting emperor little thought what he was giving to us when he banished the apostle; no more than Augustus, in his political plans as to the census of the empire, knew he was sending a poor carpenter to Bethlehem, with his espoused wife, that Christ might be born there; or the Jews and Pilate's soldiers, that they were sending the thief to heaven, when they broke his legs in heartless respect for their own superstitions or ordinances.<a name=374:6></a> God's ways are behind the scenes; but He moves all the scenes which He is behind.<a name=374:7></a> We have to learn this, and let Him work, and not think much of man's busy movements: they will accomplish God's.<a name=374:8></a> The rest of them all perish and disappear.<a name=374:9></a> We have only peacefully to do His will.<a name=374:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same voice that afterwards called John up to heaven, he now hears behind him on earth -- the voice of the Son of man.<a name=374:11></a> It summons his attention with power; and turning to see the voice, as Moses towards the bush, he sees, not the image of God's presence in Israel, but the vessels of God's light in the earth, and a complete summary of it all, and, in the midst of them, Christ as Son of man.<a name=374:12></a> We find, thus, in the Revelation, God's whole history of the world, or of what is of Him in it, from the first decay of the assembly to the new heavens and new earth.<a name=374:13></a> But it was impossible for God to set aside the present expectation of Christ, or to justify the assembly in its careless but sinful thought, "My Lord delayeth His coming".<a name=374:14></a> Hence, as always, this history, and especially that of the assembly, is given in a way which leaves time out altogether.<a name=374:15></a> The moral progress of the assembly is given in pictures of the state of the existing assemblies selected for that purpose, beginning with its first decline, and ending with its entire rejection.<a name=374:16></a> Being taken up as assemblies, the general principle of responsibility is in view, and the assembly viewed,

		not as the infallibly blessed body of Christ, but such as that it may be rejected and set aside on earth; for a local assembly and the external visible assembly clearly can.<a name=375:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These assemblies are seen as distinct light-bearers; that is, in their place of service, or rather position of witness in the world.<a name=375:2></a> They are viewed in their own proper character as of God; as set by Him in the world, they are of gold.<a name=375:3></a> He may take them away because they give a dim, or no true light or witness for God; but the thing taken away was founded in divine righteousness, and founded originally by a divine hand.<a name=375:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Spirit first occupies itself with the character of Him who stood amongst them.<a name=375:5></a> First, we get His actual position, before stating what He was.<a name=375:6></a> He stood as Son of man.<a name=375:7></a> We have not Him here as Head of the one body, nor even as heavenly Intercessor; nor have we the Christ, of course (that is, the Jewish character of the Lord).<a name=375:8></a> It will be found that these are just the characters of Christ omitted also in the first chapter of John's Gospel.<a name=375:9></a> John sees Him in the wide character in which He is set over all the works of God's hand, and Heir of all promises and purposes of God to man according to divine righteousness.<a name=375:10></a> He is not the Son of man in service.<a name=375:11></a> His garment is down to His feet, and He has the girdle of divine righteousness about His breasts.<a name=375:12></a> This is His character.<a name=375:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then His qualities or attributes.<a name=375:14></a> First, He is the Ancient of days.<a name=375:15></a> In Daniel the same truth comes out.<a name=375:16></a> The Son of man is brought to the Ancient of days; but, farther on in the chapter, it is the Ancient of days who comes.<a name=375:17></a> The Son of man is Jehovah.<a name=375:18></a> This characterises all the testimony.<a name=375:19></a> The King of kings and Lord of lords shews Him:(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:375">footnote</a></i>) but, when He comes, we find that He is King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=375:20></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:375">footnote</a></i>) But in this glory He has the attributes of judgment -- eyes of fire -- that which pierces into everything, and fire is ever the sign of judgment.<a name=375:21></a> This was its piercing, searching character: His feet, the firmness with which sin was met; for brass is righteousness, viewed, not as intrinsically in God to be approached, but as dealing with man, in his responsibility as man.<a name=375:22></a> The mercy-seat was gold, the altar and laver brass; but there it was as an altar, that is, dealing with sin for man, a sacrifice, though fire was there, but here the burning furnace of judgment.<a name=375:23></a> The voice was the sign of power and majesty.<a name=375:24></a>

		Next, we have official supremacy.<a name=376:1></a> He held all that was subordinate authority in light and order, here spoken of as regards the assembly, in His right hand, in His power.<a name=376:2></a> He had the power of judgment by the word, and supreme authority -- the sun -- in the fulness of its highest character.<a name=376:3></a> We have His personal glory as Jehovah; His qualities as divine Judge; and His supreme official position.<a name=376:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, He was not less the Redeemer, the gracious securer in blessing of them that were His.<a name=376:5></a> John (as ever in prophetic vision of Jehovah, for it is not the Spirit of adoption here) falls at His feet as one dead.<a name=376:6></a> So Daniel; so in spirit Isaiah (chapter 6); but His power sustains the saint, does not destroy him.<a name=376:7></a> He lays His right hand on John himself, declares Himself the first and the last, Jehovah Himself, but withal the same that died in love and has complete power over death and hades; the deliverer from it, not the subjecter to it.<a name=376:8></a> He has risen out of death and hades, and has the keys -- full power over them -- divine power or support; and He who died and rose again, and lives for ever even as man, does so, not simply in the power of divine life in man, but of victory over all that man was subject to by sin and infirmity.<a name=376:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the position He here takes with John His servant, and with the assemblies respectively.<a name=376:10></a> We shall see that the state of the latter assemblies brings out other characters known only to the opened eye of faith.<a name=376:11></a> These were what John had seen, and which he was to write.<a name=376:12></a> Then as regards prophetic facts, he was to write the things that were, the state of these various assemblies as the setting forth historically of the assembly's various state -- a history; and the things which should be after them (that is, when the assembly's history has closed on earth).<a name=376:13></a> The whole assembly therefore, is thus, to the Spirit, the present time -- the "things that are".<a name=376:14></a> The future was what came after it, God's dealings with the world.<a name=376:15></a> This, while it left the coming of the Lord, or preparatory prophetic events in immediate expectation, left, if there was delay (and there was to be), the period undefined, and the expectation, though prolonged, still a present one.<a name=376:16></a> We may remark that we have the personal glory of Christ here, the position as to the assemblies accompanying it.<a name=376:17></a> He is not personally revealed as Son of man, that is, as taking the Son of man's place: only He who is Ancient of days is so seen as to make us understand that it was one who had that place -- was Son of man.<a name=376:18></a> Subsequently,

		in the Apocalypse, it is not His intrinsic personal character, but some relative character or place He takes.<a name=377:1></a> Only we have something analogous to this, when the account of future things comes in.<a name=377:2></a> As regards the world, He is seen as the Lamb, one whom the world has rejected, but who has redemption right over it.<a name=377:3></a> There He is seen with the seven horns and seven eyes -- His power over the world, as with the seven stars here as Son of man.<a name=377:4></a> These are the things John had seen.<a name=377:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now pass to "the things that are".<a name=377:6></a> The stars are in Christ's hand; He speaks of them first; He walks in the midst of the assemblies.<a name=377:7></a> The latter are light-bearers, the assemblies or assembly as set in a given position, and viewed as such before God; not what the people became, but what the assembly is in His sight; just as Israel was His people whatever the Israelites became.<a name=377:8></a> The stars are that which is held by Christ to give light and have authority, what He holds responsible to this end before Him.<a name=377:9></a> It is, in a certain sense, all composing the assembly therefore, and so it is often said in the addresses to the assemblies; but more especially those who stand in responsibility through their connection with Himself, the stars in His hand.<a name=377:10></a> They should shine, and influence, and represent Him, each in its place during the night.<a name=377:11></a> That the clergy gradually took this place, and in this sense are responsible in it, is quite true; but that is their affair to answer for themselves before the Lord.<a name=377:12></a> The Spirit does not so take it here.<a name=377:13></a> They assume it as honour; they have it as responsibility.<a name=377:14></a> If ever they were called "angels", it was evidently just this assumption, and taken from this place.<a name=377:15></a> Again, it cannot be doubted that leaders, elders, or others, were in a special place of responsibility, supposing them to be rightly such.<a name=377:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>they are so treated; but the Spirit does not so own them here.<a name=377:17></a> Christ does not address Himself to elders, nor to the modern notion of a bishop, which did not indeed exist then.<a name=377:18></a> Nor is a diocese(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:377">footnote</a></i>) thought of in these addresses.<a name=377:19></a> You have not the authorities (elders) spoken of in scripture, of which there were always several; and this passage of scripture cannot be applied to human arrangements as now existing.<a name=377:20></a>

		The star is the symbol, and it is here seen in Christ's hand.<a name=378:1></a> It is (as angel is always used where it is not actually a heavenly or earthly messenger) the mystical representative of one not actually seen.<a name=378:2></a> It is so used of Jehovah, so used of a child, so spoken of Peter.<a name=378:3></a> Elders may have practically been specially responsible from their position; but the angel represents the assembly, and especially those to whom, from nearness to Christ and communion with Him, or responsibility for it through the operation of His Spirit in them for His service, He looks for the state of His assembly in His sight.<a name=378:4></a> No doubt the whole assembly is responsible, and therefore the candlestick is removed when unfaithfulness is brought home to it; but Christ is in immediate communication with these in respect of it -- a solemn thought for all who have the good of the assembly at heart.<a name=378:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way in which the angels and the assemblies are identified, and any distinction in the degree or manner of it, requires a little more detailed attention.<a name=378:6></a> That the assemblies are addressed in their general responsibility, in the addresses to the angels, is evident.<a name=378:7></a> For it is said, "What the Spirit saith to the churches".<a name=378:8></a> It is not a private communication to an authority for his direction, as to a Titus or a Timothy, but said to the assemblies; that is, the angel represents their responsibility.<a name=378:9></a> So we find distinct parts of them noticed.<a name=378:10></a> "The devil shall cast some of you into prison"; "fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer": "but I have a few things against thee, that thou hast there": "My faithful martyr who was slain among you": "But unto you I say, the rest in Thyatira" (so it is to be read).<a name=378:11></a> Yet the angel and assembly or candlestick are distinguished: "I will remove thy candlestick out of its place".<a name=378:12></a> "Thou sufferest that woman Jezebel".<a name=378:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this separation between the angel and the assembly does not take place in the last three assemblies.<a name=378:14></a> The angel is addressed throughout.<a name=378:15></a> As to them too it is only said, Christ has the seven stars, not that He holds them in His right hand.<a name=378:16></a> In Smyrna and Philadelphia there is no judgment; they were tried, as faithful, and encouraged.<a name=378:17></a> As to judgments, or rather warning threats: -- in the case of Ephesus, which presents the general fact of the assembly's first decline, the warning is given that the candlestick would be taken away unless they repented: that the assembly did not, we know from scripture and fact, and these assemblies looked at as a successive history.<a name=378:18></a> In

		Pergamos and Thyatira the offenders are those specifically judged; in the case of Thyatira fearful judgments on Jezebel and those connected with her: she had had time to repent and did not; but here the change of everything is looked for at the Lord's coming.<a name=379:1></a> All this shews the angels to be the representatives of the assemblies, but morally such; Christ's warning to be addressed to them (as we can easily understand to be the case in any who had the interest of the assembly at heart), whom Christ trusted with this; but to be so far identified with the assemblies that it concerned all who composed them, while particular judgments were denounced on guilty parties.<a name=379:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may now enter on the series of particular assemblies; but briefly, in connection with the whole structure of the book, rather than entering into the instructive details, which I have done elsewhere in a series of lectures.<a name=379:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great fact is, that the assembly in this world is subject to judgment, and to have its whole existence and place before God as light-bearer in the world set aside; secondly that God will do this if it departs from its first spiritual energy.<a name=379:4></a> This is an immense principle.<a name=379:5></a> He has set the assembly to be a true witness of what He has manifested in Jesus; of what He is when Jesus is gone on high.<a name=379:6></a> If it be not this, it is a false witness, and it will be set aside.<a name=379:7></a> God may have patience, and has blessedly so.<a name=379:8></a> He may propose to her to return to her first love, and does; but, if this do not take place, the candlestick is removed, the assembly ceases to be God's light-bearer in the world.<a name=379:9></a> The first estate must be maintained, or God's glory and the truth are falsified; and the creature must be set aside.<a name=379:10></a> But no mere unsustained creature does this, none as such.<a name=379:11></a> Hence all fails and is judged, save as in, or upheld by, the Son of God, the second Man.<a name=379:12></a> Ephesus had gone on well in maintaining consistency, but that forgetfulness of self and thinking only of Christ, which are the firstfruits of grace, were gone.<a name=379:13></a> As heretofore remarked, there were works of labour and patience; but the faith, hope, and love had in their true energy disappeared.<a name=379:14></a> They had rejected the pretension of false teachers, and laboured and not fainted.<a name=379:15></a> All that can be said of them is said to shew Christ's love, and that He is not forgetful of them, or of the good manifested in them.<a name=379:16></a> Still they had left their first love; and this unless repented of and the first works done, involved the taking away of the candlestick.<a name=379:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=380>[Page 380]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another important principle is found here, that when the assembly had departed from faithfulness, when collectively it had ceased to be the expression of the love in which God has visited the world, God throws back individuals on the word of God for themselves: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches".<a name=380:1></a> The assembly is judged, and thus cannot be the security for faith; the individual is called to hear what the Spirit says.<a name=380:2></a> The warning of taking away the candlestick here is specially worthy of notice, because there was a great deal the Lord highly approved of -- encouraged them by shewing He did; but, for all that, if first love was departed from, the candlestick would be removed.<a name=380:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of Christ and promises are general, as the assembly is characteristic of the whole principle on which the assembly stands.<a name=380:4></a> Christ has the stars in His right hand and walks amidst the candlesticks.<a name=380:5></a> It is not a special character applicable to a special state, but the whole bearing of His position in the midst of the assemblies.<a name=380:6></a> The assembly, viewed as having left its first love, is never promised anything.<a name=380:7></a> It cannot direct a believer when it comes under reproof and judgment itself.<a name=380:8></a> The promise is then to the individual overcomer: a very important principle.<a name=380:9></a> The promise given to him that overcomes is the general one -- is the contrast to Adam's ruin, but in a higher and better way than that in which he enjoyed the good which he lost.<a name=380:10></a> He that overcomes shall eat of the tree of life.<a name=380:11></a> But this is not the tree of life in man's paradise in this world, but the paradise of God Himself.<a name=380:12></a> We must remark, too, that it is not as the first Adam now, individually keeping one's first estate, but overcoming.<a name=380:13></a> And what is before us to overcome in is, not only the world and its hostilities (though that may be), but within the sphere of the assembly itself.<a name=380:14></a> It is the call to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies which gives occasion to the speaking of overcoming.<a name=380:15></a> This, in respect of the claim of the assembly to be heard, is an immensely important truth.<a name=380:16></a> The message is addressed to the assembly, not by it to individuals, and she is warned of her delinquency, and the individual saint is called to overcome.<a name=380:17></a>

		The word to Smyrna is short.<a name=380:18></a> Whatever the malice and power of Satan, at the utmost, if permitted, he has but the power of death.<a name=380:19></a> Christ is First and Last, beyond as before death, God Himself; but more than that, has met and gone through its power.<a name=380:20></a> The saints were not to fear.<a name=380:21></a> Satan would work,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now need a closer judgment.<a name=381:10></a> Christ appears as the One having the two-edged sword of the word proceeding out of His mouth.<a name=381:11></a> It will be remarked here, that, in Smyrna and Pergamos, a special character of Christ applies to a special state.<a name=381:12></a> There is no general result for the assembly.<a name=381:13></a> In Ephesus we have Christ's position as Judge in the midst of the candlesticks, and the assembly threatened with removal from its place of witness upon earth.<a name=381:14></a> In Thyatira He takes His place as Son of God, Son over His own house, and, as things are (as to the assembly) got to the worst, is revealed in all-piercing and immutable judgment, and the whole blessing of the new state is promised to the overcomer.<a name=381:15></a> In Pergamos we have faithfulness found in its previous path, Christ's name and faith held fast in spite of persecution.<a name=381:16></a> It differs from Philadelphia, that His word is not said to be held fast as that of Christ's patience (that the assembly, in its Pergamos state, did not do), but it did hold fast the confession of Christ in the midst of persecution.<a name=381:17></a> But another kind of evil came in -- seduction to fall in with the world's ways by evil teaching within.<a name=381:18></a> The doctrine of Balaam was there.<a name=381:19></a> Idolatry flowed in.<a name=381:20></a> There were also sects within, which taught pretended sanctity but evil practice.<a name=381:21></a> These the Lord would judge.<a name=381:22></a>

		The assembly of Philadelphia has a peculiarly interesting character.<a name=384:5></a> Nothing is said of its works, but that Christ knows them But what is interesting in it is that it is peculiarly associated with Christ Himself.<a name=384:6></a> Christ, as in all these last assemblies, is not seen in the characters in which He walked in the midst of the assemblies, but in such as faith peculiarly recognises when ecclesiastical organisation has become the hot-bed of corruption.<a name=384:7></a> Here it is His personal character, what He is intrinsically, holy and true, what the word displays and requires, and what the word of God is in itself -- moral character and faithfulness.<a name=384:8></a> Indeed this last word includes all faithfulness to God within and without, according to what is revealed, and faithful to make good all He has declared.<a name=384:9></a>

		Christ is known as the Holy One.<a name=384:10></a> Then outward ecclesiastical associations or pretensions will not do.<a name=384:11></a> There must be what suits His nature, and faithful consistency with that word which He will certainly make good.<a name=384:12></a> With this He has the administration; and opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens.<a name=384:13></a> See what His path was on earth: only then graciously dependent, as we are.<a name=384:14></a> He was holy and true, to man's view had a little strength, kept the word, lived by every word that proceeded out of God's lips, waited patiently for the Lord, and to Him the porter opened.<a name=384:15></a> He lived in the last days of a dispensation, the holy and true One, rejected, and, to human eye, failing in success with those who said they were Jews, but were the synagogue of Satan.<a name=384:16></a> So the saints here: they walk in a place like His; they keep His word, have a little strength, are not marked by a Pauline energy of the Spirit, but do not deny His name.<a name=384:17></a> This is the character and motive of all their conduct.<a name=384:18></a> It is openly confessed, the word kept, the name not denied.<a name=384:19></a> It seems little; but in universal decline, much pretension and ecclesiastical claim, and many falling away to man's reasonings, keeping the word of Him that is holy and true, and not denying His name is everything.<a name=384:20></a>

		But as regards the former substantive qualities, keeping the word, and not denying Christ's name (though with a little strength) in presence of ecclesiastical pretension to a successional God-established religion, promises were given.<a name=385:3></a> Christ would force these pretentious claimants to divine succession to come and own that He had loved those who kept His word.<a name=385:4></a> An open door was given at present, and no man could shut it; just as the porter had opened to Him, so that scribes and Pharisees and priests could not hinder it.<a name=385:5></a> In the future they would have to own themselves humbled, and that those who followed the word of the holy and true One were those He had loved.<a name=385:6></a> Meanwhile His approbation was sufficient.<a name=385:7></a> This was the test of faith -- to be satisfied with His approbation, content with the authority of His word.<a name=385:8></a>

		Here the angels come in to praise, not in the fourth chapter.<a name=393:3></a> I can hardly doubt that a change in administrative order takes place here.<a name=393:4></a> Until the Lamb took the book, they were the administrative power; they were the instruments through which what the four living creatures symbolised was exercised in the earth.<a name=393:5></a> "But unto the angels hath he not put into subjection the world to come, whereof we speak".<a name=393:6></a> Hence, as soon as the Lamb appears and takes the book, as soon as the idea of redemption is brought in, the living creatures and elders are brought together, and the angels take their own place apart.<a name=393:7></a> Like the living creatures before, they give no reason for their praise.<a name=393:8></a> As the heads of creation as to their nature, they celebrate with all creatures the title to glory of the Lamb and His own worthiness, ascribing praise to Him that sits on the throne and to the Lamb for ever and ever.<a name=393:9></a> The four living creatures, that is, all the exercise of God's power in creation and providence, join their Amen, and the elders worship God in the excellency of His being.<a name=393:10></a> But the living creatures and elders are joined (verse 8) in falling down before the Lamb.<a name=393:11></a> I do not think they are meant to be distinguished in the latter part of the verse,(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:393">footnote</a></i>) but merge in the elders, symbolising different service but not now two classes.<a name=393:12></a> Verse 9 is the general fact; not "they sung", but "they sing".<a name=393:13></a> This takes place in heaven; but those named are in the mind in a general way.<a name=393:14></a> Thus the source of what follows, the throne, and the persons engaged in heaven before God in all that passes, are displayed: whence the judgment flows, who surround the throne of God above, and who is in it, have been brought before us; the heavenly scene, and choir, and assistants.<a name=393:15></a>

		Chapter 12 gives us a brief but all-important summary of the whole course of events, viewed, not in their instruments on earth or the judgment of these, but the divine view of all the principles at work, the state of things as revealed of God.<a name=402:3></a> The first symbolical person, subject of the prophecy and result of all God's ways in it, is a woman clothed with the sun, having a crown of twelve stars, and the moon under her feet.<a name=402:4></a> It is Israel, or Jerusalem as its centre, as in the purpose of God (compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>, and <a href="../bible/Chronicles.htm#87:6">Chronicles  87:6</a>).<a name=402:5></a> She is clothed with supreme authority, invested with the glory of perfect administration in man, and all the original reflected glory of this under the old covenant, under her feet.<a name=402:6></a> She was travailing in childbirth, distressed, and in pain to be delivered: on the other hand Satan's power in the form of the Roman Empire, complete in forms of power, seven heads, but incomplete in administrative supremacy -- ten, not twelve horns.<a name=402:7></a> But Satan, as the open infidel enemy of God and God's power in Christ, sought to devour the child as soon as born, who was to have the rule of the earth from God.<a name=402:8></a> But the child, Christ, and the assembly with Christ, is caught away to God and His throne -- does not receive the power yet, but is placed in the very source of it from which it flows.<a name=402:9></a> It is not the rapture as regards joy; for it goes back to Christ Himself but the placing Him and the assembly in and with Him, in the seat from which power flows for the establishment of the kingdom.<a name=402:10></a> There is no time for this: Christ and the assembly are all one.<a name=402:11></a> But the woman -- the Jews, after this fly into the wilderness, where God has prepared a place for them, for the half-week.<a name=402:12></a>

		But, to follow up the latter part of the chapter, a loud voice proclaims in heaven that the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ is come -- the testimony still of the second Psalm; only as yet it was only proclaimed from heaven, where the power of the kingdom was already made good by the casting down of Satan.<a name=403:6></a> Satan's anti-priestly power was over for ever; king and prophet he might yet put on; but his heavenly place was past.<a name=403:7></a> The saints of the heavenlies had overcome him by that which made their conscience and their title to heaven good -- the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their mouth, God's sword by the Spirit -- and gave up their lives to the death.<a name=403:8></a> The heavens and the dwellers there could now rejoice; but it was woe to the inhabiters of earth and sea; for the devil had come down, knowing he had but a little time left.<a name=403:9></a> I think verse 11 implies that there ate saints killed after the rapture, who yet belong to heaven.<a name=403:10></a> If there were such killed because of their faithfulness, were they not taken up, they would lose earth and heaven, though more devoted than those who had earth.<a name=403:11></a> We see them moreover in chapter 20 in the first resurrection.<a name=403:12></a> The souls under the altar also had to wait for others -- their brethren who had to be killed, as they were; and we are to note here that those celebrated as happy are the slain ones, none others.<a name=403:13></a> Yet it is before the last three years and a half.<a name=403:14></a>

		In chapter 13 we have the clear and full development of Satan's instruments of evil.<a name=404:8></a> They are two -- the ten-horned and the two-horned beasts.<a name=404:9></a> To the first the dragon, who swept with his tail a third part of the stars to earth, Satan under the form of the Roman Empire, gave his throne and much authority.<a name=404:10></a>(<i>see <a href="jnd_footnotes.htm#47:404">footnote</a></i>) The second not only wielded the first power administratively before him, but was the active power of evil to lead men to recognise the first, and therein the dragon.<a name=404:11></a> The beast is the original Roman Empire, but largely modified and in a new character.<a name=404:12></a> It has perfect completeness in its forms of government or heads, but is composed of ten kingdoms, indicating also, I doubt not, imperfect administrative completeness.<a name=404:13></a> It has not twelve horns; it is incomplete.<a name=404:14></a> Seven would be completeness of a higher kind.<a name=404:15></a> The Lamb had seven horns; the woman, twelve stars on her head.<a name=404:16></a> One is perfectness in

		As regards those who dwelt on earth (for the division was not merely a spiritual one now), all worshipped the beast, save the elect -- those who had been written from the foundation of the world in the Lamb's book of life.<a name=405:18></a> Human resistance by force was not the path of obedience.<a name=405:19></a> Here the patience and faith of the saints were shewn.<a name=405:20></a> He who took the sword would perish by it; it is never Christ's way, but unresisting patience; but the beast who did would perish.<a name=405:21></a> This then was the imperial power, a blasphemous power set up by Satan, with the place of the old Roman Empire, which represented all four, modified in form, but the imperial head restored.<a name=405:22></a>

		The angel declares the truth of these things, and that the Lord God of the prophets -- not as the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, nor as directly teaching the assembly as dwelling in it by the Spirit -- the Lord God of the prophets has sent His angel to inform His servants of these events.<a name=424:2></a> "Behold", says Christ, speaking as of old, in the prophetic spirit, rising up to His now personal testimony, "Behold, I come quickly.<a name=424:3></a> Blessed is he who keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book".<a name=424:4></a> The assembly is viewed, not as the subject of prophecy, but as "the things that are", time not being counted, specially time to come.<a name=424:5></a> Those that keep it are those concerned in the book, who are warned that Christ will soon be there.<a name=424:6></a> No doubt we all can profit by it, but we are not in the scenes it speaks of.<a name=424:7></a> John, impressed with the dignity of the messenger, fell down and would have worshipped him.<a name=424:8></a> But the saints of the assembly, even if made prophets of, were not to return into the uncertainty of ancient days.<a name=424:9></a> The angel was a simple angel, John's fellow-servant, and fellow-servant of his brethren the prophets: he was to worship God.<a name=424:10></a> Nor were the sayings to be sealed, as with Daniel: the time was at hand.<a name=424:11></a> When it closed its testimony, men would remain in the same state for judgment or blessing.<a name=424:12></a> And Christ would quickly come, and every man receive as his work was.<a name=424:13></a> Verse 7 was a warning, in form of blessing, to those in the circumstances referred to, to keep the sayings of the book, but this verse 12 is the record of Christ's coming to the general judgment of the quick.<a name=424:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, Christ announces Himself, having taken up the word in Person in verse 12, as Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end -- God before and after all; and filling duration.<a name=424:15></a> I suppose we are to take as the true reading: "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city".<a name=424:16></a> The redeemed, cleansed ones, can enter there and feed on the tree of life; for I suppose it is the fruit here.<a name=424:17></a> Without are the unclean and violent, and those who love satanic falsehood and idolatry, sin against purity, against their neighbour, against God, and follow Satan.<a name=424:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus "the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=425:9></a> It is not a warning from one coming as a judge and a rewarder, but the revelation of Himself which awakens the desire of the bride according to the relationship in which grace has set her.<a name=425:10></a> Nor is it a mere sentiment or wish: the Spirit who dwells in the assembly leads and suggests her thought.<a name=425:11></a> But the Spirit turns also, and the heart of him who enjoys the relationship, to others.<a name=425:12></a> "Let him that heareth" -- let him who hears the voice of the Spirit in the assembly -- join in the cry, and say, Come.<a name=425:13></a> It is one common hope, it should be our common desire; and the sense of what is coming on the earth, and the sense of failure in things that are, ought only, though it be in truth an inferior motive, to urge the cry in all.<a name=425:14></a> But while still here, the saint has another place also.<a name=425:15></a> Not only do his desires go after God upwards and the heavenly Bridegroom, but he reflects God's known character, by having His nature and Spirit as manifested also in Christ's love, and in possession of the living water, though not of the Bridegroom.<a name=425:16></a> He turns round and invites others, "Let him that is athirst come", and proclaims it forth then to the world, "Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely".<a name=425:17></a> Thus the whole place of the heavenly saint, conscious of the assembly's place, is brought out in this verse, from his desire of Christ's coming, to his call to whosoever will to come.<a name=425:18></a>

		The first, at the opening of the whole book, gives the individual conscious blessing through what Christ has done; the latter, the whole position of the assembly, thus distinguishing clearly the saints under the gospel from those whose circumstances are prophetically made known to them in this book.<a name=426:5></a> "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and made us kings and priests to God and his Father".<a name=426:6></a> As soon as Christ is named (and it is so in both cases), it awakens in the saints the consciousness of Christ's love and their own place in relationship with Him.<a name=426:7></a> They are already washed from their sins in His own blood, and made kings and priests to God and His Father -- have their place and state fixed, before any of the prophetic part is developed, and in the coming kingdom will enjoy that place, not of being blessed under Christ, but of being associated with Him.<a name=426:8></a> Here they have their place simply in the kingdom and priesthood; it is individual title resulting from His first coming.<a name=426:9></a> They are loved, washed in His own blood, and associated with Him in the kingdom.<a name=426:10></a>
