		Every correction of scripture is of moment.<a name=1:1></a> I beg to suggest one, the occasion for which it appears to me exceedingly mars the sense.<a name=1:2></a> I refer to the expression "It pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell.<a name=1:3></a>" The English reader may see upon the face of it, that the word "Father" is put in by our translators.<a name=1:4></a> This is extremely bad theology, depriving us of the development of glory in the Person of our most blessed Lord.<a name=1:5></a> "All the fulness was pleased to dwell in him.<a name=1:6></a>" In its present reading it is merely the pleasure of the Father about the Son, which I apprehend to be a mischievous derogation from the divine glory of the Son, to deprive us of the revelation of that in which to me Christianity consists -- a revelation of the Trinity known in the relationship in which we are brought by faith to it.<a name=1:7></a> In the second chapter we have the fact, "All the fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily;" that is, in the incarnation of the Son.<a name=1:8></a> While He was the Son in personal union with flesh as Jesus, there could be no separation of the Son from the Father or the Spirit, though most distinct in their relationship.<a name=1:9></a> Therefore the Lord says, though He wrought Himself the miracles, "The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works"; and again, "If I cast out devils, by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.<a name=1:10></a>" That He was the Son, however, is the direct object of faith, but revealing the Father; and therefore "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.<a name=1:11></a>" In a word, the fulness of the Godhead (as is declared by the Spirit concerning Him) "dwelt in him bodily.<a name=1:12></a>" These things may be difficult as to human explanation, but not as to communion, where the Spirit of God is; for He reveals in communion, according to the power of truth, and no way else.<a name=1:13></a> And I believe that, while the human intellect will break itself to pieces against the glory of the divine revelation, the fulness of our joy and hope, and the soundness of our Christianity, and, consequently christian strength and energy, chiefly depends upon the distinctness with which we are cognizant of the unity and trinity, withal made known to us in the Incarnation, which is the revelation of it.<a name=1:14></a> "God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble.<a name=1:15></a>" I believe it to be a revelation, and known, where only it can be known, in communion, by those made partakers of the Spirit by faith in Christ Jesus: all else will stumble somewhere, and these too, if they be not humble.<a name=1:16></a>

		ON HAGGAI 2: 5-9¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>To the Editor of The Investigator</i>.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sir, <p>I do not pretend to an adequate knowledge of Hebrew for a criticism dependent on the language.<a name=2:2></a> It appears to me, however, that interpreters have hindered their apprehension of the general force of the passage in Haggai, by confining themselves to the English translation, valuable as it may generally be.<a name=2:3></a> The passage does not apparently contemplate <i>two houses</i> at all, but negatives the idea very carefully.<a name=2:4></a> The spirit of the prophecy is contained in this: "According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my Spirit <i>remaineth</i> among you: fear ye not.<a name=2:5></a>" The fact of two houses of course was before them; so it has been before us.<a name=2:6></a> God in the exercise of His love obliterates this idea (which we have rekindled), and will allow only of a different state of the same house, and that was one of far greater glory.<a name=2:7></a> "Who is left among you that saw <i>this house</i> (vioch ibixvodo heuh tenbiyt) <i>in its former glory</i>?<a name=2:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord says (after the verse above quoted, stating His continuance with them), "Thus saith Jehovah; Yet it is a little while," etc.<a name=2:9></a>, and He will shake all that whose apparent stability has been against the people of His love, and "I will fill this house with glory: great shall be the glory of <i>this house</i>, the latter than the former": or, simply, "the latter glory of this house [looked at in its unity] shall be greater than the former.<a name=2:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such seems the idea and the construction of the passage.<a name=2:11></a> I find the Septuagint follows it.<a name=2:12></a> The thought of God's mind seems to run through this construction, and to be borne upon the plain terms of the passage itself, and to be fully given by it only.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the other part of the passage I confess the difficulty.<a name=2:14></a> But it is clear to me, that it is much more abstract in intention than is generally supposed.<a name=2:15></a> It is not Christ shall become the desire of the Jews, nor merely the gold and silver after which the nations of the world should seek; but that that on which the heart of the Gentiles would be set should be not among

		SCRIPTURAL CRITICISMS 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Sir, <p>I would renew my purpose to take notice of any passages in which it would appear to me more light might be thrown on the word, as read in English; which I conceive would be a valuable thing to many interested in the study of the scriptures.<a name=4:1></a> Often on an isolated expression much chain of argument depends; and again, a single expression often contains a head of argument which clears and satisfies the mind as to its bearings.<a name=4:2></a> I do not attach any extraordinary importance to the observations; only I feel that whatever clears scripture to the ordinary reader is of importance -- I will add, of importance to God in His lovingkindness to us.<a name=4:3></a> I will, trusting to the Lord's guidance, advert to one or two passages in the epistle to the Romans.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, Romans 1: 18: "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.<a name=4:5></a>" It appears to me, that the ordinary punctuation here mars the sense.<a name=4:6></a> Its force I apprehend is this, "all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men that hold the truth in unrighteousness"; and this is a most important distinction, for it brings in the whole Gentile world guilty; as the apostle afterwards proves.<a name=4:7></a> God having been revealed in Christ, wrath is revealed against all ungodliness without exception, because it is such, and as ungodliness, asebeian.<a name=4:8></a> Your Greek readers will remember that worshipping Gentiles are called by the opposite word to this, that is, sebomenous, or "devout.<a name=4:9></a>" Hence we have two great classes -- ungodliness universal; and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness .<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add another remarkably beautiful circumstance of the most accurate word of God in this passage: wrath is not revealed in Him.<a name=4:11></a> In Him, or therein, the righteousness of God is revealed; but there is no "therein" or "in him," when the wrath is spoken of.<a name=4:12></a> It is universally revealed.<a name=4:13></a> What we have revealed in Christ is, "that he died for the ungodly" (the same word), and of God, that in and by the gospel He justifies the ungodly.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another expression which often puzzles the reader, which seems to me very plain by attention to the use of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		words of the original -- "revealed from faith to faith"; ek pisteos eis pistin.<a name=5:1></a> Now I believe that ek (the word here translated "from") always, when thus used with an abstract word, means the character, or order, or manner, of the thing which is spoken of.<a name=5:2></a> Thus salvation is ek pisteos here, "from faith," as we should say, "faithwise" (a form retained in many common words).<a name=5:3></a> This is its manner, order, the dispensation according to which salvation comes.<a name=5:4></a> The literal meaning is its source, "out of," which very readily in an abstract word is used in the sense of its order or dispensation.<a name=5:5></a> Even in English the expression is not unusual; for example, "It is out of kindness he does it," as we might in a similar sense add, "not through severity.<a name=5:6></a>" Now I believe this to be the uniform sense of the preposition ek used abstractedly, or in its moral sense, and hence also especially when it is used without the definite article in Greek following it.<a name=5:7></a> Applying this to this sentence, of which I will give further instances explanatory of passages in this book, "The righteousness of God is revealed from faith"; that is, according to the principle of faith, or a dispensation of faith, in this order or manner -- "to faith," therefore, which is the recipient power consequently in man.<a name=5:8></a> The statement is a most perfect abstract of the character of the dispensation: a revelation; the subject of that, "the righteousness of God"; the character of the dispensation by which it is revealed, ek pisteos, and, consequently, that to which it is so revealed, "faith.<a name=5:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following may be taken as instances: akrobustia ek phuseos, "uncircumcision by nature"; and in Romans 2: 29 we have an instance of the remark as to the leaving out of the article, epainos ex anthropon, that is, "human praise"; that is, the character of their praise: expressions, in this instance, adequately represented by the English of them.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, chapter 3: 20, dioti ex ergon nomou, "by the works of the law," that is, in this way.<a name=5:11></a> And hence we have the plain sense of another passage in this book, which has perplexed English readers: "justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith"; ek pisteos.<a name=5:12></a>.<a name=5:13></a>.<a name=5:14></a> dia tes pisteos .<a name=5:15></a> The circumcision had been seeking justification, but they had been seeking it ex ergon nomou, in that way, the wrong way -- by works of law.<a name=5:16></a> God would now justify them, not in that way but in another way, that is, ek pisteos, "by faith," according to that principle or dispensation.<a name=5:17></a> But, inasmuch as it was upon this principle, the same God would justify, must
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		justify, him who had the principle; and therefore a Gentile who had this faith (God's gift) would be justified through or by it, dia tes pisteos.<a name=6:1></a> The former being the principle of the dispensation, which involved justification, when the thing existed, the person who had it was justified necessarily upon this principle; and therefore by the same God the believing Gentile was necessarily admitted.<a name=6:2></a> It was therefore eis upakoen pisteos, for the obedience of faith to all nations for His (Christ's) name, the object and subject matter of faith, in whom the Lord requiring the obedience was revealed.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in chapter 4: 2, ex ergon edikaiothe, justified by works, that is, in that way.<a name=6:4></a> So oi ek peritomes -- oi ek nomou -- ex eritheias.<a name=6:5></a> I have given instances sufficient, I believe, to explain what I mean; were I to adduce all the proofs, I should quote every place where ek is used without the article.<a name=6:6></a> I would only remark, sir, that it is not a hasty observation, though of course liable to correction, for I have held it in the use of scriptures these nine years, but had not the opportunity of your journal to express it thus.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have alluded to the use of the article or its omission; and it seems to me a most important point in the use of the Greek Testament.<a name=6:8></a> My observation has led me (and in these things we are as dependent on the Lord's guidance, and as much debtors to His mercy as in any thing) to this conclusion that, whenever the article is used, it denotes <i>a</i> or <i>the</i> substantive object of the sentence; and where it is not used, the word is always characteristic; and that this rule holds good in all circumstances, though more difficult of discovery, to a mind not accustomed to abstract, in some cases than in others.<a name=6:9></a> Granville Sharp and Bishop Middleton have elaborately treated the article, and with great value in many respects; but I believe the above simple rule involves the true decision of every case.<a name=6:10></a> Bishop Middleton makes all prepositions an exception; I believe them none.<a name=6:11></a> The principle is recognized distinctly in a formal proposition: that is, the subject has, the predicate has not the article; so much so, that if it has, the proposition becomes what is called reciprocal: that is, the terms are so identical in extent, that either could be affirmed of the other.<a name=6:12></a> I would note, before I pass on, an instance of this, the mistranslation of which I believe to have been a cause of as much error in the Church as any one thing: e amartia estin e anomia, "sin is the transgression of the law.<a name=6:13></a>" The apostle states no such thing.<a name=6:14></a> Sin is lawlessness; or lawlessness,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that is insubordination, is sin.<a name=7:1></a> Disobedience is sin.<a name=7:2></a> This may be proved in breaking the law in a given instance: that is, transgression of the law is sin; but sin is not the transgression of the law, for, achri gar nomou amartia en en kosmo.<a name=7:3></a> Yet I suppose upon this false translation half the formal judgment of the Church upon what sin is has been founded; but it is not my business to reason upon this here.<a name=7:4></a> It is exceedingly interesting from its connection with 2 Thessalonians 2: 3, 7, 8, where we have the man tes amartias of sin; and then the mystery tes anomias of iniquity (the two terms of the reciprocal proposition above), concluding with o anomos the wicked one; and I believe it to assist much in the solution or understanding of that passage.<a name=7:5></a> I believe there is a much higher characteristic of sin than the breach of a commandment -- the spirit of disobedience.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rule destroys the folly of many Socinian comments, easily else destroyed, such as Wakefield's and the like.<a name=7:7></a> "In the beginning was the word," etc.<a name=7:8></a>; kai Theos en logos.<a name=7:9></a> Theos here is the predicate of logos, and if it had had the article, it would have proved that there was nought else at all God but the Word -- that the extent of Godhead was equivalent to o logos.<a name=7:10></a> It has nothing whatever to do with any emphatic sense of Theos, a sense which I believe Theos never can be proved to have.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take another illustrative instance; Romans 1: 21: dioti gnontes ton Theon, ouch os Theon edoxasan -- not clearly as a subordinate God: the apostle's argument is directly the other way.<a name=7:12></a> But when they knew God, the Person, the one God, the object of reverence, they glorified Him not in that character.<a name=7:13></a> Had the other notion been right or in any instance true, this passage would have no force, unless it were os ton Theon.<a name=7:14></a> I believe then, in every instance where the article is omitted, the noun is characteristic, adjectival in its character; where inserted, it presents the substantive object of thought.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The observations of Granville Sharp quite fall in with this, but are only an instance of it.<a name=7:16></a> Thus in ton monon despoten Theon kai Kurion emon Iesoun Christon, the ton belongs to Iesoun Christon -- all the rest is characteristic of Jesus Christ, "the only [master] God and our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=7:17></a>" The rule has been drawn of old from the reading of the New Testament.<a name=7:18></a> If any student of it would take the first seven verses of the epistle to the Romans -- a book in which the observation has peculiar value from the character of the reasoning -- I think he will find the light it throws on the subject, and be recompensed
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		through the whole of the rest of scripture for his trouble.<a name=8:1></a> I am aware it may be found to militate against many reasonings of individuals, with whose results at the same time I may fully agree.<a name=8:2></a> I have no doubt myself of its universal applicability and use.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The undoubted truth of it in the case of a preposition is a strong argument for the truth of the principle.<a name=8:4></a> To take a single example, Romans 1: 3, peri tou uiou autou, this is the substantive object of that sentence.<a name=8:5></a> In the next, His identification as Jesus (whom we have known as man) is so.<a name=8:6></a> Hence we have tou, that is, Iesous Christou tou Kuriou emon -- orithentos uiou Theou en dunamei, that is <i>what</i> He is.<a name=8:7></a> Again, ex anastaseos nekron.<a name=8:8></a> Now this might perhaps, with almost equal (I do not say equal) force, be dia tes, though it would then be autou; but it states here the manner of the determination, not the fact by which it is declared, therefore it is simply ex anastaseos nekron.<a name=8:9></a> So in English we might say "by resurrection," or again, "by the resurrection"; both would be true, their force would be different.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The application of this rule is of most extensive, and consequently immense importance, remembering it is applicable to scripture.<a name=8:11></a> I have myself no doubt of its universal truth, but I should feel obliged by any of your correspondents suggesting any passage, if there be any, which falsifies it.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One instance destroys a principle, not a human custom; where there is only one distinct act, the insertion or omission makes no difference in sense, only in force; and hence some apparent difficulty, which for this reason alone I notice.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in an instance I take casually, pollakis pathein apo kataboles kosmou nun de apax epi sunteleia ton ainon.<a name=8:14></a> (Hebrews 9: 26.<a name=8:15></a>) The point was His often suffering; the other was a necessary, not the substantive part of the sentence.<a name=8:16></a> On the matter it would have been equally true apo tes kataboles tou kosmou, but the sentence would not have carried the same quantity of moral truth.<a name=8:17></a> It gives the characteristic of the period, not the period itself.<a name=8:18></a> As in vulgar English, often more pregnant with force than what is accounted refined grammatical language, we say "in kingdom come," it would be much less expressive to say, which is all I am now concerned in, "the kingdom to come"; it would state the same fact, but would not in the same way apply the character of it to the subject of conversation.<a name=8:19></a> So again, epi sunteleia.<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here again the whole force of it arose from this being one of the characteristics of the suffering (indeed that suffering had an essential characteristic from it); whereas if it had been put merely aionon it would have lost much of its force; for there were specific ages, the closing of which as definite things constituted the object which characterized the appearing of the Lord.<a name=9:1></a> Thus we shall find the apparent difficulty highly illustrative of the principle.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe many an effort at a various reading has arisen from a want of understanding of the sense, and I confess that learned criticisms have often proved to me children playing with toys.<a name=9:3></a> I do not despise their value in their place; but no one unspiritual, no one untaught of God, is fit to be a judge (he may be a servant) in the interpretation of the divine word.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would instance in this Bishops Horsley and Lowth, because of their eminence; men, masters in criticism confessedly, and to be used as such it may be; but in interpretation founded on it by using it alone by intellect, the well taught reader of a mere English Bible would be more to be trusted in all the sense of the scripture writers than they are.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am well aware of the opinion which would be formed of such an assertion, but I do not make it lightly; and while I would be thankful for their service, as for a grammar or a dictionary, or for their intellect as God's gift, judgment and deference to it I believe to be so far ruin to the Church.<a name=9:6></a> I do not say they were in nothing taught of the Spirit: so far as they were, they will be blessed; so far as not, they will be confusion and bad guides to others, so that both would fall into the ditch.<a name=9:7></a> I am quite willing, and desire, any remark I make to be subject to the same rule; I need not say that as mere grammatical critics, though not bound by them, I should be content to learn from them, or those far indeed below them.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add another passage of which the mistranslation is apparent, and its application mischievous in the study of the divine mind.<a name=9:9></a> It is one of the very few passages in the wonderful, though human, translation we have of the New Testament, in which I confess I believe the translators judged of the translation from the sense, which I am perfectly satisfied they, if it be so, mistook.<a name=9:10></a> It is Romans 11: 31, outo kai outoi nun epeithesan to umetero eleei, ina kai autoi eleethosi, so these have now disbelieved your mercy (that is, the mercy to the Church or the Gentiles), that they might be objects of mercy.<a name=9:11></a> That is, Christ

		was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, and that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy; but they, having rejected Christ as mercy to the Gentiles, forbidding to preach to the Gentiles that they might be saved, have now lost this ground, and stand upon mercy themselves; and yet God's faith abounding over their lie shall make His promise good, yet so as it shall be mercy.<a name=10:1></a> This marvellous wisdom of order and dealing it was which made the apostle cry out "O the depths of the wisdom," etc.<a name=10:2></a> The present English translation destroys all this, and mistakes the purposes of God.<a name=10:3></a> His mercy they will have; but it is indeed mercy to them now en apeitheia where the Gentiles otherwise once were, now they, ina kai eleethosi.<a name=10:4></a> And thus ignorant of this mystery, the Gentiles -- the Church -- has become wise in its own conceits, subject, in the true judgment of God, to be cut off.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add, in Hebrew, one which is to me of great interest in Psalm 89.<a name=10:6></a> The Holy One of Israel, and the Holy One, are both spoken of, but the words in the original are quite different; in verse 18 it is yisharel wildish, in verse 19 it is liatiyedcha, a word which I believe will be acknowledged ordinarily to mean goodness or mercy.<a name=10:7></a> What makes it interesting here is, that it is the same word as is used in verse 1, "I will sing of <i>the mercies</i> of Jehovah for ever.<a name=10:8></a>" It is a concentration of the mercies of Jehovah in the person of the man chosen out of the people -- David His servant, one able to sustain all the attributes of Jehovah, spoken of before as the medium of, and making them all, mercy towards His people.<a name=10:9></a> It is the same word in verses 24, 28, 33.<a name=10:10></a> The whole seems to be the presenting Christ as the sustaining person of <i>Chesed</i>, and the consequences towards those with whom He is united.<a name=10:11></a> The same word is used in Psalm 16, when the resurrection of our Lord is spoken of.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have a strong conviction that the words abstractedly might be applied to either; yet that, when they have a definite formal application, <i>Chasidim</i> applies to the Jewish, <i>Kedoshim</i> to the Gentile or Church saints; but the thing cannot be taken as a simple general rule without more understanding of the subject.<a name=10:13></a>

		SCRIPTURAL CRITICISMS 2

		Dear Sir, <br>I would renew my attempt to clear the interpretation of the New Testament by some very simple criticisms.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would here first take notice of the difference of eis and epi, the use of either of which distinctly is intimately connected with the question of God's love to the world, and the absolute salvation of the Church: to which, important as it is, I refer here only in connection with the texts I take notice of.<a name=11:2></a>
	</div>

		We have another most important instance in verse 18 of chapter 5.<a name=11:7></a> "Therefore as by one offence towards (eis) all men, to (eis) condemnation.<a name=11:8></a>" This was the aspect of the result of the offence (intercepted, as regards them that believe, by the death of Christ); "so by one righteousness towards (eis) all men, to (eis) justification of life"; if, as in the English translation, it had been "upon," for which the scriptures use epi, all would have been justified.<a name=11:9></a> We know it is not so, nor does the scripture say so.<a name=11:10></a> The aspect of the act is as wide as the aspect of the act of the first Adam; the effect is quite another and a distinct question.<a name=11:11></a> We have, in the former passage, seen it to be pronounced <i>upon</i> them that believe.<a name=11:12></a> These remarks make, I believe, quite clear what the English translation renders very difficult to comprehend.<a name=11:13></a> The word translated (Romans 5: 18) "<i>upon</i> all" is the same as "<i>unto</i> all" in Romans 3: 22, not as "<i>upon</i> all" them that believe.<a name=11:14></a> It shews that the free gift was unto (that is, towards) all in its aspect; but that its effect, and the acceptance of people under it, is quite a distinct question.<a name=11:15></a> The accuracy and perfectness of scripture is additionally illustrated.<a name=11:16></a> Eis seems to exhibit the natural consequence,

		The expression genetai andri etero is translated "married to," which seems to be more than its force; as in verse 3, "if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man.<a name=12:4></a>" It seems a more general phrase, though in an honest sense it may of course have this force.<a name=12:5></a> But while it may be said in a certain way that the soul is married to the risen Christ, the Church, I believe, as such, is never said to be married to Christ.<a name=12:6></a> It is said, as to a particular body, that "I have espoused you as a chaste virgin unto Christ.<a name=12:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Revelation 19 we have the joyful celebration, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; let us be glad and rejoice, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.<a name=12:8></a>" This is after the judgment of Babylon.<a name=12:9></a> And again, in chapter 21: 9, "I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=12:10></a>" Here we have then the Church confessedly not married to the Lamb; and I believe this to be a most important difference: error as to which has produced as much mistake as any other at all concerning scripture.<a name=12:11></a> It may be said to be espoused or destined for him, but the marriage is not yet come.<a name=12:12></a> This takes place on being united to Him in that day when He shall appear in His glory, when He calls them up into the air; then shall He "present it to himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.<a name=12:13></a>"

		Now this difference affects the whole position we are set in.<a name=13:1></a> The Church has never yet been brought into the position with God, in which the whole argument of the great body of comments on scripture supposes it to be placed (and this is another instance of the evil of applying Old Testament statements to New Testament subjects as if they belonged to them), though faith, by the Spirit, sees that place to belong to it, and therefore keeps itself for it.<a name=13:2></a> It is the part of Babylon to corrupt itself with all the kings of the earth; but we, though with long protracted affections, know the faithfulness of the Redeemer's love, and remain in solitude till He who has loved us shall appear.<a name=13:3></a> For we are "espoused to one husband," and this shall be in the resurrection, for the second Adam is known to us in the resurrection.<a name=13:4></a> We were taken out of Him in death: He is dead to all but faith now, and the Church is therefore still taken out of Him; and in resurrection we shall be one with Him, married unto Him.<a name=13:5></a> We are indeed one spirit with Him now, and therefore know the blessing; but the whole body of the Church shall be finally united to Him in the joy of its Lord.<a name=13:6></a>

		I think it will be found that all the scriptures will bear out this difference; and, clearly, it strongly affects our position, while we learn distinctly the aspect of faithfulness which the Church should present; its utter separation from the world and all secular help; in its character, a chaste virgin unto Christ: genomene andri etero, it has lost all its character as well as relationship.<a name=13:7></a> When the spirit of the risen Saviour is in me, I am so far united unto Him, and so ought I to keep myself: I am vitally and everlastingly one with Him; but the Church corporate is not so married unto Him, for indeed it is not yet formed.<a name=13:8></a> To assume the privileges of a wife does not become her position; not to have more than the modesty of one in her deportment as ill suits her state.<a name=13:9></a> She shall reign queen over all her Lord's goods, and rule in His house with Him: fidelity of hope to one long absent from His pledged love -- as a stranger therefore in the midst of all that knows Him not -- her present portion.<a name=13:10></a> Whether receiving the tokens of His love to her from on high or not, faithfulness to Him is her clear part.<a name=13:11></a> The world may count her case foolish and hopeless; but she knows in whom she has believed, and she may be content to abide the jest of those who know it not, because she has the secret of His love by His Spirit dwelling in her, and will rejoice in that day when He makes good His faithfulness, and celebrates

		Now if we compare John 17: 3, we shall see the amazing force of that expression, and the meaning of this: "This is life eternal, that they should know thee, the only true God [that is the Father], and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.<a name=17:3></a>" That they may know thee, ton -- that one, or Him, who is the only true God, contrasted with gods many and false gods, and Him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.<a name=17:4></a> How does He give them this eternal life, this knowledge?<a name=17:5></a> I answer, By their being planted in Himself: "he that hath the Son hath life": but they are thus in Him that is true, and consequently, being in Him that is true -- that is, in His Son -- they dwell in God and God in them.<a name=17:6></a> They know the Father, who Himself is the only true God; and they know Jesus Christ whom the Father hath sent, and none else can know Him.<a name=17:7></a> Being in Christ and knowing His love, we are in the true God, and so know the Father as being in the Son, and we know Jesus Christ.<a name=17:8></a>

		I would remark that this passage (John 17: 3) seems to me to embrace true religion as referable to Jews and Gentiles.<a name=17:9></a> Unless known as the Father, there was no knowing Him at all; and this by knowing Him in the Son; if they knew not Jesus Christ whom He had sent, they knew nothing of that ministration in which, as Messiah, He had fulfilled the purposes of God, and manifested eternal life in sonship.<a name=17:10></a> This was eternal life, for He was the living God.<a name=17:11></a> Therefore He says "power over all flesh.<a name=17:12></a>" The Epistle was written, as the Gospel, to shew them what eternal life was, to prove to them that they had it already.<a name=17:13></a> He sums up all from first to last (against all the ramifications of intellectual imaginations, in which men, creating trouble for their own minds, were apt to wander) in the person of Jesus Christ, putting everything in its place in and round that centre.<a name=17:14></a> Whoever studies the three closing oidamen of John's Epistle will at once see the amazing and stern comprehensiveness of the passages, and in the last especially; the closing of all cavil in the person of Jesus Christ -- "Him that is true" -- "the true God and eternal life.<a name=17:15></a>" If the object of the two books, as stated, John 20: 31, and 1 John 5: 13, be observed, the meaning and combined power of these passages will be most apparent.<a name=17:16></a> Simplicity of faith is the real secret -- the kernel of all knowledge.<a name=17:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would make further a few remarks on 1 Corinthians 15: 24, <i>et seq</i>.<a name=18:1></a> I do not think it is sufficiently observed that there are two very distinct though closely connected passages referred to there; and I think a little attention will make it plain.<a name=18:2></a> The two distinct things are, His "putting his enemies," and putting "all things under his feet.<a name=18:3></a>" There is also a direct distinction between putting them under Him, and His subjecting them.<a name=18:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would first remark that the supremacy of man is the point in question -- man in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ; as a little farther on, verse 47, "the second man, out of heaven.<a name=18:5></a>" The whole chapter is the power of the resurrection: the progressive steps of this resurrection occupy the apostle's attention.<a name=18:6></a> The putting all things under man's feet is the express subject on which the apostle dwells from Psalm 8.<a name=18:7></a> The union of the other with it, being Lord as well as Son of David, is that which must always puzzle the unbeliever, as the Lord did the Jews with it; it is the strength and comfort of faith.<a name=18:8></a> It is the same Jesus who was made Lord and Christ, whose coming to take His kingdom is here celebrated.<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole subject then is the kingdom of man (in resurrection) as a given kingdom, contrasted with God.<a name=18:10></a> Hence, the Father never becoming incarnate and remaining in office (I speak after the manner of men) Supreme Deity, the kingdom is delivered up to Him, to God, even the Father, to Theo kai patri -- that God (as contrasted with man) may be all and in all, instead of Christ the Man being all in all.<a name=18:11></a> This is clearly the subject: the contrast of God and the given kingdom of the risen Man, the Head of the new world.<a name=18:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With this personal supremacy of Christ, the Lord from heaven, there are two things connected; "the putting his enemies" and putting all things under His feet being quotations from Psalms 110 and 8.<a name=18:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now under the risen Man, as entitled in every sense thereto by glorifying God, by purchase at His life's cost back again, by overcoming all His enemies personally, God on His resurrection and glorifying put all things under Him, not in actual subjugation, but title of subjection; they were His by victory, by purchase, by worth, in the purpose of the divine glory: so Psalm 8.<a name=18:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite otherwise as to the other.<a name=18:15></a> There Jehovah says, "Sit thou at my right hand till I make thy foes thy footstool.<a name=18:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is to sit there till it is done.<a name=19:1></a> Ruling "in his enemies" and "over all," are quite distinct things; as to both, the gift of dominion by the Father is distinct from subjugation by the Son.<a name=19:2></a> In this latter (that is, subjugation by the Son) the two become coincident.<a name=19:3></a> The reign of verse 25 I take to be the direct assertion of what is consequent upon His receiving the power of ruling among His enemies till the time when He delivers it up (the last enemy being destroyed, which is death).<a name=19:4></a> Further, "sit thou at my right hand till I make" -- here is the Father making Christ's enemies His footstool, consequent on which He rules in the midst of His enemies.<a name=19:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this act of the Father's the apostle does not speak of; because, after speaking of the resurrection of Christ's people at His coming, the time of this kingdom, he goes on to the end when He delivers up the kingdom; "for," says the apostle, "he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.<a name=19:6></a>" This is the Son's by His actings in power, as the risen Man.<a name=19:7></a> The Father having put His enemies under His feet, or made them His footstool when He comes, having till then sat at God's right hand; "for he hath put all things under his feet.<a name=19:8></a>" This is another great truth; and here the general act of the Father is spoken of (namely, putting all things under Christ's feet); but as a thing already done -- God hath put all things under His feet.<a name=19:9></a> This is His enjoyed power -- a power the results of which we by no means see accomplished.<a name=19:10></a> When they are, when all things are subjected, then He, the Man, will deliver up the kingdom, that God may be all in all.<a name=19:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same truth as to all things being not subjected by Christ, when all things are put under His feet by the Father, is stated in Hebrews 2, where, quoting the same Psalm 8, the Spirit of God adds for us, "Howbeit we see not yet all things put under him, but we see Jesus," exalted.<a name=19:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then we find the title of all in inheritance (in Christ determined the Son of God with power) in the resurrection.<a name=19:13></a> He waits for the time when the subjugation of His enemies shall make all things His, His enemies not yet being made His footstool.<a name=19:14></a> The saints are gathered out, meanwhile, to reign with Him; He acting by His Spirit and controlling also thereby through the world, they are raised at His coming.<a name=19:15></a> For His enemies are now put under His feet, and He takes the inheritance, subjecting His enemies; and they having been destroying the inheritance, as well as injuring the heirs in it, He vindicates

		The end of Christ's given kingdom is stated in verse 24: the way in which the subjection of His enemies by Him is connected with His power in verse 25: in verse 27 the extent and character of the dominion is given, but not the state of things under it, because resurrection is the subject, and they, though under it in blessing, are not in it; so neither the intermediate state of Psalm 110: 1; for the apostle is speaking of the exhibited resurrection state in Christ and in us, and this in full, consequent upon His leaving the right hand of the majesty on high, His enemies now made His footstool.<a name=20:12></a>

		It appears to me that while in general the authorized English translation is one of incomparable value, on the subject of the dispensation of the glory to come there are several passages which the translators have forced from their plain sense, in consequence of their not seeing or not believing in it, and therefore not seeing how it could be possible to take it in the sense the passages plainly represented -- otherwise their pains are very remarkable.<a name=21:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of these passages I will notice.<a name=21:2></a> There is one very important passage, of some length, exceedingly obscured by a fear (I suppose) of popular mistake.<a name=21:3></a> The word translated "condemnation" in John 5: 24, and in verse 29 "damnation," is the identical word rendered "judgment" in verses 22 and 27, and correctly so rendered.<a name=21:4></a> The word properly used for "condemnation" is different, as in Romans 8: 1: krisis is the word in John, katakrima in Romans.<a name=21:5></a> A plain and beautiful passage is obscured by this effort to meet common thoughts, or by a fear of strange ones.<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The statement of the passage is, that there are two things in which respectively the Son's glory is shewn -- quickening and judging.<a name=21:7></a> In the former, as a blessing, He exercises His power conjointly with the Father; in the latter, as the vindication of His honour against those that have despised it, He is alone, and executes it in the way in which He was despised.<a name=21:8></a> He judges as Son of man: but as to those who are quickened, there is no need of bringing them into <i>crisis</i>, for they through grace have honoured the Son when the rest dishonoured Him unrighteously; and it is just out of such <i>crisis</i> they are saved, as the subjects of the exercise of the Son's quickening power; but that all men should honour Him, judgment is committed entirely to Him whom they dishonoured, securing His honour as the Father's.<a name=21:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These then are the two great instruments by which honour is brought and secured to the Son -- quickening power, and <i>crisis</i>.<a name=21:10></a> They therefore that are quickened do not come into <i>crisis</i>; they have passed from death into life.<a name=21:11></a> How are they known?<a name=21:12></a> They hear Christ's word, and believe God the Father who sent Him: thus we know that they have eternal life, and shall not come into <i>crisis</i> at all.<a name=21:13></a> Before the bema of Christ they may stand to have righteous appointment before Him; but into <i>crisis</i> they do not come.<a name=21:14></a> This is the statement of 2 Corinthians 5: 10: "We must all appear before the bema of Christ, to receive the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		things done in the body, good or evil.<a name=22:1></a>" This then is the positive assertion of the Lord, that the quickened shall not come into <i>crisis</i>, but have everlasting life.<a name=22:2></a> The same is the result of resurrection, when this truth is disclosed.<a name=22:3></a> They that are in their graves shall come forth at the power of the same voice: they that have done good to the resurrection of life, of which they have been made partakers; not to <i>crisis</i>; and they that have done evil to the resurrection of judgment, a distinct thing, which is the result of the exercise of Christ's voice on an unquickened soul, and in which none at all can stand, as in Psalm 142 (LXX) me eiselthes eis krisin, Enter not into judgment with thy servant.<a name=22:4></a> (Hebrews and Eng.<a name=22:5></a> Psalm 143.<a name=22:6></a>) Thus the resurrection of life is the filling up the quickening power of Christ as to this mortal body, mortality being swallowed up of life: the resurrection of judgment is to <i>crisis</i>, that is, for the wicked only, for none can stand in it.<a name=22:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The connection of this with present blessing is manifest; the beautiful connection with the exhibition of the power of Christ is made most plain.<a name=22:8></a> The change of the word destroys the consequence and connection of the passage.<a name=22:9></a> We cease to have the double exhibition of the power of Christ in its pursued effects, and we lose the present peace which results from knowing (conformed to our complete justification in Him who is Himself the judge) that we shall not come into <i>crisis</i> -- into question of judgment as to our reception at all.<a name=22:10></a> How indeed should Christ do it, save as despising His own sacrifice and righteousness, when it is before Him we stand?<a name=22:11></a> Our resurrection is a resurrection of life, whatever our responsibility, which 2 Corinthians 5 maintains complete in its place.<a name=22:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		To turn to another passage (1 Corinthians 11: 29, <i>et seq.<a name=22:13></a>)</i>, where this word is misused: "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.<a name=22:14></a>" The apostle is speaking of Christians fallen under chastenings of sickness, or even temporal death -- sleeping (the common christian word for a believer's death), because of evils into which they had fallen; and tells them they are but eating and drinking judgment to themselves; but that, when they were judged, they were chastened of the Lord, that they should not be condemned with the world.<a name=22:15></a> They were Christians, and therefore chastening judgment came upon them here, that they should not be condemned along with the world.<a name=22:16></a> But if, says the apostle, we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord.<a name=22:17></a> <a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first word "judge" is here again a different one, diakrinei, discern oneself.<a name=23:1></a> If by the cherished use of the presence of the Lord with our souls, by the Holy Ghost, we discerned the springs of evil or circumstances of evil therein, which were the occasions of what called forth the chastening, we should not come under it.<a name=23:2></a> Examine yourselves -- and how?<a name=23:3></a> By the light of the presence of the Spirit of God; and hence the importance of keeping it undimmed, ungrieved in the soul, and exercising oneself by examining watchfulness so as not to lose it: otherwise the very power of discernment is gone comparatively, by which the evil is discerned; we become blind, and cannot see afar off.<a name=23:4></a> The good Shepherd may restore us, and does, for His name's sake; but it is by chastening, and possibly sorrowful evil.<a name=23:5></a> Our wisdom is the spirituality by which evil is seen in its springs, not in its effects; and the watching ourselves in this, so as that unconsciously the power of discernment be not weakened by losing the sense of the very evil which calls for it, and the remedy be the sorrowful but still loving stroke of the Lord's hand.<a name=23:6></a> "Make the heart of this people fat" is the worst sorrow of judgment; but any measure of it in us is a grievous evil.<a name=23:7></a> May we, by thus discerning ourselves, be kept or made very bright and joyful in spirit, of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; our estimate of holiness high; because our communion, and consequently understanding, is bright, even with Him who makes us partakers of His holiness!<a name=23:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another passage I will now refer to (Acts 3: 19): "Repent, and be converted, so that your sins may be blotted out <i>when</i> the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.<a name=23:9></a>" Read, "so that [opos an] the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.<a name=23:10></a>" The mission of Jesus, whom they had lost as a nation, would be on their repentance.<a name=23:11></a> It is not here, "Repent and be baptized every one of you," and individual matter of salvation, as in the former sermon; but an address to the assembly of the Jews, explaining the position in which they stood by the rejection of Jesus; but that even so, upon their repentance, Jesus would be sent to them again; and on their repentance and conversion the times of refreshing would come from the presence of the Lord: opos an elthosi, the only sense of which is "so that they may come.<a name=23:12></a>" The sermon is a Jewish sermon to them as Jews.<a name=23:13></a> It states, verse 18, the sufferings; verse 21, restitution of all things; Jesus in heaven till then; and on their repentance the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=24>[Page 24]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		seasons of refreshing to come.<a name=24:1></a> I would also remark that "raise up," verse 26, refers, I apprehend, not to resurrection, but to the same words "raise up," verse 22, stating that what the prophet promised was indeed raised up in the person of God's Son Jesus; the "sent him to bless you," was on His mission from the Father, but it was not done on repentance now, for He would send Him, now fore-preached, in the times of refreshing which would be on their repentance.<a name=24:2></a> The prokerugmenon answers to the proelpikotas of Ephesians 1: 12.<a name=24:3></a> The alteration prokecheirismenon, as to the matter, comes to the same sense, though it is of stronger reproach to the Jews as actually manifested and produced to them.<a name=24:4></a> But the whole passage is completely a Jewish sermon.<a name=24:5></a> "To you first" -- "ye are the children of the prophets.<a name=24:6></a>" The translators (I suppose) could not see the national repentance, or the dealing of the Lord with the Jews still, as a nation; and the passage is quite changed into rather unintelligible Gentile theology.<a name=24:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have a similar instance in Romans 11: 31: "Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also might obtain mercy.<a name=24:8></a>" This is asserting that the Jews as a nation are to obtain mercy by the Gentiles mercy.<a name=24:9></a> So, doubtless, the translators thought; but it is a mistranslation, outo kai outoi nun epeithesan to umetero eleei ina kai autoi eleethosi: "These have now disbelieved in the mercy to you Gentiles, that they also might be brought upon terms of mercy.<a name=24:10></a>" Promises had belonged to the Jews; but they forbad to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always, so that wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.<a name=24:11></a> Thus, like mere sinners of the Gentiles, it was a matter, though true to Himself, of sovereign mercy to bring in the Jews: fulfilment of promises they had rejected in Him, who was a minister of circumcision to confirm them.<a name=24:12></a> God concluded all in unbelief: the Gentiles naturally, the Jews now in the wisdom of dispensation, that both might come in on like terms of mercy, as the Jews surely shall in the latter day.<a name=24:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another passage which sometimes perplexes people with deep enquiries, which (I believe) take their rise merely from obscurity of expression.<a name=24:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Revelation 22: 9 we have, "For I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book; worship God.<a name=24:15></a>" And again, chapter 19: 10, "I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus.<a name=24:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=25>[Page 25]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is commonly taken as if the angel had the testimony of Jesus, and was himself as one of the prophets.<a name=25:1></a> But it appears to me the rendering is simply this: sundoulos sou eimi kai ton adelthon sou ton echonton, "I am but a fellow-servant of thee, and of thy brethren the prophets"; thee and the prophets being in apposition, not the angel and the prophets: in the other, "of thy brethren which have the testimony of Jesus," which makes the passage very simple.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would repeat here what has been noticed elsewhere, which makes an obscure passage very easy: "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the glory of the former.<a name=25:3></a>" (Haggai 2: 9.<a name=25:4></a>) This should be, I apprehend, "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former"; and this is not yet properly fulfilled.<a name=25:5></a> If we refer to verse 3, we shall see at once how "this house" is used as to both its states.<a name=25:6></a> The house is looked at as one thing -- it is Jehovah's house, the temple, in different states; of which her first glory is one; and then "how do ye see it now?<a name=25:7></a>" The unity of the house in all its states makes the sentence very plain.<a name=25:8></a> Many of these passages may seem very simple; but it must be remarked that one passage, where the mind is subject to scripture, will arrest it in all its course; and thus all its principles will be more or less affected: and thus it becomes of great importance to free the mind from its difficulty.<a name=25:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a slight correction in 1 Peter 1: 11, which makes it more strong and clear: the sufferings; the glories after these, meta tauta doxas .<a name=25:10></a> It enlarges the scope of the abounding glories of Christ to come, not His present glory merely at the right hand of the Father.<a name=25:11></a>

		ON THE GREEK ARTICLE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine which, for nearly thirty years, has satisfied my own mind on the subject of the use of the Greek article is so simple, and at the same time (as being merely the intelligent application of a universally well-known principle of Greek grammar) so readily appreciable, that I have been surprised no one has stated and developed it.<a name=30:1></a> Nothing but my own habits, the conviction of how little I could pretend to critical scholarship, and the pressure of other service, has hindered my giving it publicity.<a name=30:2></a> But as it is a material help to the study of scripture, I venture to do so.<a name=30:3></a><a href="#30:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The rule is simply this, illustrated in the known form of a proposition in Greek, That whenever a word<a href="#30:f2"><sup class="footnote-link">++</sup></a> presents the <i>object</i> about which the mind is occupied, as objectively present to it, the article is used; whenever a word is merely characteristic, it is not.<a name=30:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In most simple cases this will be self-evident.<a name=30:5></a> It will confirm also many subordinate rules given in treatises on the subject; as, for example, those relating to abstract nouns, previous reference, and the like.<a name=30:6></a> In some cases it will leave a choice of using or not using the article, so far as the sense is concerned, and merely affect vigour of style: in some it will require the power of abstraction, a power absolutely demanded for the critical study of the Greek Testament.<a name=30:7></a> But it will explain all, and give the special force of a vast number otherwise left uncertain.<a name=30:8></a> This last reason, and the more perfect understanding of scripture connected with it, is what leads me thus to give it publicity.<a name=30:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The metaphysical reasons may be subordinately interesting, and confirm the rule.<a name=30:10></a> It may cause the article to retain its name of "definite," though I should perhaps prefer "objective.<a name=30:11></a>" It may explain its early Homeric pronominal use.<a name=30:12></a> It may shew, that in translating Greek into English, "a," or "the," or neither,<a href="#30:f3"><sup class="footnote-link">+++</sup></a> may be required: for that depends on the genius of English;

		our enquiry, on the genius of Greek.<a name=31:1></a> Our great point will be the truth of the fact.<a name=31:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I say o anthropos esti zoon logikon, the object before my mind to be described is o anthropos.<a name=31:3></a> Zoon logikon is the description -- that which characterizes, in an explanatory way, the object about which I am occupied: it is not an object, but the character given to an object.<a name=31:4></a> The object is anthropos.<a name=31:5></a> It may be the archetypal idea of the race (that is, an ideal object), or an actual individual previously spoken of; but it is the object before my mind to be spoken of<a href="#31:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>; o designates it; anthropos names the thing designated.<a name=31:6></a> The anarthrous word describes, or attaches a descriptive idea to, the designated object.<a name=31:7></a> Hence, though the usage was subsequently lost, we can easily conceive that where some one had been named, it stood alone as a pronoun, answering to "he"; and in many phrases is rightly rendered "this," or "that," when in English the reference is specific, though equally well in general "the.<a name=31:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, too, the well-known usage in reciprocal propositions, that both nouns have it.<a name=31:9></a> That is, they are co-extensively predicable one of the other; or, rather, they both name or designate one identical object.<a name=31:10></a> This will only be the case as to the terms themselves, when the two words stand alone.<a name=31:11></a> When one is limited by the annexation of a governed noun or otherwise, it will only be true, of course, within that limit; that is, of the terms so modified.<a name=31:12></a> Thus in e amartia estin e anomia the terms are reciprocal, because both are taken in the abstract totality of the things in their nature.<a name=31:13></a> But e zoe en to phos ton anthropon necessarily limits the reciprocity to the historical facts by the verb, and to a certain sphere of fact by the genitive following to phos.<a name=31:14></a> That is, the article, as presenting an object, presents the whole thing named.<a name=31:15></a> If it be abstract, it is the whole thing in its nature, as e amartia, e anomia; and in this case the terms are properly reciprocal.<a name=31:16></a> If not, it affirms

	<div class="footnote">
		<a class="footnote" name="#31:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Hence, when the article is used, it always marks the totality of the subject named, because it is a definite entire object before my mind and of course complete in itself. This is sometimes of little, sometimes of great, moment, but always true. The word to which the article is attached is universal; that is, an ideal abstract, or individual, that is, a particular case of the term, and to the exclusion there of others. It cannot have the sense of some. A word without the article may be numerically one, as is evident, if in the singular; but it is not any particular one, but characteristic.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now to open a little more the metaphysical order in the mind.<a name=32:7></a> The mind is ignorant, that is, has to receive, and be directed to, an object whose existence is assumed or recognized; it has to be informed about that object.<a name=32:8></a> O turns its attention to an object (designates it, as an intellectual finger-post), supposed, I suspect, in all cases to be before the mind, named or unnamed; and, next, what accompanies o gives the object its name, as anthropos.<a name=32:9></a> The predicate informs the mind about the object.<a name=32:10></a> Now in a reciprocal proposition both are names attached to the same object.<a name=32:11></a> Hence both are objective, and both descriptive.<a name=32:12></a> E anomia estin e amartia.<a name=32:13></a> Anomia, lawlessness, is the object before my mind -- that is, sin.<a name=32:14></a> So also sin is anomia.<a name=32:15></a> They are different titles of the same object.<a name=32:16></a> But zoon logikon is not an object at all.<a name=32:17></a> It is a descriptive idea, to enlarge so far my idea of my object, anthropos.<a name=32:18></a> It may be applied perhaps to other objects.<a name=32:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence too the effort of the ancient logicians to define by the genus and essential difference; because one gave the general race or character of being, and the other that which distinguished the object from all other classes, and thereby made it one to itself.<a name=32:20></a> It was really classification, and so far well, but no more, Locke's attempt to give, instead of that, all the qualities, informed more but was not a remedy: first, because many of those qualities were common, and not distinctive; secondly, because some might be individual.<a name=32:21></a> Hence the various efforts at classification in different branches of natural history by collections of distinctive marks sufficiently generalized.<a name=32:22></a>

		The passage now leads us to another case -- the use of the article with a verb substantive.<a name=33:13></a> This is generally left as optional.<a name=33:14></a> It is true, the noun accompanying such verb is used with and without an article; but the meaning is not the same.<a name=33:15></a> En auto zon en.<a name=33:16></a> Is it not evident here that the possession of zon characterizes the person or being spoken of?<a name=33:17></a> And zon becomes a noun characteristic of the existence affirmed.<a name=33:18></a> Hence constantly with verbs substantive, when the thing is generally affirmed, the article is wanting.<a name=33:19></a> A thing which could be called life was found in him: that name characterized the existing thing.<a name=33:20></a> It might in many other cases too, and hence it is only characteristic of the existence implied in the verb substantive.<a name=33:21></a> The existence is before the mind, and hence the verb is called substantive.<a name=33:22></a> There was .<a name=33:23></a>.<a name=33:24></a>.<a name=33:25></a> what?<a name=33:26></a> Life.<a name=33:27></a> This will be entered into fully farther on, for it is true of all impersonal verbs, there "was," "fell," etc.<a name=33:28></a> Had it been e zon, there would have been no life anywhere else, for the whole thing designated by zon would have been in Him.<a name=33:29></a>

		In to phos alethinon, phos is presented as the object; but in itself it would not be sufficient: it would be distinctively the light as contrasted with all other objects, and therefore the mind has to resume its exercise, and to fix it on a particular light; that is, the true light, which contrasts with any other light.<a name=37:1></a> Here the general abstract idea or object is phos, to phos: but there is an added object of the mind to which attention is substantively drawn: o photizei panta anthropon, equivalent to to photizon of which it is affirmed, not that it is alethinon, (a mere character in that case), but to; alethinon [phos], distinctly and definitely that one particular light in contrast with false ones.<a name=37:2></a> It is a reciprocal proposition.<a name=37:3></a> The last word, phos, comes in merely as repeated, to secure from mistake, as the subject-matter, of the truthfulness contended for.<a name=37:4></a> Its being the true one is the object of affirmation.<a name=37:5></a> This merely amounts to the mental phenomenon, that the mind can have not only existences for an object, but acts or qualities; that is, the article can be used with verbs, or participles and characteristics (that is, adjectives), as objects, the substantive being assumed or expressed for clearness sake.<a name=37:6></a> Were this not so, the mind could only have actual existences, and not actings or characters, for its object; but this is not true.<a name=37:7></a> This designation by the article in the case of infinitives, participles, and adjectives, by making them objects, makes, in fact, nouns of them in the mind.<a name=37:8></a> Thus, 1 John 5: 20, ginoskomen ton alethinon, where the person is absolutely designated by having that quality.<a name=37:9></a> So, in a bolder form, Mark 9: 23, to ei dunasai pisteusai, the question of power lies in believing, the man having said to Jesus, ei ti dunasai.<a name=37:10></a> Esti being understood, gives pisteusai without any article; otherwise it would make believing absolutely identical with power as a reciprocal term.<a name=37:11></a> The verb-substantive constantly, indeed, takes away the article, as we shall see.<a name=37:12></a> In the same verse we have the article with a participle, to pisteuonti, not exactly equivalent to "a believer" (though for most purposes it is), because it supposes the act, and not merely the abiding quality.<a name=37:13></a>

		One other case remains in this chapter important to notice -- dolos ouk esti.<a name=45:6></a> (verse 48 Gr.<a name=45:7></a>) Two reasons might seem to deprive dolos of the article here.<a name=45:8></a> First, the verb esti; because, unless in the case of a reciprocal proposition, esti makes what follows it a character of the subject.<a name=45:9></a> And this is so much the case that when another verb is such as to make the following noun characteristic, it has not the article.<a name=45:10></a> So in tinos auton estai gune; gune characterizes the relationship -- "Shall she be wife?<a name=45:11></a>" -- bear that character.<a name=45:12></a> E gune would have fixed the mind on the person, and meant rather the woman in that relationship.<a name=45:13></a> (Mark 12: 23.<a name=45:14></a>) So, in the same verse, eschon .<a name=45:15></a>.<a name=45:16></a>.<a name=45:17></a> gunaika, "to wife," as wife; again, as monos echon athanasian (1 Timothy 6: 16); echontes chreian very frequently echontes exousian.<a name=45:18></a> This was the condition or state of the persons spoken of, of God Himself.<a name=45:19></a> The anarthrous nouns are attributes or conditions of something.<a name=45:20></a> Yet echomen will have the article after it whenever the word is not merely characteristic, but positively fixing the mind on a definite object.<a name=45:21></a> En o echomen ten apolutrosin.<a name=45:22></a> (Ephesians 1: 7.<a name=45:23></a>) Redemption is more than a characteristic of us.<a name=45:24></a> It is a positive object marked out to the mind.<a name=45:25></a> So Philippians 1: 23, ten epithumian echon.<a name=45:26></a> The same principle very plainly applies to Ephesians 3: 12, en o echomen ten parresivan.<a name=45:27></a> Now this might seem rather a contradiction, but if examined illustrates remarkably the principle.<a name=45:28></a> It is not here a quality in Paul, but a special designated boldness to which he refers: ten parresian kai ten prosagogen en pepoithesei dia tes pisteos aujou, that boldness and confidence of access which we have before God through Him.<a name=45:29></a> Where parresian is used as a quality or state of the person, it has not the article, as Hebrews 10: 19; 1 John 2: 28; 3: 21.<a name=45:30></a>

		But to return to dolos ouk esti -- dolos is not a predicate here, nor exactly characteristic of Nathanael.<a name=46:1></a> The negative modifies the sentence.<a name=46:2></a> It is not merely that the complete abstract idea, guile, is not in him, but there is none of it.<a name=46:3></a> To put it in another shape; you cannot make an object as existing before the mind of what is denied to exist.<a name=46:4></a> Hence we have dolos ouk esti, rightly translated "no guile.<a name=46:5></a>" So in 1 John 3: 5, en auto amartia ouk esti, "in him is no sin.<a name=46:6></a>" The same holds with echei used in a similar way, as John 4: 44, timen ouk echei.<a name=46:7></a> We have a confirmation of this by seeing that, where it is a positive object about which something is denied, and not the denial of the existence of the thing, ouk does not alter the common rule; thus ouk estin o Theos Theos nekron.<a name=46:8></a> (Matthew 22: 32.<a name=46:9></a>) It is not, "God is not.<a name=46:10></a>" God is presented as the object, and He is denied to be Theos nekron.<a name=46:11></a> Whereas in LXX, Psalms 13: 1 and 52: 1, we have ouk esti Theos, there is no God.<a name=46:12></a> In Mark 12: 27, on the contrary, we have the idea in a different shape: ouk estin o Theos nekron.<a name=46:13></a> If this be not elliptical, and if so, identical with Matthew, the sense is different, and o Theos becomes a proper object of the mind based on what has been said, and is a term of relationship, as o Theos Abraam etc.<a name=46:14></a> He is not the God of dead persons, as called their God.<a name=46:15></a> If this be so, the article as designating a positive object is positively necessary.<a name=46:16></a> It is a question of spiritual intelligence which is the meaning here.<a name=46:17></a> The grammatical rule is maintained equally by either.<a name=46:18></a> I incline to the latter.<a name=46:19></a> The cases of ouk esti and similar forms without an article are too numerous to mention.<a name=46:20></a>

		An English expression here may assist the reader.<a name=46:21></a> In "similar forms without an article," "an article" is merely characteristic of "form.<a name=46:22></a>" It is a form without an article.<a name=46:23></a> <i>The</i> article would fix my mind on the article itself as the subject of enquiry, or, if recently mentioned, refer to it as so mentioned; only that English is neither as accurate nor consequently as uniform, nor as universal in application of the principle.<a name=46:24></a>

		It is, I think plain, from the examination of a number of passages, that in cases where one article is used with several nouns, (while the grammatical agreement of the article is, by attraction and the usual analogy, partially with the nouns which follow<a href="#53:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>), the object designated by the article is mentally another, to which all the nouns used apply, or with which they associate themselves.<a name=53:8></a> Where each is made a distinct definite object of, each will have the article.<a name=53:9></a> That mental object may be a person, who unites in himself the various names or titles.<a name=53:10></a> It may be association in a common object or common circumstance.<a name=53:11></a> In a word, the nouns are united in some common fact which the mind has before it, so as to group them together.<a name=53:12></a> This may be expressed or understood from the context.<a name=53:13></a> Thus it is expressed in the following: Titus 2: 13; Ephesians 5: 5; 2 Thessalonians 1: 12; 2 Peter 1: 1.<a name=53:14></a>

		Hebrews 3:1 is a very plain and express case.<a name=54:1></a> In Philippians 1:7, it is the work in which the Philippians sympathized with Paul, which consisted in these two things: apologia kai bebaiosei.<a name=54:2></a> So in Romans 15: 6.<a name=54:3></a> It is readily understood from the context.<a name=54:4></a> In a word, there is always one definite object before the mind, of which the various nouns come in, not merely descriptively, but as together forming the completeness of that object.<a name=54:5></a> The grammar follows the noun, as the relative pronoun does, in its case, that to which it is related.<a name=54:6></a> I shall now give some cases in which it evidently is not one person, and in which the common idea is not expressed in the passage.<a name=54:7></a> Only before citing them I will here recall the principle I have laid down, as we are at one of the most important and difficult applications of it.<a name=54:8></a> The article points to some definite object of the mind.<a name=54:9></a> The noun following gives the name to this object.<a name=54:10></a> In some cases, where this is sufficiently certain by specific contrast, the name is not even added, as o men, o de.<a name=54:11></a> Earlier in the language, this was more extensively the case; and it hence became a pronoun, as in Homer.<a name=54:12></a> The object is assumed to be one we have before us, and known as an object, though we add a name (but a name known as designating that object), and much perhaps else about it.<a name=54:13></a>

		To proceed to the cases: Philippians 1: 7, te bebaiosei kai apologia.<a name=54:16></a> It is evident that Paul is speaking of one single common work which could only be expressed by using both words -- confirming and defending: but he had but one object in his mind.<a name=54:17></a> So in a passage already quoted, 2 Peter 1: 10, bebaian .<a name=54:18></a>.<a name=54:19></a>.<a name=54:20></a> ten klesin kai eklogen .<a name=54:21></a>.<a name=54:22></a>.<a name=54:23></a> poieisthai, calling and election are united in the one thing to be secured, in the security they sought.<a name=54:24></a> They could not secure one without the other.<a name=54:25></a> They formed one object in the apostle's mind in the diligence he recommended.<a name=54:26></a> God had chosen; God had called them.<a name=54:27></a> Being so chosen and called, they were to have this a settled and not uncertain thing in their minds, through the diligence recommended.<a name=54:28></a>

		PROVERBIAL EXPRESSIONS

		There is a class of expressions to which it may be well to allude -- short, pithy, or proverbial sayings, which, in many languages, make exception to ordinary grammar, and only claim a metaphysical explanation.<a name=83:17></a> It would be said in French, "<i>Chat échaudé craint l'eau froide"; "force lui fut</i>"; in German, "<i>Unwissenheit und Unschuldigkeit sind Schwestern</i>.<a name=83:18></a>" It is not merely, I judge, the rapidity of expression which give occasion to it, or not always, but a peculiar state of mind which takes up the thought characteristically, but neither abstractedly nor objectively; and it becomes, though an appellative noun, a kind of proper name.<a name=83:19></a> It is a way of putting it stronger than a mere descriptive statement.<a name=83:20></a> The object is so present to the mind that it does not require an article of any kind.<a name=83:21></a> Hence in prophetic oracles we have it, phone boontos.<a name=83:22></a> As in English, if the Queen

		ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE GREEK ARTICLE

	<div class="paragraph">
		Every noun which is not itself a proper name is in direct contrast with this latter; it is the name of what a thing is, not of an individual.<a name=85:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When, in the nature of things, there is ostensibly only one, as sun, moon, heaven, imagination easily personifies them.<a name=85:2></a> But as John, Peter, etc.<a name=85:3></a>, are names of individuals, or become so, so tree, table, glass, etc.<a name=85:4></a>, is the name of a thing, not of an individual.<a name=85:5></a> Such a word, or appellative noun, answers to the question What?<a name=85:6></a> Just so a proper name answers to the question Who?<a name=85:7></a> I say, "Who, what individual, is that?<a name=85:8></a>" The reply is, "Peter, John," etc.<a name=85:9></a> If I say, "What is that?<a name=85:10></a>" the answer is, "It is a tree, a table," etc.<a name=85:11></a>, that is what it is.<a name=85:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Habits of language may vary.<a name=85:13></a> A language may have an indefinite article, or use the number <i>one</i> for it; and either of these individualizes.<a name=85:14></a> Thus in French, <i>un homme</i>, a man; and even in Greek, eis (one) is often so used in the New Testament.<a name=85:15></a> But the noun in itself states what a thing is -- table, chair, etc.<a name=85:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this lies the whole doctrine of the article, at least the root of it all.<a name=85:17></a> The style of language varies as the mind of the people who speak it.<a name=85:18></a> An Englishman says "law"; that is, he uses the abstract idea "law" by itself.<a name=85:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		French cannot bear this; it must have a <i>positive</i> object before the mind, it cannot deal in abstractions.<a name=85:20></a> Hence it can say <i>sans loi</i>, because <i>sans</i> excludes existence, but not <i>par loi</i>.<a name=85:21></a> Where the sentence implies existence it cannot use a mere abstract word.<a name=85:22></a> It must be <i>toute loi, toute loi quelconque</i>, or something tantamount.<a name=85:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whenever a word is merely descriptive of something else, not an individual, it needs no article.<a name=85:26></a> So even in French, <i>par bonté</i>.<a name=85:27></a> In Latin all is thus abstract.<a name=85:28></a> Every noun, when not defined by a pronoun possessive or the like, answers to the question "What?<a name=85:29></a>" not to "Who?<a name=85:30></a>" It is not individualized.<a name=85:31></a> German and Dutch are more like French.<a name=85:32></a> Our business now is with the Greek; but the general principle will help us to understand it.<a name=85:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A noun, as elsewhere, is always a quality or kind of being, or answers to "What?<a name=85:34></a>" As, for instance, anthropos, bios, oikia, etc.<a name=85:35></a> The article makes it individual, o anthropos.<a name=85:36></a> A similar principle will be found in Hebrew; and its form, when a word

		What follows is striking: o thanatos; but anastasis nekron, anarthrous.<a name=86:9></a> The latter -- this thing, what is called by that name; the former might have been equally anarthrous, but o points it out as the well-known king of terrors.<a name=86:10></a> It is individualized, a being to the mind.<a name=86:11></a> Abstractions are the chief difficulty; for the article individualizes.<a name=86:12></a> But a thoroughly abstract word is made a unity of (that is individualized) by contrast with all other things possible compared with it.<a name=86:13></a> Hence an individual of any kind, and an abstraction, will both have the article.<a name=86:14></a> When I say "man," I individualize the kind or race, I sum up qualities which distinguish him from animals, angels, God, etc.<a name=86:15></a>, with which the mind would compare him.<a name=86:16></a> Thus o anthropos may be man, that kind of being summed up as an individual being in thought, or a particular individual man, already known.<a name=86:17></a> So o nomos may be "law," or "Moses's law," or any known law; less familiar here, because nomos is more difficult to individualize abstractedly by a tacit comparison with other things: a few particular laws are what we think of, or law simply in its nature, that is, the name for what it is.<a name=86:18></a> Law cannot be so abstract a thought -- is more positively instituted.<a name=86:19></a> With abstract qualities the case is simple.<a name=86:20></a> That particular one is, itself, in contrast with all other qualities, e anomia, e amartia.<a name=86:21></a> I think it will be found that of such words, of those that are in kind familiar to us in detail, we make what is called an abstraction; that is, we sum up the various things as a whole, and it becomes a unity and in Greek has an article: as e amartia, e anomia.<a name=86:22></a> The principle applies anywhere, but such a word as nomos, for example, is less liable to be summed up thus.<a name=86:23></a> Species afford facility for this; if accustomed to be

		Take, now, to illustrate the principle, John 1.<a name=87:7></a> O logos is an individual personal being; Theos a kind of being; pros ton Theon a personal being; en arche is absolute (en te arche would be a particular beginning, perhaps of all things; but one designated one); zoe en, it is, what was there (e zoe would have individualized it, and there would have been none anywhere else -- that life would have been in Him alone as a whole); then e zoe, because it is the life mentioned, that is, it is individualized.<a name=87:8></a> It is not what, but which life.<a name=87:9></a> So to phos to anthropon, it was the light of men.<a name=87:10></a> Here it is clearly individualized, a particular light, and, indeed, the only one owned as of men.<a name=87:11></a> In the case of te skotia, it is important.<a name=87:12></a> You could not say phos phainei en skotia because there would be no darkness if the nature (the what) of the thing were in question, but te skotia is a particular darkness -- abstract, no doubt, but what was opposite to the light of men, which was life in Christ the Word.<a name=87:13></a> What that found itself in was darkness opposed to it, and which could not comprehend it, the darkness of this world.<a name=87:14></a> It is stated mysteriously, but it is that darkness in which the light of men, Christ, shines.<a name=87:15></a> That darkness did not comprehend it -- no doubt because it was darkness, but the opposite of that light.<a name=87:16></a> Whatever is contrasted has an article, for it is thereby a positive object individualized; consequently, as one whole before the mind; hence as above species.<a name=87:17></a>

		A noun is a mere name, the designation of "what" or character (not proper names of course).<a name=98:6></a> Thus house, man, cat, dog, in any language, names "what" a thing is, not an individual: o points out and individualizes.<a name=98:7></a> In certain <i>styles</i> (which raise a question), as fables, proverbs, these may in a measure merge, because particular care is there taken to paint a character.<a name=98:8></a> Latin is metaphysically special in this and uses all nouns so, as <i>venit homo</i>.<a name=98:9></a> Number, unless by special designation, gives individuality, but the genius of the language is to abstract into kind.<a name=98:10></a> Greek is more material for individualism as to what is external; that is, o is so.<a name=98:11></a> French is still more, which makes it the most exact and the most narrow language in the world, incapable of stating abstractions.<a name=98:12></a> It individualizes and materializes everything.<a name=98:13></a> Anthropos, aner, gune, is "what.<a name=98:14></a>" Man, or a man, is a question of the style of the language.<a name=98:15></a> <i>We</i> think it must be a man, that is, we make it precise by a number.<a name=98:16></a> <i>Ein Mensch, ein Mann, un homme, un uomo, un hombre</i>, etc.<a name=98:17></a>; but in such a sentence it is really what kind of being came, though I may add only one <i>(ein, a, un)</i>.<a name=98:18></a> In German, unity is secured by emphasis on <i>ein</i>; in French, when it is distinctive, you must add <i>seul, pas un homme</i> being characteristic.<a name=98:19></a> You must say <i>pas un seul homme</i>; but <i>un</i> is not less "one" for all that.<a name=98:20></a> O though singular, is not this (though eis is so used at any rate in New Testament); it is indicative of personal individuality, and, if an abstraction or a contrasted part, as e agape or to soma, is still this; it points out an individual in contrast with others.<a name=98:21></a> If there were only one man, I could not say o unless in contrast with what was not man, as o Theos.<a name=98:22></a> Hence o logo Theos en is no diminution of the force of Theos, but only shews that it is not the whole individual Being in contrast with all others; o Theos is.<a name=98:23></a> O anthropos, a particular known man, or o anthropos mankind, are both in contrast with others, that is, individualized

		The following notes on particles and prepositions were the fruit of private research for private use in studying the New Testament, so that the reader must not expect anything of a complete treatise on the subject to which they apply; and, perhaps, he will find sometimes what may not satisfy his judgment as to the metaphysical connection of the literal with the moral sense of a word.<a name=106:1></a> But when it was merely the question of using one's labours, undertaken in and for his own New Testament studies, for the service of others who may profit by the labour without adopting all that is said, he could have no objection to their being printed.<a name=106:2></a> The reader may learn how many nice points of meaning there are in the use of these words, and may use these notes to come to a more just appreciation of the force of words and shades of meaning than the notes themselves can furnish.<a name=106:3></a> As a help to his further labours he may find them useful.<a name=106:4></a> They are in no sense offered as anything complete or final.<a name=106:5></a> They were formed in <i>bonâ fide</i> noting down the remarks and fruits of private research for private use.<a name=106:6></a> The reader can profit by them and draw his own conclusions.<a name=106:7></a> They will, at least, supply a pretty large index to the New Testament use of these words, and raise questions for enquiries which the paper itself may not solve.<a name=106:8></a> One only can guide us into truth and the mind of God in His word.<a name=106:9></a>

		Upo, <i>under</i>, genitive and accusative.<a name=142:9></a> The meaning, where not physical, as upo tes ges (in Revelation 5: 3, 13, it is upokato), is "under the influence or effect of," "under the power of," and so the effect of a cause.<a name=142:10></a> The accusative, as usual, introducing motion towards an object, at least of thought; thus 1 Corinthians 10: 9, upo ton opheon apolesthai; Acts 15: 4, apodechesthai upo tes ekklesias; John 14:21, agapasthai upo tou Patros.<a name=142:11></a> The reception, the love (flowed from Him), was the effect of an influence coming out from Him; paschein upo, which gives its essential force, for it is used with the passive, as we say, "suffer under" a thing or person; Mark 5: 25, 1 Thessalonians 2: 14.<a name=142:12></a> 2 Corinthians 11: 24, the sense is this with elabon.<a name=142:13></a> so Hebrews 12: 3, with upomeno.<a name=142:14></a> 2 Peter 1: 17 is more peculiar; it is the principal thing under the effect or influence of which the other happened, though not absolutely a cause or instrument, which <i>directly</i> is not the force of upo, though it amounts to it in common parlance, as "spoken upo ton propheton" the person upo whom being the agent or vessel, which is its very common use; but it is the effect of their action on, or it is under their hand or mind in it, in its being done.<a name=142:15></a> There is a receptive passive condition in the person or thing which is upo.<a name=142:16></a> Whereas with dia, the person or thing

		TWO LETTERS ON THE GREEK AORIST IN TRANSLATING THE NEW TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		My Dear Brother, <p>Mere grammar will not do without the <i>usus loquendi</i>; nor do languages answer to one another in their habit of thought.<a name=144:1></a> I had purposely put "has," "have," etc.<a name=144:2></a>, where aorists are, very often, and as yet I think I am right.<a name=144:3></a> I have seen -- 's book, not read it through; but it is grammar, not Greek.<a name=144:4></a> Take estaurosan (Galatians 5: 24) as an example: he spoils the whole matter by his principle.<a name=144:5></a> The aorist means very often the future, as no one can doubt.<a name=144:6></a> Again, in many cases the imperative aorist has a sense impossible to give in English.<a name=144:7></a> The present is Do, or Do not, something now; the aorist, Do not be in the state of one who has done it.<a name=144:8></a> Perhaps I express it imperfectly, but it is the idea.<a name=144:9></a> The aorist is of no time; but we have not properly a tense with no time.<a name=144:10></a> Hence we must put the aorist often into a time tense in English, future, historic, or what is called perfect; but the Greek perfect is much more defined than the English -- more distinctly the subsistence of what has been done.<a name=144:11></a> A Christian "crucified the flesh" is not a present continuance, and indeed has no sense.<a name=144:12></a> It is about some Christian somewhere.<a name=144:13></a> It is more the French perfect.<a name=144:14></a> <i>Je fus à Paris</i>.<a name=144:15></a> They that are Christ's crucified the flesh.<a name=144:16></a> What does that mean?<a name=144:17></a> I repeat, there is no aorist in English.<a name=144:18></a> In the participle you must often say "having.<a name=144:19></a>" It is in fact with undetermined time; which, where it is instant, may be translated present; when consequent on another, must be future in English, and when it is not simply a past historical fact, in the air, but, brought into present bearing and relationship, must be "has.<a name=144:20></a>" Sunestauromai "was and am"; estaurosan, "they have" done it.<a name=144:21></a> In John 15: 6, the sense is future, but, as it is a constant fact, present would serve in English, a certain fact is looked at as a fact, so James 1: 2; but there are cases where you must in English translate in the future.<a name=144:22></a> In Mark 10: 3, 4, I prefer "has," because it is a present obligation; but in the two last you must make it present -- habitual without time.<a name=144:23></a> In Matthew 10: 4, o kai paradous auton is mere description, and one can say, in English, who also betrayed Him; but we say it in English because it is past now or supposed so to be.<a name=144:24></a> Nor do I think that the aorist means simply <a name=145>[Page 145]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a future as such; but there are cases where in English we must put a future, because English cannot always abstract and put it in no time.<a name=145:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is of the present participle with an article, Matthew 2: 20, oi zetountes, "the seekers": we must say, who sought.<a name=145:2></a> They were not seeking then, for they were dead.<a name=145:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In page 15 (2 Corinthians 5: 14) the Authorized Version gives the right sense but freely, the "five" no sense at all.<a name=145:4></a> All died because Christ died; and it is not all believers, for those who live are distinguished; but I question if he be not right as to the to, verse 15, applying to both.<a name=145:5></a> But I have not had time to examine it.<a name=145:6></a> Died, as to Christ, is an historical fact, one died: so rightly.<a name=145:7></a> Apethanon is a consequence.<a name=145:8></a> Perhaps "had died" were better than "have.<a name=145:9></a>" I cannot say, judging this is an historical fact in itself.<a name=145:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think in result the making the aorist a mere <i>historical</i> fact, as "crucified," a great mistake in grammar and in intelligence.<a name=145:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot at this moment give you an example where, <i>in English</i>, the aorist must be given as a future, but I met one the other day.<a name=145:12></a> I am glad, I trust, to learn anything and willing to learn from anybody.<a name=145:13></a> But my critics, -- amongst them, have not as yet convinced me.<a name=145:14></a> In looking over John and part of Matthew, I have put out "has" in one case and put it in in another.<a name=145:15></a>

		Dear -- , <p> -- had proposed to me to do what you suggest.<a name=145:19></a> I have no objection.<a name=145:20></a> Since this question was raised, I have paid attention as I passed along preparing for the new edition of the New Testament; and it is clear to me it is wholly impossible to make an English aorist which has no time.<a name=145:21></a> It may be <i>very</i> often translated as an historical tense, and here I have often hesitated between the historical tense and the auxiliary verb.<a name=145:22></a> In the passive form it is often impossible to use either.<a name=145:23></a> Sometimes the perfect future, "will have," may serve.<a name=145:24></a> But see in Matthew 24: 2 aphethe: still it is the aorist.<a name=145:25></a> But the English looks at it from the <i>time of the speaker</i>.<a name=145:26></a> It may be alleged that a prophecy

		looks at fulfilment as already there; but you must say "there shall not be left one stone upon another.<a name=146:1></a>" When another event is named or supposed, it is imperfect in its sense, and so has to be expressed.<a name=146:2></a> Very often, as I have said, the historical sense is in the participle; in English, you must put the perfect form or present; "having called" (or "calling") the disciples, he said to them.<a name=146:3></a> In the imperative I have no doubt there is a difference of sense; but how to be expressed in English?<a name=146:4></a> "If thy hand offend thee, cut it off," is an aorist; have it cut off, have it in that state, not properly do it.<a name=146:5></a> This is very common: so of the eye, "pluck it out and cast it from thee.<a name=146:6></a>" In English, present and aorist are alike, touto olon gegonen "took place.<a name=146:7></a>" There is a perfect which in English must be made what they call an aorist, because it is historical.<a name=146:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take Matthew 1: 24, 25; you have a row of tenses where the imperfect becomes historic: no doubt in Greek it is habitual in sense, but in English must be historic or aorist.<a name=146:9></a> In chapter 2: 2 "we have seen" is far better in English than the historic tense "saw.<a name=146:10></a>" Then you get a whole string where it is historical, as to which English uses imperfect or aorist, "saw," "came," etc.<a name=146:11></a>, in verse 2 elthomen is "have" or "are come.<a name=146:12></a>" If I say "came," it is a history of what had happened before.<a name=146:13></a> In the passive, nothing at all answers in English to aorist.<a name=146:14></a> Chapter 2: 16, "was mocked," "had been mocked"; so verse 17, eplerothe "then was" is imperfect; so verse 18 ekousthe.<a name=146:15></a> What tense in English is verse 19, teleutesantos?<a name=146:16></a> But the grammarians say it is used.<a name=146:17></a> Thus Jelf.<a name=146:18></a> The aorist, in all the moods except the indicative and the participle, is usually expressed in Latin and English in the present, etc.<a name=146:19></a> And the consequences of aorist are often supposed to continue (that is, where it is not merely historic), and then we must say "has," or the like.<a name=146:20></a> So with participles of time, "when," etc.<a name=146:21></a>, he says, as I have already said, it has the sense of <i>futurum exactum</i>.<a name=146:22></a> John 18: 24 it is pluperfect, which is very common.<a name=146:23></a> In John 15: 6 it is present or future.<a name=146:24></a> Luke 1: 1: it is far better as "have.<a name=146:25></a>" In Mark 3: 21 exeste, it is perfect, or present; "he has gone out of his mind," or "is beside himself.<a name=146:26></a>" So in infinitives (and imperfect) it has no past sense, as here kratesai.<a name=146:27></a> In Mark 3: 26 aneste, "have," or "be," or "rise up," stenai in English present.<a name=146:28></a> I have no doubt to a Greek mind there is a difference, and, when I read Greek, I feel it.<a name=146:29></a> The mistake is in thinking that <i>we</i> have an aorist.<a name=146:30></a>

		I repeat, habitually the historical tense answers to it.<a name=147:1></a> "He saw," "went," "came," but when?<a name=147:2></a> The rest of the sentence requires to an English mind a time: we English are obliged to give it.<a name=147:3></a> Nor do I see that it is in this sense less future than perfect or pluperfect.<a name=147:4></a> It is never any of them really; it is the rest of the sentence attaches its time force to the undefined fact of existence which the aorist expresses.<a name=147:5></a> In general in English we date grammatical time from our speaking, pluperfect, imperfect, future perfect (<i>exactum)</i>, from some other noticed event.<a name=147:6></a> These always refer to, and compare the act as to time with some other stated or supposed fact.<a name=147:7></a> "He was doing it when," etc.<a name=147:8></a> He had done it already then.<a name=147:9></a> "He will have been at Rome three weeks to-morrow.<a name=147:10></a>" This seems to me the secret of so-called tenses in Hebrew.<a name=147:11></a> They think from the first fact mentioned, "he went and ate," "ate" goes into so-called future, because it is after "went," and then a Vau conversive: only it goes out into details.<a name=147:12></a> All, save as excepted, apply time to present time of speaking.<a name=147:13></a>

		Excuse such a long grammatical disquisition, but it is in reply to your suggestion as to the elements of the case.<a name=147:14></a> At any rate, you will see that, though more instinctively than from grammatical research, it has not been overlooked; and the researches made did not find me without a judgment, though of course I may have failed in applying it, and in some cases have much hesitated.<a name=147:15></a> But the sense is different.<a name=147:16></a> "We saw his star in the east and came," is historical of the <i>past</i>; we "have run" is a fact (and much more an aorist than "saw," though the fact of "having seen" cannot cease, and so far hence perfect).<a name=147:17></a> Then you must say "and have," or "are come," and it is really a present, even if I say "have"; and "have" and "are" are the same -- both perfects in Greek.<a name=147:18></a> You will find, let me add, the tenses, aorist or future or perfect, interchanged in the same sentence.<a name=147:19></a> For this reason the mind may define more naturally or purposely.<a name=147:20></a>

		THE GREEK AORIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As many are very much occupied with the Greek aorist just now, allow me to suggest some thoughts as to it.<a name=148:1></a> As to Greek scholarship I should yield the palm to anyone, I may say, who has made it especially his study, though conversant with the language, as one may be who for years had laid it aside for other occupations, and has only resumed it for the study of the New Testament.<a name=148:2></a> But when the question is one of translation, the power of a second language has also to be settled, and its forms may not exactly answer to those of Greek.<a name=148:3></a> Still there are certain conditions of human thought which are the same in all languages, because all languages are the expression, as such, of the human mind.<a name=148:4></a> I do not speak of the effect of inspiration on them, but merely of the vehicle of thought in itself.<a name=148:5></a> But this shews that metaphysical analysis has its part as well as the empiricism of particular grammars.<a name=148:6></a> I shall confine myself to English, unless any particular suggestion may offer itself.<a name=148:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall begin by stating, what may seem very paradoxical, that tenses have nothing to do with time properly speaking.<a name=148:8></a> Verbs, and still more accurately participles, refer not to objects, that is, to nouns, but to acts (voices I do not speak of here).<a name=148:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are only two tenses, as there are two participles: one is accomplishing an act; the other views the act as accomplished.<a name=148:10></a> "I dine," that is accomplishing; "I dined," here the act is viewed as accomplished.<a name=148:11></a> "I dine every day in the year at three o'clock," that is the accomplishing of the act, and in so far present, that is, viewed as present; the time is expressed by every day in the year, each viewed as present, but, in fact, many not yet come.<a name=148:12></a> But "I dine" is a real aorist, only an aorist of accomplishing, not of what is accomplished.<a name=148:13></a> When I say "I dined," the act is viewed as accomplished.<a name=148:14></a> But it relates the act as such, the mere act is accomplished; and if I can put my mind into the position of viewing it as accomplished in the mind's eye, a future act as to time will take this form.<a name=148:15></a> I take an example which Howell cites as to this question.<a name=148:16></a> "He told me he was sent by his principals to Paris, and returned next week.<a name=148:17></a>" Now, "returned" is <i>de facto</i> at a future time, next week.<a name=148:18></a> But the mind views the arrangement as one whole in the mind, and so accomplished.<a name=148:19></a> The moment you get into the historical form, not in a mental view of a whole looked at as a plan, and so existing complete in the mind, you must put the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=149>[Page 149]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		present or future.<a name=149:1></a> "He was sent by his principals to Paris, and returns," if vividly presented, or "will return," if prosaically stated, "next week.<a name=149:2></a>" But when I look at it as a whole in his plan, the act is looked at as in that accomplished, and I say "returned.<a name=149:3></a>" The nature of the time remains the same.<a name=149:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, there is no real future tense, because there nothing is accomplishing or accomplished, or it could not be future.<a name=149:5></a> Hence I can affirm no act accomplishing or accomplished.<a name=149:6></a> What does the mind do?<a name=149:7></a> It takes the pure verb which represents the act simply as an act, "dine," and puts present purpose before it.<a name=149:8></a> "I will" (that is present will) "dine with you to-morrow"; the verb is present, a thing accomplishing, "I will.<a name=149:9></a>" Philologists tell us that in other languages terminations were originally words, but I confine myself to English now.<a name=149:10></a> In Greek it seems evident that change of form is used for the tenses, auxiliary verbs being occasionally used, besides the case of the pluperfect.<a name=149:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Participles give very definitively the accomplishing and the accomplished act; "dining," "dined.<a name=149:12></a>" This, with the auxiliary verbs, gives great accuracy of expression -- "I am dining," "I have dined.<a name=149:13></a>" The former is an exact present; whereas "I dine," being merely the accomplishing, the act may apply to any time at which the mind realizes the act.<a name=149:14></a> It is an aorist present.<a name=149:15></a> But in the exact present the verb is not the act but the participle, "dining.<a name=149:16></a>" The verb is simply the expression of the present existence of the act.<a name=149:17></a> Not that "am" by itself expresses time but existence; yet if the accomplishing is in existence, it is of course present.<a name=149:18></a> I say, "I am a man.<a name=149:19></a>" That is not time, but "what"; only it must not have ceased to be, because existence is stated.<a name=149:20></a> And in the highest of all expressions it is in contrast with time -- "I am.<a name=149:21></a>" The other auxiliary verb, which must be the main object of enquiry, is "I have.<a name=149:22></a>" This too has two tenses, "have," "had"; one possession now, the other possession past; the present, as usual, is the fact, not time: only it has not ceased to exist to the mind, as "I have a book.<a name=149:23></a>" But I can use this too for all times, provided it be viewed in the mind as going on.<a name=149:24></a> "I have breakfast every day at nine o'clock.<a name=149:25></a>" But it is used, though a present, with a past participle, which gives a very logical definite force to it in English.<a name=149:26></a> "I have written a letter.<a name=149:27></a>" The participle views the thing as done, the letter is written.<a name=149:28></a> "I have" affirms present realization of the fact.<a name=149:29></a> Hence, in English, it has a moral force, not historical, not properly referring to time, though to a thing done, not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		doing or to be done.<a name=150:1></a> That man "has stolen.<a name=150:2></a>" This is not historical.<a name=150:3></a> For that I should say "That man 'stole' my watch.<a name=150:4></a>" It is characteristic of the man.<a name=150:5></a> "You have beaten your brother.<a name=150:6></a>" "I have not; I never touched him.<a name=150:7></a>" "I have not" is denial of the fact morally; "I never touched" is historical.<a name=150:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore we say, "I wrote it yesterday," not "I have written.<a name=150:9></a>" We say simply "I have written a letter.<a name=150:10></a>" Hence it may be used for the Greek perfect, where the participle can be applied mentally to a subsisting effect.<a name=150:11></a> "He has taken the city," historically as a fact.<a name=150:12></a> I say, "He took the city, but lost it again the next week.<a name=150:13></a>" "Took" is merely the accomplished fact, "taken" is a past fact, "has" present possession of the fact.<a name=150:14></a> But it is by no means in English a Greek perfect always, that is, a past fact continuing.<a name=150:15></a> It is often a fact in itself wholly past, but realized morally as a present thing.<a name=150:16></a> "I have written to you in this article on the subject of the aorist"; in Greek, egrapsa; in English, "have written"; because, though the writing be done once for all, an accomplished fact, it is treated morally as a present thing between my reader and me.<a name=150:17></a> "I have"; here the Greek aorist must be translated by what people are pleased to call a perfect.<a name=150:18></a> If I say "I wrote," present realization is gone.<a name=150:19></a> It is the revelation of the past fact, but present realization is not necessarily a Greek perfect.<a name=150:20></a> It may, and very often is, an aorist in Greek.<a name=150:21></a> When I read the New Testament, I may throw it back into historical fact naturally enough.<a name=150:22></a> But often we lose thus the power of it, because the writer is treating the matter as a morally present subject of consideration between him and those written to; yet the aorist may and very often is used.<a name=150:23></a>

We refer to the period during which Adam was clothed with authority, as head over all things in this lower world. That period formed the dispensation, as it may be called, of the beginning of time; and while time was still only in its beginning, that primary dispensation was, through the illapse of sin, precipitated to a close. The interval between the fall and the incarnation, between the ruin of the first and the appearing of the Second Adam, does not, in its whole history, present any distinct order of things which might, with scriptural propriety, be termed a dispensation. There was doubtless a peculiar form of government set up during the interregnum; the administration of affairs was entrusted to the angels of heaven, and especially during the Mosaic period, as scripture abundantly testifies; but the angels were not placed in a relation of headship towards men, such as was occupied once by the first Adam, and is now occupied by the Second; therefore their exercise of government did not possess a true dispensational character. They were not constituted lords of creation, so far as appears from scripture, but were rather ministers of state, who stood before the throne of Jehovah, and were, for a season, charged by Him with the functions of executive government."

In the proper and scriptural sense of the expression, there can never be another economy than that on which we have already entered. *In so far as true dispensational elements are concerned*, we have been cast on times destined to be eternal. There will -- there must -- be changes. Owing to the general, the well-nigh universal non-recognition of Christ's headship, it is necessary that unexampled changes -- changes subversive of the whole apparent order of things -- should take place, in order to unfold the real nature of this dispensation, and win, for the great truths which form the basis of it, the willing acknowledgment of the world ... Let not the *prestige* of stupendous coming change create the idea that yet another economy must be ushered in upon the theatre of creation. Heaven and earth may pass away, but the economy that now exists, identified as it is with Christ's headship, shall never pass away." (Pages 415, 416.) "The dispensation of the fulness of times, then, was not preceded by any order of things possessing a proper dispensational character, except the Adamic, which was only of very brief duration; and it never will -- we must for a moment recall the attention of our readers to the fact -- be superseded by any other dispensational system. No changes, however great, that may yet set in upon the tide of time, will shake or undermine its God-laid foundations. In its grand, generic principles it will endure throughout eternity. The millennial age will, in no true dispensational element, differ from the evangelistic age that is now revolving. Our brethren, whether pre-millenarian or holding opposite views, who speak of *the thousand years* as a new dispensational era, we are far from being disposed to charge with rashness; but we are persuaded that they use the term dispensation in an improper sense." (Page 418.) "The eternal duration, speaking prospectively, of the very economy that is now running its course, is so far from being admitted by some of our brethren, that they regard the present economy as merely parenthetical ... . Were anything of that kind introduced, it would necessarily suspend the existence of the established or current economy; in other words, it would supersede, for an interval, the existing Head of creation from His right of government; but the right referred to, after being once conferred, and so long as it has not been forfeited, cannot possibly be, even for a brief interval, superseded, or thrown into abeyance; and, therefore, the insertion of a parenthetical dispensation is impossible."

		But this is out of place in insisting on the accurate force of a word.<a name=155:1></a> The scripture, the Lord Himself there, does speak of periods carried on under God on different principles (which are very justly called dispensations), whereas, one of the writer's periods is never called oikonomia, nor is this word ever applied to, nor does it mean, a period at all.<a name=155:2></a> "So shall it be in the end of <i>this age</i>" (tou aionos toutou), says the Lord.<a name=155:3></a> (Matthew 13.<a name=155:4></a>) So He appeared epi sunteleia ton aionon.<a name=155:5></a> (Hebrews 9.<a name=155:6></a>) Now, aion clearly signifies, in such passages, a period or course of time in which certain principles have sway on God's part.<a name=155:7></a> Thus, until the end of the age, judgment, which plucks up out of this world, is not to be exercised by the Lord's servants; whereas, in the end of it, judgment will gather out of the kingdom of the Son of man all scandals.<a name=155:8></a> And hence it is also that this present time is called (not I judge a dispensation, but) a parenthesis,<a href="#155:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> because the Lord Jesus speaks of "this age" when He was upon earth, as the same as that which will close by judgment at the end; but this was a period connected with His relationship with Jews, and which will not be closed till He again is present in person; whereas, in the interval, the Church of the first-born has been gathered for heaven.<a name=155:9></a> Another reason why it has been called so, and proof that it is so, is, that sixty-nine of Daniel's weeks are run out, and then there is an interval of ages, and the last week begins again to run on and be counted.<a name=155:10></a>

(Page 419.) "Some seem to be of the opinion, that all pre-millennialism labours under the vicious necessity of putting these gospel-times within brackets -- of making the present age a mere parenthesis in the world's history."

		<a class="footnote" name="#156:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>"The critical accuracy is not to be despised as little or unworthy, which aims at ascertaining not only the general import of each divinely-indited sentence, but likewise, if possible, the precise idea attaching to each divinely-indited word. Indeed, accuracy of verbal interpretation is absolutely necessary to determine even the general drift of much that is written, and it were an easy, though not a grateful, task, to illustrate the justness of this statement, by adducing many instances of erroneous exposition, attributable to nothing whatever but the want of verbal accuracy ... <p>"These remarks may seem foreign to the subject announced at the head of this article, but we have been led into them naturally enough by the course of our meditations on that very subject. We apprehend that *dispensation*, or *economy*, for the words are identical in meaning, is generally used as a theological term, with greater latitude than the scripture application of it warrants. A less arbitrary use of it, one more exactly conformed to scripture precedent, would afford a correct as well as comprehensive, principle, for the classification of God's dealings with our world, and prevent much loose speculation, perhaps much barren controversy. <p>"The word referred to, is employed only once in the New Testament, to denominate a distinct period of the world's history; but an examination of the passage in which it occurs will enable us, without much difficulty, to ascertain the idea there attached to it, and the characteristic features of the period which it designates ... . The Greek word, here rendered *dispensation*, literally signifies *stewardship*, and in that signification it is repeatedly used in scripture -- most frequently to denote the ministerial charge, etc ... . In this its proper and more common scriptural acceptation, the word involves the ideas of delegated authority and responsible trust. These ideas are not excluded from the meaning of the word as it is employed in the passage before us. Indeed they constitute the essential and generic portion of its meaning, wheresoever it is used in the New Testament. 'The dispensation of the fulness of the times' is just, in other words, the delegated administration, or government, of the fulness of times; or, by an obvious and common transition, the period during which that administration, or government, exists. To determine the peculiar nature of the economy, or administration, referred to, we must consult the statement made by the apostle regarding it. Anakephalaiosasthai ta panta en to Christo is the explanatory language which he uses. It means, according to the English version, 'that he might gather together in one (i.e., concentrate under the rule or government of one head) all things in Christ.'" Then, after a quotation from Owen (Exp. Ep. Hebrews cap. 1) to the same effect, the writer sums up: "Christ's government, then, or his headship over creation, is the grand characteristic feature which marks the dispensation of the fulness of times or, it may be termed, the Messianic economy."

On the other hand, the commencement of the dispensation cannot be postponed to the date of the incarnation. No sooner had that marvellous event set an historic seal to the announcement of ancient prophecy, 'Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given,' than the government was, *de jure*, or by God's act of devolution, laid on the shoulder of Christ, and the economy of the fulness of times thus put in movement" (Pages 414, 415.)

He appeared, it is true, and that *for great reasons of state*, if the expression may be used, in a condition of deepest abasement; He was so disguised that there was scarcely one who could 'declare His generation' as the eternal Son; yet He spoke with authority, as one who was conscious of universal lordship, and had claims on universal loyalty. His claims were not recognised except by a few who had been waiting for Him, as the consolation of Israel; and till this day they have never been recognized except by the election of grace: but want of recognition cannot divest Him of His authority, nor abolish His claims. We, therefore, maintain that ever since the day of the incarnation, or the day when Christ began to exist in a condition of God-manhood, the dispensation of the fulness of times has been running its course."

		PREFACE TO THE GERMAN TESTAMENT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to enable the reader to use this new translation with full profit, it is necessary to notice the end we have proposed in it, the means employed in reaching that end, and some other particulars.<a name=167:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To publish a new translation is to declare oneself dissatisfied with existing ones.<a name=167:2></a> We are far from wishing to seek out and uncharitably to judge the defects of the work of others, but the repeated citations from the pulpit of the original of various passages, the improvements on the Lutheran translation, and finally the various new versions which have appeared of late years, prove most clearly the need of our times.<a name=167:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God at the beginning of the sixteenth century caused His light to break forth on a world deeply sunk in darkness, Martin Luther was the instrument specially chosen by Him to spread the truth in Germany.<a name=167:4></a> This labourer, full of faith, occupied himself principally with the work with which God had entrusted him.<a name=167:5></a> To gain this object he used the Bible, which he himself translated for this end.<a name=167:6></a> Others followed him in this, in various lands, some of whom were even compelled to forfeit their lives in attaining the object of their holy zeal.<a name=167:7></a> Far be it from us to despise the toil and labour of love of these blessed instruments in the Lord's hand!<a name=167:8></a> Surely God Himself has not despised them, and many lands have enjoyed for these three centuries the fruit of their labours.<a name=167:9></a> But the requirements of our day are new.<a name=167:10></a> While the energy of the Holy Ghost three centuries ago was directed to laying bare the foundations of truth, hitherto buried under a countless multitude of human institutions and traditions, and Luther's translation was blessed as a valuable instrument in this work, the Spirit is active at the present time in meeting other wants.<a name=167:11></a> In our days men go farther than formerly.<a name=167:12></a> Everything is sought into; the scriptures are searched: and who will blame this?<a name=167:13></a> Men desire to understand (not only some truths such as are indispensably necessary for salvation, but) the whole truth, and therefore the mind and will of God in so far as His counsels and revelations with regard to the world and with regard to the Church are concerned.<a name=167:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Ghost Himself calls our attention to the necessity of understanding the divine will as a means of safety in the last days; and regard for the holy scriptures is in these days a proof that God is honoured.<a name=167:15></a> The efforts of the enemy also are chiefly

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another ground for making the translation as literal as possible was the conviction that it would not be without profit to a reader unacquainted with the original to learn something of the style, the customs, the thoughts and the manners of the writers of the Gospels.<a name=168:10></a> For since the heart, as well as the mind, finds food in the word of God, the forms of expression chosen by the writers are not without importance; and by changing them, even if the meaning of the sentence remains unchanged, the

		We have already remarked that where it appeared to us admissible, we have left the style peculiar to each of the several inspired writers unaltered, in accordance with our principle of translating the written word as faithfully as possible.<a name=173:7></a> We have always, where the reader could not fail to understand, retained the sentence in its primitive form as we found it in the original text, and only where an imitation of this form would occasion ambiguities have we admitted a change, so as to give the sense to the best of our ability.<a name=173:8></a> Thus, for example, we find in Luke, in several places, the word "and" where we, in order to be understood, must translate it by "that.<a name=173:9></a>" (See Luke 2: 15; 5: 1, 16; 9: 28; 14: 1.<a name=173:10></a>) Where a form of speech indicates the customs of the East, we have not sought to accommodate it to those of the West; because by a true picture of the former all the circumstances there mentioned are placed more distinctly before the eye of the reader's mind.<a name=173:11></a>

		We also believe that the representation of manners and customs, in their original character (as for example, "To lie at table," instead of "To sit at table"), not only often pictures the whole scene more vividly before us, but also, even though at first sight it seems most strange, is calculated to place many passages in a clearer light.<a name=173:12></a> Thus, for example, the expression "To lie at table," given literally, explains how Lazarus lay in

		In the Acts of the Apostles we find the word "way" employed in a special sense (Acts 19: 9; 24: 22).<a name=174:6></a> We have not, however, felt induced, in any way, to paraphrase this expression, as the reader will soon perceive that it was at that time employed in a similar manner to that in which the word "pietist" now is to designate Christians.<a name=174:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But to justify the translation of some passages, on account of the peculiarity of the evangelist Luke's style, and also to explain a passage which is difficult for many to understand, we call attention to the fact that Luke not unfrequently employs the third person plural of an active instead of a passive verb, and that even where there is no question of action.<a name=174:8></a> We may here adduce several passages in proof of this.<a name=174:9></a> Luke 6: 38, we read, "They will give," and in the same verse, "They will measure," which is equivalent to "It will be given," "It will be measured," and might here, though not in all cases, be as suitably expressed by "Men will give.<a name=174:10></a>" The passage (verse 44), "Figs are not gathered from thorns," or "Men do not gather figs from thorns," is in the Greek "They do not gather," etc.<a name=174:11></a> Chapter 14: 35, "They cast it out," means only "It is cast out," or "Men cast it out.<a name=174:12></a>" Chapter 12: 20, is, "To-night they require thy soul of thee.<a name=174:13></a>" Here it would not do to say, "Men will require thy soul of thee," but, "It will be required.<a name=174:14></a>" See also chapter 21: 16; and Acts 27: 42.<a name=174:15></a> These two last examples are indeed not so distinct; but, supported by the many others, we have ventured to translate Luke 16: 9 by "That ye may be received"; and this remark explains the reason why we have thus rendered dexontai.<a name=174:16></a>

		We pass on to some other remarks.<a name=178:4></a> The word daimonion, universally rendered "devil" where we read that Christ cast out "devils," is different from that used in speaking of the devil, diabolos (Satan).<a name=178:5></a> The word "devil" means slanderer or evil accuser; therefore the great accuser of the brethren, who is also an evil spirit, is called "the devil.<a name=178:6></a>" "The devils" (daimonia) are, however, connected with Satan or Beelzebub (Matthew 12: 22-27; Mark 3: 22-26).<a name=178:7></a> The word daimonia was employed by the heathen for certain intermediate spirits whom they regarded in a good sense as powerful ruling spirits affording protection to a nation or an individual.<a name=178:8></a> Scripture teaches us (Deuteronomy 32: 17; 1 Corinthians 10: 20) that the gods of the heathen were of these evil spirits.<a name=178:9></a> And as such Beelzebub, the god of the Philistines and of other Gentiles related to this tribe, is known to us.<a name=178:10></a> As we, however, could find no word in German corresponding to daimonion in Greek, we were compelled, like others, to translate it by "devil" (<i>Teufel</i>) in German, which is rather the equivalent of diabolos in Greek.<a name=178:11></a>

		The somewhat strangely sounding expression used by us, "The Christ," instead of "Christ," has been purposely chosen, in order to mark the distinction between the office and the name of the Lord.<a name=178:12></a> "Christ" has become in the parlance of the present day a simple name; in earlier days this was not the case.<a name=178:13></a> "Christ" (Greek), or "Messiah" (Hebrew), means "the Anointed," who, according to the promise of God, was expected.<a name=178:14></a> This word therefore expresses more than merely the name of a person, although this use of it had already appeared at the time the scriptures of the New Testament were written; and since,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=179>[Page 179]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in our opinion, the designation of the office and the name should not be confounded, in order to retain the force of the word, we have written "Christ" when it is used as a proper name, and "the Christ" when it designates the office of the Messiah, the Anointed.<a name=179:1></a> In the Greek, the article o marks the distinction.<a name=179:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, in like manner, often used the word "law" without an article, or added one in small type.<a name=179:3></a> The distinction is very important, because the expression, "the law," always suggests to the mind the law of Moses.<a name=179:4></a> The apostle, however, often speaks of law as a general principle, and not of the law of Moses, and then we have used "law" without an article, or added one in small type.<a name=179:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reader will further find -- that we have translated "nations" (<i>nationen</i>) instead of "heathen" (<i>Heiden)</i>, and for this reason, that the latter designation, used in our days as the term for unconverted idolaters, is not always its representative.<a name=179:6></a> Undoubtedly, in former times, all not Jews were idolaters; for men had turned away from God.<a name=179:7></a> The grace which has visited the nations has, however, changed all; and although, in contrast to the Jews, they have not ceased to be "nations," they are now no longer "heathen.<a name=179:8></a>" This is the reason why we chose "nations" as a general designation, although this word is an imported one.<a name=179:9></a> We could not say "peoples" (<i>völker)</i>, because the Jews were "the people" (<i>volk)</i>.<a name=179:10></a> In the passages in which ta ethne signifies a class and not the peoples, we have translated the word by the expression "those of the nations.<a name=179:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The application of the foreign word "hades" will be thought no less striking.<a name=179:12></a> The cause of our choice is here important enough.<a name=179:13></a> That is, Luther has translated two words by "hell" (<i>hölle)</i>, although their meaning is altogether and entirely distinct; one expression being employed for the place of future torment prepared for the devil and his angels; the other in general for the unseen or invisible world of spirits, upon which till the coming of Christ darkness and obscurity rested, as we may see in the Old Testament, where this word is "<i>scheol</i>.<a name=179:14></a>" De Wette has employed the rather heathenish designation "lower world" (<i>unterwelt)</i>.<a name=179:15></a> But as we find the same word applied to Christ who went into paradise, we have preferred to retain the Greek word itself, "hades," that it might not be confounded with "hell" (geenna) which is the place of eternal torment.<a name=179:16></a> In "hades" there may be joy as well as torment.<a name=179:17></a> The rich man and Lazarus were both in hades.<a name=179:18></a> In hell there is only torment.<a name=179:19></a>

		We must consider more at length the word ekklesia, usually rendered "congregation or church," but by us "assembly.<a name=180:1></a>" Though we might in general be indifferent about this expression, we dare not be so ever about a false rendering of the word of God.<a name=180:2></a><a href="#180:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> The Greek word ekklesia means "assembly"; and especially denotes an assembly of those who in the Greek states, as also in some modern republics, had the rights of citizenship in contradistinction to those inhabitants who had them not, and who bore the not easily translated name paroikos, which we have rendered "foreigner" or "without citizenship.<a name=180:3></a>" We have not translated ekklesia by "congregation" (<i>gemeinde)</i>, because this designation does not represent the true meaning of the word in its original character.<a name=180:4></a> In order therefore to obviate any embarrassment of understanding, we have translated it by "assembly"; and the reader will find it used unmistakeably in this sense in Acts 19: 41, where we read, "The town clerk dismissed the assembly.<a name=180:5></a>" We felt ourselves compelled, in order not to weaken its true force, to use the same term in every case.<a name=180:6></a> It is therefore used for every kind of assembly, whether of the children of Israel in the wilderness, or of the tumultuous persons rushing into the theatre, or for the "lawful assembly" at Ephesus (Acts 19); both for the general assembly of Christians in heaven, and for the so-called church-congregation (<i>gemeinde</i>) <i>on</i> earth, whether it be the assembly in a place or in a private house.<a name=180:7></a> Thus scripture has applied the word, commonly used to denote the gatherings of the citizens, to the assembly of God.<a name=180:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We now turn our attention to the word "repentance" (<i>busse-penance)</i>, an expression which, though we have adopted it, does not suffice, because it has too much of an external character, and denotes a work-doing (<i>werke-thun)</i>.<a name=180:9></a> "Conversion" (<i>bekehrung</i>) was proposed as a suitable rendering; but, although several translators have adopted it, we have not followed them, because conversion is not the signification of the word metanoia.<a name=180:10></a> In Jeremiah 31: 19 we read, "After I was converted (turned), I repented.<a name=180:11></a>"

		Metanoia is the moral judgment of the soul upon all the past, upon all that it is as in the flesh before God.<a name=181:1></a> Others have preferred "change of mind," and have certainly approached somewhat nearer to the real meaning.<a name=181:2></a> But since in this designation the judgment of the soul with respect to the past is wanting, we felt ourselves obliged to retain the word "repentance" (<i>busse)</i>.<a name=181:3></a> We make no further objection if anyone prefer "change of mind," because this meaning is included in metanoia, although it does not, as we have said, express the judgment of the soul.<a name=181:4></a>

		In Mark 2: 26, and 12: 26, we find the expressions "in Abiathar" and "in the bush"; the former expression has frequently been translated by others, "in [the time of] Abiathar.<a name=181:5></a>" In this passage epi may indeed be translated by the addition of the words "the time of"; but we could never say "in the time of the bush.<a name=181:6></a>" This latter expression, "in the bush," and also Romans 11: 2, where the word is "in Elias," point rather, according to our judgment, to the conclusion that a passage of the Old Testament is alluded to by the use of this form; which is the opinion of several learned men.<a name=181:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word <i>elteste</i>, "elder" (literally eldest), does not completely answer to the Greek presbuteros, because the latter, though undoubtedly used for an office in various places, stands also in contrast with neoteros (the younger), which is entirely lost in the German expression.<a name=181:8></a> The expression "<i>die eltern</i>" (parents), literally, elders, the real force of the Greek presbuteros, has, however, quite another signification in German.<a name=181:9></a> It is true presbuteros is not merely an old man (presbutes), but is used for the whole class of the old in contrast with the younger.<a name=181:10></a> Among the Jews who became Christians there is no trace to be found of any distinct office of "elders.<a name=181:11></a>"

		In the Acts the word "worshipper," sebomenos, frequently occurs, as the name of a numerous class of Gentiles who, acknowledging the vanity of Gentile idolatry, and detesting its disorders, attended the Jewish worship, seeking in it a refuge in their moral distress, and in spite of the unfaithfulness of the Jews -- so mighty is the truth of God -- finding one, though an insufficient one.<a name=181:12></a> We therefore find many of this class who followed the apostle Paul and other servants of God.<a name=181:13></a> "Proselytes" is another word, although these "worshippers" may also have been such.<a name=181:14></a> We might have translated the word as others, "fearing God," but this would rather describe a state of soul than be, as

		In 2 Corinthians 2: 16 the unusual expression, "sweet savour of death," will strike the reader.<a name=182:2></a> He will be assisted in understanding it by the remark that the expression is a figurative one, alluding to the Roman triumphal processions.<a name=182:3></a> They used on these occasions sweet odours, and often killed many captives, while others, on the other hand, were spared.<a name=182:4></a> The "sweet savour" was therefore a "savour of death" or of "life.<a name=182:5></a>" In like manner, says the apostle, is the gospel, when received, a means of life; but when not received -- however sweet it be -- it is only a cause for condemnation.<a name=182:6></a>

		The reader, but little acquainted with the manners, customs, and arrangements of ancient times, may find difficulty in several other expressions, which, as we could not without circumlocution render into German, need, we think, a short explanation.<a name=182:7></a> They follow in order: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The "praetorium.<a name=182:8></a>" This word was applied to the headquarters of a Roman camp, where the commander had his official residence, or in Rome to those of the imperial guard.<a name=182:9></a> It was therefore in general the fortified head quarters of the soldiery; and because the provincial governors who were dependent upon the emperor were called "praetors," the hall in which they issued regulations and gave judgment, as the commander did at the head quarters, was also called "praetorium.<a name=182:10></a>" The word is used in the New Testament in all these significations but the first, and we have therefore left it unchanged.<a name=182:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. The "sanhedrim" was the chief council of the Jews held in Jerusalem, which, consisting of seventy-two members, was formed of priests, scribes, and elders, and presided over by the high priest.<a name=182:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. The "synagogue" was among the Jews what is called a church in Christendom.<a name=182:13></a> Sacrifices were indeed only offered in the temple, but the ordinary divine service took place in the synagogues.<a name=182:14></a> Here they read the word and preached, and hence proceeded the discipline which cast out those who were not regarded as faithful Jews.<a name=182:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. "Asiarchs" were officers in the province of proconsular Asia (a part of Asia Minor), who were yearly chosen from the chief men of the province, to take the place of presidents over the various idolatrous services, and to arrange the games dedicated to the honour of the gods.<a name=182:16></a>

		6. "Sandals" are soles bound to the feet by leather thongs.<a name=183:4></a> As Roman luxury extended, men wore shoes or half boots, called upodemata koila, and as it appears later, merely upodemata.<a name=183:5></a> In the New Testament "upodemata" is used as well as "sandals.<a name=183:6></a>" It does not, however, appear probable that this luxury had reached the disciples; and, as the writers of the New Testament have employed two words for the same thing, the reader will understand by "sandals" those soles bound to the feet by leather thongs.<a name=183:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to coins and measures, an exact knowledge of the value of the different coins is not very important, because in the New Testament they are only employed in general to denote larger or smaller sums, and this distinction is apparent in the passages themselves.<a name=183:8></a> As we have, however, used some Greek names, we give here the value of the different coins, but without seeking to be perfectly accurate.<a name=183:9></a> We only remark with respect to the drachma, that some estimate its value at less than we do.<a name=183:10></a> "Lepton" is a 1/2 pfennig ( 1/5 of a farthing) or even less; the smallest coin.<a name=183:11></a> "Quadrans" is equal to 2 lepta.<a name=183:12></a> Assarion: the value of this coin is uncertain.<a name=183:13></a> Some give 4, some 2 Pfennigs (1/5 or 2/5 of a penny).<a name=183:14></a> Drachma (100 to a mina) is about 7 groschen, (8 1/2d.<a name=183:15></a>).<a name=183:16></a> Didrachma is 2 drachmas = 14 groschen.<a name=183:17></a> The Mina (60 to a talent) is about 22 1/2 to 23 thalers (£3 7s.<a name=183:18></a> 6d.<a name=183:19></a> To £3 9s.<a name=183:20></a>).<a name=183:21></a> But the worth of a talent was different in different countries.<a name=183:22></a> The Babylonian talent had 12 minas more than the more generally used Attic talent.<a name=183:23></a> In the New Testament it is probably the Syrian talent.<a name=183:24></a> The silver talent was valued in Syria at something over 320 thalers (£48), the golden talent at 3,935 thalers (£590 8s.<a name=183:25></a>).<a name=183:26></a> [A.<a name=183:27></a> Böckh reckons the drachma at 7 1/2 Sg.<a name=183:28></a> (9d.<a name=183:29></a>); the mina at 25 thalers (£3 15s.<a name=183:30></a>); and the Attic talent at 1,500 thalers (£225).<a name=183:31></a>] The Choenix is commonly what a man needs for a day's sustenance.<a name=183:32></a> Bath = 6 hins, or about 1 eimer (bushel?<a name=183:33></a>).<a name=183:34></a> Corus = 10 baths.<a name=183:35></a> [<i>written</i> 1855]

		With regard to the words pleonexia and pleonektes, which all have translated by "covetousness," and "covetous man," we have also retained this meaning.<a name=185:11></a> We are, however, convinced that this word, indicating an unbridled inclination (or affection) for that which does not belong of right to the one filled with pleonexia, signifies "fleshly lust," as well as "covetousness.<a name=185:12></a>" See Ephesians 5: 3, 5; Colossians 3: 5; 2 Peter 2: 3, 14; 1 Thessalonians 4: 6; 1 Corinthians 5: 10, 11; Ephesians 4: 19.<a name=185:13></a> The last passage explains the general use of the word.<a name=185:14></a> Some of the passages quoted are not so distinct, but they may help the reader.<a name=185:15></a>

		PREFACE TO THE VEVAY NEW TESTAMENT, 1859

	<div class="paragraph">
		In presenting to the reader this new translation of the second part of the holy scriptures, it is well to give him some information as to the plan which we have followed, and the principles which have guided us in our undertaking.<a name=187:1></a> With regard to the details of this work, we will only mention those which have appeared to us as needing some explanation.<a name=187:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thoroughly convinced of the divine inspiration of the scriptures, we have endeavoured in translating them to reproduce as exactly as possible in French, that which God has given us in another language, unknown to the greater part of those who read the Bible.<a name=187:3></a> We have rendered the Greek as literally as was consistent with the perspicuity needed for the understanding of what is said.<a name=187:4></a> The depth of the word of God is infinite, and the connection that exists between all the parts of the divine mystery is not less admirable; although this mystery is not revealed to us as a whole, for "we know in part and we prophesy in part.<a name=187:5></a>" Therefore it is that we often meet in the word with expressions that, flowing from the depth of the mystery in the mind of the inspired writers, make us perceive (under divine teaching) the connection of the different parts with each other, and that of each of these parts with the whole.<a name=187:6></a> To retain these Greek expressions is sometimes disadvantageous to the style of the version; but, when the clearness of the sentence was not injured by it, we have allowed some to stand which might help the reader to apprehend all the meaning and bearing of what is written in the Greek.<a name=187:7></a> In other cases, when the French language would not admit of a literal translation, and where the form of the Greek phrase appeared to contain thoughts that might be more or less lost or modified in the French expression, we have given the literal translation in a note.<a name=187:8></a>

		There is another point which relates to the Greek text itself, and which it is needful to mention.<a name=187:9></a> Until the end of the fifteenth century, at which period printing was invented, the holy scriptures -- as well as all other books -- existed only in the

		The use we have made of the word "gospel" (euaggelion) is not without its danger, and requires that the attention of the reader should be called to the proper meaning of the word, as well as to some facts connected with it.<a name=194:7></a> We commonly say, "to preach the gospel" -- "this or that is not the gospel"; and by "gospel" is understood a certain system of doctrine.<a name=194:8></a> The word, however, means simply "glad tidings," "good news" brought by some one.<a name=194:9></a> Thus when Timothy brought to Paul good news of the faith and love of the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 3: 6), it is said that he eueggelisato (evangelized) Paul as to the faith and love of the Thessalonians.<a name=194:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, in the same way that the word "Christ," used at first as a title in the sense of the Anointed One, became afterwards a proper name; so the pre-eminently good news, the good news of the love of God and of His intervention in the person of Christ to save men, is called "the good news," "the gospel.<a name=194:11></a>" It is important that the reader, when he meets with this expression, should bear in mind the idea of a communication of good and glad tidings, as a message from God; and that he should also remember that the word euaggelion, translated "gospel," is used to designate various glad tidings or good news.<a name=194:12></a> When, for instance, we read of "the gospel of the kingdom" (that is to say, of the good news that God was going to establish His kingdom on earth), this is quite a different good news from
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=195>[Page 195]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that of the intervention of God in grace for salvation.<a name=195:1></a> It must also be observed that when we find the expression "the gospel of God," the word speaks to us of God as the source of the good news; whilst when the expression is "the gospel of Christ," it is Christ who is presented as being the subject of this good news.<a name=195:2></a> Some other analogous modes of expression will not be passed unnoticed by the attentive reader.<a name=195:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should add that this word euaggelion (gospel) is not common to all the sacred writers, and that we do not find it in the Greek text of Luke, John, James, or Jude.<a name=195:4></a> Peter only makes use of it once; in Paul, on the contrary, that great herald of the glad tidings, we meet with it very frequently, but in different acceptations.<a name=195:5></a> Matthew uses it four times, always adding the words "of the kingdom.<a name=195:6></a>" Of all the evangelists, Mark is the only one who employs this word several times in the sense which we now usually give it; and this is readily accounted for by the fact that Mark is particularly occupied with Christ as proclaiming the word, and that he makes no mention of the circumstances which accompanied the birth of our Lord, but begins with the glad tidings at once, and ends his narrative with the commission entrusted by the Lord to His disciples, without giving -- as the other evangelists have done -- an especial character to that mission.<a name=195:7></a> He says merely, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to every creature.<a name=195:8></a>" The reader will however observe that even in Mark the word is not used independently of the idea of the coming of the kingdom, for it is there written "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent ye, and believe in the glad tidings.<a name=195:9></a>" This coming of the kingdom is a very different thing from the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, although these events took place before the setting up of the kingdom, and were in fact necessary to it.<a name=195:10></a> It is evident that, before the accomplishment of the fact, the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus could not be preached as glad tidings, men being then called on to believe in a living Christ.<a name=195:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally and in a general way it may be said that the word "gospel," having by itself the meaning of good news declared, serves to express the preaching of the truth, as well as the truth preached; and that the word is used sometimes in the one, and sometimes in the other, of these two senses.<a name=195:12></a> Thus the study of the text will shew that there are, both in Mark and in the Epistles of Paul, some passages in which the word "gospel" is

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was important to preserve the distinction which the word makes between the expression (an extremely vague one however) of ades, the invisible place, where the souls of men go after death, and that of geenna, the place of torment.<a name=196:4></a> We have therefore retained the Greek word ades, hades.<a name=196:5></a>
	</div>

		Neither ought we to lose sight of the important difference that exists between the expressions, doulos, diakonos, and uperetes.<a name=196:6></a> We have retained for the first, the term (of evil sound in the present day) of slave; the diakonos was a man who served at table or elsewhere, without being, on that account, a slave; the uperetes, originally a rower in a galley, was an official servant, such for instance as an "apparitor.<a name=196:7></a>" When the text does not allow us to render these differences into French, we have given the Greek word in a note.<a name=196:8></a>

		The Greek word osios demands also a little explanation, as in Acts 13: 34, 35.<a name=197:10></a> There is no question but that the word is used in the New Testament, as also in the Septuagint, in the sense of "holy," (see 1 Timothy 2: 8; Titus 1: 8; Hebrews 7: 26; Revelation 15: 4), although the word usually translated "holy" is agios.<a name=197:11></a> The proper sense of osios is pious, compassionate, that which is not profane, and it is applied to Christ, in whom is summed up all the benevolence and the goodness of God towards men, as well as perfect piety.<a name=197:12></a> This application of the word comes out in a very remarkable way in Psalm 89, where the expression is used by the sacred writer to designate the loving-kindnesses of God towards Israel, which are centred in David, and the promises made to David and his seed, that is to say, to Christ (verses 1-4).<a name=197:13></a> The same expression is applied in verse 19 to the person in whom all these mercies are centred, in contrast with the other word that is usually rendered by "holy," and which is employed in verse 18 with respect of Jehovah.<a name=197:14></a>

		The expression "under sin" (Romans 3: 9) is peculiar, but we have retained it in order not to weaken the moral force of the term, which, in the text, points out the sinful condition (as God views it) which presses upon us, a weight, a power, and on every side; the meaning would be lost if it were translated "in sin," or "subjected to sin.<a name=198:9></a>"

		By comparing the expressions epi Abiathar (Mark 2: 26), epi tou batou (Mark 12: 26), and the analogous form en Elia (Romans 11: 2), we have arrived at the conclusion (evident to ourselves at least) that the first should not be rendered "in the days of Abiathar," but that all three designate a section or heading of a book -- a section or heading in which is found the recital of the fact in question.<a name=199:4></a> We have therefore departed from the ordinary translation, and have said "in [the section, or heading, of] Abiathar" "in [the section of] the bush.<a name=199:5></a>"

		The translation of Luke 16: 9, "that ye may be received," requires justification.<a name=199:6></a> The reader can easily convince himself that Luke, in his Gospel, frequently employs the active verb, with the third person of the plural, to express the simple fact which is usually rendered by the passive form, "that they may receive you," for "that ye may be received.<a name=199:7></a>" Compare chapter 6: 38, 44 (twice); 12: 20; 14: 34, etc.<a name=199:8></a>

		The expression, "the ends of the ages," which will be found in 1 Corinthians 10: 11, is rather strange; but to preserve the sense of the Greek, we could not say, "the last times," any more than "the end of the ages," still less "the end of the world.<a name=199:9></a>" The end of the ages was not yet come; but all the different dispensations by which God had put Himself in relation with man, so far as they were connected with man's responsibility, had come to one point, and were brought to an end in the death of the Lord Jesus.<a name=199:10></a> After that -- great as had been His long-suffering -- God established a new creation.<a name=199:11></a> We have therefore used the literal translation, "the ends of the ages.<a name=199:12></a>"

		[-The reader who compares our translation with the Greek, will observe, especially in John 6, that we have often omitted the ego.<a name=200:3></a> The Greek language generally admits of the omission of personal pronouns, unless the person designated is to be made prominent; but John often uses this pronoun without the least intention of giving the emphasis which the use of it would give in French.<a name=200:4></a> We fear we have even used the word "<i>moi</i>" too frequently after all; but, as its use is a peculiarity of John's style, we were anxious to leave it in wherever this was possible.<a name=200:5></a>

		There are other expressions in the Gospel of John to which it may be well to draw the reader's attention, because it is difficult to give the force of the Greek in French.<a name=200:6></a> Thus the word " <i>venu</i>" in the sentence "<i>venu de Dieu</i>" (John 16: 30) is the same as "<i>sorti</i>" of verses 27 and 28 of the same chapter, where we read " <i>Je suis sorti d'auprès de Dieu</i>," the only difference being that of the accompanying preposition.<a name=200:7></a> Verses 27 and 28 express the consciousness which the Saviour had of His position with the Father before coming down here; verse 30 the knowledge which the disciples had that He had come from God.<a name=200:8></a> Without pretending to have succeeded, we have at least sought to express this difference, which is one of real importance.<a name=200:9></a>-]
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter chapters of John's Gospel it will be found that in order to maintain the distinction, frequently important, between erotao and aiteo, we have translated the first by "demand," the second by "ask.<a name=200:10></a>" There are cases in which either the one or the other word may be used indiscriminately, at other times each is used in a sense peculiar to itself: erotao expressing a familiar request where intimacy exists; aiteo, the request rather of an inferior with regard to his superior.<a name=200:11></a> The disciples employ both of these words in their relations with Jesus; but, in His relations with His Father, Jesus demands, erotao, whilst He never employs the word aiteo with regard to His Father.<a name=200:12></a> For the difference between the two, compare John 16: 23.<a name=200:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a peculiar sense, which it is well to notice.<a name=201:1></a> The general idea expressed by the verb pleonekteo, is that of making a gain at the cost of another, appropriating to oneself the goods of another; it is the desire of possessing oneself of something, and often with the accessory idea that crooked means are used for the purpose; and this desire may apply to the wife as well as to the goods (property so called) of another.<a name=201:2></a> We have ourselves the conviction that this is the meaning of Ephesians 4: 19, 1 Thessalonians 4: 6, and perhaps of yet other passages, such as Ephesians 5: 3.<a name=201:3></a> Nevertheless, as we cannot rest this interpretation on any acknowledged authority, we have not ventured on introducing it into the text.<a name=201:4></a> We confine ourselves to the expression of our convictions on this point, adding that the thing in question is at any rate an unlawful desire to possess oneself of something in opposition to good morals; and that, in 1 Thessalonians 4: 6, the word "matter" refers to relations with women.<a name=201:5></a>

		The translation of 1 Corinthians 16: 15 does not satisfy us.<a name=201:6></a> The word etaxan, which we have rendered by "have devoted," signifies to appoint an officer to a regiment, or, in general, a man to any post; but here it concerns a service of love.<a name=201:7></a> The family of Stephanas -- the first converts in Achaia -- moved by their desire to serve the Lord, and by their love for the saints, had placed themselves in that which related to service at the head of the saints.<a name=201:8></a> They had taken this place with regard to the saints in order to serve them with all their heart.<a name=201:9></a> They were thus established over the saints for the purpose of serving them, but they had appointed themselves to it; and Paul beseeches the saints to obey them.<a name=201:10></a>

		THE BEARING OF ROMANS 5: 12-21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, <p>The division in the doctrinal teaching of the Epistle in Romans 5 at the beginning of verse 12, the verse you point out, has been already noticed in tracts which are in print.<a name=206:1></a> The former part deals with what we have done, as God's question to Cain; the second with what and where we are, as God's question to Adam, the state of Adam being confirmed and made plain by the judgment pronounced on him.<a name=206:2></a> "He drove out the man.<a name=206:3></a>" Romans 1: 19 to 5: 11 deals with what we have done, and Christ's propitiation as the remedy, adding His resurrection as the great seal of it.<a name=206:4></a> From verse 12 it deals with what we are.<a name=206:5></a> He speaks of state, not guilt, though of course guilt is there.<a name=206:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "wherefore" (dia touto), of which you first ask, is a gathering up of the whole teaching of the previous part of the epistle, which taught, not Judaism and a called people, but wrath <i>from heaven</i> against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of them who hold the truth in unrighteousness, Jew and Gentile.<a name=206:7></a> All were under sin under different circumstances, but alike come short of the glory of God; and every mouth stopped, those that had law, as well as reckless Gentiles sunk in evident depravity.<a name=206:8></a> It was the condition of the whole race of man, as man, before a revealed God, holy in His nature.<a name=206:9></a> There is, however, an additional special ground of the "wherefore," which will not be fully apprehended till that is introduced: a living Christ securing blessing where a man is justified from the old sins, and reconciled, having been an enemy.<a name=206:10></a> Christ's death would secure him through, and save him from wrath.<a name=206:11></a> This so far brought in, not only the clearing the guilty by the work Christ had wrought, but a new standing in life.<a name=206:12></a> By the righteousness of one the free gift came to all for justification of life.<a name=206:13></a> This was a new position of man, not indeed yet the glory or resurrection with Christ and union with Him, but a new position and standing; not merely the clearing away the sins a man was guilty of in connection with his old standing, but a new standing in life, a justification of life.<a name=206:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This clearly brought in a new state, not mere justification from the evil he was guilty of, but a condition into which he was brought; hence too, though recognizing it, it reached out beyond the whole nature of Judaism.<a name=206:15></a> This the apostle sums up in

		chapter 5: 12-21 with the connecting word "wherefore," taking the whole scope of thought which precedes, and resuming it in his own mind, as is his custom, as a causative point of departure in his reasoning, as he often does too with the word "for" (gar).<a name=207:1></a> The sense of what had been said led to this, "as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin.<a name=207:2></a>" This brings us to eph o.<a name=207:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Epi with a dative is primarily "upon," as epi pinaki, "on a dish"; hence is used for "besides," something added, epi pasi, in addition to all this, or above.<a name=207:4></a> Hence also as epi te probatike, epi thurais, but with the idea of actually touching.<a name=207:5></a> It is then used morally for a ground, motive, object, what characterizes an act.<a name=207:6></a> We use "upon" so, but with express words: I did it upon this ground, upon this condition.<a name=207:7></a> Greek uses it by itself, something which is, not the cause, but is supposed; without which the thing would not so be as we say it is.<a name=207:8></a> We are called not epi akatharsia under a supposition of being unclean persons when so called.<a name=207:9></a> Epi trisi martusin, three witnesses were the condition of carrying out the judgment.<a name=207:10></a> Any necessary or true condition: "man shall not live by bread ep arto.<a name=207:11></a>" It was not the cause of life, but his life was involved in it; so epi panti remati.<a name=207:12></a> We say "to live upon.<a name=207:13></a>" This use of epi is very common; ep elpidi arotrian.<a name=207:14></a> It was no cause of ploughing; still the ploughing was not to be without it.<a name=207:15></a> Epi to onomati mou, the reception of the child is characterized by that as a motive.<a name=207:16></a> In English we must translate it variously, but it is easy to understand in Greek something supposed and viewed as involved in a thing happening, without which it would not be what it is, but not its cause.<a name=207:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus here, the origin of death amongst men, or cause of its entrance into man's world, was Adam's sin; but if we could suppose (what could not be save by this acting of God, as in the miraculous birth of Christ) a man born without sin, he would not be brought under death.<a name=207:18></a> Hence each person's sinning is supposed in its passing upon all: it is <i>vorausgesetzt</i>; death comes <i>moyennant</i>.<a name=207:19></a> It is eph o, "inasmuch as," or "for that" as in Authorized Version, not "because.<a name=207:20></a>" A man was condemned because of his sin, or an elder judged; but it was epi trisi martusin, that was a regular condition of his being condemned.<a name=207:21></a> The sinning exists as a fact connected with the dying: they do not die without it.<a name=207:22></a> The origin of death in the world was Adam's sin.<a name=207:23></a> It is not a condition set out <i>a priori</i>, as

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think children enter into the question here -- no more than when the apostle says, "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.<a name=208:2></a>" They really begin to sin as soon as they begin to live: though it be undeveloped, their will works.<a name=208:3></a> I do not doubt they go to heaven: Matthew 18, I think, shews it, and the ground; but the apostle is looking at man manifested as man, that is, what he is and does.<a name=208:4></a> Children are saved, not by innocence, though practically an expression of it, but because Christ came to save what was lost.<a name=208:5></a> This question then I dismiss; I refer to it merely as an objection which might be made.<a name=208:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think eph o has the sense "whereunto": if it were the object in its extent, it would be, I conceive, the accusative, if so used at all.<a name=208:7></a> What follows, to the end of verse 17, is a parenthesis, bringing in the question of law's place and bearing, and insisting that grace which met sin could not be narrowed up to law, though it met transgressions under it.<a name=208:8></a> And first it is asserted that sin was in the world when the law was not.<a name=208:9></a> True, a sin could not be reckoned as so much to an account; but death proved its reign over those who were not in the case of Hosea 6: 7.<a name=208:10></a> Israel, like Adam, had transgressed a positive covenant; but sin was reigning in death over those who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression.<a name=208:11></a> And Adam was a figure of the second Adam come in grace.<a name=208:12></a> Now though transgressions or offences, as verse 16, had to be met, yet the condition and state was the great point here, the many connected with him had been constituted sinners by Adam's disobedience; so the many connected with Christ were constituted righteous by Christ's obedience; but this was state and standing, not properly guilt as to things done.<a name=208:13></a> Sin was in the world before the law came.<a name=208:14></a>

		As to ellogeitai, it is not elogizeto, "was accounted" (as righteous).<a name=208:15></a> The word is only used elsewhere in Philemon.<a name=208:16></a> It is not a person accounted righteous on whatever account, but a particular act or debt owing -- put into an account.<a name=208:17></a> When there was no specific prohibition, there was no specific transgression.<a name=208:18></a> Sin was there, but there was no transgression.<a name=208:19></a> This requires a law to transgress.<a name=208:20></a> But the evil tree bears its fruits and proves what the tree is, and men are judged according to their works.<a name=208:21></a> But there was not as under the law positive transgression, which the government of God could deal with as so much to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		Shall the bearing of man's offence be greater than that of God's gift?<a name=209:5></a> Death was reigning outside the law; but by the offence of one many were dead: should not the grace of God much more abound to the many who labour under it, and not be confined to the Jews who claimed it?<a name=209:6></a> The state of sin was universal through Adam, the grace must be as wide in its address.<a name=209:7></a> Again, as by one's sinning came the charge or guilt leading to condemnation, should not the free gift be thus too?<a name=209:8></a> Yea, more, the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift, with many offences to meet, to justification; vs.<a name=209:9></a> 16.<a name=209:10></a> The first phrase is by one having sinned; the second "by one" is abstract, ex enos, of one [thing or person]: of one -- that is its general character; then the free gift is ek pollon -- had that as its character.<a name=209:11></a> The first statement in verse 15 declares that as to the objects the sphere must extend to the many, since by the offence of one the many died.<a name=209:12></a> Grace must go out as far and brings in the man Christ Jesus, the last Adam, of whom the first was a figure, the thought necessarily involving it.<a name=209:13></a> The comparison to prove the extent in verse 16 is between the acts, as 15 between the objects.<a name=209:14></a> The guilt which led to condemnation was ex enos, a unity; the free gift being of God was of many offences.<a name=209:15></a> So as to the effect: by the offence of one, death reigned by one; much more the grace would triumph on the other hand, and they that received it would reign in life.<a name=209:16></a> In these three aspects grace in God triumphed over sin in man, and that by one man, not by every man for himself, the principle of law and individual judgment.<a name=209:17></a> As far as offences went, they had been multiplied, and grace could meet them.<a name=209:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 18 resumes the general principle from verse 12, and is as abstract as possible.<a name=209:19></a> As by one offence towards all for condemnation, the direction and tendency of the one offence, so by one righteousness or righteous act accomplished towards all for justification of life; for it was in the risen Jesus they got it, from having been under death, and now justified if they had Him in life.<a name=209:20></a> For as by the disobedience of one the many connected

		There are, as the whole passage teaches and has for its object to teach, two heads of races, natural and spiritual: two persons, one in whom sin, the other in whom grace, came; and, further, that the law was a "moreover" (plen), which came in by the bye, pareiselthen, but that you could not shut the grace up to that, but must go to the two heads of sin and grace.<a name=210:7></a> The law merely came in that the offence might abound, but it was not only when offence, but when sin, abounded that grace abounded over it.<a name=210:8></a> Had righteousness replaced the reign of sin, judgment and condemnation only could have been the effect.<a name=210:9></a> But grace reigned, yet through righteousness, (on the principle of divine righteousness, fully established), and that to eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord: a complete summary of the whole ways of God.<a name=210:10></a> Death is looked at as death here reigning by sin; condemnation was out beyond that.<a name=210:11></a>

		I turn to look at some of the words inquired of.<a name=210:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Parabasis is positive transgression of a law which exists.<a name=210:13></a> Paraptoma, though applicable to transgressions, is a more general word and with a different sense.<a name=210:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Parabasis goes beyond and transgresses an actual law or barrier set us by God.<a name=210:15></a> Hence there must be a law.<a name=210:16></a> Paraptoma fails or falls from the right condition in which we should hold ourselves.<a name=210:17></a> Transgressions do this, but every fault and failure does.<a name=210:18></a> This can be without a law.<a name=210:19></a> A Concordance will easily shew this.<a name=210:20></a> I am not aware of any case where parabasis is used without direct reference to law (or tradition), unless the verb in Acts 1: 25 (Judas parebe), and a case where another reading is preferred.<a name=210:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the difference of dorema and dorea, the former word is used but twice, here and in James 1: 17, where the mind rests in the thing given, in dorea in its quality.<a name=211:12></a> In English we use "gift" for both.<a name=211:13></a> "What did you give for that?<a name=211:14></a>" "Nothing; it is a gift.<a name=211:15></a> I have it as a dorea.<a name=211:16></a>" "What is your gift?<a name=211:17></a>" "It is a beautiful Bible, a dorema.<a name=211:18></a>" So we use "hope" for the thing hoped for and the quality.<a name=211:19></a> That dorea is the quality we see when adverbially used, dorean elabete, dorean dote.<a name=211:20></a> Dorea then is the general word which characterizes what I get.<a name=211:21></a> You may remark that all the words in verse 16 have this form, that is, are objectively looked at as a complete subsisting thing: dorema, krima, katakrima, charisma.<a name=211:22></a> In James 1: 17 we have dosis and dorema.<a name=211:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to these forms, and so in dikai -- , many of your readers may be, but perhaps all are not, aware that the ordinary rule is, that words derived from the perfect passive have their force according to the person.<a name=211:24></a> The first person is the objective thing or act, the second the doing, the third the doer, -- ma, -- sis, -- tes: as krima the judgment pronounced, the thing itself imputed; krisis judging as an act; krites the judge.<a name=211:25></a> So dosis is properly giving, dotes a giver.<a name=211:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be added here that kata compounded with a word gives intenseness to it, as echo to have, katecho, to hold, hold fast, take and keep fast; chrao, katachrao, to use as a possession what belongs to me.<a name=211:27></a> These become modified in use.<a name=211:28></a> Krima is the thing of which I am accused and for which I am judged.<a name=211:29></a> Christ's krima was put on the cross, what He was condemned

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus also dikaioma would be the objective sum total, which being accomplished gives me righteousness as far as that sum total goes: hence an ordinance, or such a fulfilment of required righteousness as makes my righteousness complete as to that.<a name=212:3></a> If it is before God, it must be according to God and absolute.<a name=212:4></a> Hence we have the dikaiomata of the saints.<a name=212:5></a> Zacharias kept the dikaiomata of the law blameless.<a name=212:6></a> It is the sum total of what is required.<a name=212:7></a> Dikaiosune is the abstract idea or the quality, the thing righteousness.<a name=212:8></a> Dikaios is what any one is; dikaiosune is that thing which having he is dikaios.<a name=212:9></a> Christ is made unto us dikaiosune.<a name=212:10></a> I have this character before God; but the dikaioma of the law is to be fulfilled in us, the full requirement of the law.<a name=212:11></a> So verse 16 speaks "of many offences" to dikaioma, to the full requirement of what must be for me to be dikaios before God.<a name=212:12></a> It is not to justify me (however true before God), but the full sum of that needed for my being accounted just.<a name=212:13></a> Justification of life is dikaiosis, the act of justifying, but being in the new place or state beyond death, it is in life as Christ is risen.<a name=212:14></a> In verse 17 I have the gift of dikaiosunes, that is, the state God sees me in or has given to me in Christ.<a name=212:15></a> But the one dikaioma is the full required total, the act which met the whole requirement.<a name=212:16></a>

		I believe I have answered, I hope rightly, all the questions you have put to me.<a name=212:17></a> The English mind is little used to the niceties of Greek language; still they are often of value to one that studies, and result in greater general clearness of statement.<a name=212:18></a> Some of the verses of this passage are as badly translated as any in the New Testament, or worse, as especially verse 18.<a name=212:19></a> Those in the parenthesis (15, 16, 17) are all much clearer, I think, if put as a question.<a name=212:20></a>

		I think we shall find these meanings of likeness and image everywhere.<a name=234:1></a> The first point in God's mind was setting man in His image (Genesis 1: 26).<a name=234:2></a> And this consequently is insisted on in verse 27.<a name=234:3></a> He set him to be like Him, to represent Him to their minds, before others; but it was also in making him like Him.<a name=234:4></a> It was not like a stone image, merely to recall, but not like; but to be before others as His image, being really like Him.<a name=234:5></a> Hence dominion also was given to him over the creation he was in.<a name=234:6></a> Hence, in Genesis 9, the grievousness of the fault of putting him to death was not that he was like God, for indeed he now was not at all like Him, but that God had set him in this place.<a name=234:7></a> If I deface the king's image, the question is not if it be like him but my defacing his image.<a name=234:8></a> In James 3: 9, on the contrary, we bless God and curse what was made like Him: what sense is there in that?<a name=234:9></a> It is not the evil come in, surely, we curse; but we curse what was made in God's likeness.<a name=234:10></a> On the other hand, we read (1 Corinthians 11: 7) "For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God" -- holds thus his place and dignity where he is.<a name=234:11></a> "The woman is the glory of the man.<a name=234:12></a>" Then Adam begets a son in his own likeness.<a name=234:13></a> Alas!<a name=234:14></a> yes; like him; upon him were the signs of what he was; not like the beasts that perish, surely, but fallen and sinful, and after his image, holding the public place in the world he did; its head no doubt, but fallen head.<a name=234:15></a> The image tends to make us suppose that of which it is the image to be like it.<a name=234:16></a> See Acts 17: 29; Psalm 50: 21.<a name=234:17></a> The "likeness" has there the simple force of the word; the "image" is the representing, to his glorifying before others, Him whose image we are.<a name=234:18></a> Now, if we look into Ephesians and Colossians, we shall find God holding a place in the one which Christ does in the other; and the former occupied with our likeness to God, the latter with His image, which Christ is perfectly.<a name=234:19></a>

		A LETTER ON THE SPRINKLING OF BLOOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Brother, <p>Allow me to say a few words on the sprinkling of blood.<a name=236:1></a> Precious and undeserved as every mercy is to us, our being sprinkled with blood is the lowest in the series; still it seems to me to have its place.<a name=236:2></a> It is most true that the blood is presented to God, and that this goes a vast deal farther than our being sprinkled with it.<a name=236:3></a> Not only was it sprinkled before the mercy-seat as well as on it, but Christ is entered in not without blood; the efficacy of His work, and blood-shedding is presented to God.<a name=236:4></a> In every case it has this character -- I mean of being presented to the eye of God.<a name=236:5></a> But this may have a double aspect, meeting the eye of God in respect of its own intrinsic value and character as perfectly glorifying God, or meeting the responsibility and need of those for whom it is shed.<a name=236:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ (John 13) as Son of man has perfectly glorified God, and as man is in the glory of God now, having glorified the Father upon earth and finished the work which He gave Him to do.<a name=236:7></a> In the Son of man's glorifying God the ground was laid for man being in the glory of God, and the counsels of God being accomplished.<a name=236:8></a> Man is reconciled to God Himself, and walks in the light as God is in the light: the veil is rent from top to bottom.<a name=236:9></a> This is the fullest character and effect of the work of Christ.<a name=236:10></a> God is glorified in Him, and, in result, man is with Him.<a name=236:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides this there was the positive responsibility of man to be met; guilt, uncleanness, and offence were all under God's eye, in those whom He would take to Himself.<a name=236:12></a> I do not speak now of renewal of heart and moral cleansing -- that is figured by the washing of water.<a name=236:13></a> But Christ came not by water only, but by water and blood.<a name=236:14></a> Nor is guilt alone put away and offence forgiven; there is a judicial purgation or cleansing of sins -- a katharismos.<a name=236:15></a> The Kopher or Kippooreem (<i>Kopher</i> or <i>Kippooreem</i>) was made or offered, death coming in, expiation, and so propitiation, blood being shed, God's character in righteousness, supreme claim, and holiness being perfectly met and even glorified.<a name=236:16></a> Further, our sins, borne and sent away on the scapegoat, never to be found; or met in an ordinary sin-offering, which in Christ was once for all, who bore our sins in His own body on the tree.<a name=236:17></a> Thus the atonement, expiation, and propitiation are perfect, and we are forgiven.<a name=236:18></a> Redemption too was accomplished.<a name=236:19></a>

		Forgiveness is expressed in Hebrew by nasa, <i>nasa</i>, to lift up, or take away; kasah, <i>kasah</i>, to cover, as in the first verse of Psalm 32, and continually elsewhere.<a name=237:1></a> The word kipper, <i>kipper</i>, the form of the verb kaphar, <i>kaphar</i>, used for making atonement, is used for appeasing or propitiating; as Jacob says, "I will appease him with the present" (Genesis 32: 20), speaking of Esau.<a name=237:2></a> In this sense it is clearly presented to God.<a name=237:3></a>

		But then, besides this, the blood was sprinkled on what was defiled.<a name=237:4></a> This was still presented to the eye of God; but to God looked at as judging, taking notice of iniquity according to righteous requirement.<a name=237:5></a> In the simple presenting it to God, He was perfectly glorified.<a name=237:6></a> In the antitype it had the worth of heavenly glory and perfect divine favour.<a name=237:7></a> We are in the light as God is in the light, without a veil, in joy, and have boldness to enter into the holiest.<a name=237:8></a> As regards the sins, they are all borne and put away, never to be remembered.<a name=237:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now comes another thought.<a name=237:10></a> I am unclean, defiled by them.<a name=237:11></a> Here I get cleansing, not in my inward disposition, but judicially, God being viewed as Judge, and my conscience purged -- not my heart and state.<a name=237:12></a> The blood is presented to God, but presented to Him as on that which had been unclean.<a name=237:13></a> This meets His eye when looking judicially at us, and He holds for perfectly clean that on which the blood is.<a name=237:14></a> Thus, when the blood was put on the lintel and the two door-posts in Egypt, God saw the blood and passed over.<a name=237:15></a> He was passing through the land judicially; where the blood was, He passed over, His judgment did not apply; otherwise He reckoned the blood a perfect answer to its requirements.<a name=237:16></a> So with things that were sprinkled in the tabernacle: the blood was put there because of the iniquities of the children of Israel, amongst whom Jehovah dwelt.<a name=237:17></a> They were thus cleansed and fit for His presence and use.<a name=237:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The case of the priests consecration was more peculiar.<a name=238:7></a> They do not stand in the place of transgressors outside as the leper.<a name=238:8></a> But they are washed with water, and the blood of the ram of consecration is put on their ear and hand and foot, as in the leper.<a name=238:9></a> So far the fitting them by water and blood is the same in consecrating the priest and cleansing the leper; and in truth what does one does the other.<a name=238:10></a> He has loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and made us kings and priests.<a name=238:11></a> But after this some of the blood on the altar was put with the oil, and all sprinkled together.<a name=238:12></a> The power of the Holy Ghost is effectual in making good in us, as dead to sin and alive to God in Him, the consecration to God manifested in Christ's death in giving Himself a sacrifice to God; so only are we cleansed in God's judgment according to the judicial estimate of God in Christ's death.<a name=238:13></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness" (Romans 8: 10).<a name=238:14></a> "The law of the Spirit of life .<a name=238:15></a>.<a name=238:16></a>.<a name=238:17></a> has made me free.<a name=238:18></a>" "For what the law could not do" God has done, when Christ was "for sin," and (He has) "condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=238:19></a>" This is judicial, but it is deliverance through death.<a name=238:20></a> Romans 8: 2, 3, bring the oil and the blood on the altar together.<a name=238:21></a> Hence we present our bodies a living sacrifice to God, holy and acceptable.<a name=238:22></a> It is still the same judicial estimate of sin according to Christ's death, only looking to realization by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=238:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards 1 Peter 1: 2, it may be taken as a general idea of its value; still it alludes to the Old Testament, when the sprinkling of blood was always the judicial cleansing of that which was sprinkled.<a name=238:24></a>

		truth may be in the apostle's mind, yet I do not quote Hebrews 9: 13, 14, because he refers to the great day of atonement and the red heifer, on neither of which persons were sprinkled with blood.<a name=239:1></a> Sprinkling, in the original, agrees with "ashes," not with "blood.<a name=239:2></a>" Still, though the force of that be very different, verse 19 shews that the sprinkling of people was not absent from his mind; and verses 21-23 shew that this was in his mind connected with purging, though I do not apply verse 19 to it.<a name=239:3></a> It was the dedication of the covenant with the sanction of death.<a name=239:4></a> But in the other verses cited, purging and blood-sprinkling on that which was to be purged go fully and expressly together in his mind, and in chapter 10: 22 this is expressly applied to the conscience -- "Having your hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.<a name=239:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the value of the precious blood of Christ does go a vast deal farther.<a name=239:6></a> We have boldness to enter into the holiest by it; we shall be in glory by it, and perfect there; we have redemption by it.<a name=239:7></a> The cleansing of the conscience is, so to speak, merely negative.<a name=239:8></a>; it clears from the sense of guilt, it meets judgment, requirement.<a name=239:9></a> On the door-posts in Egypt it shut God out, because He came as an avenging Judge.<a name=239:10></a> Still we evidently need it in this character.<a name=239:11></a> So in sprinkling everything in the tabernacle, it removed the stains of Israel's iniquities, and enabled the worship to go on.<a name=239:12></a> It entitled the leper to come into the camp and partake of all that would practically restore him to God.<a name=239:13></a> It was the basis of all, because that by which anything was sprinkled met the whole character of God -- was as fit for the mercy-seat and Him that sat upon it, as for the sinner to cleanse him.<a name=239:14></a> Still in its application as sprinkling on anything it went no farther than the cleansing from positive defilement by sin: most blessed assuredly, as it is indispensable to have it; but still, as so sprinkled and applied, only going to the judicial but perfect removal of all uncleanness in God's sight.<a name=239:15></a> I repeat, what the blood has done goes infinitely farther for us, and in glorifying God.<a name=239:16></a> The sprinkling is a purging process; the death of Christ involves all the glorifying of God in it.<a name=239:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we must make a slight difference in thought between the death of Christ and His blood-shedding; the latter being connected with purging through expiation and propitiation, while in the death we get besides the perfect testing of all that Christ was for God, and it was a perfect sweet savour as in the meat-offering.<a name=239:18></a> Still they are not disconnected, for there is sweet

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is important to remark is, that this sprinkling of blood, though every remedy comes from God's love and sovereign grace, is not in itself the outgoing of that full and infinite love -- does not take in the counsels of God, nor the work of Christ as the righteous base of those counsels, nor His so being made sin as to open the wide scene of God's glory.<a name=240:3></a> God is viewed as a righteous Judge simply, who requires what is clean in His sight, and we through grace are cleansed for Him as He so requires.<a name=240:4></a> Hence I have said that, while most precious and indispensable for us, it is the lowest step in the wonderful scheme of grace.<a name=240:5></a> In it grace is measured by our need, and God takes the character of Judge.<a name=240:6></a><br>J.<a name=240:7></a>N.<a name=240:8></a>D.<a name=240:9></a>

		Psalm 7, of which the title shews the occasion, exhibits the confidence of the beloved in His righteousness as against the reproaches of the enemy and the blasphemer, though there were none to declare His generation.<a name=242:10></a> (Compare John 18, latter part especially.<a name=242:11></a>) Compare the history of this Psalm and the latter part of 1 Peter 2, recollecting that Absalom, or that history, was the type of the latter-day trouble; the identification of the Lord with it, as exhibited in His bringing into judgment.<a name=242:12></a> He indeed entered into it that He might overcome, and so give to them "the sure mercies of David" -- the Beloved.<a name=242:13></a> But as the Jews were then with Pilate, so the Gentiles with the ungodly Jews.<a name=242:14></a> The reproach associates itself with the attacks of the ungodly; so Rabshakeh.<a name=242:15></a>

		243 Psalm 8 is the celebration by the Jews of the glory of their Head, in which of course we join.<a name=243:5></a> It is Jehovah -- His name, excellent in all the earth, and His glory now set above the heavens (so recognized by them).<a name=243:6></a> Of the application of this there can be no question.<a name=243:7></a> I do not think the omission of the sun immaterial.<a name=243:8></a> This man, in His humiliation, and as the Son of man, is considered Enosh, Ben-Adam.<a name=243:9></a> I am at present disposed to think the translation of verse 5 right.<a name=243:10></a> Observe, the last verse expresses the sense of the Jews as to their portion of the glory.<a name=243:11></a> His name excellent in all the earth, etc.<a name=243:12></a>, not the Church's -- His glory set above the heavens.<a name=243:13></a> Also observe, this is the dominion of man properly, the Jewish portion, not the fulness which is the Church's.<a name=243:14></a> He, the man, is head over all things to the Church; observe also, as Christ is identified with the remnant of the believing Jews (through grace) in the latter-day trial, when this Psalm especially has its fulfilment; so Christ was the only faithful Jew in the day of His humiliation in the flesh, and held that character as a remnant, even alone, in the midst of the opposition and hatred of unbelieving Jews, and the kings of the earth rising up against the Lord and against His anointed.<a name=243:15></a> This mystery opens out much in the giving and sacrificing of Christ for the people, though, by the power of the resurrection, it also let in the Gentiles to the blessing of the same testimony.<a name=243:16></a> Hence see the application of verse 2.<a name=243:17></a>

		Jehovah is addressed as One who has set His glory above the heavens, because it is consequent upon Christ's exaltation as man, and we can say the Church's with Him.<a name=243:18></a> Hence all the Church's portion in such passages is found in the person of Christ, the Church being united to Him, and actually takes place therefore when the Church is caught up to meet Him in the air, consequent on which the Jewish blessing begins.<a name=243:19></a>

		In Psalms 1, 2, we have the two parts of the subject of the whole book of Psalms: a righteous remnant in the midst of sinners; and the counsels of Jehovah as regards His King in Zion, His Son on the earth.<a name=243:20></a>

		Psalm 2 brings out the Messiah in the proper dignity of His person for the earth without any other connection with men -- only that He is begotten of Jehovah on the earth.<a name=244:2></a> He is Adonai, the Son, the anointed King of Jehovah in Zion (the heathen His inheritance to be broken in pieces as a potter's vessel); to be trusted in (which is due only to Jehovah); associated with Jehovah when He is raged against.<a name=244:3></a> No doubt men will rage against Him, and that in the same time and spirit; and He as sitting in heaven laugh at them.<a name=244:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have the righteous in the midst of sinners in Israel; but these last will not stand in the judgment nor in the congregation of the righteous when gathered.<a name=244:5></a> Such is in Psalm 1 the character and position of the righteous; and in Psalm 2, Adonai Messiah.<a name=244:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in fact He who should be King in Zion was to suffer, because the righteous were; and He entered into their sorrows, but as the righteous One, first it is into the sorrows of the righteous He entered.<a name=244:7></a> Hence after the great basis of the righteous in Israel and the Messiah, we have His entrance into the sorrow of the righteous and righteous sorrow.<a name=244:8></a> David naturally furnished the evident occasion for this in his history, though not alone.<a name=244:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalms 3-7 present this position of the righteous into the trials of which Christ entered.<a name=244:10></a> Psalm 3 is the confidence of faith.<a name=244:11></a> He looks to God in Zion, to Jehovah in the midst of the many that rise up against him: Jehovah is his help, and He will bless His people.<a name=244:12></a>

		Psalm 4 is a call to the God of his righteousness to hear.<a name=244:13></a> Jehovah has chosen the godly; and His countenance suffices.<a name=244:14></a> This is righteousness, as the former is trust.<a name=244:15></a>

		But Psalm 6 shews that the remnant had share (not in will: else they would not be the remnant) in this evil, and above all with Israel.<a name=244:17></a> Hence they must have to do with <i>God</i> as to it in the sense of His chastenings on His people.<a name=244:18></a> Still this makes them increasingly separate from the wicked, while mercy is looked to for deliverance.<a name=244:19></a> Compare Christ baptized of John: that is, the spirit of grace brought Him in the way

	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, Psalm 7 looks at them in conscious integrity -- Christ's actual place, not what He took, and the remnant's as renewed through grace.<a name=245:2></a> Hence not deliverance or mercy, saving and putting the enemies to shame in goodness, but righteousness is looked for: Jehovah shall judge the peoples, He will arise in His anger, whet His sword against the wicked, as He establishes the just.<a name=245:3></a> Compare the owning of Christ (though it goes farther) after being baptized.<a name=245:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 8 is the full result in Christ displayed as Son of man, to the glory of Jehovah, as the Adonai of Israel: yet I doubt not Christ is owned as such here.<a name=245:5></a> Thus the universal Adamic and the Jehovah government in Israel are united, while it reaches far wider still, because they are established in the person of the Son of God.<a name=245:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As Psalms 1 and 2 are introductory, setting up Messiah; so Psalms 3-8 are Messiah's condition as identified with the remnant pursued throughout, till, asserting His righteousness, the glory and vindication comes, true personally when He went to the Father from the world, effectually for the Jews when He returns taking the heavenly and earthly power.<a name=245:7></a> Psalms 9-15 are the discussion more particularly of the character and condition of these wicked ones, and of that wicked one, and their prevalence, Jehovah being the only resource of the godly, the contrast in Psalm 15 being of acknowledged Jewish righteousness.<a name=245:8></a>

		Psalm 9.<a name=245:9></a> The force and application of this beautiful Psalm are too obvious to need much explication; it is a learning, from the dealings of the Lord on behalf of the confiding remnant of the Jews, the faithfulness, and goodness, and full name of the Lord.<a name=245:10></a> He has in these actings manifested all the principles of His throne, so as to give the place and ground of confidence to all that seek the right.<a name=245:11></a> (See also Jeremiah 33: 9.<a name=245:12></a>)

		Psalm 10 is the extremity and helplessness of the poor remnant that put their trust in God, the occasion of God's arising so as to put out their (that is, the unbelievers) wickedness for ever.<a name=245:13></a> It expresses the cry, which is not one of fear but dependence, at the manifestation of the enemy and his grievousness.<a name=245:14></a> But his confidence and wrongness of object which makes him forget God draws out (upon the cry of the remnant, as it were) God to arise against him and put his name out of remembrance, so that destructions come to a perpetual end.<a name=245:15></a> Verses 16-18 give

		From Psalms 9, 10, which are prefatory, we enter much more into the actual historical circumstances of the latter days, the condition of the remnant, and Jehovah's positive judgment which closes the age.<a name=246:7></a> The following Psalms discuss the state, feelings, and position of the poor in spirit in the midst of this, the character of the wicked being fully brought out.<a name=246:8></a>

		Psalm 11 is the believer's trust in God.<a name=246:9></a> The principles of His dealings with the result as in man, all the foundations, are destroyed; and the righteous, though righteous, have in themselves no defence; but there is a God that sitteth above, where the workings of the ungodly do not touch the foundations of His throne; and He trieth thence the children of men, therefore trieth indeed the righteous; but it is judgment and destruction on the ungodly which floweth from His very character, in which the righteous trust.<a name=246:10></a>

		This Psalm will have its special and intended accomplishment when, the saints being taken away to the Lord, the remnant of believing Jews will by their apparent desertion by God be tried, but also give occasion to the coming forth of the infidel boast, saying, "Where is now their God?<a name=246:11></a>" Also, observe, it is a confidence that God is in covenant, He is in His holy temple, His throne being in heaven, so that He is there in covenant though above in power.<a name=246:12></a>

		Psalm 12, I think, applies to, or specially includes, the professors within the name, the nominal associates in the same hope, but who were really not of God's children.<a name=246:13></a> It is the complaint of the godly man as to the state of things around him in Zion itself -- he would not have wondered at there being no godly ones among the enemies (nations) without.<a name=246:14></a> This is alike applicable to Jesus the Lord, the man of sorrows, and the remnant upon whom His eye is in the latter day in Zion at Jerusalem.<a name=246:15></a> Glory

		Psalm 14 states the implication of the Jews as a body in the common principles of the ungodly (the Lord have mercy on them!<a name=247:8></a>).<a name=247:9></a> The fears of the godly drive them to God; of the hypocrite, to alliance with evil.<a name=247:10></a> We are warranted by the apostle in ascribing this Psalm to the Jews, and indeed it flows from the discovery that even they had corrupted their ways, so that there were none that understood.<a name=247:11></a> (Compare Isaiah 33: 14, 15.<a name=247:12></a>) Also consider Isaiah 63, as we shall see also the association by comparing it with Isaiah 53.<a name=247:13></a> The captivity is not reckoned to be brought back <i>by Jehovah</i> till the full blessing apparently.<a name=247:14></a>

		Psalm 15 seems the character of those who remain really in communion morally with Him there in the holy hill of righteousness, when righteousness has been manifested, and what the characters are of relative righteousness from a pure heart, the righteousness of our relation to one another flowing from personal faithfulness to it and our higher relations, moral uprightness.<a name=247:16></a> For I observe that in the latter-day righteousness, it is not merely external, but because God makes them that from which the external righteousness should have flowed; as He says, "I said not in that day, etc.<a name=247:17></a>, but obey my voice; " He putteth His laws in their hearts, and writeth them in their minds.<a name=247:18></a>

		Having gone through these general subjects, the direct testimony of Messiah's identification with the remnant is brought out in truth, and power of life, and resurrection; previously it was more properly His condition in consequence of identification with the nation, though of course the benefit resulted to the remnant; the wickedness of the great body being discovered by His coming to the nation (if another came in his own name, they would and will receive him); here what that value and benefit is to the remnant by virtue of Christ's resurrection.<a name=248:12></a> The association of the Church with Christ is on higher ground than even this Psalm.<a name=248:13></a> Here He associates Himself with them on earth, and knows coming into their circumstances He will still be raised; the Church is associated with Him as risen, the power of which is specially given in John 17.<a name=248:14></a>

		The workmanship of God and the law of Jehovah are manifestly (I will not say contrasted, but) distinguished.<a name=251:3></a> Thus the heavens and the firmament, day and night, are a tacit testimony by which we may say, "Have they not heard?<a name=251:4></a>" -- the declaration of God's glory, not the law declaring His righteousness.<a name=251:5></a> The Spirit only may recognize, but they declare the glory without any reference to the character or condition of those to whom they are displayed.<a name=251:6></a> Thus they are referred to in Romans 10, and become emblems of grace: see Matthew 5: 45 to the end, being Christ the Sun of it, as set in the heavens, for grace is from the heavens.<a name=251:7></a> The law looks for righteousness from the earth, therefore ever in reference.<a name=251:8></a> He maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust, where grace is the subject, loving them who do not love us, as loving our enemies, the very character of God in grace.<a name=251:9></a> This (that is, the natural testimony of benevolent goodness to sinners) was among the Gentiles (He left not Himself without witness) as the law among the Jews, and so pleaded in Romans, that every mouth may be stopped; and so grace from heaven, from the Sun of righteousness, and the rain of His Spirit, was on Gentile as well as Jew.<a name=251:10></a> Here however it is only the sun, and not the rain, because of universality; the heavens spread over all, and the sun going about from one end to the other.<a name=251:11></a> Now this symbolically shews the character of grace, its scope and working in light, and fulfilled when the Sun of righteousness arises indeed in person.<a name=251:12></a> The spiritual estimate of the law in godly acknowledgment is thus beautifully stated; but not, it appears to me, in connection with heavenly hopes or heavenly righteousness: grace has established that in the heavens.<a name=251:13></a> It is rather a godly Jew on the coming in of the millennium, the other symbolically stating what was to him in the heavens -- Jehovah being owned as the rock and God of the Spirit-taught remnant.<a name=251:14></a>

		Psalm 21 is the Jewish remnant's joy in the position of Christ with God; they perceive His acceptance and exaltation, and are now of one mind with it, and see how He did save Him, though they had "esteemed him stricken of God and afflicted" (though this is not adverted to, but the acceptance of the king).<a name=252:3></a> In a word they come to understand the resurrection and ascension of Christ the king, as verse 7, and therefore knowing their own security, that is, His power, as a believing people, and trusting in Him as the deliverer also of them in the latter day; for they see Him as a Jew, and in faith destroying His, that is, their enemies (so faith ever -- unbelief its own difficulties, faith its sins -- as the enemies of Christ); and triumph in His victory, not seeing them as associated with itself.<a name=252:4></a> So the Jews in the latter day, by faith in Him; they see Him all through as He is: it was "against thee.<a name=252:5></a>" You may compare the last verse with Isaiah 2: 11, 17.<a name=252:6></a>

		Then further it is Christ as heard, Christ as man, who speaks, "For thou hast heard me.<a name=253:9></a>" (Verse 21.<a name=253:10></a>) And as a Jew then, we have His first ministry in the congregation.<a name=253:11></a> That I apply to the saints gathered out among the Jews -- the Gentile saints being added thereto, "ye that fear the Lord, praise Him:" we know from John 20: 17 the Lord's application of this; then all the congregation as under Solomon compared with David.<a name=253:12></a> The rac aqhal is His Solomon state.<a name=253:13></a> The rest of the Psalm follows this.<a name=253:14></a> I am not so ascertained of verses 30, 31, as to their application.<a name=253:15></a> This I see that it rests in the resurrection-glory of Christ, as delivered and delivering as man.<a name=253:16></a> I should incline to think it the elect remnant: if not, it would be the latter-day Jews (this would be still the elect remnant), witnesses of His acts -- evincing who He was, and how He had delivered them; for He bore, as a Jew, their iniquities; and this was what was to be explained, for it was the strength of the dark morning which they wanted.<a name=253:17></a> (Compare Isaiah 50: 10.<a name=253:18></a>)

		Observe, there were two parts in our Lord's sufferings.<a name=254:8></a> First, that in which He was faithful to God, and presented the perfect compliance with His will in the midst of an opposing world.<a name=254:9></a> In all this His strength was, as in Isaiah 50, that His Father heard Him always: this He reckoned upon all through and looked to it in the hour of darkness.<a name=254:10></a> "All ye shall be offended because of me this night, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<a name=254:11></a>" But, next, it was the dereliction of this He felt and expresses, as in the opening language of this Psalm.<a name=254:12></a> It was here then a completely new kind of suffering, bearing, not the wrath and wickedness of man in faithfulness to God, but the wrath or alienation of God -- the bruising of Jehovah in faithfulness to man, going through His uttermost responsibility for sin, especially, as we have seen, for the Jews, to whom therefore the language as spoken in the former part of the Psalm clearly applies primarily, though the Church by the Spirit of faith is enabled to join with them in it.<a name=254:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The perfectness of our Lord through this was seen in that recognition of God's perfectness -- "But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<a name=254:14></a>" Two parts there are also of temporal trial: despite of such "a worm and no man;" and opposition, "the assembly of the wicked.<a name=254:15></a>" In both He looked for God's help.<a name=254:16></a>

		On the entreaty to hear the cry in verse 7, verse 8 seems to me to be Jehovah's expression of what had been in His heart as the foundation of it all.<a name=256:11></a> The Hebrew reads thus -- To thee, that is, Messiah, my heart said, "Seek ye my face;" the answer is, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek.<a name=256:12></a>" Then comes the confidence and pleading with the Lord thereon: Psalm 25 being confessional intercession for them in integrity; Psalm 26, the righteous integrity of Christ.<a name=256:13></a> Psalm 27 is the plea of what Jehovah is to them in the trouble, Christ having thus taken a place with them.<a name=256:14></a>

		As noticed heretofore, Psalms 1, 2 having given first the man of perfect legal righteousness and therefore flourishing in all his ways, and secondly the King exalted on Zion's throne of God, and judging and breaking to pieces hostile Gentiles, the Psalms which follow present the astonishing enigma (solved only by the deeper knowledge of the counsels of God) of Him (in whom alone these characters were true, and those united with Him in His ways, and by the working of His Spirit in them), instead of prospering (outwardly), being in misery, afflicted, despised, betrayed among God's people, and forsaken apparently of God (in one sense really), and the Gentiles domineering over them without hindrance.<a name=265:4></a> This enigma, in the pleadings of the Spirit of Christ in all the circumstances, the dealings of God in them, and the display of all His ways and depths thereby (for the real sources of it were all the depths of God's character) are brought out in these Psalms, as felt, understood, and expressed by Christ.<a name=265:5></a>

		This is a subject full of interest, because the Church can always go on this ground (and it is a ground of unfailing righteousness), and say, "not unto us.<a name=274:9></a>" The Church is set to declare the character of God, and in its weakness; therefore it cries for the vindication of this character.<a name=274:10></a> So Christ was enabled to say, "I know that thou hearest me always," but therefore also judgment must begin at the house of God.<a name=274:11></a> Thus Christ put Himself under these things, and it "became him," etc.<a name=274:12></a>, but if these things be done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?<a name=274:13></a> For the judgment and character of God run on unchanged, and as He judges by, so will He judge in, His strength; but Christ is the vindication of the principles of God, because He is their personification in that very weakness in which the question arises.<a name=274:14></a> The application of God's power settles it.<a name=274:15></a> But we must not pursue this farther here.<a name=274:16></a>

		Though the object of Psalm 70 is the same, yet its character is different; there is more confidence (I say not more faith), more appealing to God on the rectitude of His favour; its word also is (for it is brought now to a crisis), "make no long tarrying.<a name=286:5></a>" Also the humiliation of Christ, the way of others' joy, is affectingly brought forward: "Let others," saith He, "rejoice;" as for me, I am content to be humbled, to do thy will for thy sake; "but I am poor and needy," content to be in humiliation, but my joy is in this, making others to enjoy.<a name=286:6></a> It is Christ and the poor, as the object of deliverance, not of suffering, a result in fact of His faithfulness in suffering; He poor, the occasion to secure by intercession, the gladness of them that trust in deliverance, but in His poverty He pleads, that they at least might be glad.<a name=286:7></a> It is in this spirit Paul says as to the Church, "so death worketh in us, but life in you:" only there in combat, here in intercession.<a name=286:8></a>

		Psalm 71, though I believe the literal David to be the subject of it, applies, it appears to me, to the anomalous position of the Jews on the setting up of Antichrist, as David driven out by Absalom.<a name=286:9></a> This type will fully explain the psalm, looking to the Jews as similarly placed in the latter day, but finding a new place in resurrection, as Daniel 12: 2; though that rather applies to another portion of the remnant yet scattered: this to a body of them, in, but now driven out of the land, though not permanently, the last time of Jacob's trouble, closing the typical David history, for then He takes His Solomon power or state.<a name=286:10></a> Psalm 70 was personal feeling, therefore, of David properly.<a name=286:11></a> The positive application of this psalm is to the Jews as apparently utterly cast off again in the close, the very close of their eventful history.<a name=286:12></a> Verse 20 is the confidence, but there is the faith of God's elect in the Lord now after the sufferings of Christ explained, clearly recognized in the outset.<a name=286:13></a> It was a Jewish faith of old; it was however to be as in a resurrection, not in what was of old.<a name=286:14></a> Solomon, not David, was to build the house -- still not forsaken, till God's strength and salvation was to them, to that generation, and those that should come.<a name=286:15></a> They should not bear fruit so

		Psalm 80 is thoroughly and properly Jewish, more accurately of Israel; for it has no specific relation to any particular portion, save as Joseph more especially implied and involved the land.<a name=295:1></a> The "Shepherd of Israel" is addressed -- He that "leads Joseph like a flock" -- He that "sits between the cherubim," the place of His rest and power of old in Israel, of divine ordinance, attributes, and the throne.<a name=295:2></a> The Jews being first restored into the trials and exercises of the latter day, and concerned in all that related to Antichrist, the restoration of the others, and their presence in the land, more particularly involved the full coming of the nations.<a name=295:3></a> This psalm, as all in this book, recognizes Israel as such before God -- "the vine that had been brought out of Egypt.<a name=295:4></a>" Yet it is before the Son of man has taken His gathering power amongst them; but faith looks at the whole scene before God, without the judicial details being brought in.<a name=295:5></a> But it is their call of God as the Shepherd of His people to take His place amongst them -- to stir up His strength and come and help them.<a name=295:6></a> It turns therefore to His presence among them in the wilderness, passing by all between as lost; and note here how judgment does the same thing by the Holy Ghost in Stephen -- "Did ye serve me by the space of forty years in the wilderness?<a name=295:7></a> yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.<a name=295:8></a>" The present desolation of Israel is referred to their sin in the wilderness -- sin which the prophetic Spirit alone notices.<a name=295:9></a> Then consequently Solomon's house is passed by, and set aside as utterly worthless; so Anna withal waited for redemption as much as Daniel in Babylon.<a name=295:10></a> Here faith consequently goes back to God's part in it: "Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt and planted it, and it is laid waste.<a name=295:11></a>" But, the grace that brought them out and planted them being thus referred to, they can set themselves, even in the desolation (for grace and God's dealings are referred to), into His hand for deliverance, to be turned again and this vine visited.<a name=295:12></a> But it is as looking down from heaven, whither as it were God was retired; and they felt it.<a name=295:13></a> Still thence He could look down in grace, if they had driven away and forfeited His presence here.<a name=295:14></a> All through it is God's actings which are referred to.<a name=295:15></a> Hence, there is a branch brought in, which He had made strong for Himself, even the Son of man which He had strengthened, the man of His right hand.<a name=295:16></a> "So," they say, "will we not go back from thee.<a name=295:17></a>" "Turn us again" is their cry.<a name=295:18></a> We have not then the judicial distinctive details, but the

		It is remarkable too to observe, that as the remnant look back here, in their own thought of it, to this as the universal condition of Israel, all their history being blotted out morally (which was the trial merely, if fruit could be got, yea even to sending the Son, and there was none), so Stephen, or the Spirit in Stephen, just sets them in that closing scene of Israel's conditional history, exactly on this ground, where the remnant, in their own sense of it in their souls, take it up.<a name=304:12></a> "Did ye offer to me, O ye house of Israel, slain beasts by the space of forty years in the wilderness?<a name=304:13></a> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, images which ye made to worship them; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.<a name=304:14></a>" They sinned in the wilderness: hence their present condition.<a name=304:15></a> All else was rejection of reclaiming dealings, and just filling up the measure of their sins.<a name=304:16></a> Of Solomon's house it could be said, "Where is the house ye will build me and what is the place of my rest?<a name=304:17></a> Hath not my hand made all these things?<a name=304:18></a>" In this Psalm then the law is discussed: Christ with them or for them, one with them now in sympathy under it.<a name=304:19></a>

		Let us take these Psalms in detail successively.<a name=308:6></a> Psalm 90 is the Spirit of Christ in Israel appealing to these great truths in the time of, and out of, their distress and humiliation.<a name=308:7></a> He who created all things has the power, and is their God.<a name=308:8></a> It is by His anger they are consumed, not by man's power or will.<a name=308:9></a> He could say "return," when He turned to destruction.<a name=308:10></a> It is the appeal of faith in the enlightening power of the Spirit of Christ, righteous in its reference to God, and going on the ground of His Almighty power, which indeed was the source of the whole blessing to come in.<a name=308:11></a> It was real humiliation for them.<a name=308:12></a> Nothing but divine power could restore them, ascribing all supreme glory to God, and righteous in owning His hand and their estate.<a name=308:13></a> The secret of God was with them, was in their cry; it was the cry of prophetic faith, consequently that which can draw all from God's power as above our evils supremely.<a name=308:14></a> "Return, O Jehovah, how long?<a name=308:15></a>" Faith always reckons also on the unchangeable fidelity of God to Himself, and therefore to the relationships He has by grace put Himself into with others; and therefore, whatever the failure of man in his responsibilities, looks up out of this to what God is: "Jehovah, thou hast been our dwelling-place to all generations.<a name=308:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Egypt, Babylon, or the wilderness, made no difference in this: and the Spirit, which could sing in the wilderness, "Thou hast guided them by thy strength to thy holy habitation," could recur to the blessed truth across all the circumstances of an exercised people, or the rebellions which were the occasions of them.<a name=308:17></a> The Psalm then takes up this character of the Lord.<a name=308:18></a>

		I add a few words on the moral condition of Israel as using it.<a name=309:9></a> It addresses the Lord at once as the God who had always been the dwelling-place of the nation; He who was God before the world was, whose power could turn man to destruction, and whose word recalls him.<a name=309:10></a> Israel was before Him in ruin -- his misery felt as caused by his iniquity -- all before Him; his days passed away in His wrath -- terrible yet now humbled condition -- a true state of soul wrought of God, though not fully knowing God.<a name=309:11></a> He prays that, in the sense of their ruin, marked in the shortening of their days -- their state of vanity, they may learn the wisdom of reference to God.<a name=309:12></a> Praying, "Return, O Jehovah," that He their Lord might repent Him, casts them entirely on mercy, desiring it early, owning (another point of truth) the affliction as of Him, that His work might appear to His servants, and the beauty of Jehovah their God be upon them.<a name=309:13></a> Such is the prayer of the Spirit in Israel looking for blessing; humbled, but calling on the name of Jehovah, the name of covenant and perpetuity as their God, yet in mercy, but in benediction on the work of their hands.<a name=309:14></a> It is a prayer properly to Jehovah on His power, as known amongst them, revealed to them of old by that name, faith applying its covenant obligations to their present circumstances.<a name=309:15></a> This psalm then is more abstract and speaks from a higher ground, yet more especially Jewish, but Jewish in what Jehovah their God is rather than in relation to circumstances.<a name=309:16></a> Nothing to me can be more calm, confident, and beautiful -- the confidence of righteous humility in faith: the Spirit of Christ -- than this psalm.<a name=309:17></a>

		But there is a knowledge of the secret place of the possessor of heaven and earth which is given only in grace.<a name=310:3></a> "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty:" such is the announcement of Abraham's God, the God of promise and covenant.<a name=310:4></a> Messiah answers that He will say of Jehovah, He is His refuge, His fortress, His God.<a name=310:5></a> This is the secret place of the Most High.<a name=310:6></a> The promises of almighty security consequently are attached to it.<a name=310:7></a> In verse 9 Israel regard Messiah as having taken their God for His God, and declare with joy His exaltation and security.<a name=310:8></a> In verse 14 we have Jehovah's announcement of His mind as resting in Him who set His love upon Him.<a name=310:9></a> Thus this psalm has descended from the abstract and fundamental supremacy of Creator to the place of covenant relationship resting in promise to Abraham, in accomplishment of blessing in the millennium, when the Melchizedek blessing shall come upon him that through Jesus shall know the secret of the Lord<a href="#310:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>; and the security of the power of the God of promise shall keep them through, while Israel bless Messiah, because He, the heir indeed of the promise and centre of the blessing, has taken their God as His God, shewing that the secret of the Lord was theirs and for them.<a name=310:10></a> The psalm has tacitly assumed the existence of the evil and the judgment on it.<a name=310:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 16-19 we have the support of the Lord under, and in, the deep sense of the evil, and the appeal as to the impossibility of the Lord's tolerating a joint throne of iniquity; and consequently the judgment follows in a confidence first expressed by Messiah Himself, verse 22, and then associating all the people with Him, verse 23.<a name=312:16></a>

		Psalm 98.<a name=314:7></a> As Psalm 96 was millennial joy introduced into the earth and among the Gentiles (these two things being united in the title and name of Jehovah's power -- the possessor of heaven and earth, and whose union we have seen to be the great object of these Psalms, and the Jews the providential centre), this psalm introduces the providential centre, and calls on them to sing as those in whose behalf the Lord has recently appeared.<a name=314:8></a> Jehovah alone in power has gotten the victory.<a name=314:9></a> Jehovah's interference recalls what is properly Jewish, and we find it distinctly revealed, when the conflict is the subject of the prophecy as in Zechariah 9.<a name=314:10></a> This interference is here celebrated.<a name=314:11></a> It is not judgment from heaven but on earth; so it is not now "the heavens declare his righteousness," but He has shewn it in the sight of the heathen.<a name=314:12></a> It is not a call on the Jews to go forth and shew the glory and greatness of Jehovah to the heathen, but to the celebration of Jehovah's deliverances and salvation in their behalf now manifested.<a name=314:13></a> "He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel.<a name=314:14></a>" Grace, and faithfulness to promises founded in grace, are the celebrations or songs of Messiah, and the salvation of their (Israel's) God has been seen to all the ends of the earth.<a name=314:15></a> This salvation, it seems to me, is specially after the manifestation of Messiah from heaven; and, they being accepted, the exercise of Jehovah's power in their favour upon earth (as already noted from Zechariah) on till Gog is destroyed.<a name=314:16></a> Hence the Jews call on the heathen to celebrate, not Messiah or the Jews to go and summon them with the declaration of the subject of their joy, but Jehovah is styled the King.<a name=314:17></a> The character of the joy and its celebration is Jewish joy, as constantly seen in the Psalms, and in the temple worship.<a name=314:18></a> Hence also the heavens are not called on to rejoice, nor so much creation as the world, its inhabitants, and the symbols of mightiness and strength, though in terms of the creation.<a name=314:19></a> The coming of Jehovah to judge the earth is still the great theme, but here as

		therefore is introduced in Psalm 102 as looking to the Lord, and crying to Him from all the consequences to Himself of the redemption of creation and the sin of His people (compare fully Hebrews 2); and, <i>nota bene</i>, the sin of Israel forces Messiah into the position which sustains her (what marvels of grace and depths of wisdom!<a name=317:1></a>); and not only so, but into the place of far deeper counsels of grace and glory.<a name=317:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This deep and wonderful psalm takes up the suffering of Christ as the pivot of the whole Jewish blessing -- the accomplishment of the divine counsels, and the glory and revelation of the divine perfection and excellency of Christ Himself.<a name=317:3></a> Messiah presents Himself in the midst of Israel before Jehovah, as utterly desolate, and under the reproach of His enemies all the day, but therein with a sentiment of its source far deeper -- "Thine indignation and wrath.<a name=317:4></a>" He had been exalted into the place of Messiah, for so He speaks here, as "one chosen out of the people" -- Jehovah's elect, His servant whom He upholds; and now, cast down, He is under indignation and wrath, His days are as gone.<a name=317:5></a> But He has identified Himself, as we have seen in Psalm 91, with the name and promises of Jehovah; He, as a shadow, gone, for the reproach too, and fidelity of Jehovah, but with this word, Jehovah is for ever; His support and faith perfect when there was nothing but Jehovah, and this is the essence and difficulty of faith in which Messiah was perfect, as in everything.<a name=317:6></a> On this ground of the stability abstractedly of Jehovah, and His remembrance, He turns to the promise and consequent necessity of the benediction of this, whereon His name was set before men.<a name=317:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The humiliation of Messiah, as the occasion of His necessity and cry of faith, is just the spring of hope for all the ruin into which He is entered (and out of which the cry comes), as to the redeemed people only when consequently united to Him in this cry, and faith understanding the ruin.<a name=317:8></a> Long time He had held His peace, but He would arise and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour her was come, for His servants take pleasure in her stones; they also think of the thoughts of Jehovah towards her, and their heart is identified with what Jehovah's heart and promise was identified with.<a name=317:9></a> This was a time of blessing.<a name=317:10></a> Thus by the manifestation of His faithfulness (for she was as in the dust, but that Jehovah had a title of His own and exercised it), the heathen would fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth His glory, for it was manifested.<a name=317:11></a> Thus Messiah put

		forth, and His heart finds rest in, the faithfulness of Jehovah towards the object of Jehovah's especial regard -- the place and the city He had chosen for Himself; and He rejoices over the glory and blessing, by that faithfulness, of the scene and subject of His tears, who would have so often gathered her children.<a name=318:1></a> But entering into the heart of Jehovah towards it, He must for its accomplishment enter into all its responsibility and ruin, and in this the Psalm presents Him.<a name=318:2></a> Further, when Jehovah builds up Zion, He will appear in His glory in behalf of the poor destitute, He hath looked down from heaven to loose those appointed to death, for such was the critical state of the people of Jehovah there at this time, and this that His name might be fully declared in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem; so that the peoples and nations should be gathered there to serve Jehovah.<a name=318:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 23 and the beginning of 24, the voice of Messiah again is heard reciting His own part in the sorrow, and presenting His case for Him.<a name=318:4></a> He had weakened His strength in His journey, and shortened His days.<a name=318:5></a> He, fearing, cries "O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days," submits to the power of death, as made liable to it and bowing under it but appealing to Jehovah against it.<a name=318:6></a> But as, when the humiliation of Messiah was declared, the glory of Messiah and the faithfulness of the promises were announced; so when He bows His head before Jehovah in death in perfect submission (for entreaty to Jehovah against, is when real, perfect submission to), the answer of the divine glory of His person at once breaks forth.<a name=318:7></a> He was Eternal -- He might die, but He was Eternal; -- He was the Creator, however He had taken the responsibility of the creature.<a name=318:8></a> The creature would be folded up as a garment, and be changed by Him; but He was the existing One, and His years would have no end.<a name=318:9></a> Further, as the Messiah, the children of those that served Him would continue, and their seed would be established before Him.<a name=318:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have gone very simply through the thread and connection of the Psalm, but if studied by the Spirit in faith, it is wonderful in presenting the humiliation, and that even to death -- the glory and divinity of the Lord Jesus -- the Creator in the ruin of His creature -- as the power of redemption, and this, withal, in the accomplishment of His ordered promises on earth, of which Zion is the centre, Jehovah the name of faithfulness, power, and truth.<a name=318:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here the circumstances of Christ connected with all this Jehovah-blessing.<a name=319:2></a> He is Jehovah.<a name=319:3></a> It begins with the suffering of Christ (resuming all this position from the first two psalms), instead of blessing in the midst of Israel.<a name=319:4></a> He is a suppliant in the midst of creation (but note this is the salvation of the nation, for He has identified Himself with it), suppliant to Jehovah, for this psalm is all of Jehovah the God of the Jews (having title to the earth also, nothing could exceed His descension and kevnwsi"), still strange as all that might be, as He declares, for His faith and truth fail not, Jehovah endures for ever.<a name=319:5></a> This faith is in the sufferings of Christ, the pillar of the nation; He holds them up, while they reject Him, the evidence of their evil, even though against Him, being the occasion of His intercession and effective sufferings.<a name=319:6></a> Then saith He to Jehovah, "Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion.<a name=319:7></a>" The set time was come: utter desolation, no help but the memorial of it presented by the Spirit of Jesus.<a name=319:8></a> So (for Jehovah was interested in it) the heathen would fear Jehovah's name.<a name=319:9></a> Observe how He keeps up the thought of identifying Jerusalem and Jehovah, even in her dust.<a name=319:10></a> Then comes a revelation, "when Jehovah shall build up Zion, he shall appear," etc.<a name=319:11></a> In mercy to the destitute, He hath looked down from heaven for this -- to declare the name of Jehovah in Zion (such was the manner of it): and the peoples and the kingdoms are gathered together to serve Jehovah.<a name=319:12></a> If this be all so; if He hears the destitute and delivers; if this be the name of Jehovah and His glory in Jerusalem, how concerning the Lord?<a name=319:13></a> His strength was weakened and His days shortened.<a name=319:14></a> He cried in this position to His God not to be cut off; then the glory of the Lord bursts forth in all its splendour, "Of old thou hast laid the foundation of the earth.<a name=319:15></a>" Creation hangs on this smitten poor one.<a name=319:16></a> He made it.<a name=319:17></a> Creation shall change -- shall be rolled up -- renewed -- but "<i>Atta hu</i>!<a name=319:18></a>" He exists ever <i>the same</i>.<a name=319:19></a> Such might have been His work, but His nature was eternal existence.<a name=319:20></a> His years in time shall have no end.<a name=319:21></a> Such is the rejected Messiah.<a name=319:22></a> Not only shall Jerusalem be the scene then of His praise, but all creation shall welcome the return of the Lord in blessing, relieved by these very circumstances.<a name=319:23></a> In the midst of it, the children of His servants should have an abiding portion -- those honoured who honoured Him -- and their seed shall be established before Him.<a name=319:24></a> Thus is the power of this blessing of

		In Psalm 103 we have the answer to all this in praise, telling what Jehovah is.<a name=320:2></a> It is Messiah praising in the midst of the congregation, and praising on the ground of a universal blessing, co-extensive with the efficacy of His sufferings; and the scene, the fall and ruin into the centre and depths of which His sufferings entered; and withal, with the competency to bless in return of the principles and glory of Jehovah which were dishonoured by, and in question therefore in, the state of ruin into which Messiah had entered, that He Jehovah might be glorified.<a name=320:3></a> Of this the centre is Jerusalem, though it is recognized (as we know more fully) that He has set His throne in the heavens.<a name=320:4></a> In this great transaction and its result man is manifested to be but grass: so in the same scene in Isaiah 40 the same discovery is made.<a name=320:5></a> But in His dealings with Israel the faithfulness, patience, healing mercy, consideration of their feebleness and low estate, deep interest in His people, mercy and righteousness that failed not, are all brought out to light before the children of men.<a name=320:6></a> He had shewn His ways in intimacy to Moses (see Exodus 34 and Deuteronomy 32), and His public acts accordant with them to all Israel; and this is remembered in Messiah's song, thus shewing the eternal character of Jehovah, "the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=320:7></a>" But through Messiah's mediation and suffering for the necessary glory of Jehovah, the full tide of His righteousness and compassion can flow towards them in forgiveness, healing and blessing; and all their sins were put far away from them, and they were renewed in strength.<a name=320:8></a> This, to wit Israel, being the centre of revealed display of these dealings and the whole character of Jehovah, creation is brought in as chorus of His praise.<a name=320:9></a> The throne in the heavens is seen and known.<a name=320:10></a> The great truths of the Church's place there remain unrevealed (that is, our portion), but creation and providence are brought forth in all their parts in the fulness, or summoned to the fulness of praise.<a name=320:11></a> Jehovah's throne is in the heavens, His kingdom rules over all; faith ever recognizes the title, but this celebrates its accomplishment and existence.<a name=320:12></a> The angels, all the hosts of Jehovah of hosts, His ministers that do His pleasure, all His works in all places of His dominion delivered and rescued from evil, are summoned to join in the praise of Jehovah now glorified in them -- praise now easy, because they now enjoy the fulness of blessing of all that He is, and reflect that glory and

		In Psalms 105 and 106 we have, as closing this scene of creation and Israel's joy, the dealings of Jehovah with Israel: first, in the supremacy of grace and according to pure promise; and, secondly, the government which acts in evil, consequently in grace, for God cannot govern where grace has not come in; and here specially it is His people as to, and notwithstanding, their multiplied offences and faults.<a name=323:2></a> This is not the period of the final rest of the Jews, but it is the period of their restoration according to covenant and promise.<a name=323:3></a> Their final rest is when Messiah, present in glory, has gathered even all the scattered ones from the four winds to enjoy the fulness of His blessing and repose; when their eyes shall see the King in His beauty, and the inhabitant of Zion, unhindered in all the land, sees the land which is farthest from it in peace.<a name=323:4></a> This is the proper and full gathering of Israel according to Matthew 24; and it would seem, though more generally, Isaiah 11 and 27.<a name=323:5></a> What precedes is partly judgment on them, partly destruction of the nations, and constitutes the great acts of royal session in order to bless them in peace, as found in Zechariah 13 for example, and Ezekiel 20; not simple restoration in blessing, but the dealings of God with them, purging them, and acting for that purpose.<a name=323:6></a>

		The division of this closing Psalm 118 (closing, that is, as to this subject) is this: first, the celebration of the truth for Israel.<a name=333:6></a> Compare 1 Chronicles 16: 34 and the structure of that Psalm very particularly; 2 Chronicles 5: 13; 7: 3; Ezra 3: 11; Psalms 106, 107, 136.<a name=333:7></a> The Psalm in 1 Chronicles 16 is a summary of the heads of what Jews are interested in as the ground, exhibition, and resting-place of confidence in the latter-day, but there only the blessing and prayer; for it supposes the first step of blessings in accomplishment, and accordingly can rehearse together the statement, "Mercy endureth for ever," and omit the intermediate miseries.<a name=333:8></a> Then the summons to each sort of persons to use the song, verse 5, Messiah for Israel and trust in Jehovah, and that answered to verse 9.<a name=333:9></a> Verse 10, the circumstance of Israel in the latter day as to the nations.<a name=333:10></a> Verse 13, the adversary's part, this Satan, and by Antichrist, but the adversary.<a name=333:11></a> Verse 18, Jehovah's hand in it -- chastening, but preserving.<a name=333:12></a> Verses 10-13, therefore, are in a manner a common subject.<a name=333:13></a> Verse 19, Messiah takes the advance, being in this now living, accepted position, and then it is the Lord's relation with Israel in connection with Messiah, not Messiah's connection with Israel in respect of the evil -- that was once true.<a name=333:14></a> Messiah's grace in subjecting Himself to their sorrows in this, though they esteemed Him stricken, is the way by which He can take them (now again at the last recognizing Him) with Him into the blessedness which (as their head, as the righteous Son) He is going into.<a name=333:15></a> The Lord's own use of it makes its force and application manifest.<a name=333:16></a>

		THE BASKET OF FIRST-FRUITS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That it applies to Israel's possession of the land at any time is plain.<a name=353:1></a> The last words of the first verse imply as much: "And it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and <i>dwellest therein</i>, that thou shalt take," etc.<a name=353:2></a> Exodus 23: 19; Leviticus 23; and Numbers 18: 13, fully confirm this.<a name=353:3></a> It was a standing ordinance in the land.<a name=353:4></a> The spirit of the offering is also clear: a full profession before God that they possessed the things which He had promised to their fathers.<a name=353:5></a> Their father had been a Syrian ready to perish, a slave in Egypt, and redemption had brought them out thence, and into the good land of which they were now in full enjoyment.<a name=353:6></a> Therefore were they come up to own the Giver in offering to Him the first-fruits.<a name=353:7></a> They <i>worshipped</i> and <i>rejoiced</i> in every good thing Jehovah had given them, and this in <i>grace</i>, with the Levite and the stranger.<a name=353:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How all this bears on the way in which the believer now makes the offering is evident.<a name=353:9></a> All his worship is but the answer, the reflex, and bringing back to God of the fruit -- the first-fruits, if true faith and godliness be there -- of what God has revealed Himself to be to him, and of that heavenly joy into which He has introduced him.<a name=353:10></a> Such is properly what the Lord calls "that which is your own;" for on earth we are pilgrims, in the desert it is not "ours.<a name=353:11></a>" The characteristic of piety will be found to be, in scripture, and everywhere, and ever, that the first effect of blessing is turning back <i>to</i> God and owning it there, not the personal enjoyment of it, which, without this, turns us from God.<a name=353:12></a> The love that gave it is more present than even the gift.<a name=353:13></a> See Eliezer at the well (Genesis 24), the cleansed Samaritan leper (Luke 17), and a multitude of other examples.<a name=353:14></a> He who gives is more and more before us than the gift itself.<a name=353:15></a> This is the elevating character of divine enjoyment.<a name=353:16></a> Then surely we do enjoy it, freely and blessedly, and the stream of grace flows out to the Levite and the stranger -- to those whose hearts are in need, and who have not an inheritance in the land we enjoy.<a name=353:17></a> It is, then, the return of the heart to God in the enjoyment of the heavenly blessings which are the fruit of redemption.<a name=353:18></a> The Christian too can enjoy or so worship when he has the consciousness that heavenly things are his.<a name=353:19></a> It is the profession, the open

		avowal, of this; if he has not this consciousness, neither can he bring his basket of first-fruits.<a name=354:1></a> "A Syrian ready to perish" was a thing past.<a name=354:2></a> The worship was grounded on possession of the blessing and on a known inheritance -- type of sitting "in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=354:3></a>" It is not thankfulness for promises, however surely <i>this</i> has its place, but thankfulness that they <i>are accomplished</i> -- in Christ, yea and amen.<a name=354:4></a> Redemption is owned as an accomplished thing that has put us in possession, though for the redemption of <i>the body</i> we have yet to wait.<a name=354:5></a>

		Indeed, this is the general character of Deuteronomy.<a name=354:6></a> It is not drawing near to God in the sanctuary by means of sacrifice, but the people -- not the priest <i>merely</i> for them -- are themselves in possession, and hence the sentiments towards God Himself, and towards the desolate of men, in the enjoyment of the blessing; for free grace becomes him who has received all through grace.<a name=354:7></a> Compare Deuteronomy 16, where even the various degrees of this are traced in the three principal feasts of Jehovah.<a name=354:8></a> Hence also the responsibility of the people as to the continuance of the enjoyment of the blessing; for it is in the path of obedience that such enjoyment is known.<a name=354:9></a> Deuteronomy is a book of the deepest practical instruction in this respect.<a name=354:10></a>

		The will of the flesh is the practical principle of all sin.<a name=355:15></a> Will is not obedience to God, and hence is sin in its very principle, but being the will of the flesh shews itself in the flesh's lusts.<a name=355:16></a> It does not turn towards God, but the contrary, and does turn towards what the flesh desires.<a name=355:17></a> It is the acting of the nature at enmity with God's.<a name=355:18></a> <i>Suffering</i> in the flesh is the opposite of this will, or acting of the nature.<a name=355:19></a> This is applied both to Christ and to us; but in the case of Christ it is applied to His death.<a name=355:20></a> (See 1 Peter 3: 18.<a name=355:21></a>) Rather than be disobedient in anything, and perfect in obedience, from the divine surrender of all will in Psalm 40 to take the place of obedience, He goes on to death, as man's weakness, Satan's power, God's wrath, and was obedient through all these, and in the former passed through both the latter rather than not obey.<a name=355:22></a> He was perfect in obedience, not sparing the flesh in anything, and died to sin once; that is, He went on to death in its fullest forms, rather than withdraw from doing God's will, or have one of His own.<a name=355:23></a> His nature<a href="#355:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> died rather than He would have a will or aught but God's will.<a name=355:24></a> Thus sin found no inlet or place.<a name=355:25></a> An apple served to lead Adam into sin; nothing could lead Christ into it.<a name=355:26></a> Not only He had never any sin, but He went through everything that could induce will,

		All is to be brought into the light, all thought of concealment rooted out and destroyed in the heart; but God will not maintain the influence of men and reputation by presenting a manifestation to them in the word, which is exactly what falsifies the moral judgment; and He does not.<a name=359:17></a> If the heart is comforting itself with the thought it will not be known, He breaks through the heart's deceit relentlessly, and says it will be known: everything hidden shall come to light.<a name=359:18></a> He does not neutralize His own authority and destroy the purity of moral principle, in saying it will be known before your brethren in that day.<a name=359:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would first say, to remove what obscures the passage, that I am satisfied that the passage is general, and embraces all men.<a name=360:2></a> I cannot conceive how the context can leave a shadow of doubt on this point in any mind.<a name=360:3></a> It ought not.<a name=360:4></a> It is not a question of the time of appearing, but of the fact.<a name=360:5></a> Secondly, it is very important to remark that as regards the saints there is no calling in question their righteousness.<a name=360:6></a> The manner of their arrival before the judgment-seat, and their state in arriving, clearly shew this, as well as the declaration of the Lord (John 5) that they shall not come into judgment.<a name=360:7></a> But how do they arrive on high?<a name=360:8></a> "I go to prepare a place for you.<a name=360:9></a> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am there ye may be also.<a name=360:10></a>" Christ comes Himself to complete His work of perfect grace in bringing us there.<a name=360:11></a> In that state we "wait for the Lord Jesus Christ [as] Saviour, who shall change our vile body and fashion it like his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.<a name=360:12></a>" (Philippians 3: 20.<a name=360:13></a>) We shall be already like Christ, conformed to the image of God's Son, bearing the image of the heavenly.<a name=360:14></a> He who sits to judge according to His righteousness, according to what He is, <i>is</i> our righteousness.<a name=360:15></a>

		Remark the true effect on a right state of mind as here described by the apostle.<a name=361:4></a> First, not a thought of judgment as to righteousness has any place whatever.<a name=361:5></a> The judgment-seat only awakens that love which thinks of those still exposed to it.<a name=361:6></a> "Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.<a name=361:7></a>" Secondly, it is realized so as to put him who realized it responsibly in the presence of God.<a name=361:8></a> <i>Now</i> "we <i>are</i> manifested to God.<a name=361:9></a>" Oh, what a healthful and blessed thing this is for the soul!<a name=361:10></a> The rest is a mere effect readily hoped for -- "I trust that we are manifested in your consciences.<a name=361:11></a>" The other considerations produced a conduct proper to have this effect; but if a man was before God it was of little matter, it did not affect the soul, save in the desire of others' good and Christ's glory.<a name=361:12></a> This double effect will certainly be produced in any such manifestation before others, and we then shall as certainly desire nothing else.<a name=361:13></a>

		The shame of a nature we have left will not be there then; the just judgment of evil will.<a name=361:14></a> I say this, however, in respect of the present condition of the soul.<a name=361:15></a> Anxiety on this point is a proof that the soul is not wholly in the sight of God.<a name=361:16></a> There it disappears because we are wholly there.<a name=361:17></a> Scripture never brings in the thought of brethren as concerned in this manifestation, and could not; but it does maintain, in the fullest way, manifestation in the light, so that if the heart reserves anything -- has not brought it wholly out before God, it should be ill at ease.<a name=361:18></a> We certainly are perfectly manifested to the Lord, consciously I mean (for we always are so), and to ourselves.<a name=361:19></a> If it be for His glory that anything should be known to the saints also, we shall not regret it then; but our proper full manifestation is certainly to God, and in our own souls.<a name=361:20></a> All that is needed to verify the government of God will, I doubt not, be made manifest.<a name=361:21></a> All that has been through evil sought to be hidden, so that the heart was false -- the counsel of the heart evil, will be brought to light; but where men have walked in the light, the counsels of the heart, however man may have judged them, will be made plain; for in that day God will judge the secrets of men's hearts.<a name=361:22></a> His grace and His government may have wrought all this in this world, and some men's sins and good works go before to judgment, but those that are otherwise cannot be hid.<a name=361:23></a>

		THE ANTICHRIST, PROPERLY SO CALLED

		After all the grave and wise speculations on the last trump, I strongly suspect it is merely an allusion to military matters.<a name=365:1></a> Somewhere in Josephus War, and perhaps in other books, we have the order of the breaking up of a Roman camp.<a name=365:2></a> At the last trump they all break up and march forward.<a name=365:3></a> Now, I acknowledge that scripture interpretation is not to be borrowed from without; but I have seen only tortured linkings with other passages within.<a name=365:4></a> I am content to take the general idea of the last public call of God relating to the Church, and leave it there.<a name=365:5></a> But what suggested the image, I suspect, was what I say: just as keleusma, in 1 Thessalonians 4, beyond controversy, is a similar military term used to a similar purpose.<a name=365:6></a> Matthew 24: 31 ("And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet"), I have not the smallest shadow of a doubt, applies to the assembling of the Jews (elect, as in Isaiah 65) after Christ is come.<a name=365:7></a>

		LUKE 21 COMPARED WITH MATTHEW 24
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Luke 21, it is much more historical because it opens out, as revealing the Son of man, the period in which Israel is set aside and not counted in its history, or what concerns the Gentiles.<a name=365:8></a> Hence the Spirit records no inquiry of "the sign of thy coming and of the end of the age," but the general history in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem.<a name=365:9></a> Thus, from verse 9 to verse 19 inclusive, we have the state of things from after the Lord's death until the encircling of Jerusalem by the Roman armies, and no mention made of the abomination of desolation, and verse 20 gives the reply to the question of verse 7, founded on verse 6.<a name=365:10></a> The statement accordingly says nothing of the tribulation such as never was, but that vengeance then comes on the people and city that all may be accomplished.<a name=365:11></a> This still continues, and will continue, Jerusalem being trodden down, till the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, in the close of the Gentile dominion begun in Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=365:12></a> Then the fact is revealed of the state of things at the close of the dominion of Gentile power -- signs in sun, moon, and stars; on earth, distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring (the last expression shewing, I think, that the words are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the prophetical revelation, which presents, it seems to me, little difficulty.<a name=366:3></a> The exhortation which follows may suggest more; at the same time it offers some remarkable helps as to the use of expressions.<a name=366:4></a> For example, "this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled" (verse 32) proves necessarily, either that "generation" must be taken in an extended sense, as in Deuteronomy 32: 5, 20, and as in other passages, or that "all" could only apply to the establishment of the state of things at the setting aside judicially of the Jewish people, because we have the treading down of Jerusalem for a long continuous period revealed.<a name=366:5></a> Hence we have to seek the guidance of the Spirit for the application of the passage, there being an incipient accomplishment at the destruction or treading down of Jerusalem, its desolation, vengeance, etc.<a name=366:6></a>, which subsists still, and a far fuller one at the close preceding the coming of the Son of man.<a name=366:7></a> Hence the Holy Ghost records here an expression which may apply to both: "Know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.<a name=366:8></a>" I do not doubt that this had a certain accomplishment in the absolute suppression of the Jewish order, but no fulfilment; and that the kingdom of God will be established by the coming of the Son of man after the signs of verses 25, 26.<a name=366:9></a> Note also, that this passage precludes the possibility of the application of "the coming of the Son of man" to the destruction of Jerusalem, because we have already had the long treading down consequent on the encompassing with armies.<a name=366:10></a> The full natural application of verses 28-31, then, is to the close, when, these signs having taken place, the full deliverance of the Jewish faithful will take place.<a name=366:11></a> So verse 35 has a limited application to Judea or Palestine; but it is evident to me that there is the larger application of the coming of the day of the Lord on the

		In Matthew 24 the Lord passes over all the times of the Gentiles unnoticed, and speaks only of Jerusalem, as though under judgment recognized of God, so far as to be the object of His thoughts and dealings.<a name=367:4></a> Verse 14 only takes the broad fact that the gospel of the kingdom should be preached to all the nations (a thing not yet accomplished to the letter), and then the end should come.<a name=367:5></a> I judge then that, while the whole reply will have an accomplishment at the close, there was sufficient in the early part to guide the saints between the Lord's ascension and the destruction of Jerusalem; but that its fulfilment will yet take place, to the end of verse 14 being general, and from verse 15 being absolutely and exclusively the last half-week of Jewish tribulation.<a name=367:6></a>

		There is a point which, I think, has not been duly borne in mind; it is that the unfaithful servant will, for the judgment, pass over into the time of the Son of man's judgment, so that what is called the Church may go on, in whatever apostasy of condition, into the state of things which takes place when the body of the faithful is gone.<a name=367:7></a> Laodicea is threatened with being vomited out of the Lord's mouth, but when it is vomited is not said, if it be taken for literal judgment.<a name=367:8></a> I am disposed to think Judaism will play an active part in connection with the apostate Church, and that there will be an astonishing amalgam; though, besides that, the Church form may continue until destroyed by the horns and the beast.<a name=367:9></a>

		THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The multitudes were present, but the discourse was addressed to His disciples.<a name=369:1></a> This, chapter 5: 4 clearly shews.<a name=369:2></a> If Luke 7: 1 be compared, the facts appear pretty clearly.<a name=369:3></a> There it is said, "Now, when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people.<a name=369:4></a>" The moral bearing of the fact is more important.<a name=369:5></a> The sermon on the mount characterizes the Lord's teaching in Israel, as introducing His doctrines.<a name=369:6></a> At the close of His ministry He has to denounce their rejection of it.<a name=369:7></a> Hence, here, as has been remarked, He begins with blessings, and in chapter 23 closes with woes.<a name=369:8></a> It will be observed that in the close of the preceding chapter, the power displayed in His ministry, and its effect in attracting the people from all quarters, had been stated.<a name=369:9></a> He preached the good news of the kingdom.<a name=369:10></a> In the sermon on the mount, He lays down its principles, describes the character of those who would enjoy its privileges, and gives positive directions for the government of their conduct.<a name=369:11></a> Meanwhile He was in the way with Israel, judgment awaiting them, if they did not agree quickly on the way.<a name=369:12></a> Hence, also, moral principles and precepts, <i>not redemption</i>, are the subject of the discourse.<a name=369:13></a> If this be understood, it is easy to perceive why the direct application of the discourse is to those who had received His word, and were entering into the kingdom, though as laying down the principles of the kingdom announced to all, all -- at least those who had ears to hear -- among the multitude were concerned in its contents.<a name=369:14></a> It may be remarked that in Luke the disciples are more formally distinguished -- " Blessed are <i>ye</i> poor, for <i>yours</i>," etc.<a name=369:15></a>, and hence woes are added.<a name=369:16></a> Just as in Matthew 3: 7 the Pharisees and Sadducees are denounced, in Luke 3: 7 the whole multitude.<a name=369:17></a> While this address was continued to Israel by Him who had the ministry of the circumcision for the truth of God -- in a word, until Jesus was rejected -- men were under trial, and, though God knew all things, were not treated as finally rejected; but the death of Christ, and we may add, the resisting of the testimony of the Holy Ghost, has closed the history of that trial, and the fig-tree is judged for ever to be fruitless and unprofitable.<a name=369:18></a> It did not then become so, but was proved to be so; and in Israel this was proved of every child of Adam, so that a new creation, connected with the Second Adam, risen and glorified, was needed.<a name=369:19></a> Hence we know fully the <i>Son of Man</i> came to seek and to save that which <i>was lost</i>.<a name=369:20></a>

		FORM OF PRAYER

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have the positive direction of Scripture to speak to one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs; but psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs mean compositions rhythmically and metrically arranged; so that I judge that the use of such compositions is scripturally authorized.<a name=370:1></a> I would add that I think the spiritual mind will detect at once what is really given of the Spirit in such compositions and what is not, even when merely added to make up the measure or rhyme.<a name=370:2></a> Moreover, also, those who believe in the action of the Holy Ghost, as the true and only power of blessing, look for the liberty of the Spirit of God, not bondage -- liberty in everything that is of Him for edification.<a name=370:3></a> The binding to a form of prayer is not this; but the exclusion of hymns is not that liberty either.<a name=370:4></a> Only it is to be sought that hymns should be really composed under His influence, and not mere human poetry.<a name=370:5></a>

		It seems clear from Psalm 68 that the display of external glory of fire, etc.<a name=370:6></a>, on mount Sinai was by the ministration of angels.<a name=370:7></a> This was the solemn sanction given to the law and its promulgation.<a name=370:8></a> Compare the details, Exodus 19: 16-18.<a name=370:9></a> This is fully confirmed by Deuteronomy 33: 2.<a name=370:10></a> Compare Hebrews 1: 7, quoting Psalm 104: 4.<a name=370:11></a> 2 Kings 1: 10, and 6: 17, afford analogous examples of Jehovah's making His ministers a flame of fire.<a name=370:12></a> So even in the bush, when there was, as to its form, an angelic manifestation of God, the bush burned with fire.<a name=370:13></a> Moses spoke with the angel in the bush.<a name=370:14></a> What is particularly referred to in the passages we are considering is that the angels were the immediate instruments through which they received the law, the manifest glory which gave it its sanction.<a name=370:15></a> Not that they spoke or personally addressed the people.<a name=370:16></a> Josephus (Antiq.<a name=370:17></a> 15 C.<a name=370:18></a> 5 s.<a name=370:19></a> 3) says, ton men Ellonon ierous kai asulous einai tous kerukas phamenon, emon de ta kallista ton dogmaton, kai ta; osiotata ton en tois nomois di aggelon para tou Theou mathonton.<a name=370:20></a> That is, the functions of ambassadors are treated as akin to those of the angels, or divine legates.<a name=370:21></a> The character of authority attached to the law was angelic, not the incarnation of God Himself whether speaking on earth or from heaven.<a name=370:22></a> In Josephus, as we have seen, Herod uses the word

		ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA

		I see no reason for saying Ananias and Sapphira were not saved.<a name=371:7></a> The analogy of the apostle's reasoning, in 1 Corinthians 11: 30-32, would lead rather to suppose they were.<a name=371:8></a> But it is a mistake to call this dealing with the world.<a name=371:9></a> It is God judging in the midst of the assembly and that He surely does, even to death, as 1 Corinthians 11, above cited, and 1 John 5: 16, 17, and James 5: 15 distinctly shew.<a name=371:10></a> 1 John 5: 16, 17, I think, teaches another truth -- that there are cases where the charity of the Church is arrested in its outward gracious nature, and takes the form of indignation against evil.<a name=371:11></a> So with Christ: "he looked about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts.<a name=371:12></a>" Perfect love, when forced to take its holy character, or rather to make its holy character prominent, is intolerant of evil, and especially of certain forms of evil, such as a base slighting of God, or pretension to deceive Him under fair forms, or heartless hindrance of blessing to others under the forms of piety.<a name=371:13></a> The action of God in this way within the assembly is judicial.<a name=371:14></a>

		There are cases where discipline is in the course of progress, and might terminate (Job 36: 7-12) in death, but where the intercession of the saints may be the means of blessing, and in the administration of God's government in the Church on earth, may avert the threatened evil.<a name=371:15></a> As regards this government, the sins would be forgiven and the life of the faulty person spared, the soul being set right.<a name=371:16></a> (Job 34: 23, 24.<a name=371:17></a>)

		THE THIRD AND SEVENTH DAYS

	<div class="paragraph">
		Numbers 19
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the use of the third day and the seventh day in Numbers 19: 12, I should not give any very dogmatically certain interpretation, drawing its meaning more from the experiences pointed to by the figure than from directly scriptural proofs.<a name=372:10></a> "Third" is little used in scripture as a number to which meaning is attached; it is, however, somewhat as that which is beyond two.<a name=372:11></a> Two seems to import completeness by corroboration in witness; the third more than enough, and hence, also, what leaves the previous state whose witness is complete.<a name=372:12></a> It is here used, I believe, only as a division of seven.<a name=372:13></a>

		no haste in restoration to communion till the privation of it, and thus the uncleanness of sin, was felt.<a name=373:1></a> Then in the water (the application by the word in the power of the Holy Ghost), the sense that the sin which interrupted communion was put away before God was given, after the full witness in the soul of the evil.<a name=373:2></a> The man was brought out of it in the sense of the grace that put it away, and that cleansed from it; and connected the sense of sin, not with the bitterness of lost communion, but with the grace that had put it away: giving a deeper and more justifying sense of it in connection with grace, making us judge it with God in grace; not in the sense of being, as to enjoyment, without Him, and the Holy Ghost a reprover.<a name=373:3></a> Still this is not communion; it is not the soul occupied with God without the conscience having to be exercised, but the conscience in exercise, though now no longer a bad one, but in a renewed sense of grace and goodness.<a name=373:4></a> Judging the evil thence, one is in a sense purified, but not so as to be peacefully in communion with God; enjoying Christ for His own precious excellences, which we do in communion.<a name=373:5></a> When the full work is wrought; when this purifying is complete, and grace in respect of sin is fully entered into, then communion is entered into, which leaves sin and all thoughts about it behind.<a name=373:6></a> The grace that has purified in making us judge sin according to grace makes us now enjoy grace without any more thinking of sin -- in a word, enjoy God.<a name=373:7></a> Communion is restored, and in the full acceptableness of the offering of Christ understood and enjoyed.<a name=373:8></a> I enter into the presence of, and communion with, God -- sin, as the subject of my thoughts, being wholly left behind.<a name=373:9></a> This is the seventh day.<a name=373:10></a> All is complete.<a name=373:11></a>

		BREAKING OF BREAD, ETC.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I regard all pretence in any to priesthood, save that which can be attributed, and which in scripture is attributed to all saints, as the principle of the apostasy in its present form of development and the denial of Christianity.<a name=377:1></a> Judaism had priests, because the people could not themselves go directly to God where He revealed Himself; Christianity has none between God's people and Himself in their worship, because Christians are brought to God and have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=377:2></a> To set a priest to go for them as one nearer to God is to deny the effect of Christianity.<a name=377:3></a> Besides, priesthood has essentially to do with intercession, or sacrifice and offerings: and in the Lord's Supper there is no sacrifice, nor is it intercession.<a name=377:4></a> The whole idea of priesthood on earth is to be rejected, therefore, as utterly contradictory both to Christianity and the act of breaking the bread.<a name=377:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, it is a mistake to think we partake by breaking the bread or that we break it.<a name=377:6></a> The whole force of the thing consists (as to this point) in our partaking of already broken bread.<a name=377:7></a> It is His body broken for us that we take and eat.<a name=377:8></a> We are not the breakers of His body, properly speaking.<a name=377:9></a> So that, I apprehend, the true partaking of the Lord's Supper is after the bread is broken.<a name=377:10></a> The breaking of the bread now is of course a necessary accident to such participation, but is no part of the communion at all.<a name=377:11></a> And every one acquainted with scripture on the point knows that "blessing" means simply giving thanks, and not consecrating the bread.<a name=377:12></a> See 1 Corinthians 11: 24, and compare Matthew 26: 26, 27; Mark 14: 22; and Luke 22: 19.<a name=377:13></a> So in Luke 9: 16, the miracle of the loaves and not the Eucharist, He blessed them and brake; in John 6: 11, 23; Mark 8: 6, 7 (also Mark 6: 41), the terms are united; in Matthew 14: 19 He blessed, and in chapter 15: 36 gave thanks.<a name=377:14></a> In 1 Corinthians 14: 16 we find incontestable proof of what indeed the previous passages can leave no doubt on a reasonable mind.<a name=377:15></a> "Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?<a name=377:16></a>" Blessing is blessing God, a giving of thanks.<a name=377:17></a> So the apostle says in chapter 11, "the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks," and in 1 Corinthians 10 "the cup of blessing which we bless.<a name=377:18></a>" Matthew and Mark, speaking of the bread, say, He

	<div class="paragraph">
		blessed; and speaking of the cup, say, He gave thanks.<a name=378:1></a> In Luke it is simply, He gave thanks.<a name=378:2></a> Thus, the blessing which precedes the breaking of bread is a giving of thanks; and in this, of course, all join, as in every thanksgiving, though one may utter it.<a name=378:3></a> Every saint is essentially competent, though in a large congregation godly order of mind may leave it to such as may have justly earned the respect of the body; yet, as the feeling of priesthood is readily slipped into, I should think it desirable that it were not always one.<a name=378:4></a> The breaking of the bread is in itself no religious act; it represents the putting of Christ to death, and, as an outward act, it was consummated by wicked men.<a name=378:5></a> But the Lord did break it in the last Supper, shewing it was a dead Christ they had to feed on; and hence he who gives thanks breaks the bread.<a name=378:6></a> The communion comes after and is on a broken body.<a name=378:7></a> The breaking is the killing of Christ, and, though absolutely necessary as a figure, because His death was absolutely necessary and is the very point shewn forth, yet the act of doing it is no religious part of the thing which one has a privilege in doing.<a name=378:8></a> And as to pouring out the wine, it is done no doubt often, but is no part of the Lord's Supper at all.<a name=378:9></a> The wine is, in the institution, supposed to be already in the cup, still pointing to the great fact, that the communion refers to an already dead Saviour.<a name=378:10></a> The blood is out of the body -- "my blood which is shed for you.<a name=378:11></a>" The act of pouring out would not represent death, because the body is not thus represented, and hence it is not referred to at all.<a name=378:12></a> The already shed blood is given thanks for or blessed, as already poured out: "the cup which we bless," etc.<a name=378:13></a> There is the breaking of the bread as significative of the breaking of His body; but this is preparatory to communion.<a name=378:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this consideration which shews the terrible import of the Roman Catholic doctrine as to the Eucharist, and how Satan has taken them in their own wisdom, and, so to speak, mocked them.<a name=378:15></a> The laity are deprived of the cup and are consoled by what is called the doctrine of concomitancy; namely, that the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus are in the bread (indeed in both species).<a name=378:16></a> But if the blood be in the body, and not shed and separate, there is no redemption.<a name=378:17></a> It is shed blood, not blood in the body, which is the power of redemption; without shedding of blood there is none.<a name=378:18></a> This confirms the view, taken above, that it is a body already broken, and blood already shed, of which we partake.<a name=378:19></a> Thus, though the bread must be broken,

	<div class="paragraph">
		as it was by Christ, by him who gives thanks, this is but preparatory, and forms, strictly, no part of the communion; and, as representing the putting Christ to death, it is no part of the holy service itself, though needed to shew that it is of a dead Christ we partake.<a name=379:1></a> It is of no living existing Christ, but of a dead Christ, and there is none such.<a name=379:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remark further, how this sets aside transubstantiation and consubstantiation; for no such Christ exists as that celebrated in the Eucharist.<a name=379:3></a> As in the Passover a slain lamb, so a dead Christ is represented there and shed blood; but there is no dead Christ now.<a name=379:4></a> He is alive again for evermore.<a name=379:5></a> As risen with Him, we remember the sorrows and sufferings which gave us a place there.<a name=379:6></a> That atoning death is accomplished and passed, and sin is put away for us, and we are alive with Him for evermore.<a name=379:7></a> I would just add that the expression in 1 Corinthians 10: 16 has no reference to one or to many, but to what Christians do in contrast with Jews and Gentiles.<a name=379:8></a> The apostle is treating the question of idolatry.<a name=379:9></a> Jews were partakers of the altar, Gentiles drank the cup of demons.<a name=379:10></a> What we (Christians) partake of is communion with the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=379:11></a> We are identified with the sacrifice, we cannot be with the cup of demons too.<a name=379:12></a>

		In speaking of abiding, it will be remarked that when final exclusion is spoken of, it is never "ye" but "a man;" when "ye," it is responsibility and privilege and not exclusion.<a name=379:13></a> The union is viewed as ostensible and fruit-bearing on earth.<a name=379:14></a> It is not the Church viewed as in heaven in its union with Christ.<a name=379:15></a> In that union as such we are perfect.<a name=379:16></a> There there is no pruning nor planting a vine to bring forth fruit nor casting fruit.<a name=379:17></a> The branches here spoken of may be so united; some are, no doubt; but it is not in this point of view they are looked at.<a name=379:18></a> The Lord speaks of Himself and of the branches of the vine already, when He and they were on earth.<a name=379:19></a> In Church-union the head is in heaven perfected there.<a name=379:20></a> We have to look then for responsibility, fruit-bearing, and privileges suited to that.<a name=379:21></a> Verse 5 speaks of one's abiding in Christ and Christ in him, but first of abiding in Him because it is responsibility.<a name=379:22></a> Christ then abides in him practically and he is fruitful.<a name=379:23></a> So Ephesians 3: 16, 17.<a name=379:24></a> Verse 5 addresses itself to the great fundamental principle and way of

		blessing; verse 7 to the connected means by which it is practically available.<a name=380:1></a> "If ye abide in me" remains always the ground -- dependence, confidence, and intimacy, dependent connection with Christ in thought and will, the being attached to Christ and dwelling in Him as one from whom we draw all; but in practical realization of this there are two means -- the words of Christ and prayer.<a name=380:2></a> This verse tells us the measure and way of blessing through these, assuming the fundamental ground of abiding in Him.<a name=380:3></a> If Christ's words abide in us -- if the mind, and thoughts, and will be always directed by, and have their motive and spring in, the words of Christ, then we are met in everything we ask.<a name=380:4></a> All that is needed to make good that will, we ask as we see it to be so needed.<a name=380:5></a> We dispose of divine action in that case for asking.<a name=380:6></a> We are vessels of His will in dependence.<a name=380:7></a> His words forming our will and mind, whatever we ask is done.<a name=380:8></a> It is not merely that He meets us by His power Himself, but He would have us have intimate confidence in exercise; and, if we are dependent on Him, know that every request is met.<a name=380:9></a> I can, being set in the way of His will by His holy and perfect words, dispose of circumstances in that path, get the strength needed, difficulties removed -- in a word, what I will.<a name=380:10></a> This last is very striking; for while it is indeed as formed by His words, yet as so formed, having His mind, I am in that liberty of action which thinks of all that suits the case and gets it.<a name=380:11></a> We are called by this phrase to a place of wonderful free power in service, though the will in that freedom be formed by Christ's words: but we are active agents under God as to all agencies and circumstances.<a name=380:12></a> Hence this is for the purpose of bearing much fruit.<a name=380:13></a> So are we His disciples, for He bore much fruit.<a name=380:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 11 (indeed 9, 10, form a preface to this), the disciples are looked at in another point of view -- not as abiding in Christ as branches in the vine, but as individual persons whom He has loved and was laying down His life for as His friends, whom He had chosen and sent forth.<a name=380:15></a> They were to be left, and, when He was gone, to love one another as He had loved them (that is, when amongst them and in dying for them).<a name=380:16></a> He has now chosen them and appointed them that they should go forth and bring forth fruit, and their fruit abide, as indeed it does to this day.<a name=380:17></a> In this position of fruit-bearing and service as His chosen ones, they would ask of the Father -- being thus placed now where Christ had been in relationship with the Father whose name He had revealed and with whom He was

		now placing them in direct relationship -- and He would give it.<a name=381:1></a> This relationship with the Father, when He left them, is the groundwork of this part of the chapter.<a name=381:2></a> Hence He says not "my words," but whatsoever I have heard of my Father -- so what they ask of the Father.<a name=381:3></a> Hence also it has the character of gift to the children; not a work being done and circumstances disposed of.<a name=381:4></a> Verses 17-20 fully shew that, in the mind of the Spirit, there is the taking of Christ's place in service by the disciples here below; hence a putting them in direct relationship with the Father as He was, and so they would have His joy.<a name=381:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the first thing was before even they were thus left, their connection with Christ Himself as the branches in the vine, His mind guiding them, and then all done that they asked for.<a name=381:6></a> Hence the person asked is not spoken of in verses 1-7.<a name=381:7></a> As abiding in Christ, and His words abiding in them, they disposed of all active agencies.<a name=381:8></a> It is this great fact which is before us.<a name=381:9></a> They might have asked Christ on earth; they might ask Him now, as having all power in heaven and earth, to act in the exercise of His lordship, and as Son over His own house for the good of that house.<a name=381:10></a> But in verse 16 they have to do with the Father, and look to a Father to give.<a name=381:11></a> The "that whatsoever" depends on "I have chosen you and established you that," etc.<a name=381:12></a> But the "that ye should go .<a name=381:13></a>.<a name=381:14></a>.<a name=381:15></a> that your fruit should remain" is an integral and essential part of the ground on which the privilege is founded.<a name=381:16></a> I have chosen you for this and that and this, that whatever ye ask.<a name=381:17></a> Having this place by My desire, such will be your relationship and privilege with the Father.<a name=381:18></a> The Father being now introduced, and they placed in relationship with Him, Christ being gone, their requests were necessarily in Christ's name or they were nothing.<a name=381:19></a> During His life, they had never done this.<a name=381:20></a> "Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name" -- "Ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full.<a name=381:21></a>" So here verse 11.<a name=381:22></a> (Compare John 11: 22.<a name=381:23></a>) The name of Christ was their whole title, and an effectual one.<a name=381:24></a>

		We must distinguish between the outward public effect of the law, and the intention of God in giving it.<a name=382:11></a> There may be a general providential effect of light being sent into the world, while the divine purpose of that light in its spiritual and everlasting bearing may be quite distinct.<a name=382:12></a> No one can doubt that the introduction of Christianity has largely modified the general state of society.<a name=382:13></a> Men do not do in the light what they do in the dark.<a name=382:14></a> Natural conscience, operating in the way of shame, will hinder them, without the least inward moral change.<a name=382:15></a> Public opinion is elevated, and it is a great providential mercy.<a name=382:16></a> Men are more or less governed by that opinion, and an outward effect is produced.<a name=382:17></a> There is, I think, something more -- When the word of God is received, the natural conscience is brought into immediate relationship with God.<a name=382:18></a> This itself elevates morally.<a name=382:19></a> Hence in protestant countries there is a most undeniably higher moral tone than in papal countries.<a name=382:20></a> Conscience has to answer

		for itself to God.<a name=383:1></a> Wretched man is not between conscience and God; his being so always morally degrades.<a name=383:2></a> Man is in his place, though he may fail in it.<a name=383:3></a> He is at least consciously responsible in it.<a name=383:4></a> Further, when men are not exercised in direct responsibility to one true revealed God, but have men between them and God (in which case, wherever it is fully developed, the true God is lost in a multitude of intermediate powers, be they called demons or saints); that is, wherever there is a priesthood, a direct power or influence of Satan can and does come in; not merely in the way of acting by temptation on evil lusts, but in the way of religious or spiritual influence and power.<a name=383:5></a> But this is the rule of the darkness of this world.<a name=383:6></a> When the word of God has direct authority, this is not the case.<a name=383:7></a> Men may be more culpable individually for neglecting the light, but there is not the same influence and power of Satan.<a name=383:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this connects itself with the public moral government of this world.<a name=383:9></a> When the authority of the word of God is over man's conscience, that of Satan is not; where it is not, the god of this world exercises his sway.<a name=383:10></a> But the proper and eternal purpose of God in the gift of the word goes farther.<a name=383:11></a> Men are quickened to eternal life by it.<a name=383:12></a>

		So in its measure is it with the law.<a name=383:13></a> It gives a true measure of what men ought to do, and, in its highest character, what they ought to feel, and claims direct authority for God over the conscience, and puts man, as far as claim on his conscience goes, under immediate responsibility to God and the consciousness of it.<a name=383:14></a> Hence it elevated the position of man immensely above the heathen who worshipped demons, and as helps to their passions, not God as a holy one for their conscience.<a name=383:15></a> Conscience could not be destroyed: God had put it in man by the fall, but it was buried as much as possible among the heathen, and religion helped through Satanic influence to do so.<a name=383:16></a>

		This the law did away, and so far tended to present blessing; but if I be asked, What is the divine intention in the law, its spiritual purpose as judged of by the perfect light of the New Testament, in which man was looked at as an already lost sinner, and heavenly and eternal blessings are revealed?<a name=383:17></a> then I say that God's intention in the law was not and could not be temporal welfare of man by restraining evil.<a name=383:18></a> I may look at the whole law given to Israel in this light as a civil code incomparably beyond all that was known among heathens; but it has no such place, now Christianity is come.<a name=383:19></a> Farther, the law

	<div class="paragraph">
		But if it be asked, what was the intention of law by the light -- the true light which now shines, the whole aspect is changed, because the truth, grace and truth, are come.<a name=384:5></a> In the first law has no place at all.<a name=384:6></a> The second gives to law (not the law merely) the necessary and inevitable character of condemnation and death; because men have to say to God, not in governmental relationship in the earth, but as personally responsible to God according to the requirements of His revealed nature.<a name=384:7></a> As viewed thus in the light of Christianity then it takes a double character.<a name=384:8></a> First, as the law dispensationally given to Israel, it was after an unconditional promise which it could not disannul and was the schoolmaster until the Seed came to whom the promise was made.<a name=384:9></a> This ceased when faith came.<a name=384:10></a> As law spiritually known, it aggravated sin and brought death and condemnation on the sinner.<a name=384:11></a> The welfare of man it has nothing to do with, for man is lost and a sinner; and the law was never given to men in general dispensationally.<a name=384:12></a> If I argue religiously on law (not the law,) the scripture affords an immediate and very clear answer: "Law entered that the offence might abound" -- not that sin might, but that offence might.<a name=384:13></a> Its effect is "sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<a name=384:14></a>" "The motions of sin were by the law.<a name=384:15></a>" "The strength of sin is the law.<a name=384:16></a>" It is so doubly.<a name=384:17></a> It condemns the sinner and brings in death.<a name=384:18></a> Sin is provoked by it.<a name=384:19></a> So perverse are we, that prohibitions set will and lusts in activity.<a name=384:20></a>

		God's intention then in law was as to spiritual things to bring in transgression and convict of sin -- man being already and hopelessly lost.<a name=385:7></a> As an outward dispensation for the Jews, it doubtless tended as a civil system to repress grosser evils: but then God was king of the country and people, and the people governed by it, and that in early times, emerging out of heathenism, before Christ came and was rejected.<a name=385:8></a> The Gentiles have nothing to say to it in this sense.<a name=385:9></a> It was a schoolmaster up to the time of Christ; then faith came and Judaism ceased.<a name=385:10></a> The only way a Gentile can be under law is as a principle of personal responsibility, in which he has to answer for himself, and on which ground it is a ministry of death and condemnation (2 Corinthians 3), the strength of sin, and useful only to bring guilt on his conscience, and the sense that he has no power to free himself, or any possibility of his being freed from the power of sin while on this ground.<a name=385:11></a>

		The subject is too vast to enter into in answering a question, or it would be important to notice that law is a principle of relationship as well as a rule, and to shew how we are delivered from law, and that this is the only means of sin not having dominion over us.<a name=386:15></a> Those who would place the Christian under law do not believe that in us, that is, in our flesh, dwelleth no good thing, nor ever will; or they do not know what they are saying or insisting on.<a name=386:16></a> It were well they should weigh the force of this: "when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law;" and "sin shall not have dominion over you, because ye are not under law, but under grace.<a name=386:17></a>"
