		I have found that one of the points on which the condition of the church of God hangs very much at the present time is, whether obedience precedes blessing, or blessing obedience.<a name=1:1></a> Many are, in some degree though perhaps by no means altogether, aware of the extent to which the principle, that blessing must precede obedience where the will of God is ascertained, has gone, or how widely its influence is spreading.<a name=1:2></a> It is a strange point of connection between Newman Street and the subsisting systems.<a name=1:3></a> The directions (as far as they are apprehended in the minds of those concerned, which is the only way in which we are concerned in them) which have emanated from Mr.<a name=1:4></a> Irving, or those speaking with him, have certainly varied; but they have all borne directly upon retaining those subject to them, in the systems current as religion in the world (though these are all asserted by them to be Babylon), and upon the plea that they could take no step until they received the Spirit, such as they possessed in Newman Street.<a name=1:5></a> This has frequently been the result of direct instructions in that place to persons who have gone there.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another principle has been adopted by a large body of the clergy, tending to the same point: that without tradition no step can be taken, because obedience becomes uncertain and therefore dangerous.<a name=1:7></a> The result is wonderfully similar, and seems to me to proceed from Satan -- such uncertainty and difficulty of mind as leads a person to settle down in what is confessedly wrong, and what he knows to be such.<a name=1:8></a> This, inevitably dulling the conscience, leads to a state of mind grievous to the Spirit of God, and necessarily lowering the moral energies of the parties concerned; "for whosoever hath to him shall be given.<a name=1:9></a>" The coalition between Irvingism and high-church principles in this respect has an astonishingly wide influence; and often so, when the persons concerned little suspect the source from which it flows; while it finds ample aliment in the natural feeling of timidity and unbelief, and assumes the justifiable principle of caution, and is never thought for a moment to be the result of man's disposition to acquiesce in evil, rather than to act in trying circumstances.<a name=1:10></a>

		of the Spirit it assumes the form of greater humility than usual, and greater dependence upon the Holy Ghost.<a name=2:1></a> On the other side, it appears like great steadiness of character, and an indisposition to acquiesce in the movements unguided by principle, which the easily led human mind is in so many ways making at the present moment.<a name=2:2></a> Thus certainly the fairest principles of conduct are brought to bear (though from such opposite, and, but for this, mutually opposed sides) upon those who conscientiously do not acquiesce in the evil in which they find themselves placed.<a name=2:3></a> Nothing can be more opposed than the principles which lead to the conclusion on one side and on the other.<a name=2:4></a> In result only they agree -- to stay where circumstances have placed them; which is just what the selfishness of unbelief will always do.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is one thing only which can justly withstand the power over the mind of such nominally good views as these, so apparently opposed to evil; and that is <i>obedience</i>.<a name=2:6></a> There is nothing so humble, nothing so steady as obedience; nothing which so marks the Spirit's presence, nothing so opposed to insubordination, nothing by which every ungodly voice must be so utterly silenced, as by obedience.<a name=2:7></a> I confess, when I see such very opposite principles leading to the same conclusion -- principles so diametrically opposite, and in conflict with each other, as resting on the presence of the Spirit, and tradition -- I am led to think that the result is not the effect of the principles in either case, but of some entirely different motive; and that the only operation of the principles is to neutralise, in either case, some other principle which acts in moving those who plead them; and consequently, by so neutralising it, to leave them where they were, without respect to the right or wrong of the case; which is precisely the result in the present instance.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And such I believe to be just the fact: but if God have any will in the matter, and this consequently terminates in <i>disobedience</i>, it becomes a very positive evil, most grievous to the Spirit of God, supposed to be, or waited for, and makes tradition (discoverable or undiscoverable) to be such as renders void the word of God.<a name=2:9></a> It is reserved for these days, among protestants, to make tradition a necessary supplement to the word of God; and it is a very great mistake to suppose that it was ever used in the early churches in the way now proposed.<a name=2:10></a> It was there, whether wisely or unwisely, a positive tradition,

		and in confirmation of doctrines avowedly taught and declared.<a name=3:1></a> A tradition that they had not yet (or did not know to be the security of the church) was an imbecility reserved surely for a state of hopeless decay.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the assertion that obedience is the great principle to go on -- obedience to known truth, not plans of our own mind, but obedience to known truth as the portion of a single-eyed, humble, simple mind; and that this is the way of these additional blessings, which are matters of God's gift (obedience to the order of which is then part, of course, of every spiritual mind) is of very great importance: but, in all cases and under all circumstances, gifts or no gifts, obedience is the path of a Christian -- the path of duty and blessing.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would first shew the essentiality of the principle, its deep essentiality; then, that it is the preliminary of blessing; and lastly, that it is the order of all special gift in Christ, the ground on which it all flows forth.<a name=3:4></a> The first establishes the principle; the last applies it.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Obedience is the only rightful state of the creature, or God would cease to be supreme -- would cease to be God.<a name=3:6></a> God may shew the impotency of the creature by turning all the wilful rebellion it may be guilty of to His own purpose in blessing; and they that are <i>adversaries</i> bound to it in His own power; but the only rightful position of the creature is obedience: upon this hangs all the order of the creation -- on this hang sin and righteousness.<a name=3:7></a> The definition of sin is lawlessness, doing one's own will.<a name=3:8></a> "He that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<a name=3:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us see how distinctly this is brought out in Scripture in its broadest lines.<a name=3:10></a> The first Adam and the second, the Lord from heaven, the great heads and types of ruin and of blessing, are thus distinguished as the disobedient and the obedient ones.<a name=3:11></a> The first Adam did his own will.<a name=3:12></a> He was put under a test of obedience.<a name=3:13></a> This was the critical point of the first Adam's standing and blessing: "Thou shalt not eat.<a name=3:14></a>" He did eat, and was ruined: death, the wages of sin, came in, the consequence of man's act, that not being the will of God.<a name=3:15></a> Death was the wages of sin; and sin was disobedience -- in subjection to God.<a name=3:16></a> Here its character and result were determined -- the hinge of man's fate -- the now wide-open door to every evil; but at which indeed mercy entered before man was excluded, that he might bear it with

		him in the desert into which he was driven, justly driven, without.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Precisely the opposite was found in the blessed and perfect Saviour.<a name=4:2></a> Would you know His character, His attitude now that He is ushered in, in His own humble but holy and perfect announcement?<a name=4:3></a> "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me; I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.<a name=4:4></a>" This was His constant character, His perfectness, as man.<a name=4:5></a> So we read in the course of His life: "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<a name=4:6></a>" This character was stamped on every circumstance; "He took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.<a name=4:7></a>" And as in life He did always such things as pleased His Father, for He sought not His own will but the will of Him that sent Him; so there was no limit to its extent any more than to its perfectness: for, loving His own to the end, He became obedient unto death, the death of the cross; for, though willingly doing it, "this commandment have I received of my Father.<a name=4:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He had now ears dug for Him (Psalm 40: 6): the Lord God had opened them, and He was not rebellious, neither turned away back, but "gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair"; nor hid His face from all that obedience brought Him into, power or no power; for He was crucified in weakness, though He liveth by the power of God.<a name=4:9></a> His power was the powerful service of God; His weakness the patience of all His will.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it was -- obedience was the principle on which He acted -- in temptation.<a name=4:11></a> "It is written" was His reply ever to the tempter's suggestions; and when the tempter would thereupon have guilefully alleged a promise, "It is written, he shall give," etc.<a name=4:12></a>, our Lord met him by the answer, "It is written": an answer shewing the principle of obedience as contrasted with the principle of assumption, of the assumption even of true privilege -- a most important truth!<a name=4:13></a> But of this more hereafter.<a name=4:14></a> Perhaps I have said more than is needful on this; for the one sentence, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God," to the believer stamps the character, and fills up the principle, of the life of the holy Jesus.<a name=4:15></a> He was the Model of obedience.<a name=4:16></a> Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The essential contrast to this is in Antichrist: "The king shall do according to his will.<a name=5:1></a>" This is <i>his</i> characteristic: not regarding any, "He shall do according to his will and magnify himself.<a name=5:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now trace other parts of scripture.<a name=5:3></a> In Exodus the word of the Lord to Moses is, "Thus shalt thou say, Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself; now therefore, if ye will <i>obey my voice indeed</i>," etc.<a name=5:4></a> And all the people answered together, "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.<a name=5:5></a>" I speak not here of their competency to fulfil their undertaking, but of the principle of obedience -- the only principle on which God could deal with man, or man walk with God.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in the blessing of Abraham in Genesis 22, the Lord closes with this -- "Because thou hast obeyed my voice.<a name=5:7></a>" And Jeremiah takes up the word of the Lord to Israel by Moses (chapter 7: 22), "For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices; but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.<a name=5:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the tenor of the covenant on which the existing comforts of the land were held, as detailed in Deuteronomy 28, after they had broken the former.<a name=5:9></a> Such is the principle of the restoration -- covenants of faith, when they had lost the fruits of the former, as given in Deuteronomy 30; "and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice, according to all that I command thee this day.<a name=5:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in the apostasy of Saul in 1 Samuel 15, we find the same basis of judgment -- "Why didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord?<a name=5:11></a> Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice"; even as we find its principle and its perfection in our Lord's constant walk.<a name=5:12></a> It is the character of the believer's sanctification -- sanctified unto obedience and the blood of sprinkling of Jesus Christ; 1 Peter 1: 2.<a name=5:13></a> This is that to which the believer is sanctified; this the purpose, the object, of his sanctification: so, where the contrary state is spoken of in Ephesians 2, "Wherein in times past ye walked according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of <i>disobedience</i>.<a name=5:14></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor does anything ever affect this essential principle: nothing but sin can draw a man out of it.<a name=6:1></a> The doing our own will is always sin, always the acting of the old man, not subject to God or it would do His will, not its own -- the nature which does not bring in God, but acts for itself.<a name=6:2></a> The object of obedience may be in question, but self-will is always wrong.<a name=6:3></a> Thus Peter, when charged before the high priest's council with disobedience to its behests, does not plead a right to do his own will -- a right to do what he pleased; he had no such right.<a name=6:4></a> As towards God, it would have been the expression of self-will; he would not have been honouring God therein.<a name=6:5></a> His word was not, 'I have a right to do what I like without reference to you'; but, "We ought to obey God rather than men.<a name=6:6></a>" It would have been really disobedience to have obeyed them.<a name=6:7></a> God would have been disobeyed in the result.<a name=6:8></a> Peter would have acquiesced, yea, taken a leading part in disobedience, as far as he was concerned.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we find how the principle is preserved in all the trying circumstances of refusing subjection to human authority.<a name=6:10></a> It can be swerved from in no instance without breaking through the first and only principle of accepted relationship to God; it is the only exercise, save praise, of life to God.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that this principle is greatly lost sight of and abused by all religious parties.<a name=6:12></a> As to this, they are divided into two great classes -- those who plead obedience, and those who plead liberty.<a name=6:13></a> Peter's answer, it seems to me, meets both.<a name=6:14></a> The dissenters, as a body, plead liberty -- rights -- the title to do, as regards men, what they please.<a name=6:15></a> The churchmen claim obedience, and plead frequently the principle; but it is still to men, and not to God.<a name=6:16></a> "We ought to obey God" is the Christian's answer to both.<a name=6:17></a> "We ought to <i>obey</i>," I say to the dissenter, who claims rights: "We ought to obey <i>God</i>," to the churchman, who pleads the principle of obedience in the defence of all the corruptions which rest merely on the authority of man and his ways: "We ought to obey God <i>rather than man</i>.<a name=6:18></a>" How perfect is scripture in setting in order the ways of men, the narrow path which no other power detects, as revealing the principles of the human mind, and judging them!<a name=6:19></a> Self-will is never right.<a name=6:20></a> Obedience to man is often wrong -- disobedience to God.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing I would mark in connection with this is, that the commands of God, though the literal circumstances of blessing associated with them may be gone, never lose their power; for they are always, unless as connected with these blessings in detail, moral -- in their character, exhibiting and expressive of God, on which relationship to Him is necessarily founded.<a name=7:1></a> This is what the word in Deuteronomy 30: 12-14, quoted by the apostle, means: "It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us, that we may hear and do it .<a name=7:2></a>.<a name=7:3></a>.<a name=7:4></a> .<a name=7:5></a> But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.<a name=7:6></a>" Now the apostle calls this the righteousness of faith (Romans 10: 6), the force of which we shall see in a moment, if we examine the place where it occurs in Deuteronomy, and learn also the accuracy of scripture quotation; and that this quotation in Romans, as everything else in Scripture, is the mind of the Spirit of God.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The statement of Moses in Deuteronomy was not the covenant on which, in literal obedience, they held the land; this would not have been the righteousness of faith, but the principle of Do, and then the blessing.<a name=7:8></a> It was <i>besides the covenant that was made with them at Horeb</i> (chapter 29: 1), and proceeds upon the ground of the total loss of the literal blessings, which were the result of literal -- obedience in the land: "And it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind, among all the nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey," etc.<a name=7:9></a> That is, after the covenant of literal obedience had been so broken that they had lost the fruits of it in the possession of the land, and were driven out (at once the evidence that it was broken, and constituting the impossibility, in that exclusion from the land, of such literal obedience), thereon the Lord says, "For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.<a name=7:10></a> It is not in heaven," etc.<a name=7:11></a> But it was nigh them, that which faith recognised in its power and principles, although, in exclusion from the land, its literal observance was impracticable.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the apostle took up the Jews, and planted them on the principle of the obedience or righteousness of faith (to them still "Lo-ammi"); that is, the confession of Messiah,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		at any time the great hope and comfort of their law to them, but specially while they were thus in bondage and sorrow.<a name=8:1></a> No other but a basis of faith could be available to them.<a name=8:2></a> This was its strength and surest object; while the obedience of faith for His name was withal spread to the nations also.<a name=8:3></a> The obedience of faith, whatever the state of, however apostasy is undermining, the church, is still, and so much the more, the principle of all righteous individual conversation.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not the exactitude of literal observance which is here imposed -- that may be impossible.<a name=8:5></a> It was so with the Jews when there was the highest exemplification of faithful obedience, as in Daniel for example; neither is the oldness of the letter the character of the Christian dispensation; that is not the obedience of faith.<a name=8:6></a> But the obedience of faith, in the newness of the Spirit, is always open, and finds its path according to the spirituality, and therefore spiritual discernment, of the people seeking it; and upon this God rests it.<a name=8:7></a> Exact conformity to His mind may be, and surely was, accompanied by direct and immediate witness of blessing, such as we have not now -- and could not have, because it would be the recognition of inconsistency, which God could not sanction, whatever be His individual prerogative of mercy.<a name=8:8></a> It was God's testimony and sanction to that which was His moral witness in the world.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is precisely in these circumstances that the obedience of faith comes in on which the blessing comes, as may be seen in Deuteronomy 30; not the insistence on literal ordinance, but the power of moral consistency, according to the expressed mind of God.<a name=8:10></a> Nothing can be more important than the position which this passage in the book of Deuteronomy holds in this respect, nor than the principle which it affords.<a name=8:11></a> The privileges attached to the dispensation were gone.<a name=8:12></a> Obedience, in the literal sense, was impossible.<a name=8:13></a> The ark was gone; the Urim and Thummim were gone.<a name=8:14></a> The temple, where literal services could be accomplished, was desolate and burned with fire, where their prescriptive services alone could be performed; and they were captives moving to and fro.<a name=8:15></a> What then could be done!<a name=8:16></a> The word was nigh them, in their heart and in their mouth, that they might do it.<a name=8:17></a> Here was the principle of conduct which assured God's accepting favour; here is the principle on which alone, in darkness, we can walk acceptably with God.<a name=8:18></a> Compare Isaiah 50, 51, where we have

	<div class="paragraph">
		the application of this -- the progressive triple link of obedience; and then, Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O arm of the Lord!<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, the notion of tradition neither recognises nor amends the fallen state of things; it does not recognise it, for it assumes the literal state of things precisely, but does not fulfil it.<a name=9:2></a> It does not acknowledge the evil and fallen state of the church.<a name=9:3></a> It assumes the continuance of that literal exactitude of services; and that, these being present, there is the security of the church.<a name=9:4></a> It acknowledges not, that it has lost its glory in the display of present power to the world; it says, Give me my ordinances, and all is well; not seeing that it has been deprived of power, because of its moral departure from its constitution with God.<a name=9:5></a> It may have been God's wisdom so to order this dispensation: I speak merely of the fact.<a name=9:6></a> Neither does tradition amend it -- it puts the church wholly on the wrong ground.<a name=9:7></a> The spirit of obedience, the righteousness of faith, is that which we need, if indeed fallen.<a name=9:8></a> Though we had the most certain information of traditional forms of worship or ordinance, it would not make the church of the living God.<a name=9:9></a> It is not the sign of the true church, or suited to the humiliation of the church in its fallen and low condition.<a name=9:10></a> The perpetuity of ordinances is not its rightful position in Babylon, but the spirit of humbled obedience -- the word nigh it; the present spirit of obedience to the word nigh them is that which marks the spirit of faith, and acknowledgment of God, not making haste.<a name=9:11></a> If we repent, we may, according to the word of Ezekiel, be shewn more.<a name=9:12></a> To mock the fallen church with tradition is but a bitter and death-bearing substitute for the living power of the divine presence, or the obedience of faith, the only sure ground on which to stand, if we have fallen from the manifested glory of it.<a name=9:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to trace the other parts of the subject.<a name=9:14></a> To shew that it is the preliminary of blessing, few words, after what has been said, will be needed.<a name=9:15></a> "If any man will do his will," says our Lord, "he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.<a name=9:16></a>" Now this is precisely the obedience of faith; and shews that moral preparation for blessing given is conversion of will into the spirit of obedience; "<i>if any one desire to practise his will</i>.<a name=9:17></a>" It is not the literal fact of outward act, but the spirit of mind, which will be therefore necessarily shewn in outward acts when that will is set before him.<a name=9:18></a> The

		next point is to <i>do My will</i>; then he shall know -- the gift of knowledge founded on the spirit of obedience; for what does it avail to confer gift on the disobedient, unless God should provide for His own dishonour?<a name=10:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would refer also, without dwelling on them, to Luke 6: 4-9; Matthew 3: 15; John 13: 16, 17 and chapter 12: 26.<a name=10:2></a> The same truth is very distinctly taught us in John 14: 21-23, where love to Jesus is thus definitely marked, and blessing marked as consequent upon it: "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.<a name=10:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more distinct -- nothing more distinct than the sovereignty of grace to the sinner through the obedience of Christ; the sureness of blessing to the saint in the order of obedience to the word.<a name=10:4></a> The chastenings of unchanging love, I speak not of here.<a name=10:5></a> But the doctrine is very express in the word as to the order of all special gift; that it is adherence to the obedience of Christ; that it hangs upon, and finds its scope and exercise in, obedience.<a name=10:6></a> There may be an extraordinary act of everlasting sovereignty, as Balaam and Caiaphas; but this is not ground that the church of God can go upon; these are not given to the church as examples, unless men would associate themselves with the apostasy as God's order.<a name=10:7></a> God may set light to His church upon the most dangerous rock on the shores of destruction; these may be beacons all around them, but no attractive guide to the place where they stand; though we may bless the hand that set them there, a warning for none to approach, though a guide to all that pass.<a name=10:8></a> Unhappy people, the witness of the ruin that rolls around themselves!<a name=10:9></a>

		One would have thought that it had been amply enough to have seen the broad and essential principle on which the whole order of Christian truth is founded, to have determined the Christian mind as to its righteousness and judgment.<a name=10:10></a> One would have thought that its conclusion would have been intuitive, and the fruit of the Spirit shewn at once in the recognition of obedience as the path of the saint: that path which, to a saint led of the Spirit, is the only one in which the Spirit can lead.<a name=10:11></a> But the enemy of our souls is not met by the simplicity of truth, because of the want of simplicity of our minds.<a name=10:12></a> According as they are not spiritual, and in any

		But I have referred to John 15, as direct instruction upon the subject: it is most exact as to it.<a name=14:1></a> The Lord had stated the truth as to personal blessing, the special gift of His manifested presence, as contrasted with the world, in chapter 14: "He that hath my commandments" (how different from a tradition we have not got!<a name=14:2></a>)<a href="#14:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> "and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.<a name=14:3></a>" Here the broad principle of general blessing is laid down, and we may observe what is most important in it -- "he that hath my commandments.<a name=14:4></a>"

		<a class="footnote" name="#14:f1"><sup>+</sup></a> The Lord's commandments are always moral, and not of ordinance. The two ordinances which were established by Him, and which separate the church from the world, are, though ordained by Him, not commandments for personal obedience. As to baptism, this is perfectly clear, from the absence of command, and from Acts 8: 36 and 10: 47. As regards the Lord's supper, it might seem to be so, but "Do this in remembrance of me" is not a command to do it; compare 1 Corinthians 11: 25. Ordinances are always separative. If I am marked by any prescribed act, this act distinguishes me, and connects me with an those who have it as a body, contrasted with those who have not such prescribed form. Hence all peculiar ordinances minister to separation among Christians, those that are God's to separation of them from the world corporately. I read, "we have no such custom," where evil was sought to be introduced; never of any circumstance, we have such an ordinance. I do not think the apostles themselves had the power to ordain anything, but as morally conducive to the good of the church. "So ordain I in all the churches" was a common order profitable for the glory of God.

		Here, however, there must be a distinction drawn between judging what one <i>has to do in</i> certain circumstances, and being <i>guided by</i> them.<a name=21:8></a> He who allows himself to be guided by them always acts in the dark as to knowing the will of God.<a name=21:9></a> There is absolutely nothing moral in it; it is an external force that constrains.<a name=21:10></a> Now it is very possible that I may have no judgment beforehand of what I shall do: I know not what circumstances may arise, and consequently I can make no resolutions.<a name=21:11></a> But the instant the circumstances are there, I judge with a full and divine conviction what is the path of God's will, and of the Spirit's intention and power.<a name=21:12></a> That demands the highest degree of spirituality.<a name=21:13></a> It is not to be directed by circumstances, but to be directed by God in them, being near enough to God to be able to judge immediately what one ought to do, as soon as the circumstances are there.<a name=21:14></a>

		As to impressions, God can suggest them, and it is certain that in fact He does suggest a thing to the mind; but, in that case, the propriety of the thing and its moral character will be as clear as the sun at noon-day.<a name=21:15></a> In prayer God can remove from our heart certain carnal influences, which, being destroyed, leave room for certain other spiritual influences taking all their place in the soul.<a name=21:16></a> Thus He makes us feel the importance of some duty, which had been perhaps entirely obscured by preoccupation caused by some desired object.<a name=21:17></a> This may be even between two individuals.<a name=21:18></a> One person may not have enough spiritual discernment to discover what is right; but

		Again the case should never exist of a person acting without knowing the will of God.<a name=22:7></a> The only rule that can be given is, never to act when we do not know what is the Lord's will.<a name=22:8></a> The will of God ought to be the motive as well as the rule of our conduct; and until His will is in activity, there is an absence of any true motive for ours.<a name=22:9></a> If you act in ignorance in this respect, you are at the mercy of <i>circumstances</i>; however God may turn all to the good of His children.<a name=22:10></a> But why act when we are ignorant what His will is?<a name=22:11></a> Is the necessity of acting always so extremely pressing?<a name=22:12></a> If I do something with the full certainty that I am doing the will of God, it is clear that an obstacle is no more than a test of my faith, and it ought not to stop me.<a name=22:13></a> It stops us perhaps through our lack of faith; because, if we do not walk sufficiently near to God in the sense of our nothingness, we shall lack faith to <i>accomplish</i> what we have faith enough to <i>discern</i>.<a name=22:14></a> When we are doing our own will or are negligent in our walk, God in His mercy may warn us by a hindrance which arrests us if we pay attention to it, whilst "the simple pass on and are punished.<a name=22:15></a>" God may permit, where there is much activity and labour, that Satan should raise up hindrances, in order that we may be kept in dependence on the Lord; but God never permits Satan to act otherwise than on the flesh.<a name=22:16></a> If we leave the door open, if we get away from God, Satan does us harm; but otherwise it is a mere trial of faith to warn us of a danger or snare -- of something that would tend to exalt us in our own eyes.<a name=22:17></a> It is an instrument for our correction.<a name=22:18></a> That is, God allows Satan to trouble the mind, and make the flesh suffer outwardly, in order that the inner man may be kept from evil.<a name=22:19></a> If it is a question of anything else, probably it is only our "<i>buts</i>" and "<i>ifs</i>" that stop us, or possibly the

		Now let us examine whether Scripture does not present some principle suitable to direct us.<a name=23:6></a> Here evidently spirituality is the essential thing -- is everything.<a name=23:7></a> The rule that we should do what Jesus would have done in such and such a circumstance is excellent, <i>where and when it can be applied</i>.<a name=23:8></a> But are we often in the circumstances where the Lord was found?<a name=23:9></a>

		In the next place, it is often useful to ask myself <i>whence</i> comes such a desire of mine, or such a thought of doing this or that.<a name=23:10></a> I have found that this alone decides more than half of the difficulties that Christians meet with.<a name=23:11></a> The rest of those which remain are the result of our haste and of our former sins.<a name=23:12></a> If a thought comes from God and not from the flesh, then we have only to address ourselves to God as to the manner and means of executing it, and we shall soon be directed.<a name=23:13></a> There are cases where one has need of being guided, not always without motives; as suppose, when I hesitate about a visit to make, or some such other case.<a name=23:14></a> A life of more ardent love, or love exercised in a more intelligent way, or set in activity in drawing near to God, will clear the motives on one side or another: and often, perhaps, we shall see that our part in the thing was but selfishness.<a name=23:15></a>

		I add with regard to a principle expressed above, that we are sanctified to the "obedience .<a name=24:15></a>.<a name=24:16></a>.<a name=24:17></a> of Jesus Christ.<a name=24:18></a>" Now He came to do the will of His Father, without which He did nothing.<a name=24:19></a> Thus, in the temptation in the wilderness, Satan tried to make Him act according to His own will, in things where there was not even an appearance of evil.<a name=24:20></a> The Father had just owned Him as His Son: Satan tempted Him, saying, "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.<a name=24:21></a>" But Jesus was a servant, and His answer consists in doing nothing, because there was wholly no will of His Father in the matter: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=24:22></a>" As there was no word from God for the actual circumstances, Jesus did nothing.<a name=24:23></a> Satan could do nothing more.<a name=24:24></a> Although ever active to do good, He did not stir, when Mary and Martha sent to tell Him "he whom thou lovest is sick.<a name=24:25></a>" His Father had not sent Him there.<a name=24:26></a> When He goes later, the wisdom of God is thus manifested, in that a testimony to the divine power of Jesus as Son of God was rendered by the resurrection of Lazarus.<a name=24:27></a> So then, when the will of God is not manifested, our wisdom often consists in waiting until it should be.<a name=24:28></a> It is the will of God that, zealous of good works, we should do good always, but we cannot go before the time, and the work of God is done perfectly when it is He who does it.<a name=24:29></a>

		I WILL GUIDE THEE WITH MINE EYE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Psalm 32: 8, 9
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three special characters of blessing mentioned in the Psalms.<a name=25:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, that which we get at the very opening of them "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<a name=25:2></a> But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<a name=25:3></a> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water," etc.<a name=25:4></a>; Psalm 1.<a name=25:5></a> It is here a contrast between the ungodly and Christ, the righteous Man.<a name=25:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Psalm 119 we go a little farther.<a name=25:7></a> This psalm speaks of having wandered, and of being restored (verse 67, 71, 176).<a name=25:8></a> It is here, "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of Jehovah.<a name=25:9></a>" It speaks of one who has the word, delights in it, looks to it, and seeks to be guided by it; still it is not so absolute.<a name=25:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the psalm before us (Psalm 32), we get the blessedness of, and God's dealings with, the sinner whose transgressions are removed.<a name=25:11></a> "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered [not who has not transgressed, who has not sinned).<a name=25:12></a> Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile" (that is, the restored soul).<a name=25:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to notice the work of the Spirit of God, in the process through which the soul is going here (as it says, "<i>Thy hand</i> was heavy upon me"), God's dealings with the soul that does not submit itself entirely in bringing it down into full subjection and confession.<a name=25:14></a> "When I kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.<a name=25:15></a> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.<a name=25:16></a> I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.<a name=25:17></a> I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin," verse 2-5.<a name=25:18></a> This is always true, if the Lord's hand is upon a man, until he recognises the evil before God; and then there is forgiveness of the iniquity.<a name=25:19></a> It is very important that we should distinguish the government of God towards our souls in forgiveness.<a name=25:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=26>[Page 26]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Until there is confession of <i>sin</i>, and not merely of <i>a sin</i>, there is no forgiveness.<a name=26:1></a> We find David, in Psalm 51, when he was confessing his sin, saying, "Behold I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me," etc.<a name=26:2></a>, not merely, I have done this particular evil; that he does (verse 1-4); but he recognises <i>the root and principle of sin</i>.<a name=26:3></a> When our hearts are brought to recognise God's hand, it is not merely, then, a question of what particular sin, or of what particular iniquity may need forgiveness; God has brought down the soul, through the working of His Spirit on it, to detect the <i>principle of sin</i>, and so there is confession of that, and not merely of <i>a particular sin</i>.<a name=26:4></a> There is then positive restoration of soul.<a name=26:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is a much deeper thing in its practical consequences, and the Lord's dealings thereon, than we are apt to suppose.<a name=26:6></a> Freed from the bondage of things which hinder its intercourse with God, the soul learns to lean upon God, instead of upon those things which, so to speak, had taken the place of God.<a name=26:7></a> "For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.<a name=26:8></a> Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance," verse 6, 7.<a name=26:9></a> There is its confidence.<a name=26:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then follows what, more especially, is the object of this paper -- "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.<a name=26:11></a> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee," verse 8, 9.<a name=26:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we are often like the horse, or the mule, every one of us -- and this, because our souls have not been ploughed up.<a name=26:13></a> When there is anything in which the <i>will</i> of man is at work, the Lord deals with us, as with the horse or the mule, holding us in.<a name=26:14></a> When every part of the heart is in contact with Himself, He guides us with His "eye.<a name=26:15></a>" "The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<a name=26:16></a> Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<a name=26:17></a> If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light," Luke 11: 34-36.<a name=26:18></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=27>[Page 27]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When there is anything wherein the eye is not single, so long as this is the case, there is not free intercourse in heart and affections with God; and the consequence is, our <i>will</i> not being subdued, we are not led simply of God.<a name=27:1></a> When the heart is in a right state, the whole body is "full of light," and there is the quick perception of the will of God.<a name=27:2></a> He just teaches us by His "eye" all He wishes, and produces in us quickness of understanding in His fear; Isaiah 11: 3.<a name=27:3></a> This is our portion, as having the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, "quick of understanding in the fear of Jehovah," hearts without any object, save the will and glory of God.<a name=27:4></a> And that is just what Christ was: "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me.<a name=27:5></a> I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart," Psalm 40: 7, 8; Hebrews 10: 7.<a name=27:6></a> Where there is this, it may be bitter and painful as to the circumstances of the path, but there is in it the joy of obedience as obedience.<a name=27:7></a> There is always joy, and the consequence -- God guiding us by His eye.<a name=27:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before anything can be done, if we have not this certainty, before we enter upon any particular service, we should seek to get it, judging our own hearts as to what may be hindering.<a name=27:9></a> Suppose I set about doing a thing, and meet with difficulties, I shall begin to be uncertain as to whether it is God's mind or not; and hence, there will be feebleness and discouragement.<a name=27:10></a> But on the other hand, if acting in the intelligence of God's mind in communion, I shall be "more than a conqueror," whatever may meet me by the way; Romans 8: 37.<a name=27:11></a> And note here: not only does the power of faith, in the path of faith, remove mountains; but the Lord deals morally, and will not let me find out His way, unless there be in me the spirit of obedience.<a name=27:12></a> What would it avail -- unless indeed God should provide for His own dishonour?<a name=27:13></a> "If any man will do [wills to do] his will," says our Lord, "he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself," John 7: 17.<a name=27:14></a> This is precisely the obedience of faith.<a name=27:15></a> The heart must be in the condition of obedience, as Christ's was, "Lo, I come," etc.<a name=27:16></a> The apostle speaks to the Colossians of being "filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding," Colossians 1: 9.<a name=27:17></a> Here it is quickness of understanding in the fear of the Lord, the condition of a man's own soul, though his spirit of mind will be necessarily shewn in outward acts, when that will is set before him; as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here then is the blessed joyful state of being guided by God's "eye.<a name=28:2></a>" "I have meat to eat," says our Lord to the disciples (John 4), "that ye know not of.<a name=28:3></a>" And what was that meat?<a name=28:4></a> "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<a name=28:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord guides, or rather controls, us in another way by providential circumstances, so that we may not go wrong, even though we are those which have no understanding.<a name=28:6></a> And thankful we ought to be that He does so.<a name=28:7></a> But it is only as the horse or mule.<a name=28:8></a> Your will being subject to Mine, He says, "I will guide you with mine eye" -- but, if you are not subject, I must keep you in with "bit and bridle.<a name=28:9></a>" This is, evidently, a very different thing.<a name=28:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May our hearts be led to desire to know and to do God's will.<a name=28:11></a> It will then be not so much a question of what that will is, but of knowing and doing God's will.<a name=28:12></a> And then we shall have the certain and blessed knowledge of being guided by His "eye.<a name=28:13></a>" There is all this government of God with those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered, unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile -- whose whole dependence is upon Him, and who feel they are sure to go wrong if not guided by Himself.<a name=28:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a guidance with knowledge, and there is also guidance without knowledge.<a name=28:15></a> The former is our blessed privilege; but it may be the latter is needed to humble us.<a name=28:16></a> In Christ there was everything exactly according to God.<a name=28:17></a> In a certain sense He had no character.<a name=28:18></a> When I look at Him, what do I see?<a name=28:19></a> A constant never-failing life -- manifestation of obedience.<a name=28:20></a> He goes up to Bethany just when He is to go up, regardless of the fears of the disciples; He abides two days still in the same place where He is, after He has heard that Lazarus is sick; John 11.<a name=28:21></a> He has nothing but to do all, to accomplish all, for the glory of God.<a name=28:22></a> One man is tender and soft; in another firmness and decision predominate.<a name=28:23></a> There is great diversity of character amongst men.<a name=28:24></a> You do not see that in Christ at all; there is no unevenness; every faculty in His humanity obeyed, and was the instrument of the impulse the divine will gave to it.<a name=28:25></a>

		Divine life has to be guided in a vessel that has constantly to be kept down.<a name=29:1></a> Thus even for the apostle the command not to go into Bithynia (Acts 16: 7) was not guidance by the Spirit of the highest sort.<a name=29:2></a> It was blessed guidance, yet not the highest character of guidance an apostle knew.<a name=29:3></a> It was more like the government of the horse or the mule, not so much the intelligence of God's mind in communion.<a name=29:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A great range of the guidance of the Spirit is just what we get in Colossians 1: 9-11 to those in communion with God.<a name=29:5></a> There we find the individual to be "filled with the knowledge of his will.<a name=29:6></a>" The Holy Ghost guides into the knowledge of the divine will, and there is no occasion even to pray about it.<a name=29:7></a> If I have spiritual understanding about a given thing, it may be the result of a great deal of previous prayer, and not necessarily of the things having been prayed about at the time.<a name=29:8></a> One has often had to pray about a thing, because not in communion.<a name=29:9></a> I may have my mind exercised about that today, honestly, truly, graciously exercised, which, five years hence, it might be, I should not have a doubt about.<a name=29:10></a> When God is using us, if we are free from ourselves, He may put it into our hearts to go here, or to go there; then God is positively guiding us.<a name=29:11></a> But this assumes a person to be walking with God, and that diligently; it assumes death to self.<a name=29:12></a> If we are walking humbly, God will guide us.<a name=29:13></a> I may be in a certain place, and there have one say to me, Will you go to -- (naming some other place)?<a name=29:14></a> Now, if I have not the mind of God, as to my going or otherwise, I shall have to pray for guidance; but this, of course, assumes that I am not walking in the knowledge of God's mind.<a name=29:15></a> I may have motives pulling me one way or the other, and clouding my spiritual judgment.<a name=29:16></a> The Lord says (John 11) -- when the disciples speak of the Jews having of late sought to stone Him, and ask, "Goest thou thither again?<a name=29:17></a>" -- "Are there not twelve hours in the day?<a name=29:18></a> If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.<a name=29:19></a> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.<a name=29:20></a>" This is just an application of the simple fact, that, if walking in the night, I must be on the look-out for stones, lest I stumble over them.<a name=29:21></a> So Paul prays for the Philippians, that their love might abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; that they might approve things that are excellent [try things that differ]; that they might be sincere and without offence till

		THOUGHTS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF ABRAHAM AND OF JACOB¦
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The experiences of the heart occupy a large place in the thoughts of Christians.<a name=43:1></a> It is nevertheless important always to judge them by the word of God.<a name=43:2></a> These experiences are the expression of the inward state of the heart, and of our relations with others, as well as of the sentiments which our conduct, in these same relations, produces in our hearts and in our consciences.<a name=43:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not necessary here to speak of the experience of an unconverted person, although such a one is nevertheless not without experiences.<a name=43:4></a> It is true, that he does not know God; but, in a certain sense, he enjoys His goodness in nature; his conscience can blame him -- he can be weary of sin, and alarmed at the thought of judgment.<a name=43:5></a> He can even forget the latter in the enjoyment of his family and society in a life naturally amiable; but he can do no more.<a name=43:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nevertheless there is a great variety in the experiences of men in whom the Spirit of God is working.<a name=43:7></a> This difference arises, on the one hand, from the relations in which we stand to God, and, on the other, from our conduct in the same relations.<a name=43:8></a> It is true that God has not put us under the law; nevertheless an awakened conscience is, as regards its relationship to God, either under the law or under grace.<a name=43:9></a> The Spirit of God, who has awakened it, has caused the light to enter, and produces there the feeling of its responsibility.<a name=43:10></a> I am under the law as long as I make my acceptance with God to depend on my faithfulness to God, that is, on the fulfilment of my duties.<a name=43:11></a> If, on the other hand, the love of God and His work in Christ are, for my conscience, the only and perfect ground of my acceptance, then am I under grace.<a name=43:12></a> The Holy Spirit will not weaken the responsibility; but He will reveal to me that God has saved my soul, which was lost because my life did not answer this responsibility.<a name=43:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As long as the awakened soul remains under the law, it has sad experiences; it feels that it is guilty according to the law and that it has no power to keep it.<a name=43:14></a> It is well aware that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=44>[Page 44]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the law is good; but, in spite of all its efforts, it does not attain its object, which is obedience.<a name=44:1></a> The experiences of souls in such a state are the experiences of their sin -- of their weakness and of the power of sin.<a name=44:2></a> Even supposing such a soul should not be as yet altogether brought to despair by the expectation of the just judgment of God, because it experiences in a slight degree the love of God, and because it hopes in the work of Christ, there will not be less uncertainty as to its relations with God; and this gives place to alternations of peace and trouble.<a name=44:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter case, the soul has indeed been drawn by grace but the conscience has not been purified, and the heart not set at liberty.<a name=44:4></a> These experiences are useful, in order to convince us of sin and weakness, and to destroy all confidence in ourselves.<a name=44:5></a> It is necessary that we should feel ourselves condemned before God, and that we should know, that henceforth all depends on His unmerited grace.<a name=44:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is otherwise when our conscience is purged, and we have understood our position before God in Christ.<a name=44:7></a> Condemned in the presence of God, we understand that God has loved us, and that He justifies us by the work of His Son; we understand that sin is taken away, and our conscience is made perfect.<a name=44:8></a> We have no longer conscience of sins before God, because He Himself has taken them away for ever by the blood of Christ, and that blood is always before His eyes; we know, that being united with Christ, who has fully glorified God in that which concerns our sins, we have been made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=44:9></a> So the heart is free to enjoy His love in the presence of God.<a name=44:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thenceforth we are under grace.<a name=44:11></a> Our relations with God depend thenceforth on God's nature, and the righteousness which Christ is become for us.<a name=44:12></a> Our relations with God do not depend on what we are before Him as responsible beings.<a name=44:13></a> Our experiences thenceforth ever return to this: that God is love, that Christ is our righteousness, and God is our Father.<a name=44:14></a> We have communion with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=44:15></a> We enjoy all the privileges of that relation.<a name=44:16></a> Nevertheless the use which we make of our privileges affects that enjoyment.<a name=44:17></a> These relations remain constantly the same, as well as the perception which we have of them; but the enjoyment of what God is in that relation depends on our conduct in such a position.<a name=44:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The experiences are always founded on my relations with God.<a name=45:1></a> Am I sad?<a name=45:2></a> It is because the communion with God -- communion which answers to my relations to Him -- is interrupted.<a name=45:3></a> I feel that I do not enjoy the blessed communion to which I have attained, and it is this that causes my sadness; but this does not arise from uncertainty as to the communion.<a name=45:4></a> itself The flesh has no relations with God; and the flesh is ever in us.<a name=45:5></a> And "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us," Romans 5: 5.<a name=45:6></a> By the Spirit we have communion with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1: 3); and we are called on to walk in the light, as God Himself is in the light; 1 John 1: 7.<a name=45:7></a> Our communion with God depends on our walking in the light, although, when we have lost it, God can visit us by His grace, and restore communion.<a name=45:8></a> But God is faithful, and does not permit sin in His children.<a name=45:9></a> If they do not walk with Him in the light, He will cause them to pass through all the trials and all the conflicts necessary to bring them to the knowledge of themselves, that they may remain in the light, and that their communion may be true and pure.<a name=45:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true that these trials and conflicts do not affect our relations with God, because they depend on what God is in Christ, according to His grace and righteousness; but the suspension of communion with God, a suspension which puts us outside of the enjoyment of the light, brings us into all kinds of conflicts, and painful and humbling experiences of what our own heart really is.<a name=45:11></a> God Himself also employs correction to humble us and break our will.<a name=45:12></a> Not only is the actual fall into sin an opportunity for the dealing of God with our souls, but all that is hard and rebellious in our souls also affords an opportunity for it.<a name=45:13></a> The consequence of these truths is, that the experiences of a soul that walks with God are far more simple than the experiences of an unfaithful soul; and, nevertheless, the knowledge of God and of the heart of man will be far deeper in the former case.<a name=45:14></a> As long as we walk in communion with Him, we walk in the light; and we have in His presence the continual sense of His fatherly love.<a name=45:15></a> Never-the-less this presence acts upon our soul to manifest all that is not in harmony with the light.<a name=45:16></a> The judgment of ourselves takes place in the presence of God, in the sense of His love, and in connection with that love.<a name=45:17></a> Sin has the character of everything which is not light; and is judged, not only because

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With hearts purified by the love of God, and strengthened by communion with Him, the grace which acts thus in us takes the place of sin which has been judged, and thenceforth our walk in the world is the effect of the communion of God in our hearts.<a name=46:2></a> We carry God, so to speak, through the world in our hearts filled with Ms love, and living in the power of the life of Christ, that which Satan offers does not tempts us.<a name=46:3></a> Our worldly trials become a motive to obedience and not to sin.<a name=46:4></a> The presence of God in our hearts preserves us in our relations with men.<a name=46:5></a> Thenceforth we experience proofs of our corruption in the presence of God, and in communion with Him.<a name=46:6></a> It is thus we judge sin in ourselves, and sin thus judged does not appear in our walk.<a name=46:7></a> But if we do not walk in fellowship with God, if sin is not thus judged, we walk more or less in the world with a rebellious will and lusts unjudged.<a name=46:8></a> The action of our self-will makes us uneasy, because we are not satisfied.<a name=46:9></a> Are we satisfied?<a name=46:10></a> Then God is forgotten.<a name=46:11></a> Satan presents temptations which answer to unjudged lusts; then the corruption of the heart manifests itself by a fall and by our relations with Satan, which take the place of our relations with God.<a name=46:12></a> Such a knowledge of the corruption of the heart will be never so deep, never so clear, never so true.<a name=46:13></a>, as that which we shall have obtained in the presence of God by the light itself We shall know sin by sin, by a bad conscience, instead of knowing it by the light of God Himself.<a name=46:14></a> We shall be humbled, instead of being humble.<a name=46:15></a> The faithfulness of God will restore the soul; but the continued power and growing light of His communion will not be the same.<a name=46:16></a> It is true we shall experience His patience and His goodness; but we shall not know God in the same way as when walking faithfully in communion with Him.<a name=46:17></a> It is true, God glorifies Himself by His ways with such a soul, because all things concur to His eternal glory; but the knowledge of God grows by our communion with Him.<a name=46:18></a>

		The life of Abraham and that of Jacob come in the way of interesting examples, in support of what we have been saying.<a name=46:19></a> It is true that neither the law, nor the fulness of grace, had been as yet revealed.<a name=46:20></a> Nevertheless, as we see in Hebrews 2, the principles of the life of faith in the promises of God were in general the same.<a name=46:21></a>

		Still there are two very distinct characters in death, as the wages of sin, and for God.<a name=58:3></a> While it is the witness of man's sin, yet because of the death of the Lord Jesus death is now one of our servants.<a name=58:4></a> All things are ours, whether life, or death, or things present, or things to come'; all are ours.<a name=58:5></a> Death is for us now as it was against us before, because Christ has tasted death.<a name=58:6></a> "Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage," Hebrews 2: 14, 15.<a name=58:7></a> It was "by the grace of God" Christ tasted death.<a name=58:8></a> In His death we see the grace of God, though it was on account of sin.<a name=58:9></a> All that was against us is gone.<a name=58:10></a> The Lord Jesus Christ turns everything He touches into blessing.<a name=58:11></a> "Out of the eater cometh forth meat, and out of the strong sweetness.<a name=58:12></a>" If I am able to contemplate death in its mightiest power, the death of Jesus, I see in it the power of grace.<a name=58:13></a>

		And here it is that I find the proper character of the savour of worship, in the "burnt-offering.<a name=58:14></a>" The blessedness of the offering of Jesus was in the perfectness of His will, but the entireness of self -- sacrifice to God -- "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.<a name=58:15></a> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<a name=58:16></a> I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.<a name=58:17></a> This commandment have I received of my Father," John 10: 17, 18.<a name=58:18></a> He was not only the spotless victim, but one able to give Himself to God.<a name=58:19></a> "Being in the form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross," Philippians 2: 6-8.<a name=58:20></a> Again, "Lo I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O God; yea, thy law is within my heart," Psalm 40: 7, 8; Hebrews 10: 7.<a name=58:21></a> So we get not only the grace of God in the gift of Jesus, but that Jesus, "through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God," Hebrews 9: 14.<a name=58:22></a>

		It is very precious to find in Genesis the elements and the broad principles of the relations of God with man in all their freshness, from the creation, sin, and the promise of the second Adam.<a name=68:3></a> We also see how the government of God was exercised; in what manner man fell; the judgment of the deluge, which put an end to the old world; the promises made to Abraham; the two covenants of Sarai and Hagar; the relations of God with the Jews in the beautiful typical history of Joseph.<a name=68:4></a> Thus, in a word, we find in Genesis, not only a history, but the grand bases of God's relations with man.<a name=68:5></a> Abraham under this holds a chief place as the depositary of the promises.<a name=68:6></a> We may understand this by what the apostle Paul says to the Galatians (chapter 3: 13, 14): "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, through faith.<a name=68:7></a>"

		Before we stop at the race of Seem, concerning whom God is particularly occupied, one remark is needed.<a name=69:7></a> A terrible principle is come up in this state of things.<a name=69:8></a> Man exalts himself in separating from God.<a name=69:9></a> But, insufficient to himself he becomes a slave; he submits to Satan's power, serves him and adores him.<a name=69:10></a> Having abandoned God, Satan usurps this place; he alarms the conscience; he takes possession of the heart and energy of man, who gives himself up to idolatry.<a name=69:11></a>

		You will find this fact in Joshua 24: 2.<a name=69:12></a> It is the principle of Satan's power on earth; which adds to the history of man.<a name=69:13></a> Joshua furnishes us with this addition to the account of the things which came to pass after the deluge -- the violence of man, the dispersion of the nations; that is, that the.<a name=69:14></a> family of Seem even, these children of Heber, worshipped other gods than the true and living God.<a name=69:15></a> The apostle tells us they were demons.<a name=69:16></a> "The things which they sacrificed, they sacrificed to demons and not to God.<a name=69:17></a>" Such is the new world; Satan becomes the ruler of the one we inhabit (a circumstance we set too much aside).<a name=69:18></a> God can deliver us, in one sense, from the yoke of Satan as ruler, although it abides true that this latter can tempt us by the lusts of this world, and make us fall morally under his yoke.<a name=69:19></a> For example, if the gospel be received outwardly in a country, and if the word of God have its free course there, whilst in another country evangelisation is not even permitted, it is evident that, in this latter, souls labour under a yoke which does not weigh in the former, and that Satan rules over one of these countries as he does not

		God manifests Himself to the conscience, which sees itself in the presence of God; it feels that God is there; it perceives beforehand a judgment which is impending; and, whatever be the lack of outward manifestation, man must find himself before God, must follow Him, whereas before this he did his own will.<a name=70:18></a> So it happened to Saul of Tarsus.<a name=70:19></a> Saul had not troubled himself about God's win; but as soon as he had heard Christ, he must enlist himself.<a name=70:20></a> The effect produced in the heart is expressed in these words: "What wilt thou have me to do?<a name=70:21></a>" The communication of life, we know, takes place in the soul.<a name=70:22></a> Also, God speaks, even though He should have manifested Himself to the sight, as to Saul.<a name=70:23></a> It is His word which makes itself to be heard, even when it is written; and the written word is in fact of authority,

		Peter might have said to the Lord, Thou canst hinder my being thus sifted, as Martha and Mary thought Jesus could have hindered the death of Lazarus; and, truly, He who can give the crown of life can shelter us; but He does not do so, that we may be tried.<a name=87:9></a> Satan desired to have Job to sift him like wheat, and God permitted him to do so; and this happens to us also.<a name=87:10></a> We often say within ourselves, Why has He dealt thus with me?<a name=87:11></a> Why has He put me in such or such a crucible?<a name=87:12></a> Ah, it is Satan who desired, and God who permitted it.<a name=87:13></a> Things often.<a name=87:14></a> occur which we cannot understand; such things are intended to shew us what the flesh is.<a name=87:15></a>

		When God is about to use a Christian in His work, He takes the one who has gone the farthest in the path of trial.<a name=87:16></a> Thus here it is said, "Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you.<a name=87:17></a>" The danger is presented to all; but He adds, speaking to Peter, "I have prayed for thee," for thee in particular; for Jesus distinguishes him from all the rest because he had taken a more prominent position than the others, and was thus more exposed, though they were all sifted at the death of Jesus.<a name=87:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord then says to Peter, "When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.<a name=87:19></a>" He was not going to spare any of His disciples the sifting; but Peter was to be the most severely tried, and, therefore, the best to strengthen his brethren.<a name=87:20></a> Notwithstanding all this, Peter is full of self-confidence.<a name=87:21></a> "I am ready to go with thee both unto prison and to death.<a name=87:22></a>" But Jesus replies, "The cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.<a name=87:23></a>"

		If we notice all that Christ did, we shall see how He was watching at this time over Peter; His grace (so to speak) went out to meet him, and took care of him all through the temptation.<a name=88:4></a> The first thing that Jesus tells him is that He has prayed for him.<a name=88:5></a> It is not that Peter's repentance led to Jesus' intercession; but the intercession of Jesus brought about Peter's repentance.<a name=88:6></a> "I have prayed for thee," and "Jesus looked on Peter.<a name=88:7></a>" As to Judas, he denied the Lord; and, when his conscience was awakened, he killed himself.<a name=88:8></a> No sooner was the crime committed than all confidence fled, and he went and killed himself.<a name=88:9></a> But, here, the effect of the prayer of Jesus was to preserve faith at the bottom of Peter's heart, so that, when Jesus looked on him, he was broken down.<a name=88:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing to remark is, that the Lord had prayed for Peter; and the second, that He always remembered His disciple, and as soon as the cock crowed, Jesus looked on him, and Peter wept bitterly.<a name=88:11></a> It is in this way the Lord deals with us, He prays for us, and allows us to go into temptation.<a name=88:12></a> If He conducts us when in it, He also bids us to pray that we enter not into temptation: but God permits all this because He sees the end of it.<a name=88:13></a> If Peter had been conscious of his own weakness, he would not have dared to shew himself before the High Priest.<a name=88:14></a> This trial was the natural consequence of what he was in the flesh; but it was God's purpose to use him, and even to put him in a prominent position in His work.<a name=88:15></a> The cause of his fall was self-confidence; the flesh was actively present.<a name=88:16></a>

		THE LAST WORDS OF DAVID
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Samuel 22; 23: 1-7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a remarkable contrast between the two songs in these chapters: the song of David after he had done with an his enemies (that is, after his trials by Saul), and the song of David after he had done with himself; here brought together by the Spirit of God.<a name=93:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of his trials, when looking back at his enemies, he sings of joy and triumph: all is exaltation.<a name=93:2></a> After his experience of the blessing, it is, "Although my house be not so with God.<a name=93:3></a>" The end of all the sorrow and trial with Saul is rejoicing, exaltation, and strength.<a name=93:4></a> "The waves of death had compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid, the sorrows of hell compassed me about, and the snares of death prevented me"; yet, the result of all he thus went through, in deep and bitter exercise of soul, is triumph, thanksgiving, and praise in the first instance, when he recounts God's deliverance; while, in the second, the result of the place of honour, blessing, and triumph, is deeper and bitter sorrow -- the confession, "my house is not so with God!<a name=93:5></a>" Not that he was without something to sustain his heart under it all; for he adds, "yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure.<a name=93:6></a>" For this he waited until the "morning without clouds.<a name=93:7></a>" But the end of all his blessing here is, "my house is not so with God.<a name=93:8></a>" This contrast makes trouble precious, and is a check to any desire to get out of it.<a name=93:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So practically is it with us.<a name=93:10></a> We need to guard against the effects of success; the pressure of circumstances which keep me down produces nothing but joy and praise in the experience of God's goodness; the effect of circumstances which lift me up is sorrow.<a name=93:11></a> How often has a saint, when in trial and conscious weakness, cast therein upon the Lord, cried unto Him, and as a faithful servant been sustained, had blessing and acquired influence, godly influence too; but how often satisfied with the blessing and the influence thus acquired and losing the sense of his weakness, has he stopped suddenly short in his course, been arrested in the point of influence obtained, and become comparatively useless in the church of God!<a name=93:12></a> This should lead us to desire conformity in suffering

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things brought before us in these chapters: one of them intended to give us solemn warning: First, the result of David's trials at the hand of Saul.<a name=94:3></a> Then, second, when set upon the throne, the consequence of his being surrounded with all the earthly blessings.<a name=94:4></a> And, third, the joy at the end, of "the sweet psalmist of Israel," in anticipation of the "morning without clouds.<a name=94:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whilst the heart receives the warning against the effects of success, or anything in present blessing, are we looking out for and resting on, the full, distinct, and perfect blessing, which will be in that day when the Lord Jesus comes?<a name=94:6></a> We see here the way in which the Spirit of Christ gathers up the history of Israel in Christ as a centre, and makes the harp of David that on which it should be played.<a name=94:7></a> There is perhaps nothing of deeper interest than to see how God takes up the history of David in the Psalms, writing as it were upon the tablets of David's heart the history of the Lord Jesus.<a name=94:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first song there is a remarkable allusion to the whole history of Israel, to dealings of God with them, of which David felt the moral power in himself.<a name=94:9></a> We have a wonderful variety of circumstances, backward, forward, and around, gathering up all the history of David, and the triumphs of David; unfolding the sympathies of Christ with the heart of David in sorrow, until he is made the head of the heathen, his own people being blessed under him.<a name=94:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 23 we get "the last words of David.<a name=94:11></a>" And here we learn where his eye and heart rested, amidst consciousness of his own failure, and the failure of his house.<a name=94:12></a> He was looking for the "morning without clouds," for the One who should rule over men in the fear of the Lord, who should build God's house, and in whom the glory should be manifested.<a name=94:13></a> These men of Belial too, there must come one in the sternness of judgment to set them aside: then "they should all of them be as thorns thrust away.<a name=94:14></a>" There is the deep consciousness of all the ruin, but the effect of the coming morning shining into it.<a name=94:15></a> The effect of the coming of the Son of David on David's heart, and the failure of everything around, leading him to reach forward in spirit to the full triumph of that day when all should be full of blessing.<a name=94:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We thus, in the two chapters, have the unfolding of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=95>[Page 95]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sympathies of Christ with the heart of David, gathering up all the sorrows of the history of Israel; and also the heart of David resting in the consciousness of what the "morning without clouds" would be.<a name=95:1></a> We should seek so to get the power of the Spirit in the sympathies of Christ, and at the same time to reach out to the hope which the Spirit of God sets before us, as by the way to be thrown upon the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.<a name=95:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now trace a little what David was, up to the time of this success.<a name=95:3></a> It is ever just the very thing that seems hopeless in the eyes of man, which is taken up of God.<a name=95:4></a> See Sarah, Rebekah, Zecharias, and Elizabeth, so too here with David.<a name=95:5></a> In him there was everything contrary to the thoughts of the flesh.<a name=95:6></a> Contrast him with Saul.<a name=95:7></a> Saul was the comeliest in Israel, taller than them all by the head; "from the shoulders and upwards he was higher than any of the people" -- strength in the flesh.<a name=95:8></a> But all this is passed by, and it is the "lad keeping sheep" that is taken up!<a name=95:9></a> Saul is unfaithful -- rejected from being king, and then God sets His eye upon David.<a name=95:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Samuel, by the Spirit of prophecy (1 Samuel 16), goes down to Bethlehem, to select from among the sons of Jesse one who should be king in the room of Saul.<a name=95:11></a> He causes them to pass before him.<a name=95:12></a> Seven come in.<a name=95:13></a> Samuel asks, Is there not another?<a name=95:14></a> Yes, a lad keeping the sheep.<a name=95:15></a> "Send and fetch him.<a name=95:16></a>" David comes, and is designated by the Spirit of prophecy as the anointed of Jehovah.<a name=95:17></a> All that is great in Jesse's eyes is suffered to pass unnoticed; the seven were personable men, but it is the lad keeping the sheep, the eighth, the weak one, that is preferred and taken up!<a name=95:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From that time the Spirit of God departs from Saul, and an evil spirit falls upon him.<a name=95:19></a> David is brought into his company as one who could play upon the harp.<a name=95:20></a> Here we find him of no importance, so that afterwards, when he had killed the giant Goliath, on Saul's inquiring of Abner, "whose son is this youth?<a name=95:21></a>" Abner says, "I cannot tell.<a name=95:22></a>" His brethren too ask him, "with whom he has left the few sheep in the wilderness.<a name=95:23></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		But what traits do we find in David?<a name=95:24></a> Deep consciousness of having God's strength, and forgetfulness of self in all the difficulties which come in the way of duty.<a name=95:25></a> He keeps his father's sheep: a lion and a bear come to take a lamb of the flock.<a name=95:26></a> It is his business to guard sheep, and he goes at once against the lion and the bear, and slays them.<a name=95:27></a> These energetic

		Hebrews 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a blessed thing, though in one sense a terrible one (terrible ever to the flesh), to know that we "have to do" with God; verse 13.<a name=115:1></a> Yet there is nothing that we so easily forget, or so often lose sight of.<a name=115:2></a> The natural tendency of our hearts is to get out of, and then (as the disobedient child, that of the parent whose eye he fears to meet) to dislike and dread, God's presence.<a name=115:3></a> Always, every moment, under every circumstance, it is God with whom we "have to do.<a name=115:4></a>" People who are ever looking at second causes are led into practical infidelity; and so is it in measure with the saint of God: if he be resting in circumstances, he loses the sense of "having to do" with God.<a name=115:5></a> But whether it be for blessing, or for profit to the conscience, we have alike "to do" with God.<a name=115:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are we seeking happiness, where shall we find it?<a name=115:7></a> where shall we get blessing that nothing can touch or hinder, that nothing can separate from, except in God?<a name=115:8></a> He is not only the source of our blessing, but the blessing itself.<a name=115:9></a> There are indeed many outward blessings given to His children by the way, and these even the unconverted may have; but the strength, the comfort, the joy of the Christian is this -- he "has to do" with God.<a name=115:10></a> God is the source and centre of his blessing.<a name=115:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When once we come really to know God, we know Him as love.<a name=115:12></a> Then, knowing that everything comes to us from Him, though we be in a desert -- no matter where, or what the circumstances -- we interpret all by His love.<a name=115:13></a> I may be called on to pass through pain, and sorrow, and trial, as part of His discipline; but everything that comes from God, comes from a source and spring in which I have confidence.<a name=115:14></a> I look, through the circumstances, to Him; and nothing can separate me from His love.<a name=115:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where God is but little known, and where there is not therefore confidence in His love, there will be repining at circumstances, and murmuring, and rebellion.<a name=115:16></a> In such a case, the sense of having to do with God will cause more fear than gladness.<a name=115:17></a> John says, "We have known, and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=115:18></a> God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<a name=115:19></a>"

		Is it not quite true that we often stop, practically, at the circumstances in which we find ourselves placed, and consider only our own feelings and judgment about them?<a name=116:1></a> Now this is a proof that our souls are not living in the fulness of communion with God.<a name=116:2></a> That with which we should be occupied is, not the circumstances, but what God intends by them.<a name=116:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Conscience must be in exercise as well; for it is equally true, that in our consciences we "have to do with God.<a name=116:4></a> This is very profitable, though not so pleasant.<a name=116:5></a> All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do," verse 13.<a name=116:6></a> And after all, dear brethren, is it not a blessed thing to know that nothing can escape either the hand or eye of God?<a name=116:7></a> What a comfort that He discerns every thought of our hearts that would hinder blessing, or dim communion with Himself!<a name=116:8></a> There may be some secret evil (one of the ten thousand things that, if indulged, would hinder the enjoyment of God) working in my heart, and yet I remain unconscious of it.<a name=116:9></a> Well, God sends some circumstance that discovers to me the evil, in order that it may be put away.<a name=116:10></a> Is not this a blessing?<a name=116:11></a> The circumstance does not create the evil which it excites; it only acts upon what it finds to be in my heart, and makes it manifest.<a name=116:12></a> Since I "have to do" with God, I am made to understand evil in myself which I had never understood before, or known to be there.<a name=116:13></a> God discovers the "thoughts and intents of the heart"; He could not rest whilst leaving anything there that would hinder our love and confidence, our comfort and peace in Himself.<a name=116:14></a> The evil being discovered, circumstances are all forgotten -- God's end alone is seen.<a name=116:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The heart of man naturally seeks rest, and seeks it here.<a name=116:16></a> Now, there is no rest to be found here for the saint; but it is written, "there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God," verse 9.<a name=116:17></a> To know this is both full of blessing and full of sorrow: sorrow to the flesh, because as it is always seeking its rest here, it has always to be disappointed -- blessing to the spirit, because the spirit, being born of God, can only rest in God's own rest, as it is said, "If they shall enter into my rest," verse 3, 5.<a name=116:18></a> God cannot rest in the corruption of sin.<a name=116:19></a> He can only rest in that which is perfectly holy.<a name=116:20></a> And because He who thus rests is love and loves us, He makes us understand that He will bring us into His own rest, into His own delight.<a name=116:21></a>

		Now let the soul once know what this rest of God is, let the heart once be set upon it, there will be joy unspeakable in understanding that God's love can rest in nothing short of bringing us into His own delight.<a name=117:1></a> There will then also be the full, settled consciousness that we cannot find rest elsewhere.<a name=117:2></a> There are indeed joys by the way, but the moment we rest in them, they become, as the quails of Israel (Numbers 11), poison.<a name=117:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whenever the soul loses practically the knowledge that its rest is in God's rest, the moment the eye is off that which "remaineth," we begin to seek a rest here, and consequently get uneasy, restless, and dissatisfied.<a name=117:4></a> Every time we find something on which we attempt to settle, that very thing proves but a new source of trouble and conflict to us, a new source of exercise and weariness of heart.<a name=117:5></a> God loves us too well to let us rest here.<a name=117:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the secret of the unhappiness and restlessness of many a saint?<a name=117:8></a> A hankering after rest here.<a name=117:9></a> God is therefore obliged to discipline and exercise that soul; to allow, it may be, some circumstance to detect the real state of the heart by touching that about which the will is concerned.<a name=117:10></a> Circumstances would not trouble, if they did not find something in us contrary to God; they would rustle by as the wind.<a name=117:11></a> God deals with that in us which hinders communion, and prevents our seeking rest in Him alone.<a name=117:12></a> His discipline is the continual and unwearied exercise of love, which rests not now, in order that we may enter into His rest.<a name=117:13></a> If He destroys our rest here if He turns our meat into poison, it is only that He may bring us into His own rest, that we may have that which satisfies His desires, not ours.<a name=117:14></a> "He will rest in his love.<a name=117:15></a>"

		The point is one which concerns those who are justified, whom God has brought into His family; God is training such, and bringing them up into the full enjoyment of His own blessedness and rest.<a name=118:3></a> If I, being a parent, enjoy anything, it is impossible (if I really love my child) not to wish him to enjoy it with me.<a name=118:4></a> And if we, who are evil, do this, how much more our heavenly Father!<a name=118:5></a> What God desires for us, as we have seen (and He delights to do it), is to bring us into the enjoyment of all that which He Himself enjoys.<a name=118:6></a> He has made us partakers of the divine nature that we may enjoy it.<a name=118:7></a> The Hebrews were continually liable to sink into the seeking a rest here, in short, not to live a life of faith.<a name=118:8></a> The great point on which the apostle insists is that God has not His rest here -- that while there was that which hindered the comfort of His love He could not rest.<a name=118:9></a> And this is proved by a variety of testimonies.<a name=118:10></a> See verses 3-8.<a name=118:11></a>

		As to their own state, though he says, "We which have believed do enter into rest" (verse 3), it was not needful to prove to them, any more than it would be to ourselves, that they were not in the rest.<a name=118:12></a> We read of their enduring a great fight of afflictions, of their being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions, and of their becoming companions of them that were so used.<a name=118:13></a> They were still in circumstances in which it could be said to them, "Ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<a name=118:14></a>" The exhortations are plainly inconsistent with a state of rest: "Let us therefore fear" (verse 1) Let us labour, therefore," verse 11.<a name=118:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem strange to have pressed upon us at one moment unqualified assurance in the love and faithfulness of God, and at the next to be addressed thus, "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it," verse 1.<a name=118:16></a> But God never ceases to warn in order that there may be the exercise of responsibility towards Himself, while we are on our way to the rest.<a name=118:17></a> Were justification spoken of, had that been the point in question, it would have been said, Do not fear, and do not labour; for Christ has done all for you.<a name=118:18></a> "To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.<a name=118:19></a>"

		THE CALL OF THE BRIDE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Genesis 24
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Abraham, as being the depositary of the promises of God to the patriarchs, we find the fundamental principles of the believer.<a name=124:1></a> Abraham having offered up his son Isaac, and having received him back, this act gives us the type of the resurrection of Jesus, who becomes, like Isaac, heir of all the goods of His Father.<a name=124:2></a> Rebekah, type of the church, is called to be the bride of Isaac risen.<a name=124:3></a> Afterwards in Jacob we have the typical history of the Jewish people.<a name=124:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Abraham we have the principle of man's relationship with God, pure grace without law.<a name=124:5></a> Hagar is introduced as a figure of the law coming in.<a name=124:6></a> Isaac, raised from the dead in figure, shews us Christ, the Head, having accomplished His work, and being in the position to maintain all the results of the divine counsels.<a name=124:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter Abraham sends Eliezer to seek a wife for Isaac.<a name=124:8></a> This represents the Holy Spirit sent by the Father to seek the church, "the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=124:9></a>" It is not Isaac who goes to look for a bride.<a name=124:10></a> No more does Christ return to this earth to choose a church for Himself.<a name=124:11></a> Rebekah must leave her country and come to the land of promise.<a name=124:12></a> In this chapter we see the features of the Holy Spirit's work, and how a soul is conducted under His guidance.<a name=124:13></a> That is what we are about to see in Eliezer and Rebekah.<a name=124:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham, having become old, says to the eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell," verse 1, 2.<a name=124:15></a> The first thing which is presented to us here is Eliezer, who has the superintendence of all the goods of his master.<a name=124:16></a> He is not the heir -- the son is the heir.<a name=124:17></a> Thus the Holy Spirit has the disposal of all things.<a name=124:18></a> He takes of the things of Christ and shews them unto us, that is, to the church.<a name=124:19></a> "But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.<a name=124:20></a> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?<a name=124:21></a> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again," verse 4.<a name=124:22></a>

		It is impossible that there should be any relation between Christ risen again and this world.<a name=125:1></a> Isaac does not go for Rebekah, but she must come to him.<a name=125:2></a> Abraham gives directions to his servant.<a name=125:3></a> Thus the first thing is to be directed by the word of God.<a name=125:4></a> Instead of making further inquiries, Abraham's servant makes ready and goes off to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor, with no other information; verse 9-11.<a name=125:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important that we should act in the same manner.<a name=125:6></a> Natural wisdom can form a judgment up to a certain point, but it takes the soul away from the presence of God, even when we are doing things according to God.<a name=125:7></a> If we begin to deliberate, there is hesitation: we take counsel of flesh and blood.<a name=125:8></a> The first thing is to put ourselves <i>in the presence of God</i>; without that there is neither wisdom nor power; whereas, placed in the path of blessing, we get from Him all the intelligence which we shall need.<a name=125:9></a> We observe this in the journey of Abraham's servant.<a name=125:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eliezer says, "O Lord God of my master Abraham.<a name=125:11></a>" He does not say "<i>my</i> God.<a name=125:12></a>" The promises had been made to Abraham, and God had revealed Himself as the God of Abraham.<a name=125:13></a> Here the servant shews himself in entire dependence; and we find him in the path of promise, not exalting himself, but acting according to the counsels of God in entire dependence, and not pretending to have anything, except where God had placed the blessing; for the promises had been made to Abraham.<a name=125:14></a> For us this blessing is in Christ, and there is the answer to our requests; nor do we desire to obtain anything save where God has put His blessing, namely, in the path of obedience to the faith.<a name=125:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eliezer addresses the God of his master Abraham, praying him to favour his master: "O Lord, let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink <i>also</i>, let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.<a name=125:16></a>" (O Lord, thou must act, and I must know by that the one whom thou hast designed to be the wife of thy servant Isaac; the one who will do these things will be the one whom thou hast chosen.<a name=125:17></a>) "And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.<a name=125:18></a> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.<a name=125:19></a> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.<a name=125:20></a> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.<a name=125:21></a> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.<a name=125:22></a> And the man wondering at her held his peace.<a name=125:23></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Why any doubt?<a name=126:1></a> Why does the servant hesitate, since his request has obtained such an answer?<a name=126:2></a> Here is the reason.<a name=126:3></a> Whatever may be the apparent manifestation of the hand of God, there is a positive rule in the word to which the Christian must pay attention, and which he must not neglect, because of his weakness in discerning what is of God.<a name=126:4></a> Faith looks to the power of God, but judges all by the word; for God must act according to His word; and the servant, being in communion with God, ought to act in this thought; and even when there may be signs, he should decide nothing until the will of God be clear according to His word.<a name=126:5></a> He must be able to say, This is indeed <i>according to God</i>.<a name=126:6></a>

		"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets, for her hands, often shekels weight of gold; and said, Whose daughter art thou?<a name=126:7></a> tell me, I pray thee; is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?<a name=126:8></a> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.<a name=126:9></a> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.<a name=126:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		God had perfectly answered the desire of Abraham.<a name=126:11></a> Eliezer, for his part, sees that he has been heard.<a name=126:12></a> Before going farther, before even entering the house, inasmuch as he had recognised the intervention of God in the whole of this business, he bowed himself and worshipped the Lord, and said, "Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.<a name=126:13></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Laban and Bethuel, after having heard Abraham's servant narrate the circumstances, acknowledge that the thing proceeds from the Lord, and say, "We cannot speak unto thee bad or good," verse 50.<a name=127:8></a> Thus, if in the circumstances of our Christian life we act in entire dependence on God, He will make our way plain, and will even soften our enemies, on account of the dependence on Him in which we live.<a name=127:9></a> Because we have set the Lord before us, He will be always at our right hand.<a name=127:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is with us now.<a name=131:8></a> The Christian who is not spiritual, but rather worldly, has a sorrowful lot; he cannot be happy if seeking after the world.<a name=131:9></a> The worldly man has at least something; he makes trial of these passing pleasures, and finds in them his joy, worthless as it may be; for in truth this joy does not satisfy.<a name=131:10></a> But the Christian finds in these things only uneasiness, because he bears about a conscience affected by the Holy Spirit.<a name=131:11></a> If he wishes to take his pleasure in the things of earth, and his heart hangs back from following the Lord, he is unhappy; he cannot chide a conscience which torments him; and as he has not listened to the Holy Spirit's invitation and has not obeyed it, there is no joy for him.<a name=131:12></a> The spiritual things, which ought to have constituted his joy, produce reproaches in his heart when he turns towards them.<a name=131:13></a> But we have the grace of Him who calls us, and who leads us, if we are faithful, in an uniform path, for the sake of His name.<a name=131:14></a> If we sin, this does not put us under the law; but we have an Advocate with the Father, who intercedes for us; and God, who is faithful, cannot fail when He is appealed to.<a name=131:15></a> "What wilt thou do unto thy great name?<a name=131:16></a>" Besides, His glory is involved in lifting us up again; and this is grace.<a name=131:17></a> Yes, we have a Saviour who intercedes with the Father for us, and who works to bring us back to the gracious God who has begun this work in us and will perfect it till the day of Christ, accomplishing all that concerns us.<a name=131:18></a>

		GOD'S DWELLING WITH MEN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Revelation 21: 1-8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this part of the chapter we have the end of all things, when the mediatorial work of Christ, even as king in subduing all things, is finished, and He has given up the kingdom that God may be all in all; when the final result is produced in the new heaven and the new earth; when the former things have passed away; when everything is in its own essential blessedness in the presence of God, and we have not only got blessing, but this in glory; it leads us in a peculiar manner to see the way in which the thought and counsel of God have been at all times to make man His dwelling-place.<a name=136:1></a> This is not always observed in Scripture; but when God's ways are brought out, and also particularly His holiness as it is said in the Psalms, "Holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever," then we have the purpose of God unfolded to us to make man His dwelling-place; and therefore we find the goodness and love of God finally displayed.<a name=136:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.<a name=136:3></a>" The language is figurative, no doubt; but there is this full and complete effect of God's own dealing and working in the removal of everything that can create a pang.<a name=136:4></a> But there is more in this than that tears are wiped away: God shall do it.<a name=136:5></a> There is the compassion that has caused the removal of the sorrow, and this is more than that the sorrow is gone.<a name=136:6></a> It is God who has removed all.<a name=136:7></a> If the evil is gone and the sense of pain, it is God who has put them away from the heart.<a name=136:8></a> "And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.<a name=136:9></a>" Not only has He taken away the evil, but it is never to be any more.<a name=136:10></a> That is, there is now full and perfect security and blessedness.<a name=136:11></a> All the evil is gone, and all those things too through which; man was exercised to bring him to a point where he could really meet God.<a name=136:12></a> The love of God takes the place of everything, and, filling all things with Himself, precludes the possibility of evil ever coming in again the contrast of man's paradise of old, as we all know.<a name=136:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then come two great principles in verses 6, 7: "I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.<a name=136:14></a> He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.<a name=136:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=137>[Page 137]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, there is the one who is athirst, and then the one who overcomes.<a name=137:1></a> These are the ways in which the Spirit works; and God always answers the workings of the Spirit.<a name=137:2></a> Whenever the Spirit acts in producing desires and wants (it may be at first after holiness or forgiveness, and then after communion and enjoying God), they are all perfectly satisfied in God.<a name=137:3></a> Therefore it is said, "I will give unto him that is athirst of -- the fountain of the water of life.<a name=137:4></a>" It is not merely, mark, the water of life that is given here; but there is given "of the fountain," that which springs up in the presence of God.<a name=137:5></a> What a thing to find!<a name=137:6></a> Thus the soul is perfectly satisfied with the fountain of blessedness for which he is thirsting, even God Himself, whom he is rendered capable of enjoying.<a name=137:7></a> He is at the wellspring.<a name=137:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second principle is that he that overcomes shall inherit.<a name=137:9></a> Here we find not desires satisfied, but difficulties overcome.<a name=137:10></a> It was so with Jesus Himself, as it is said, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father on his throne.<a name=137:11></a>" "He that overcometh shall inherit these things," as associated with Christ, "and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.<a name=137:12></a>" He comes into immediate connection with God.<a name=137:13></a> In the one we have the satisfaction of spiritual wants, in the other the relationship wherein we stand.<a name=137:14></a> This is the general thought.<a name=137:15></a> Such is the state and condition of those spoken of; but there is another point which deserves to be enlarged on a little more, and that is the personal happiness found in it.<a name=137:16></a> There is no longer a Mediator, no longer the need of one; there is no more the need of mercy and grace found to help in the time of need.<a name=137:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come a little closer, there are other things that claim attention.<a name=137:18></a> We have here, "Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people," etc.<a name=137:19></a> His dwelling-place is with men.<a name=137:20></a> It is no more an individual or a national thing.<a name=137:21></a> Of course the wicked are put away; but God's dwelling-place is no longer with the Jews, but with men.<a name=137:22></a> And this too is to be noticed, that the church has a very peculiar place.<a name=137:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of God was to be with men, dwelling and

	<div class="paragraph">
		abiding with them.<a name=138:1></a> Christ dwelt here among men, but it was a short time, and now He is cast out; but that will be another thing.<a name=138:2></a> Nor will it be as He appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<a name=138:3></a> Even Christ's stay was to end; but not so the dwelling of God by-and-by.<a name=138:4></a> Neither is it simply men made blessed; but God will dwell with them.<a name=138:5></a> Such is the distinctive eternal character of blessing; but also the church is to possess it in a peculiar way, already remarked on in this passage.<a name=138:6></a> It is not life only, but the presence of God with men as His abiding-place to reveal Himself and bless them fully.<a name=138:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look back at Adam and his dwelling-place, we shall not find this.<a name=138:8></a> God did not, could not, stay there.<a name=138:9></a> Man was then put under responsibility to see if God could stay there.<a name=138:10></a> The question of obedience had to be settled; and we know how it was settled.<a name=138:11></a> Man disobeyed and was cast out.<a name=138:12></a> The test was the stability of the creature; it was no question of divine work in grace.<a name=138:13></a> God, therefore, in no wise dwelt there.<a name=138:14></a> But on man's sin He revealed the assurance of the Second Man, the Lord from heaven.<a name=138:15></a> As the first man, Adam, had failed under the serpent's craft, the last Adam was to come and destroy his power.<a name=138:16></a> So said God when pronouncing on the serpent.<a name=138:17></a> There was this revelation; but the world went on so badly that the flood came and took them all away, save Noah and his family, whom God rescued in the ark.<a name=138:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet the next thing we hear of the world is that men set about in the plain of Shinar to defy God, centralise man, and possess the earth in their own might and for their own name; just as men will do by-and-by in a yet more daring way, but Jehovah will confound them also, as He did at Babel.<a name=138:19></a> Thus, we see, by His judgment, the world ordered into nations and tongues; and the very fact of the existence of different tongues shews that men are separated into nations.<a name=138:20></a> This took its rise at Babel; so that the children of men could no longer understand each other.<a name=138:21></a> And still there are these peoples and tongues, nations and families.<a name=138:22></a> Thus the world was settled then.<a name=138:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But another thing comes out: "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham.<a name=138:24></a>" He said, as it were, You must have done with all this: it is the world.<a name=138:25></a> You must leave your country, and kindred, and father's house.<a name=138:26></a> I must have a people in the world.<a name=138:27></a> This was the call of Abram.<a name=138:28></a> But though we hear of the calling of God, and the election of God, and the promises of God, we have no such thing as God dwelling

		with Abram or the patriarchs.<a name=139:1></a> We know, in fact, that Abram did not leave his father's home at once, though he did quit his country; in other words, he had not done with the flesh.<a name=139:2></a> But when Terah was dead, then he blessedly went on as a pilgrim, and God visited him in a lovely way, shewing him His goodness and grace; not, of course, in such spiritual depth and fulness as now, but brightly and beautifully, as in Genesis 17, 18.<a name=139:3></a> He was the olive-tree or stock of God, as we read in Romans 11.<a name=139:4></a> Still there was yet no dwelling-place for God.<a name=139:5></a> He visits and gives him the promises.<a name=139:6></a> This was all right so far as it went; and though Abraham's faith failed in Egypt, yet in the main he walked blessedly as a pilgrim.<a name=139:7></a> But though God visited him and talked with him, there was yet nothing of redemption seen as a ground-work for God to abide with men.<a name=139:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At Egypt came the question which was to be the type of redemption: so mercy put the blood on the lintel as a figure of Christ.<a name=139:9></a> Then the children of Israel go through the Red Sea as the sign of the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=139:10></a> Then we find redemption -- the active intervention of God to make good the promises made.<a name=139:11></a> We have not now a promise of something to be given, but actual deliverance, as it is said in Exodus 19: 4: "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<a name=139:12></a>" So it is said (1 Peter 3: 18), "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.<a name=139:13></a>" Not our poor vile bodies -- they are not yet brought to God; but our souls are truly redeemed.<a name=139:14></a> A work has been wrought so absolute in its nature for the putting away of sin, that now there is not a single thing (morally I mean) between God and him who has part in it; and not only is there nothing in us by which sin can be imputed, but we have been brought nigh to God.<a name=139:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Say, are you brought nigh to God?<a name=139:16></a> You say, I am hoping to get there.<a name=139:17></a> Then you have not been brought there, for He does not bring half way.<a name=139:18></a> But Christ has brought us nigh to God.<a name=139:19></a> He represents us in the presence of God.<a name=139:20></a> The putting away of sin is accomplished, or it never can be, for Christ cannot die over again.<a name=139:21></a> The work is done, but also the people are brought out.<a name=139:22></a> All that hindered God having them is put away by blood-shedding; but also they are taken out of the condition in which they were and are brought to God, to

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very different thought to say, One day I hope to come, from saying, I am come.<a name=140:3></a> It is all grace: that we know.<a name=140:4></a> But now there is nothing between me and God -- of course, there is the blessed Mediator -- but I mean there is no evil; it is all cast into the depths of the sea; and we are in His presence "holy and without blame.<a name=140:5></a>" And what is the consequence of this?<a name=140:6></a> That God can dwell among us and in us.<a name=140:7></a> If you look at Exodus 15: 2, you will see how He brings it out, consequent on their deliverance from Egypt, "The Lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation; he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation.<a name=140:8></a>" And in Exodus 29: 45, God declares that this was His own thought: "And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God, and they shall know that I am the Lord their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them; I am the Lord their God.<a name=140:9></a>" This is just the language applied to the church.<a name=140:10></a> We shall see the church brought out later.<a name=140:11></a> But He brought Israel into the land to dwell among them, and He did dwell among them, as we know, for the Shechinah just means a tabernacle or dwelling-place of glory.<a name=140:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We get this immense truth, which we are almost afraid to look in the face, that, when sin is put away and we are brought to God, He dwells in and among us.<a name=140:13></a> just as Solomon said, "But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?<a name=140:14></a> behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee," 2 Chronicles 6: 18.<a name=140:15></a> What a truth this is, that God has so perfectly sanctified the people in order to manifest Himself, that He comes and dwells among them!<a name=140:16></a> And where was Jehovah to dwell?<a name=140:17></a> In Israel; and all nations were to come there and see His glory; as it will be again in the latter day.<a name=140:18></a> It was all spoiled and corrupted: this is another thing; but it was set up that He might be inquired of by the nations.<a name=140:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find another thing connected with this, that, except the setting apart of the sabbath, the first time holiness is spoken of is in Exodus 15.<a name=140:20></a> Every saint had it, of course, in his heart and ways; but it was not brought out before.<a name=140:21></a> But the moment they sing this at the Red Sea, "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?<a name=140:22></a> who is like thee, glorious in holiness," the command is, "Sanctify yourselves";

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now another thing comes in, that where one gets this full blessedness is in Christ: not Christ in us (however true), but we in Him.<a name=141:7></a> And you will find this connected with the fact that He is dwelling with us.<a name=141:8></a> There is not a spot left on the man that is set apart as redeemed and purchased and perfected for ever, Christ having borne his sins in His work of redemption.<a name=141:9></a> The believer stands in all the efficacy of Christ's work.<a name=141:10></a> Suppose you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and your sins have not finally and definitely been put away, they never can be; or else Christ must die again, and He never can.<a name=141:11></a> But, blessed be God, He has put away sin, as we find in Hebrews 10: 11, "And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins; but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God.<a name=141:12></a>" He is not standing, but is set down, for the work is done.<a name=141:13></a> There we find perfect cleansing through the blood-shedding, as it was said to Israel, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you.<a name=141:14></a>"

		It is true again of the church of God, as it is said, "In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit," Ephesians 2: 22.<a name=142:5></a> Thus the church of God became the habitation of God.<a name=142:6></a> This is a wonderful and blessed position, and we have it in a special manner by the Head being in heaven, as the Lord Himself said, "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you," John 14: 20.<a name=142:7></a> This expresses our union with Christ; as it is said in Ephesians 5: 30, "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=142:8></a>" Such is the special and blessed character of the church.<a name=142:9></a> It is the habitation of God, and will be so till the day it is taken up to be with the Lord.<a name=142:10></a> This is indeed a wonderful thing, and shews us what manner of persons we ought to be in all holy conversation.<a name=142:11></a> The individual may fail, and the church of God may fail, and has failed, so as to have become the very seat of Satan (I mean those professing to be the church now); but this has not altered the truth that, wherever we find the true church, it is the habitation of God.<a name=142:12></a> It is not merely that life is there hidden as we get in Colossians, but manifested, as in Ephesians; it is brought out.<a name=142:13></a> It is the Holy Ghost in the individual man, though His presence may perhaps only be known by a groan.<a name=142:14></a> I am not speaking now of how all this has been corrupted and spoiled.<a name=142:15></a> This is truth also.<a name=142:16></a> But so is this other thing with regard to the individual, that Christ is in him, and he is in Christ.<a name=142:17></a> This is true of the church too, if it knows its place.<a name=142:18></a> It is more than being the mere dwelling-place of God.<a name=142:19></a> We have union with the Head in heaven.<a name=142:20></a> We are members individually, we are also collectively the body of Christ.<a name=142:21></a> Hence the exhortation, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God"; and therefore, the church ought to be as a city set on a hill.<a name=142:22></a>

		DEAD AND RISEN WITH CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you examine the writings of Paul with a little care, you will find this principle at the root of all his teaching -- that we are dead and risen with Christ.<a name=147:1></a> It is not only that He has died and risen for us, but that we are dead and risen with Him.<a name=147:2></a> He adds another thing; and that is our union with Him, now that He is ascended.<a name=147:3></a> "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=147:4></a>" These two principles are found here; our being dead and risen with Him; and our union with Him, now that He is on high.<a name=147:5></a> When he speaks of union, there is so far a difference that he looks at us as dead to begin with; and the whole power of Christ comes in to raise us.<a name=147:6></a> When he looks at people as living in sin, he brings in the doctrine of being dead to sin.<a name=147:7></a> On the other hand, if we are looked at as dead in sins, with no spiritual life, then the whole work is of God in raising us out of that state; so in Ephesians he unfolds the privileges of the child of God, from death to union with Christ.<a name=147:8></a> Here he lays, as the foundation of his teaching, our being dead and risen with Christ.<a name=147:9></a> Thus he associates us with Christ in every respect, first by death, then by resurrection, and, lastly, "when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.<a name=147:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference in the two epistles lies specially in this.<a name=147:11></a> To the Colossians he speaks of life, or the new nature, we have in Christ; whereas, in Ephesians, we have much more of the Holy Ghost by whom we are made one with Christ, "members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=147:12></a>" Here it is death and resurrection and association with Christ.<a name=147:13></a> Indeed this is his doctrine everywhere.<a name=147:14></a> "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.<a name=147:15></a>" "And you being dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.<a name=147:16></a>" His constant theme is that, as believers, our entire association is with Christ.<a name=147:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I repeat that, blessed as the full privileges are into which we thus come, the great doctrine, which lies at the foundation and root of all this, is the being dead and risen with Him.<a name=147:18></a> The true condition of every believer, that which from the very starting-point this doctrine teaches, is the utter judgment of the old man; the sentence of death passed upon

		it, and condemnation altogether.<a name=148:1></a> There is no recognition of the flesh as to allowance or acceptance of it.<a name=148:2></a> But when I have found out that the old man is simply this evil thing, then I discover that it is a question of putting it off and of putting on something else.<a name=148:3></a> It is not a correction of the old nature, but the having done with it and having something else instead of it.<a name=148:4></a> I put off the one, and I put on the other.<a name=148:5></a> It is a figure, of course, but the figure of what is most real to faith.<a name=148:6></a> On the one hand, I have done with my Adam-life; and, on the other, the nature that I get or put on by grace is the Christ-life.<a name=148:7></a> But how can I put off a life?<a name=148:8></a> I can put off an opinion or a bad habit; but how can I put off a life?<a name=148:9></a> The only way of putting off a life is by dying.<a name=148:10></a> But here I am alive.<a name=148:11></a> How, then, can it be true of me that I have put off the old man?<a name=148:12></a> This is the great truth that the apostle brings before us.<a name=148:13></a> After having received Christ for my life (the second Man He is called, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit) -- after having received life from Christ, He Himself being in me, God has appropriated to me all the value and power of that in which Christ is, and which is in Him.<a name=148:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here it is more particularly as regards life; but He has been crucified for us, not merely as putting away sins, but "in that he died, he died unto sin once.<a name=148:15></a> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=148:16></a>" There is this great basis of truth upon which all the apostle's teaching is founded: that Christ comes, presents Himself to man as in the flesh, and man will not have Him.<a name=148:17></a> Man could not have to say to God as a living man in the flesh.<a name=148:18></a> But Christ dies for him; and those who receive Him into their hearts now live by Him.<a name=148:19></a> "As many of us as were baptised unto Christ Jesus, were baptised unto his death.<a name=148:20></a>" Such is the way he answers in Romans 6, where the charge is made, "Let us continue in sin that grace may abound.<a name=148:21></a>" If it be said, Christ by His death and resurrection has made me righteous before God, and so I may live in sin, there is this doctrine in reply.<a name=148:22></a> The obedience of Christ is obedience unto death; and if you are dead with Christ, a dead man does not live.<a name=148:23></a> He strikes at the root of the matter, and says, You have got this justification of life by Christ's death and resurrection, and you are denying the very thing that justifies you.<a name=148:24></a> It is death to sin and life to God; and therefore you who plead for sin are denying the great

		On the other hand, there is the positive side: "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.<a name=149:15></a>" I have received Him who has risen, as my life.<a name=149:16></a> Nothing can be more important in its place than a distinct and definite apprehension of this; not only Christ has died for us, but we can also say that we have died with Him.<a name=149:17></a> How it cuts at the root of everything that flesh seeks!<a name=149:18></a> What can a dead man seek?<a name=149:19></a> We are to reckon ourselves dead -- not to reason that we must die, which will not give us power; but we are to reckon ourselves dead.<a name=149:20></a> Supposing a person comes to tempt me -- how can he tempt a dead man?<a name=149:21></a> He tells me to come and amuse myself in something.<a name=149:22></a> But I say, I am dead; and the reason I can say so is that my life is another kind of life altogether.<a name=149:23></a> The old stock may spring up and shew itself sometimes; but I learn to treat the old life as not the tree at all.<a name=149:24></a> We may fail to do this, and then it will produce the old bad fruit; but inasmuch as Christ is my life, I am but a grafted tree; I have a right to take that which I am grafted into as the real tree, and have nothing to do with anything else.<a name=149:25></a>

		Ephesians 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways in which we may look at our relationship to God; and rightly.<a name=159:1></a> There is, first, our coming to Him; secondly, our souls may look at the counsels and dealings of God toward us.<a name=159:2></a> Of Abel it is said, God had respect unto his gifts -- he came with his needed offering.<a name=159:3></a> We are looked at in the flesh.<a name=159:4></a> As to my state before God, I could not draw near, unless I could bring Christ as an offering.<a name=159:5></a> We must have that sacrifice in order to bring us near.<a name=159:6></a> Consequently, in that case our relationship to God is measured by our need.<a name=159:7></a> We come near because we find we cannot do without it, and we accept that offering as needful to accomplish it.<a name=159:8></a> In another way, the measure of God's blessing we never know, until we look on our relationships as measured by God's thoughts of us -- by all that which He loves to display when He satisfies His own heart in grace, and by His way of shewing it.<a name=159:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We never enjoy our true blessing unless we see how He feels and would act.<a name=159:10></a> I must thus rise above what I am to what God is; then my mind is formed by the thought of what God is.<a name=159:11></a> This is what we are called to.<a name=159:12></a> We must come in by our need, as the prodigal did.<a name=159:13></a> Man cannot by searching find out God.<a name=159:14></a> There cannot be any knowledge of God in grace by man being competent to know it.<a name=159:15></a> There would be no need of grace if he could know God otherwise.<a name=159:16></a> If I can claim His grace, I do not need grace at all.<a name=159:17></a> The way a sinner must come in must be by his need; in this way he learns what grace is, he learns love.<a name=159:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I have got to God, it is another thing.<a name=159:19></a> Then He would form our minds and hearts by what He is Himself.<a name=159:20></a> I came as a sinner because I needed it, just as a hungry man needs food; but when brought, I have fellowship and communion with the God who has brought me to Himself.<a name=159:21></a> The measure is given in this epistle: "growing up into Christ in all things.<a name=159:22></a>" It is a wonderful thing that God has called us to fellowship with Himself.<a name=159:23></a> It is wonderful to have the same thoughts, the same feelings, as God, and to have them together, all flowing from Him.<a name=159:24></a> And we are brought into it by grace, and we enjoy it just so far as we are emptied of self.<a name=159:25></a>

		There is more happiness in the fact of being in communication with Him than in the things He communicates; and I say again, because of its importance, that a soul cannot have the enjoyment of the things of God without having peace, which is connected with the conscience.<a name=160:27></a> The beginning of this chapter shews how we are presented to God.<a name=160:28></a> It is a test whether the judgment-seat brings any terror to your minds.<a name=160:29></a> Does it give you any uneasiness?<a name=160:30></a> How does the saint get there?<a name=160:31></a>

		In this portion of Scripture the apostle sums up the exercises of heart, and the work of grace; first in these exercises of heart, and then in the revelation of real liberty through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, which we enjoy as redeemed from all that we were in the flesh, from sin and Satan and the world, and from law too.<a name=165:1></a> But then, having gone through all this, and having shewn the way by which we, having the Spirit, are children of God and heirs, joint-heirs with Christ, and being conscious of the bondage and corruption which is still around us here, he closes the whole by shewing how, before it, and in it, and above it, and beyond it all, God is for us.<a name=165:2></a> He brings out this great truth to shew, not that Christ is in heavenly places, but that He is with us in the difficulties.<a name=165:3></a> He shews (and what a blessed thing this is, for by it Paul gets to God Himself!<a name=165:4></a>) though he goes into the trouble of time, that, before trouble was, and before you ever were, it is Himself that is for you; and if so, no matter what is against you!<a name=165:5></a>

		REFLECTIONS ON MIXED MARRIAGES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		[The following remarks were made on a particularly solemn instance, where a young sister (converted in 1853) fell into the snare of accepting an offer of marriage made by a worldly man.<a name=171:1></a> This she had contrived to conceal from the assembly of Christians where she lived; but a delay, which arose out of seemingly accidental circumstances, gave occasion to a brother's discovering her intentions, and warning her solemnly.<a name=171:2></a> She owned the wrong, but persisted; left for a relative's, where she sickened of a violent fever, which from the first she owned to be the chastening of the Lord; and died after three days, His word having penetrated and brought her, not only to entire self-judgment, but to fulness of joy.<a name=171:3></a> The details, for various reasons, are omitted.<a name=171:4></a>]
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The preceding history relates, in all Christian simplicity, facts which shew how God can interfere in discipline to deliver His children from the sad spiritual consequences which flow from a want of faithfulness.<a name=171:5></a> A young Christian allowed herself to be drawn into accepting an offer of marriage with an unconverted man.<a name=171:6></a> Her conscience plainly shewed her that she was acting against the will of God.<a name=171:7></a> But she did not know how to stop at the first step, and, not having at once rejected, as unfaithfulness and sin, the thought of that which was offered to her, she had not afterwards the strength to give it up; and God was forced to take her away from this world to keep her from a sin which she did not desire to commit, but which she had not the strength to resist.<a name=171:8></a> Oh how difficult it is to stop when once we have set out on such a road!<a name=171:9></a>

		Any one who has closely observed the walk of Christians, and who has cared for souls with a heart in any little measure zealous for the glory of the Lord and desirous of the spiritual welfare of the dear children of God, will not have failed to perceive the fatal influence that the world exercises over them when it gains entrance into their hearts.<a name=171:10></a> God only knows, and the one who has suffered from it, by what subtle means, and under what an amiable guise the world often invades the heart of the Christian.<a name=171:11></a> But the manifestation of Christ to the soul, and the power of His presence, are never ways by which the world insinuates itself into the heart.<a name=171:12></a> Those, therefore, who are found, by grace, near Christ, are shielded from the influence of such feelings, and can judge them and everything which tends to make a way for the world within the heart, or for desires which are connected with the world.<a name=171:13></a>

		Now these are the two principles which regulate the ways of God with regard to us.<a name=172:11></a> On the one hand, God keeps the heart to cause it to discern His own purpose; and, on the other, Christ intercedes for us with respect to all that may be called infirmity.<a name=172:12></a> There are real difficulties along the way, and there is weakness in us, and alas!<a name=172:13></a> a will which does not like to be bridled, and which betrays itself in a thousand forms of thought and deed.<a name=172:14></a> Our weaknesses, like our will, tend to hinder us from reaching the end of our journey; but there is a great difference in the way in which God acts with regard to our weaknesses, and with regard to our will and the thoughts which flow from it.<a name=172:15></a> "The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=172:16></a>" God judges our thoughts and intentions by His word.<a name=172:17></a> Nothing escapes Him; He is faithful towards us.<a name=172:18></a> His word is in the heart like an eye from which nothing is concealed; "all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<a name=172:19></a>" Do

		The second point that I wish to lead you to notice is the government that God exercises with regard to His children.<a name=174:15></a> He warns them by His word, and if they do not listen, He interferes in His power to stop them in order that He may be able to bless them.<a name=174:16></a> See Job 36: 5-14; chapter 33: 14-30.<a name=174:17></a> In the dealings of God salvation is not brought into question.<a name=174:18></a> He looks upon His children, and chastens those whom He loves.<a name=174:19></a> The persons of whom the Holy Ghost is speaking in Job are called "the just.<a name=174:20></a>" God does not withdraw His eyes from them, and He says also to Israel by the prophet Amos, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities," Amos 3: 2.<a name=174:21></a>

		Nor is this the only thing; for I know that not only am I in Christ, but Christ is in me.<a name=179:9></a> These two things cannot be separated, but they are quite different.<a name=179:10></a> The one expresses my standing, the other my state.<a name=179:11></a> The Lord Himself said, before He left the world, "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=179:12></a>" He has brought me into the standing; and this we have in Ephesians 1, 2.<a name=179:13></a> Christ is looked at as having lain in death but now raised, and we are raised up together and made to sit together in heavenly places in Him.<a name=179:14></a> There we are; and such is our position as connected with the "God of our Lord Jesus Christ," chapter 1: 17, etc.<a name=179:15></a> But in chapter 3: 14, it is, "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=179:16></a>" Again, in chapter 1, it is written, "that we should be to the praise of his glory"; whereas in chapter 3, the prayer is founded on "the riches of his glory," verse 16.<a name=179:17></a> In the first chapter God is called the Father of glory.<a name=179:18></a> Here the standing is taken as a settled thing; but we have something further, "that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.<a name=179:19></a>" Here it is state, not standing.<a name=179:20></a> We do not ask God to raise us up: that is an accomplished fact and is my standing.<a name=179:21></a> But here the apostle prays that something may be accomplished; that according

	<div class="paragraph">
		I know that Christ is in me, and I in Him; but I ought not to be satisfied without the consciousness of enjoying Him.<a name=180:3></a> "That Christ may dwell in your hearts" is a prayer as to state, not a declaration of standing.<a name=180:4></a> What we have to watch is, not to unsettle the truth of the standing, but to apply the blessedness of the standing to the judgment of the state.<a name=180:5></a>

		That is the reason why you will find constant reference to mercy when Scripture speaks of or to the individual.<a name=181:2></a> When the church is addressed, grace and grace only is mentioned.<a name=181:3></a> Only in Jude we have "mercy unto you, and peace and love be multiplied"; and then, in verse 21, "looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life," where the departure of Christendom is contemplated, and when things were rapidly going on to judgment.<a name=181:4></a> We find, therefore, the saints exhorted to keep themselves "in the love of God.<a name=181:5></a>" This is state again, and it shews that when the Christian profession had slipped, and was slipping, more personal dependence comes in urgently.<a name=181:6></a> The moment I let this in, I let all the light in, and gradually my eyes get to see clearly.<a name=181:7></a> Christ is that light, and when we have to do with Him, the subtlety of evil is seen.<a name=181:8></a> But, besides the light, there is grace and present dependence needed.<a name=181:9></a> Let us delight in dependence -- that a Person above us should minister to us and care for us.<a name=181:10></a>

		Again, in Ephesians 3, it is not our being glorified with Him, but that God may be glorified.<a name=181:14></a> Thus in verse 21, "Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus.<a name=181:15></a>" But this state is produced by Christ's dwelling in us by faith.<a name=181:16></a> It is not a question of the standing we have in Christ.<a name=181:17></a> This carries full, practical blessedness with it, as it is said, "That ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<a name=181:18></a>" Whereas in chapter 1: 22, the point is, that God has put all things under Christ's feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.<a name=181:19></a> Hence also in Ephesians 1, it is the exceeding greatness of God's power to usward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead, etc.<a name=181:20></a>; whereas in chapter 3 it is, "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh <i>in us</i>,"

		This, too, is the principle of real piety, because it keeps us in constant dependence upon God, and constant reference to God.<a name=185:13></a> It is an amazing comfort for my soul to think that there is not a single thing all through my life in which God as my Father has not a positive will about me to direct me; that there is not a step from the moment I am born (though while we are unconverted we understand nothing about it) in which there is not a positive path or will of God to direct me here.<a name=185:14></a> I may forget it and fail, but we have in the word and will of God what keeps the soul, not in a constant struggle against one thing and another, but in the quiet consciousness that the grace of God has provided for everything -- that I do not take a step but what His love has provided for.<a name=185:15></a> It keeps the soul in the sweet sense of divine favour and in dependence upon God, so that like David we can say, "Thy right hand upholdeth me.<a name=185:16></a>" Moses does not say, Shew me a way through the wilderness, but "Shew me now thy way.<a name=185:17></a>" A man's ways are what he is: God's way shews what He is.<a name=185:18></a>

		Then there is the other blessed truth.<a name=186:7></a> We are set apart through the Spirit for, and to the value and the sprinkling of, the blood of Jesus Christ.<a name=186:8></a> We know that when the priests were consecrated, the blood was put upon their right ear and upon the hand and foot, as a token that all the mind and work and walk should be according to the preciousness of this blood.<a name=186:9></a> In God's sight there is not a single spot upon us because of the blood that has been shed, and we have to walk according to the value of that blood before God.<a name=186:10></a> In the case of the leper the blood was to be sprinkled upon him seven times He was set apart to God (in type) under the whole perfect efficacy of what the work and blood of Jesus are in God's sight.<a name=186:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we come to a third point in the chapter, that is, the keeping through the way.<a name=187:5></a> There are difficulties and trials, and temptations: it is well we should look them in the face.<a name=187:6></a> Everybody is not passing smoothly through this life, though some may be more so than others.<a name=187:7></a> There are plenty of difficulties and trials, and we have to make straight paths for our feet.<a name=187:8></a> Still, we are "kept by the power of God," but, mark this, it is "through faith.<a name=187:9></a>" We have to remember that, and this is why the trials come in.<a name=187:10></a> We can count upon the whole power of God, but it is exercised in sustaining our faith in God, as the Lord says to Peter, "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.<a name=187:11></a>" He does not take us out of trial; on the contrary, it is said, "Ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.<a name=187:12></a>" There may be this heaviness through trial; no such thing as doubting God's goodness, but the pressure, whether of sorrow or of that which might tend to make our feet slip, may produce heaviness of spirit.<a name=187:13></a> But after all it is "only for a season," and "if need be.<a name=187:14></a>" Do not make yourselves uneasy: the One who holds the reins of the need-be is God.<a name=187:15></a> He does not take pleasure in afflicting.<a name=187:16></a> If there is the need for it, we go through the trial, but it is only for a moment.<a name=187:17></a> It is a process that is going on, and do you fancy that you do not want it?<a name=187:18></a> The great secret is to have entire confidence in the love of God, in the certainty that He is the doer of it -- not looking at circumstances or at second causes, but seeing the hand of the Lord in it, that it is the trial of our faith, and that it is only on the way.<a name=187:19></a> When the day comes in which God has things His own way (He does His own work now, of course, but when He has things His own way), these very trials will be found to praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.<a name=187:20></a> It is a process that He is carrying on now; it may be even the putting into the furnace to bring out the preciousness of the faith.<a name=187:21></a> It is not a question of being cleansed, but He does cause us to pass through all that which He sees needed for discipline.<a name=187:22></a> He uses the things that are in the world: the evil, the sin, the ill-will of others,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see thus what a strengthening thing it is to wait for Christ.<a name=188:2></a> It is not spoken of here in the highest way, but it is the same general principle.<a name=188:3></a> I am waiting.<a name=188:4></a> I do not think much of an uncomfortable inn if I know that I am only there for two or three days on the way.<a name=188:5></a> I might perhaps wish it were better, but I do not trouble myself much about it, because I am not living there.<a name=188:6></a> I am not living in this world, I am dying here; if there is a bit of the old life, it has to be put to death.<a name=188:7></a> My life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=188:8></a> I am waiting for the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ -- waiting for God's Son from heaven, who is going to take us there, to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away; and all that we pass through here is merely this exercise of heart, which God sees to be needed to bring us there where the Lord Himself will have us with Himself, and that for ever.<a name=188:9></a> And there is nothing more practically important for every-day work and service, than our waiting for God's Son from heaven.<a name=188:10></a> If you want to know what this world is, and if you want to get comfort for your soul, you will be waiting for God's Son from heaven.<a name=188:11></a> If I am belonging to the world, I cannot have comfort.<a name=188:12></a> The apostle says, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.<a name=188:13></a>" And if we are getting into ease in it, we shall find His discipline.<a name=188:14></a> But the moment I am waiting for God's Son from heaven, my life is but the dealings of God with me with an object, and the object is that it should be to praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.<a name=188:15></a> Let me ask you all, What would be the effect of Christ's coming on your souls?<a name=188:16></a> Would it be this?<a name=188:17></a> Here I am passing through in heaviness because of manifold temptations, but He will come and take me out of it to Himself.<a name=188:18></a> Or would it surprise you?<a name=188:19></a> Would it find you with a number of things which you would have to leave behind?<a name=188:20></a> As to your heart, where is your heart with respect to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=188:21></a> Young or old (there may be more to learn if we are young; but) would the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ find you with plenty of things that you would have to throw overboard?<a name=188:22></a> or with this feeling, Here is an end of all the exercises of heart; He for whom I have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something very sweet in the certainty with which the apostle Peter presents to us the truths contained in this epistle.<a name=190:1></a> There is neither hesitation nor uncertainty.<a name=190:2></a> The word speaks of things received, of a certainty for those to whom it is addressed.<a name=190:3></a> Their faith was tried, but the thing was certain.<a name=190:4></a> The apostle speaks here of an inexhaustible fund of truths which belonged to him; and it is not as one groping in the dark that he speaks of it.<a name=190:5></a> These things are too important to be left in doubt; they deserve all our attention: our hearts need it.<a name=190:6></a> It is not the unregenerate heart that loves the Lord Jesus.<a name=190:7></a> One may be brave and all that, and think that if one's conduct is good, the result in heaven will be accordingly; but therein is no love for the Lord Jesus.<a name=190:8></a> And this is the mark of the Christian.<a name=190:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says, in verse 8: "Whom [Christ] having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.<a name=190:10></a>" Now, there is no such thing as this without the new birth, which is a new life, which has an object which preoccupies it.<a name=190:11></a> It is an entirely new life, which has interests, affections, quite a new world; and without that there is no Christian, because there is not Christ.<a name=190:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now see the two principles laid down in this chapter, and in the work here attributed to the Holy Spirit.<a name=190:13></a> God finds the soul in a certain position, in certain relations, and removes it to a place in quite a new state; and this separation is according to the power of the resurrection of Christ.<a name=190:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle speaks to the Jews of the dispersion (that is, to those of whom it is spoken in John 7: 35, those dispersed among the Greeks) in these words: "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia; elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father," etc.<a name=190:15></a> He addressed himself to the dispersed, to the Jews converted to Christianity, to those who are elect according to the foreknowledge of God, through the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: grace and peace, etc.<a name=190:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=191>[Page 191]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He says this because He is speaking of another election than that of the Jewish people.<a name=191:1></a> The Jewish nation was elected after another manner.<a name=191:2></a> Here he writes, as we said, to the Jews who had believed on the Lord Jesus; so that sanctification in them was not sanctification of a nation by outward means, but by the Holy Spirit, who separated the souls from among the Jews to belong to God, and to form a part of the present dispensation of grace.<a name=191:3></a> It was not with them as with the ancient Jews, who were separated from the Egyptians by the Red Sea; they were separated by the sanctification effected by the Holy Spirit.<a name=191:4></a> Observe particularly this word <i>sanctification</i>; the first idea is separation for God, not only from evil, but a setting apart for God, who sanctifies.<a name=191:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what God does in those whom He calls.<a name=191:6></a> God finds souls lying in evil.<a name=191:7></a> John, on this subject, says in his first epistle, chapter 5: 19: "We are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness": and it is very precious to have things clearly stated.<a name=191:8></a> "We are of God.<a name=191:9></a>" It is not merely that we should conduct ourselves aright; doubtless, that is well, but the great difference is, that we are of God, and that "the whole world lieth in wickedness.<a name=191:10></a>" Does that mean that we are always as we should be?<a name=191:11></a> No: but we are of God.<a name=191:12></a> One is not all one would desire to be; this will come to pass only in heaven, for it is only there that God will make us conformed to the image of His beloved Son.<a name=191:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here is what God has done: He has separated us to Himself, as a man who hews stones out of a quarry.<a name=191:14></a> The stone is hewn out of the quarry and set apart, destined to be cut and fashioned, in order to be placed in the appointed building.<a name=191:15></a> And God detaches a soul from the quarry of this world to separate it for Himself.<a name=191:16></a> I say not but that there is much to do, for a rough stone cut out of the quarry requires often considerable labour before it is placed in the building for which it is destined.<a name=191:17></a> Even so God separates, prepares, and fashions this soul to introduce it into His spiritual building.<a name=191:18></a> There are many useless matters to take off, but God acts every day in His grace.<a name=191:19></a> Howsoever, this soul is sanctified, set apart for God, from the moment it is taken out of the quarry of this world.<a name=191:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To what does God destine this soul?<a name=192:7></a> To obedience.<a name=192:8></a> Up to this period it has done little but its own will; it has followed its own way, no matter what appearances may have been, more or less good, more or less bad; it is all one.<a name=192:9></a> The character may have been weak, or more or less fiery, until, as with Paul, the Lord arrested him on his road: now behold this soul, hitherto filled with its own will, set apart for obedience.<a name=192:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul had been very learned in what concerned the religion of his fathers; he had sat at the feet of Gamaliel.<a name=192:11></a> He honestly believed that he had done the will of God, but there was nothing of the kind; he followed his own will, according to the direction impressed by the tradition of his fathers.<a name=192:12></a> Never, till the moment that Jesus stopped him on the way to Damascus, had he said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=192:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, whatever may have been the conduct of a soul before this setting apart, nothing of all that has made it do the will of God.<a name=192:14></a> But the aim of the life of a soul sanctified, or set apart, is to do the will of God.<a name=192:15></a> It may fail, but that is its aim.<a name=192:16></a> Jesus said, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.<a name=192:17></a>" He had no need of sanctification, in one sense, because He was holy; but the aim of His whole life was obedience.<a name=192:18></a> Here I am "to do thy will, O God.<a name=192:19></a>" He took the form of a servant, made in the likeness of men, and He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=192:20></a> He existed only for God; the principle of His life was obedience.<a name=192:21></a> He was come to do nothing but His Father's will.<a name=192:22></a> As soon as a soul is sanctified, it is sanctified unto obedience; and this is manifested by the spirit of dependence which has done with its own will.<a name=192:23></a> It says, "What must I do?<a name=192:24></a>"

		As to the second thing, we are sanctified to enjoy the sprinkling of blood; first, to obedience, then to enjoy the sprinkling of blood.<a name=193:2></a> The soul, thus placed under the influence of the blood of Christ, is thereby completely cleansed.<a name=193:3></a> The blood of the Son of God cleanses us from all sin; it is by the efficacy of His blood that we are separated from this world.<a name=193:4></a> The question here is not of the blood of bulls and goats, which could not sanctify the conscience of him who did the service, but it is the blood of Christ, who, by the Eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=193:5></a> It is this blood which purifies the conscience.<a name=193:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews, under the law, said indeed, trusting to their own strength, We will do all that thou hast spoken.<a name=193:7></a> They undertook to do everything when it was prescribed to them as a condition.<a name=193:8></a> But here it is much more; it is the Spirit that makes them say, "What wilt thou have me to do?<a name=193:9></a>" It is submission, it is the principle of obedience really produced in the heart: "I know not what thou wilt, but here am I to do thy will.<a name=193:10></a>" It is obedience without reserve.<a name=193:11></a> There is no question here of rules that man cannot accomplish, but of the whole will changed; no more to do one's own will, but to do God's will.<a name=193:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of the law was sprinkled, as well as the people but that gave its efficacy to the requisitions of the law, while the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus gives to the changed heart the purification and the peace which belong to those who are placed under the efficacy of His blood.<a name=193:13></a> We are placed there as the Jews were under the blood of the goat of atonement, not however for a year only, but for ever.<a name=193:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to a soul, then, that the Holy Spirit has hewn out of the quarry of this world, being honest, amiable, kept by the good providence of God, but withal doing its own will -- well, God has found it there in the world and of the world, notwithstanding all its good qualities; and He has to put His love in its heart, in order that it may, without hesitation, only care about the will of God to do it.<a name=193:15></a> But, thus separated, it is under the blood of sprinkling, it is cleansed from all its sin.<a name=193:16></a> That is the first principle; the separation wrought by God Himself, who places us outside of this world, or rather of the things of this world, and makes us Christians.<a name=193:17></a> Without this there is

		I would point out to you the meaning of the word "sanctification"; it is rarely used in the Scriptures in the sense in which we generally use it, that is to say, in the progressive sense.<a name=194:6></a> It is only three times spoken of in this sense.<a name=194:7></a> It is said, "Follow peace with all men, and holiness [sanctification), without which no man shall see the Lord," Hebrews 12: 14.<a name=194:8></a> "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly," 1 Thessalonians 5: 23.<a name=194:9></a> I quote these two passages to shew that I do not set aside this sense of the word; but it more particularly designates an act of separation, a setting apart for God.<a name=194:10></a> If we have not laid hold of this meaning, there will be an entire mistake as to what sanctification is.<a name=194:11></a> In the two above-quoted passages, the word has an every-day application.<a name=194:12></a> In the sense in which it is used by the apostle in the beginning of this epistle, it is perfectly in the sense of taking a stone out of the quarry of this world to fashion it for God.<a name=194:13></a> Sanctification is attributed to the Father in more than one place in the Bible; see Hebrews 10: 10.<a name=194:14></a> Now, it is by this will that we are sanctified; by the offering made once of the body of Jesus Christ.<a name=194:15></a> It is by this will of God that we are sanctified.<a name=194:16></a>

		"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead," verse 3.<a name=195:3></a> Such is the way He does it.<a name=195:4></a> God sets us apart for Himself.<a name=195:5></a> It is not by modifying what was bad in us, but by creating us anew; by making afresh a new creature, for the old man cannot be made subject to the law.<a name=195:6></a> He gives a new life.<a name=195:7></a> If one be not thus born anew, one belongs yet to the world, which is under condemnation; but when God acts, it is altogether another thing.<a name=195:8></a> Being born in Adam, we have need to be born by Christ.<a name=195:9></a> When the heart is visited by the Holy Spirit, one is begotten again by a life which is not of this world, which urges it to another end -- Christ.<a name=195:10></a> It is not by precepts addressed to the old man, but by another life.<a name=195:11></a> The precepts follow afterwards; that is to say, that the life of which we speak, which is the new birth, belongs not to this world, neither in its source, nor in its aim; it cannot have one single thing in common with the old life.<a name=195:12></a> This life is found here below in the body: we eat, work, etc.<a name=195:13></a>, as before; but this is not what Christ came for.<a name=195:14></a> Christ came to make us comprehend quite another thing from the life here below, into which He entered; and that is the rule of the Christian's conduct.<a name=195:15></a> He has for object, for aim, and for joy, what Christ has for object, aim, and joy; his affections are heavenly, as those of Christ.<a name=195:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the life of Christ is in me, the life and the Spirit of Christ in me cannot find joy in that wherein Christ finds not Ms joy.<a name=195:17></a> The Spirit of Christ in me cannot be a different spirit from what was in Him; and it is evident that he who is separated from this world for God cannot find pleasure in the life of sin of this world, and prefer it to that of heaven.<a name=195:18></a> We know well that the Christian often fails in this rule; but this denies not that there is nothing in common between the life of heaven and that of the world.<a name=195:19></a> It is not a question of prohibitions as to using this or that, but of having altogether other tastes, desires, and joys; and it is, on that account, people imagine that Christians are sad, as if they were absorbed by only one

	<div class="paragraph">
		No unrenewed person can comprehend what renders the Christian happy, that is to say, that his tastes are not for the things of this world.<a name=196:3></a> His thoughts rise higher.<a name=196:4></a> This is the joy of the Christian, that Christ is entered into heaven, and has Himself destroyed all that could have hindered us from entering there.<a name=196:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Death, Satan, and the wicked spirits have been conquered by Christ, and the resurrection has annihilated all that was between Him and the glory.<a name=196:6></a> Christ placed Himself in our position; He underwent the consequences of it; He has conquered the world and Satan.<a name=196:7></a> It is written, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you": if he is already conquered, we have not to conquer him, but to resist him.<a name=196:8></a> When we resist him, he knows he has met Christ, his conqueror.<a name=196:9></a> The flesh does not resist him.<a name=196:10></a> Jesus gives us a living hope by His resurrection from the dead; in this way, and being in Him, we are on a foundation which cannot fail.<a name=196:11></a>

		Christ has already shewn that He has won the victory; and what grace is here presented to us!<a name=196:12></a> Even that of obtaining "an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith.<a name=196:13></a>" This treasure is in heaven.<a name=196:14></a> I have nothing to fear, it is in perfect safety.<a name=196:15></a> But this is what I fear as to myself, temptations, all sorts of difficulties, for I am not in heaven.<a name=196:16></a> This is true; but what gives every security is, not that we are not tried or tempted, but that we are kept in the trial here below, as the inheritance is kept in heaven for us.<a name=196:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is the position of the Christian, set apart by the resurrection of Christ, and begotten again.<a name=196:18></a> It is that, in waiting for the glory, we are kept by the power of God through faith, separated from the world by the power and communication of the life of Him who has won the victory over all that could have hindered us from having a part in it.<a name=196:19></a> And why are these trials sent to us?<a name=196:20></a> It is God who works the soil, in order that all the affections of the heart, thus sifted, may be purified and exercised, and perfectly in harmony with the glory of heaven and with the objects which are set before us.<a name=196:21></a>

		Let us see a little what the apostle says on this subject.<a name=197:2></a> Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations; that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.<a name=197:3></a>" What are we about then, as the process of sanctification is carried on?<a name=197:4></a> It is that although we have not seen Jesus, we love Him; and although now we see Him not yet believing, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of our faith, even the salvation of our souls.<a name=197:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is there the heart finds itself.<a name=197:6></a> Thus, whatever be the circumstances of the present life, Christ is present in the midst of our temptations, and the heart always finds itself close to Jesus, the source of its happiness; and, while saying that His love is boundless -- passes all knowledge -- we can say also that we have the intelligence of it.<a name=197:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The magnet always turns towards the pole; the needle always trembles a little when the storm and tempest roar, but its direction changes not; the needle of the Christian heart points always towards Christ.<a name=197:8></a> A heart which understands, which loves Jesus, which knows where Jesus has passed before it, looks to Him to sustain it through its difficulties; and however rugged and difficult the way, it is precious to us, because we find there the trace of the steps of Jesus (He has passed there); and specially because this road conducts us, through difficulties, to the glory in which He is.<a name=197:9></a> Seeing' says the apostle, that it need be, in order that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried by fire, might be found unto praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.<a name=197:10></a>

		It is not only that we have been begotten again, but that we receive the end of our faith, even the salvation of our souls.<a name=197:11></a> The end of all will be to see Christ and the glory that He has gained for me.<a name=197:12></a> He says here, the salvation of the soul, because the question is not of a temporal deliverance, as in the case of the ancient Jews.<a name=197:13></a> I see now this glory through a veil, but I long to see myself there.<a name=197:14></a> And being now in the trial, I look to Him who is in the glory, and who secures it

		The church shall not only be blessed in His presence, but shall be also the expression of what God is, because God has given her of His Spirit.<a name=213:3></a> What is important in the position of the church for us Gentiles is, that having faith we are there also, having "heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory," verse 13, 14.<a name=213:4></a>

		Afterwards, the apostle, recognising all the saints as "one body" in Christ, desired, first, that their hope might be clear and intelligent; and, secondly, that they might experience the power of the life of Christ.<a name=213:5></a> He desires first, that the saints may intelligently enjoy the calling of God, all the glory of "his inheritance in the saints," and then, verses 19-23, that they may know "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<a name=213:6></a>" God has willed a special glory for the church; and to return to her position before God, she is "holy and without blame in love.<a name=213:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things constitute our hope: first, what we are before God; and, secondly, the position in which He places us above all things, for the possession of the inheritance that Jesus has acquired to the praise of His glory.<a name=213:8></a> That is what we are to seek into, and what is to be our every-day occupation.<a name=213:9></a> I do not say to what extent the thing can be realised, but we must understand what God has meant to do in placing us so high.<a name=213:10></a> There are no clouds there; I say not, no difficulties, but when we are before God, close to Him, we feel that He wills all that, and that He wills that we be there, and that the cords of His love are drawn between Him and us -- that He holds us.<a name=213:11></a> Dear friends, are our hearts occupied about these

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is special is the Holy Spirit given as seal after we have believed, before the things themselves be accomplished.<a name=214:7></a> Thus, we are able to enjoy all that belongs to the church, that God has "predestinated .<a name=214:8></a>.<a name=214:9></a>.<a name=214:10></a> to the praise of his glory.<a name=214:11></a>" Having the love shed abroad in the heart, I do not say, being assured of this love (that is doubtless very much), but the love being shed abroad in the heart, and enjoying this love, we have the assurance of being before Him "holy and without blame," and of possessing all the glory of the inheritance.<a name=214:12></a> I apply this to the practical state of my soul.<a name=214:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Revelation 1: 1-5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before beginning the prophetic part of this book, the Lord addresses Himself to the seven churches of Asia by the mouth of John, in wishing "Grace be unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the seven spirits which are before his throne.<a name=215:1></a>" Thus, before beginning the prophecy, the Christians are put in their place and it is on this I have to dwell now.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The eternal Spirit speaks here, not under the characters of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, because He speaks of that which God will do on the earth; it is rather according to the Jewish form -- Jehovah upon His throne, and not a Father in the midst of His family; Ephesians 1 and 4.<a name=215:3></a> The Holy Spirit is presented to us, not in His unity, but in the diversity of His perfection; that is, displayed in the manifestation of Himself, in what He is, and in what He does; Revelation 4: 5; chapter 5: 6.<a name=215:4></a> Finally, the Lord Jesus is spoken of as what He was on earth, and what He will be as Mediator, who has come, and who will come.<a name=215:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This address, then, differs a little from those which we find at the head of the epistles; nevertheless, he wishes "grace and peace.<a name=215:6></a>" When the apostle addresses individuals, as Titus, Timothy, etc.<a name=215:7></a>, he adds "mercy.<a name=215:8></a>" The moment we contemplate a Christian individually, it is needful for him to wish mercy; but as to the church, it is viewed in Spirit, perfect and accepted before God, having received mercy.<a name=215:9></a> It is ever as God sees it, in its privileges -- praying that it may enjoy them: "John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first-begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.<a name=215:10></a> Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.<a name=215:11></a> Amen.<a name=215:12></a> Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.<a name=215:13></a> Even so, Amen.<a name=215:14></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things in these last verses: (1) the wish of grace and peace, and the description of the Person in whose name this wish is made -- Jesus Christ, "the Faithful Witness," etc.<a name=216:1></a>, (2) in the fifth and sixth verses, we have the answer of the church, the instant that Christ is named before Jehovah -- the answer unto Him that loved us; (3) in verse 7, we have not the response of the church, of the heart of the church, but the revelation of the knowledge which the church possesses with reference to the world.<a name=216:2></a> The subject here is not the faith which fills the heart with joy through the knowledge it possesses of Jesus.<a name=216:3></a> For there are two kinds of knowledge; that which produces the answer of the heart of the church as to itself, and that which it possesses of what is in the world.<a name=216:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus is presented here under three characters: <i>the Faithful Witness, the First-Begotten of the dead, the Prince of the kings of the earth</i>.<a name=216:5></a> He has not yet taken this last power.<a name=216:6></a> He has perfectly represented God; He is conqueror of death; He has all power, it is true, on earth, but it is verse 7 which answers as regards the full accomplishment of His character.<a name=216:7></a> "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him," etc.<a name=216:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will enlarge a little on the answer of the church, verses 5, 6: "Unto him that loved us," etc.<a name=216:9></a> Observe the effect of the thought, and what Jesus is in the heart of the faithful and of all the church!<a name=216:10></a> There is nothing which stops; there is instantaneously the answer of praise and thanksgiving.<a name=216:11></a> The moment that the church is found in the presence of this grace of Jesus, there is nothing but praise.<a name=216:12></a> There is no considering, no hesitating, no doubt nor difficulty.<a name=216:13></a> The only thing that faith has to do is immediately to say, as soon as the grace of the Lord Jesus is come to the ears of the church, "Unto him that loved us .<a name=216:14></a>.<a name=216:15></a>.<a name=216:16></a> be glory and dominion for ever and ever.<a name=216:17></a>" It is the natural and necessary answer of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, and the revelation of what Christ is.<a name=216:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Too often, alas!<a name=216:19></a> there is a quantity of prefaces in our hearts, in order to put us upon the ground of praise.<a name=216:20></a> Here there is nothing of the sort.<a name=216:21></a> It is the effect that the Holy Spirit must produce in the heart which is in its normal state, whether in the heart of the believer, or in that of the church; because, as soon as we have believed that God regards the church in Christ, He puts aside individual circumstances.<a name=216:22></a> Christ is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will not say that individual circumstances are nothing in their place -- very far from it; but the essential thing is to be a Christian, and it is necessary, in this vocation itself, to make new progress every day.<a name=217:3></a> The Christian is perfectly washed, purified, and capable of enjoying Jesus; he is all that Jesus wished that he should be, and in Him a partaker of joy and peace -- of that which He has purchased for us, and of all that we are in Him.<a name=217:4></a> And when it is a question of the church of God, of the adoration or the worship that we render Him, we are then, in our capacity as Christians, putting out of sight our circumstances and the flesh which is in us, for the purpose of enjoying, as Christians, by the Spirit, all that Christ is for us.<a name=217:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most important for the children of God to apprehend their position aright.<a name=217:6></a> When it is said that He is "the Faithful Witness," the question is, not to say, I have not been the faithful witness, I ought to have been that; but rather to say, it is He that has washed us.<a name=217:7></a> I am entitled to think only of Jesus, only of what He has done for me; I am entitled to be set there.<a name=217:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I am before God alone in my closet, it is needful that I judge myself.<a name=217:9></a> I may say to myself, You have not understood that you are a king and a priest; and the Holy Spirit makes me examine my state.<a name=217:10></a> But with other Christians, in my capacity as a Christian, I am there for the purpose of enjoying all that which Jesus has entitled me to enjoy -- all things that He has done for those who believe in Him.<a name=217:11></a> It is true that my individual state may hinder me from enjoying as I ought all the fulness of the grace of Jesus.<a name=217:12></a> It is possible that I may be more or less incapable of enjoying my position, but that does not change the position itself; it is so much the worse for me if I enjoy not my title.<a name=217:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Important as it is to judge ourselves, it is very important also to think of all our privileges in Christ; it is this which imparts strength to sacrifice all; it is this which purifies, which sanctifies.<a name=217:14></a> The extent of the privileges of the Christian strengthens him to get aloof from a multitude of things of this world.<a name=217:15></a> When we have understood heavenly things, we can immediately say, "Unto him that loved us," etc.<a name=217:16></a> The Christian is no more to think of the particulars of his state,

		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but "unto him that loved us.<a name=218:1></a>" When in the presence of the Lord, there is nothing prepared for God but praise and adoration: "to him be glory and dominion.<a name=218:2></a>" The Christian remembers what Christ is for him.<a name=218:3></a> The Christian may sometimes say, I am not in a state to praise; he may, it is true, be more or less capable of doing it well, but he is always in a state to do it.<a name=218:4></a> If a man who has sinned is there in the midst of his brethren, he may be cast down in humiliation, but he is, and ought always to be, in the position to praise doubly the grace shewn him, because Christ is always suitable to a sinful soul.<a name=218:5></a> His praises will be modified, but he will always praise.<a name=218:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So also, whenever a Christian is in circumstances of chastening from the love of the Father, there is some hindrance to his enjoying this gladsome liberty of the Spirit; nevertheless, because Christ has done all for him, he can always praise Him.<a name=218:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which makes the thing more remarkable is, that this song is sung in heaven.<a name=218:8></a> Observe what is said (chapter 5: 9) to "him that sat upon the throne.<a name=218:9></a>" Those who begin the strain sing "a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests.<a name=218:10></a>" Clearly there is but a trifling difference.<a name=218:11></a> They sing better, without doubt, in heaven than on earth; but it is very nearly the same song.<a name=218:12></a> There is no other subject of praise for heaven than for earth; the blood of Christ has the same efficacy on earth as in heaven: that for which they praise God there is equally true for us.<a name=218:13></a> Their harps are better tuned than ours, but their song is the same.<a name=218:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the power and the glory of Jesus (who has accomplished all) being there, the Spirit who reveals Him to our souls produces in us praise and adoration: -- those sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ are the answer to that which the Spirit reveals to our hearts.<a name=218:15></a> When the Holy Spirit reveals to our hearts what Christ has done, we know that we ought to praise.<a name=218:16></a> What else could we do?<a name=218:17></a> What the Holy Spirit can produce in us is thankfulness, adoration, and praise.<a name=218:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak of the Holy Spirit in the heart of the believer.<a name=218:19></a> Observe the three things, and the immediate effect of the revelation of Jesus.<a name=218:20></a> He speaks of a simple certainty of His love.<a name=218:21></a>

		One may reason about it oneself, and not be sure of His love; but if it were given us to see Him, could we have a doubt?<a name=219:1></a> Did ever one that met Him on earth find any other thing than <i>love</i>?<a name=219:2></a> He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=219:3></a> Our view may be obscured, but we know that He is <i>love</i>.<a name=219:4></a> if I commit myself unreservedly to what He is, He is love.<a name=219:5></a>

		He came not for the purpose of judging.<a name=219:6></a> If I think on what Christ is, He is love.<a name=219:7></a> If I take the history of Jesus, I can see what He has done, but it is impossible to find a single trait to indicate that He did not love; and the truth of the word, that He in no wise casts out him that comes to Him, has had its entire accomplishment.<a name=219:8></a> None could say, I have been to Him, but He wished me not.<a name=219:9></a> The Son has rejected none of those whom the Father sent Him; and here is the greatest proof of the humiliation of Jesus, that He gathered and received all those who His Father sent Him.<a name=219:10></a> Had there not been love in Him, never would He have been in this position; His perfect obedience, and His infinite incomprehensible love, placed Him there; but not one did He refuse, because He was doing, not His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.<a name=219:11></a> He cannot refuse us.<a name=219:12></a> Knowing our unbelief, He came to do the will of His Father, and to glorify the Father during the whole course of His ministry; and He must receive those who come.<a name=219:13></a>

		THE HOPE OF THE CHRISTIAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been occupied, for my own soul, with the inquiry what is the hope of the Christian, and I send you some points of the result, thinking they may be a means of cheering and encouraging some of God's dear children.<a name=224:1></a> The first important point which this result brings powerfully home to the heart and conscience is, that the source of this hope, and the only means of rightly estimating it, the only sure ground on which the heart can rest in appropriating it, is that all that I hope for is the fruit of the grace of Jesus, that in which His own heart finds its delight, in giving to us, because it is that of which He knows in Himself the blessedness, and because His love is perfect towards us.<a name=224:2></a> His interest in us is as perfect as Himself.<a name=224:3></a> This is essentially characteristic of perfect love.<a name=224:4></a> All this, I need not say, is according to the counsels of the Father.<a name=224:5></a> "It is not mine to give," says Christ, "but to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.<a name=224:6></a>" For it is what He takes as man, that He gives to us, and hence, as receiving it Himself as man from His Father, and delighting in it as the expression of the Father's love.<a name=224:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This thought brings out another simple, but remembering who Jesus is, a most blessed and wonderful truth, that where there is perfect love on the one hand, and capacity of enjoyment through possession of the same nature on the other, love will seek to introduce its object into the common enjoyment of that which it possesses, and finds its blessing and happiness in.<a name=224:8></a> This is true of a friend, a parent, and every genuine human attachment; though, of course, in these cases, imperfection is attached to the affection itself, and to its power of accomplishing its wish to make happy.<a name=224:9></a> But the perfection of Christ's love does not, since it is love to us, make our introduction into the enjoyment of His blessedness a thing not to be hoped for because it is too excellent, but just lays the sure ground for this hope.<a name=224:10></a> It is His own delight to make us happy, a part of the perfection of His nature, His own satisfaction.<a name=224:11></a> "He shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied.<a name=224:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to this I would first of all direct the attention of yourself and your readers.<a name=224:13></a> Christ is finding His own delight and joy in blessing us, and in blessing us with Himself, because He loves us; and this blessing must be according to the perfectness

		of His own nature, for it flows from Him, and is to be enjoyed with Himself, and as He enjoys it before and with the Father.<a name=225:1></a> What a scene this opens before us, if we have indeed tasted His love!<a name=225:2></a> And yet it is all dependent on His own free goodness, and the fruit and display of it, the happiness itself being dependent on His own excellency.<a name=225:3></a> That His grace is the source of it every Christian will recognise; but I think you will find that, in taking Scripture to guide us in the details it gives of our future blessedness, this character of blessing shines out most evidently.<a name=225:4></a> And it is the elements of our future joy which Scripture affords, which I would present to you, though surely grace is needed to give them their value, which will be just proportionate to our personal estimate of Christ Himself; that is, to our spiritual knowledge of Him.<a name=225:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our possession of the life of Christ, His being our life, so that it can be said of it, in its nature and fruits, "which thing is true in him and in you," is the basis of our hope, and that which makes us, in connection with His work on the cross, capable of enjoying it.<a name=225:6></a> He became a man, and having first wrought redemption, and glorified God in our behalf, and put away sin for us, and made peace, He becomes, as victorious over death, and entering risen and glorified into God's presence, the source of life to us, nay, more, our life.<a name=225:7></a> We are thus brought into the place of sons, all the old thing, with its fruits and nature, judged, condemned, and done away, whatever conflicts and exercises of heart we may have with it, and through it, while down here.<a name=225:8></a> As alive in Christ we stand before God, consequent on the accomplishment of redemption, and in virtue of complete forgiveness.<a name=225:9></a> "He hath quickened us together with him, having forgiven us all trespasses.<a name=225:10></a>" We are introduced in the place of sons with Christ, as the result and fruit of redemption, and as really partaking of the life in which He lives.<a name=225:11></a> See how the Spirit in 1 John (which specially treats of the existence, possession, and development of this life in Christ, and so in us.<a name=225:12></a> See chapter 1: 1, 2; chapter 5: 11, 12, for the general principle) connects us with Christ in life, position, and, consequently, hope.<a name=225:13></a> "If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.<a name=225:14></a> Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be caned the children of God.<a name=225:15></a>" We have, by adoption, Christ's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Blessed testimony in all its parts!<a name=226:5></a> born of God, we have the nature (morally) and position of that true, blessed, and eternal Son made man, that in His glory we may be with Him and like Him.<a name=226:6></a> We are children of God, unknown by the world consequently as He was.<a name=226:7></a> We shall be perfectly like Him in glory, seeing Him as He now is above in heavenly glory, and hence can bear no lower standard now.<a name=226:8></a> Having this hope in Christ, reaching to, and founded on Himself, we seek to be as like Him now as possible, in the inner man, and in our ways we purify ourselves as He is pure.<a name=226:9></a> What a picture of the moral position of the Christian is here, through his living connection with Christ!<a name=226:10></a> It is sweet to say it is ours, sweeter to say we have it in Him, and that He Himself is the perfection of it.<a name=226:11></a> If His life is animating us, through the strengthening grace and communications of the Holy Spirit, what a power and value will such a statement have for us, living by and dwelling in Him!<a name=226:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, is one great and blessed part of our hope, "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.<a name=226:13></a>" It is perfectness in likeness to Christ, in ourselves morally in its full result, for it is in glory; that is, all the full fruit of the power of this life as in Christ, produced even as to the body, while its internal excellence, likeness to Christ, is perfect, and no hindrance to its exercise, but, quite the contrary, a suited condition: and with the blessed consciousness that we are like Him, though we have it all from Him.<a name=226:14></a> We shall be like Him.<a name=226:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But secondly, in this state we shall have the full blessed object, in which this perfect nature delights, and in this state is capable of delighting in, in all its absolute and heavenly excellency, before us -- its satisfying object; an object which can keep all its powers in blessed and full exercise, can occupy it with perfect delight.<a name=226:16></a> And yet while I delight in Him as

		<a name=227>[Page 227]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		supremely excellent, the full display of heavenly excellence, I know that I am like Him; I could not (my desires being fixed on this, having tasted its excellence) be perfectly happy, were I not.<a name=227:1></a> Yet in us this excellence is a capacity to be occupied with its perfection in Him.<a name=227:2></a> However great our glory and excellency may be, it is only as being like Him.<a name=227:3></a> He is the thing we are like.<a name=227:4></a> He is it in its own proper and positive substantive being and existence.<a name=227:5></a> If I am adopted to be a son, am really born of God, a child, He is the Son.<a name=227:6></a> Hence all our excellence is the means of apprehending and adoring His.<a name=227:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark that this is true, both in moral perfections and in relationship.<a name=227:8></a> God is perfect in Himself and for Himself.<a name=227:9></a> Love and holiness, as indeed every other attribute of God, have their joy in themselves, and of course perfectly and infinitely in God.<a name=227:10></a> But the creature needs an object to enjoy perfectly what this blessed nature is and gives, even when he possesses it.<a name=227:11></a> The new man delights in holiness, but the perfect holiness of God is needed for the perfect delight of our new and holy nature.<a name=227:12></a> The new man has a nature imbued with charity, and so can delight in its exercise; but the perfect love of God, manifested in Jesus, and known in communion, is his delight.<a name=227:13></a> So in our relationship we are sons with God; but I must learn in Jesus what it is to be a son, and what the power of that word is, "the Father loveth the Son.<a name=227:14></a>" We share in the glory; but the glory in which we share is His.<a name=227:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the hope, then, presented to us in this passage, we have the Father's love presented as the source, so that we are already children of God, so as to know our position; but this flowing from our being born of God, from Christ being our life, and we as He, so that even the world does not know us, as it did not know Him; we are so identified with Him that, though what we shall be does not yet appear, we know we shall be like Him when He shall do so; seeing Him in the very glory in which He now is as Son, with the Father, viewed in manhood on high.<a name=227:16></a> It is not as the world will see Him, being blessed under Him, and seeing Him so far as He can be revealed to mortal eyes; but being like Himself, and seeing Him as He is.<a name=227:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads to another part of the blessing, which is equally the joy of Jesus Himself.<a name=227:18></a> We shall be with Him.<a name=227:19></a> Evidently, if we love and delight in Him, this is needed for our full joy; and while He ministers this in us now, by being present with us in grace, it is the object of our hope in its full character

		and permanent fulness.<a name=228:1></a> "So shall we ever be with the Lord.<a name=228:2></a>" Remark here, that the apostle, when speaking here of the Lord's coming, does not enter at all, as regards our portion, into the consequences in glory and dominion.<a name=228:3></a> This has its place; but what satisfies and fills the apostle's heart, when he has the revelation of the way in which God would call up the saints to their enjoyment, is, for his own feeling of joy and delight, all embraced in this, "So shall we ever be with the Lord.<a name=228:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is, more than once, brought before us by Christ Himself.<a name=228:5></a> "Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<a name=228:6></a>" The connection of these last words with what precedes, throws light on the value and extent of this hope.<a name=228:7></a> The Lord continues, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<a name=228:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father had to decide, so to speak, between Christ and His disciples on one side and the world on the other, for the moral separation was complete.<a name=228:9></a> What the Father was, had been fully shewn in Christ.<a name=228:10></a> The world could recognise nothing of it: there was no common principle or bond.<a name=228:11></a> The disciples had recognised, at least, through grace, that He came from the Father.<a name=228:12></a> He could not stay in the world.<a name=228:13></a> That was closed.<a name=228:14></a> His departure forms the groundwork of the whole chapter.<a name=228:15></a> Whether He or the world could be owned of the Father could leave no doubt.<a name=228:16></a> The Father, and necessarily so, had loved Him before ever the world existed; and if the world rejected Him, the hour was come for the Father to glorify Him with Himself.<a name=228:17></a> For the time, no doubt, the disciples were to remain in the world; but He had declared unto them the Father's name, and would declare it, that the love wherewith the Father loved Him might be in them, and He in them.<a name=228:18></a> Hence He would have them where He was.<a name=228:19></a> They would be able to enjoy it, since they know the same love, and He was in them to be the power of the enjoyment.<a name=228:20></a> It was not only their desire and blessing, but His.<a name=228:21></a> He would have them where He was, if He could not (and it was far better, surely) remain where they must be for the moment.<a name=228:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a hope is this, and, blessed be God, founded on a present blessing, only as yet in an earthen vessel, and known in present imperfection!<a name=229:5></a> And if we are with Christ, it is in the Father's house, where He is in the Father's love.<a name=229:6></a> He is not alone, He is gone to prepare a place for us; nor will He be content to send and fetch us, He will come and receive us to Himself, that where He is we may be also.<a name=229:7></a> This same chapter (John 14) shews that it is our present knowledge of the Father, as revealed in the Son, that is the means of knowing what this joy is, and coming to the enjoyment of it.<a name=229:8></a> We shall be there with the Lord, ever with Him: no interruption, no decay of joy, but rather ever increasing delight, as there always is when the object is worthy of the heart, and here it is infinite: and this in the relation of the Father's affection for the Son.<a name=229:9></a> We are with Him in that place, with Himself, and with Him in the joy, infinite joy, which He has in the Father's love, a love resting on Him as Son, but in His excellency as such, loved before the world was, and now the accomplisher of redemption.<a name=229:10></a>

		Some other passages will help to fill up the great leading traits here given, both as to the glory and our living with the Lord, shewing our identification or association with Him, and the character of this blessedness.<a name=229:11></a> "The glory thou hast given me, I have given them," the Lord says, "that they may be one, as we are one, I in them and thou in me.<a name=229:12></a>" If Christ is in us now the hope of glory, He will be in us then the display of glory.<a name=229:13></a> He will be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe.<a name=229:14></a> It is not here mutuality, but manifestation, manifestation through the fulness and excellency of that which is displayed, being in Him that displays it: the Father in Christ, and Christ in us.<a name=229:15></a> "Thou in me," says the Lord.<a name=229:16></a> The Father is in Him, in divine unity and fulness; and yet here, mark, Christ is spoken of as one to whom glory is given: that is, though a divine Person, He is considered also as man; and then, "I in them," so that as the Father is displayed in the Son, as in Him, so the Son, Christ, in us, as in us.<a name=229:17></a>

		I will now refer to Psalms 16 and 17, which collaterally throw light on this part of our subject.<a name=230:1></a> In Psalm 16, which is (with others) quoted in Scripture as shewing the humanity of Jesus, His taking our sorrows and position of dependence on and obedience to God (that is, our position as saints), it is said, "I have said to Jehovah, Thou art my Lord, my goodness extendeth not to thee -- to the saints on the earth, in them is all my delight.<a name=230:2></a>" That is, having the divine glory, He associates Himself with the saints on the earth, those excellent in God's sight.<a name=230:3></a> At the close He shews that, as One who is the head of these, the path of life is shewn to Him.<a name=230:4></a> In God's presence is fulness of joy, and at His right hand pleasures for evermore.<a name=230:5></a> This, then, in principle, is a part of our hope, as His "companions," though He be anointed with the oil of joy above us.<a name=230:6></a> We are in God's presence, where fulness of joy is.<a name=230:7></a> Where God's presence shews itself, it fills all things, and excludes all contrary to itself.<a name=230:8></a> It necessarily makes infinitely and perfectly happy.<a name=230:9></a> It sufficed to Christ's hope -- His who knew it best and perfectly -- surely, then, to ours: and, as we have seen, we have a nature capable, without alloy or mixture, of perfectly enjoying that presence.<a name=230:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me add, too, that we shall not lose the Holy Ghost by being in glory: loss indeed it would be.<a name=230:11></a> Our nature of joy will be the new nature, the divine nature of which we are made partakers; our power of joy the Holy Ghost who dwells in us.<a name=230:12></a> It is striking that even Jesus, after His resurrection, gave commandments to His apostles by the Holy Ghost.<a name=230:13></a> (Compare Romans 8: 11.<a name=230:14></a>)

		I would have the reader remark, how all this joy has its counterpart and commencement of realisation down here, save the glory of the body alone.<a name=232:4></a> How the heart knows that, how sweet soever the common joy of saints (a necessary proof and accompaniment of the holy liberty of the Spirit in a pure heart), yet that in joys and sorrows, there is a looking to Jesus, a communion with Jesus, a dependence of heart on His approbation, in which none can participate.<a name=232:5></a> On high it will be perfectly enjoyed and possessed, in the white stone and the new name.<a name=232:6></a> The heart that knows Him could not do without this.<a name=232:7></a>

		Let us remark, too, how various the joy is -- and so it is now.<a name=232:8></a> I delight in the nature of God; I delight in a Father's love; I delight in the glory of Jesus; I delight in my intimacy with Him; I delight in the blessedness of being with the Son before the Father; I delight in His being a man, with whom I am, yet one divinely perfect; I delight in God and the Lamb -- the blessed and glorious display of redeeming counsels and divine glory; I delight in being like Christ; I delight in all the saints being like Him; I delight in His being glorified in them; I delight in adequate service, in a full and perfect witness, in a fit and heavenly worship; I delight in what is proper to God; I delight in what is the glory of Christ Himself, as such; it is what is common to all, and what is peculiar to oneself.<a name=232:9></a> The Christian will remark, too, that in enjoying Christ in glory, he will not lose the blessed feeding on a once humbled Saviour: we know this also now, we delight in communion, and in hope in the glorified Lord; but we turn back and feed on Jesus, lowly and rejected, on the earth.<a name=232:10></a> If He is what we hope for in glory, He is what we need on earth; but our heavenly state will surely not diminish our power of delighting in the perfection of that blessed One.<a name=232:11></a> And as a pot of the manna, which had nourished Israel in the desert, was to be kept in the ark in Canaan, that Israel, in its rest, might know what had sustained them in the desert, so we shall eat of that hidden manna, which has nourished and fed our souls in our pilgrimage.<a name=232:12></a>

		CHRISTIAN DEVOTEDNESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If there be one thing of importance now, it is Christian devotedness.<a name=234:1></a> I do not separate this from Christian doctrine, but found it on it.<a name=234:2></a> I do not surely separate it from the presence and power of the Spirit (one of the most important of these doctrines), for it is produced by it.<a name=234:3></a> But Christian devotedness founded on the truth, and produced by the power of the Spirit, I believe to be of the utmost importance for the saints themselves and for the testimony of God.<a name=234:4></a> I believe surely that doctrine is of deep importance now: clearness as to redemption, and the peace that belongs to the Christian through divine righteousness, the presence and living power of the Comforter sent down from heaven, the sure and blessed hope of Christ's coming again to receive us to Himself that where He is we shall be also, that we shall be like Himself seeing Him as He is, and that if we die we shall be present with Him, the knowledge that risen with Him we shall be blessed not only through but with Christ, the deep practical identification with Him through our being united with Him by the Holy Ghost.<a name=234:5></a> All these things, and many things connected with them, held in the power of the Holy Ghost separate us from the world, shelter the soul by the spiritual possession of Christ glorified, the conscious possession of Christ, from the cavils of current infidelity, and give a living spring to the joy and hope of the whole Christian life.<a name=234:6></a> But the expression of the power of them in the heart will manifest itself in devotedness.<a name=234:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity has exercised a mighty influence over the world, even where it is openly rejected, as well as where it is professedly received.<a name=234:8></a> Care of the poor and the supply of temporal wants have become recognised duties of society.<a name=234:9></a> And where the truth is not known and Christianity is corrupted, diligent devotedness to this, on the false ground of merit, is largely used to propagate that corruption.<a name=234:10></a> And even where infidelity prevails the habits of feeling produced by Christianity prevail, and man becomes the object of diligent, though often of perverted, care.<a name=234:11></a> The testimony of the true saint surely should not be wanting where falsehood has imitated the good effects of truth.<a name=234:12></a> But there are higher motives than these; and it is of the true character of devotedness I would speak.<a name=234:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another principle must be added to this to complete those which governed His walk: undivided obedience to His Father's will, His having that will for His constant motive.<a name=235:16></a> Love to the Father and obedience to Him gave form and character to His love to us.<a name=235:17></a> And so it is with us, only that He Himself comes in as the more immediate object, but this in no way hindering the display of the divine nature in love.<a name=235:18></a> "Be ye <i>imitators of God</i> as dear children, and walk in love even as Christ hath loved us and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=235:19></a>" Note here the fulness of motive and character which is shewn, and how high and blessed that motive and character is.<a name=235:20></a> We are followers and imitators of God.<a name=235:21></a> We walk in love as Christ loved us.<a name=235:22></a> It is the exercise of divine love as displayed in Christ.<a name=235:23></a> There is no stint in it.<a name=235:24></a> He gave Himself, nothing short of Himself, wholly; a principle often repeated as to Christ, His love to us, for He gave Himself for us.<a name=235:25></a> Yet God was the object and motive constituting its perfection: "an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=235:26></a>" It is thus we are called to walk, to imitate God, to follow Him as He displayed Himself in Christ.<a name=235:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be blessed to joy in God, who is love, it is blessed to follow Him in the love He has exercised.<a name=235:28></a> Yet as displayed in Christ as a man, it has God Himself for its object: and so

	<div class="paragraph">
		with us.<a name=236:1></a> The love that descends down from God working in man rises up always towards and to God as its just and necessary object.<a name=236:2></a> It can have nothing lower as its spring, towards whomsoever it is exercised.<a name=236:3></a> All the incense of the meat-offering was burnt on the altar, however sweet the savour to others.<a name=236:4></a> This constitutes, as I have said, its essential character and excellence; nor do its just actings in us come short of its actings in Christ.<a name=236:5></a> "Hereby," says John, "know we love, because he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=236:6></a>" There is no question of any cup of wrath for us.<a name=236:7></a> Here Christ stood, of course, alone; but all self-sacrifice displayed in Him we are called upon to display, as having His life, Himself, in us.<a name=236:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will consider this a little more methodically before I press it hortatively on my brethren.<a name=236:9></a> As to reward, as motive or merit, it is clear that any such thought destroys the whole truth of devotedness, because there is no love in it.<a name=236:10></a> It is self, looking, like "James and John," for a good place in the kingdom.<a name=236:11></a> Reward there is in Scripture, but it is used to encourage us in the difficulties and dangers which higher and truer motives bring us into.<a name=236:12></a> So Christ Himself, "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.<a name=236:13></a>" Yet we well know that His motive was love.<a name=236:14></a> So Moses: "He endured as seeing him who is invisible, for he had respect to the recompense of reward.<a name=236:15></a>" His motive was caring for his brethren.<a name=236:16></a> So reward is ever used, and it is a great mercy in this way.<a name=236:17></a> And every man receives his reward according to his own labour.<a name=236:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spring and source of all true devotedness is divine love filling and operating in our hearts: as Paul says, "the love of Christ constraineth us.<a name=236:19></a>" Its form and character must be drawn from Christ's actings.<a name=236:20></a> Hence grace must first be known for oneself, for thus it is I know love.<a name=236:21></a> Thus it is that this love is shed abroad in the heart.<a name=236:22></a> We learn divine love in divine redemption.<a name=236:23></a> This redemption sets us too, remark, in divine righteousness before God.<a name=236:24></a> Thus all question of merit, of self-righteousness, is shut out, and self-seeking in our labour set aside.<a name=236:25></a> "Grace," we have learnt, "reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ.<a name=236:26></a>" The infinite perfect love of God towards us has wrought; has done so when we were mere sinners; has thought of our need; given us eternal life in Christ when we were dead in sins -- forgiveness and

	<div class="paragraph">
		divine righteousness when we were guilty; gives us now to enjoy divine love, to enjoy God by His Spirit dwelling in us, and boldness in the day of judgment, because as Christ, the judge, is, so are we in this world.<a name=237:1></a> I speak of all this now in view of the love shewn in it.<a name=237:2></a> True, that could not have been divinely without righteousness.<a name=237:3></a> That is gloriously made good through Christ, and the heart is free to enjoy God's unhindered love: a love shewn to men in man.<a name=237:4></a> For the very angels learn "the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.<a name=237:5></a>" This knits the heart to Christ, bringing it to God in Him, God in Him to us.<a name=237:6></a> We say nothing separates us from this love.<a name=237:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first effect is to lead the heart up, thus sanctifying it we bless God, adore God, thus known; our delight, adoring delight, is in Jesus.<a name=237:8></a> But thus near to God and in communion with Him, thus not only united, but consciously united, to Christ by the Holy Ghost, divine love flows into and through our hearts.<a name=237:9></a> We become animated by it through our enjoyment of it.<a name=237:10></a> It is really "God dwelling in us," as John expresses it; "his love shed abroad in our hearts," as Paul does.<a name=237:11></a> It flows thus forth as it did in Christ.<a name=237:12></a> Its objects and motives are as in Him, save that He Himself comes in as revealing it.<a name=237:13></a> It is the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord; not the less God, but God revealed in Christ, for there we have learnt love.<a name=237:14></a> Thus, in all true devotedness, Christ is the first and governing object; next, "His own which are in the world"; and then our fellow-men.<a name=237:15></a> First their souls, then their bodies, and every want they are in.<a name=237:16></a> His life of good to man governs ours, but His death governs the heart, "Hereby know we love because he laid down his life for us.<a name=237:17></a>" "The love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again.<a name=237:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must note, too, that as redemption and divine righteousness are that through which grace reigns and love is known, all idea of merit and self-righteousness is utterly excluded, so it is a new life in us which both enjoys God and to which His love is precious; which alone is capable of delighting, as a like nature, in the blessedness that is in Him, and in which His divine love operates towards others.<a name=237:19></a> It is not the benevolence of nature, but the activity of divine love in the new man.<a name=237:20></a>

		Its genuineness is thus tested, because Christ has necessarily the first place with this nature, and its working is in that estimate of right and wrong which the new man alone has, and of which Christ is the measure and motive.<a name=238:1></a> "Not as we hoped," says Paul (it was more than he hoped), speaking of active charity; "but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.<a name=238:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is more than a new nature.<a name=238:3></a> Our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost; and God's love is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.<a name=238:4></a> And as it springs up like a well in us unto eternal life, so also living waters flow out from us by the Holy Ghost which we have received.<a name=238:5></a> All true devotedness, then, is the action of divine love in the redeemed, through the Holy Ghost given to them.<a name=238:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There may be a zeal which compasses sea and land, but it is in the interest of a prejudice, or the work of Satan.<a name=238:7></a> There may be natural benevolence clothed with a fairer name, and irritated if it be not accepted for its own sake.<a name=238:8></a> There may be the sense of obligation and legal activity, which, through grace, may lead farther, though it be the pressure of conscience, not the activity of love.<a name=238:9></a> The activity of love does not destroy the sense of obligation in the saint, but alters the whole character of his work.<a name=238:10></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=238:11></a>" In God love is active, but sovereign; in the saint it is active, but a duty, because of grace.<a name=238:12></a> It must be free to have the divine character -- to be love.<a name=238:13></a> Yet we owe it all, and more than all to Him that loved us.<a name=238:14></a> The Spirit of God which dwells in us is a Spirit of adoption, and so of liberty with God, but it fixes the heart on God's love in a constraining way.<a name=238:15></a> Every right feeling in a creature must have an object, and, to be right, that object must be God, and God revealed in Christ as the Father; for in that way God possesses our souls.<a name=238:16></a>

		Hence Paul, speaking of himself, says, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.<a name=238:17></a>" His life was a divine life.<a name=238:18></a> Christ lived in him, but it was a life of faith, a life living wholly by an object, and that object Christ; and known as the Son of God loving and giving Himself for him.<a name=238:19></a> Here we get the practical character and motive of Christian devotedness -- living to Christ.<a name=238:20></a> We live on account of Christ: He is the object and reason of our life

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point one may do well to notice, which makes the plain difference between devotedness and natural kindness.<a name=243:10></a> "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<a name=243:11></a>" The Lord does not tell them to let their good works shine before men; elsewhere He says the contrary.<a name=243:12></a> But their profession of Christ is to be so distinct that men may know to what to attribute their good works, and glorify their Father which is in heaven.<a name=243:13></a> What is wanted among Christians, is that through grace they should be Christians devoted, plainly devoted, in all their ways, devoted in heart and soul to Him who loved them and gave Himself for them.<a name=243:14></a>

		The apostle was pressed to say what he knew, that is, to express what was passing in a heart which enjoyed its position in God.<a name=253:7></a> His soul was so happy that he could desire the same thing for others of which he had the consciousness for himself.<a name=253:8></a> Joy is always full of good-will; divine joy, of love.<a name=253:9></a> But more; this wish describes to us the state of the apostle's soul, notwithstanding his circumstances.<a name=253:10></a> Notwithstanding his confinement, which had already lasted more than two years, his heart was completely happy; it was a happiness of which he himself could render a reason; and all that he could desire was that those who heard him, even the king, were such as he was, except those bonds.<a name=253:11></a>

		There are poor Christians, dishonoured by those who are in consideration, designated by injurious titles; well, to these persons despised and pointed at because of their faith, the Lord reveals His relations with them in a manner most positive and clear.<a name=257:8></a> The revelation that Jesus made to Paul is, that they are entirely identified with Himself.<a name=257:9></a> He says, I am all those men whom thou persecutest.<a name=257:10></a> Paul sees the glory, and he is arrested; no doubt that it is the Lord.<a name=257:11></a> But this Lord is Jesus, who shews him that he persecutes Him in persecuting the Christians.<a name=257:12></a> It is Myself, says Jesus, "whom thou persecutest.<a name=257:13></a>"

		There were these two features in the life of Christ down here.<a name=278:7></a> First, He exercised constant dependence on His Father as He said, "I live by the Father.<a name=278:8></a>" The new man is ever a dependent man.<a name=278:9></a> The moment we get out of dependence, we get into the flesh.<a name=278:10></a> It is not through our own life (for, indeed, we have but death) that we really live, but by Christ, through feeding on Him.<a name=278:11></a> In the highest possible sense, He walked in dependence on the Father, and for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame.<a name=278:12></a> Secondly, His affections were undivided.<a name=278:13></a> You never find Christ having any new object revealed to Him so as to induce Him to go on in His path of faithfulness.<a name=278:14></a> Paul and Stephen, on the other hand, had the glory revealed to them, which enabled them to endure.<a name=278:15></a> For when the heaven was opened to Stephen, the Lord appeared in glory to him, as afterwards to Saul of Tarsus.<a name=278:16></a> But when the heavens opened on Jesus, there was no object presented to Him, but, on the contrary, He was the object of heaven; the Holy Ghost descends upon Him, and the voice of the Father declares, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.<a name=278:17></a>" Thus the divine Person of the Lord is always being witnessed to.<a name=278:18></a> The apostle here gets hold of the preciousness of Christ in the lowliness into which He has come; but he never loses sight of the glory of Him who has come there.<a name=278:19></a> So when I get Christ at the baptism of John, I see Him at the lowest point (save in another way on the cross); and, finding Him there, I find all the divine compassion of His heart.<a name=278:20></a>

		OUR JOY IN HEAVEN

	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke 9: 28-36
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look a little at this scripture, as shewing what our joy in the glory will consist of.<a name=279:1></a> We have the warrant of 2 Peter 1: 16 for saying that the scene represents to us the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=279:2></a> And this is what we wait for.<a name=279:3></a> Our souls are not in a healthy state unless we are waiting for God's Son from heaven.<a name=279:4></a> The church is not regulated in its hopes by the word and Spirit of God, unless it is looking for Him as Saviour from heaven; Philippians 3.<a name=279:5></a> And this passage, as disclosing to us specially what will be our portion when He comes, is important to us in this respect.<a name=279:6></a> There are many other things in the passage, such as the mutual relations of the earthly and the heavenly people in the kingdom.<a name=279:7></a> These it may be very instructive to consider; but this is not our present purpose, which is to consider what light is here afforded on the nature of that joy which we shall inherit at and from the coming of the Lord.<a name=279:8></a> Other scriptures, such as the promises to those who overcome in Revelation 2 and 3, and the description of the heavenly city in Revelation 21 and 22, give us instructions on the same subject; but let us now particularly look at the scene on the holy mount.<a name=279:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and James and John, and went up into a mountain to pray.<a name=279:10></a> And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.<a name=279:11></a>" It was when Jesus was in the acknowledgment of dependence -- "as he prayed" -- that this change took place.<a name=279:12></a> This, then, is the first thing we have here -- a change such as will pass upon the living saints when Jesus comes.<a name=279:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias.<a name=279:14></a>" They were with Him.<a name=279:15></a> And this will be our joy; we shall be with Jesus.<a name=279:16></a> In 1 Thessalonians 4 after stating the order in which the resurrection of the sleeping, and the change of the living, saints will take place, that we shall both be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air, all that the apostle says as to what shall ensue is, "and so shall we be ever with the Lord.<a name=279:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in this passage there is not only the being with Christ, but there is also familiar intercourse with Him.<a name=279:18></a> "There talked with him two men.<a name=279:19></a>" It is not that He talked with

	<div class="paragraph">
		them, though this was no doubt true; but this might have been, and they be at a distance.<a name=280:1></a> But when we read that they talked with Him, we get the idea of the most free and familiar intercourse.<a name=280:2></a> Peter and the others knew what it was to have such intercourse with Jesus in humiliation; and what joy must it have been to have the proof that such intercourse with Him would be enjoyed in glory!<a name=280:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then it is said by Luke that "they appeared in glory.<a name=280:4></a>" But this is secondary to what we have been considering.<a name=280:5></a> We are told that they were with Him, and then that they appeared in glory.<a name=280:6></a> They share in the same glory as that in which He was manifested.<a name=280:7></a> And so as to us.<a name=280:8></a> "When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.<a name=280:9></a>" "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.<a name=280:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thing still.<a name=280:11></a> We are not only told that they were with Him, that they talked with Him, and appeared in glory with Him, but we are also privileged to know the subject of their conversation.<a name=280:12></a> They "spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.<a name=280:13></a>" It was the cross which was the theme of their conversation in the glory -- the sufferings of Christ which He had to accomplish at Jerusalem.<a name=280:14></a> And surely this will be our joy throughout eternity, when in glory with Christ -- to dwell upon this theme, His decease accomplished at Jerusalem.<a name=280:15></a> We next read that Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.<a name=280:16></a> It shews us what the flesh is in the presence of the glory of God.<a name=280:17></a> Peter made a great mistake; but I pass on.<a name=280:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"While he thus spake, there came a cloud and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.<a name=280:19></a> And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.<a name=280:20></a>" Peter tells us that this voice came from the excellent glory.<a name=280:21></a> "For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.<a name=280:22></a>" Now Peter and the others had entered into the cloud; and thus we get the wonderful fact that in the glory, from which the voice comes, saints are privileged to stand, and there, in that glory, share the delight of the Father in

		"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.<a name=281:4></a>" The vision all gone -- the cloud, the voice, the glory, Moses and Elias; but Jesus was left, and they were left to go on their way with Jesus, knowing Him now in the light of those scenes of glory which they had beheld.<a name=281:5></a> And this is the use to us of those vivid apprehensions of spiritual things which we may sometimes realise.<a name=281:6></a> It is not that we can be always enjoying them and nothing else.<a name=281:7></a> But when for the season they have passed away, like this vision on the holy mount, they leave us alone with Jesus, to pursue the path of our pilgrimage with Him in spirit now, and with Him in the light and power of that deepened acquaintance with Him, and fellowship of the Father's joy in Him, that we have got on the mount; and thus to wait for the moment of His return, when all this, and more than our hearts can think of, shall be fulfilled to us for ever.<a name=281:8></a>

		Acts 7
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are two of the main thoughts presented in this striking and instructive chapter.<a name=282:1></a> God was rejected, let Him speak or act as He might, and never more than when He displayed His grace.<a name=282:2></a> "Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost.<a name=282:3></a>" It is true, these Christ-rejecting Jews boasted in the law; but if they had received the law by the disposition of angels, had they kept it?<a name=282:4></a> They had persecuted the prophets; they had slain those who foreshadowed the coming of the Just One they had now betrayed and murdered Himself.<a name=282:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was no new feature in their history.<a name=282:6></a> Their fathers had done the same as themselves.<a name=282:7></a> Man is ever resisting what God sends in blessing.<a name=282:8></a> Joseph and Moses had been rejected, the two prominent types of the Lord Jesus.<a name=282:9></a> Their fathers despised and hated Joseph; they had done the same by Christ.<a name=282:10></a> God exalted Joseph; and Stephen's testimony was to Jesus standing on the right hand of God.<a name=282:11></a> And if Joseph sent and called his kindred in grace, did not and will not Christ do the same?<a name=282:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses appears.<a name=282:13></a> He abandons the house of Pharaoh in love to his brethren; but they resisted him, as Christ was resisted.<a name=282:14></a> "As your fathers did, so do ye.<a name=282:15></a>" All boasting then was ended.<a name=282:16></a> They were constant only in opposing the Holy Ghost.<a name=282:17></a> This is ever the case with the natural man.<a name=282:18></a> He cannot trust God.<a name=282:19></a> He ever resists the Spirit of God.<a name=282:20></a> There is no power in him to rely on the word of God; but the moment a thing is built up which can be seen, man can trust in that, no matter what it may be.<a name=282:21></a> God may be gone; but if it be the tabernacle or the temple, some settled thing for the eye, man will trust in it, though it is the very thing God is about to judge.<a name=282:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony God gave was resisted; and man was clinging to that which God is going to pull down.<a name=282:23></a> All that is not founded upon the word will be shaken, and this, terrible though it be to flesh and blood, is a positive promise to us.<a name=282:24></a> "Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.<a name=282:25></a> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.<a name=282:26></a> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.<a name=282:27></a> For our God is a consuming fire," Hebrews 12.<a name=282:28></a>

		How far can you take this as a promise?<a name=283:1></a> If your hearts are resting here, you cannot.<a name=283:2></a> This may be easily known by the test -- how far are your hearts attached to Christ in heaven, unseen save to the eye of faith?<a name=283:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How beautifully was this brought out in the case of Stephen!<a name=283:4></a> He was a bright reflection of his blessed Master, resisting unto blood in his strife against sin.<a name=283:5></a> What is more, he brings before us a vivid picture to be followed in our everyday life.<a name=283:6></a> For we are called always to testify for Christ, through the power of the Spirit, though it may not be unto death.<a name=283:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides, the rejection of the testimony by Stephen was a turning-point of the ways of God with Israel, with man, though the principle had already come out at the death of Christ.<a name=283:8></a> God never could directly bless the world after that.<a name=283:9></a> He could forgive guilty Israel if they repented, and send Christ back again, in answer to the prayer on the cross.<a name=283:10></a> And this is just what Peter preaches in Acts 3 that, if the people were converted, to the blotting out of their sins, Jesus was ready to return, and to bring in the times of restitution of all things -- a truth which their present impenitence postpones, but does not destroy: for He is coming again.<a name=283:11></a> But now Stephen's testimony is utterly refused, and the witness of Christ's heavenly glory is cast out of the city and stoned without mercy.<a name=283:12></a> It was the fitting sequel of such a testimony.<a name=283:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had been dealing with man in all sorts of ways since Adam, but it only brought out the greater evil, for man continually resisted Him.<a name=283:14></a> Before the law they were lawless; they were transgressors when they had the law.<a name=283:15></a> God had given priests, kings, prophets in vain.<a name=283:16></a> Then He sent His Son.<a name=283:17></a> But they only rejected God in all ways, and at all times.<a name=283:18></a> When Christ came, sin added another crime to the terrible list.<a name=283:19></a> The deepest of all evils was there -- rejection of the Son of man in His humiliation, and of the Spirit's testimony to His exaltation in heavenly glory.<a name=283:20></a> Jesus came not in the sternness of the law, but in love, yet He met only with enmity and hatred.<a name=283:21></a> If men, as such, could have been connected with God, they must have been when Christ came.<a name=283:22></a> But man needs a new nature for such a link; and this Christ does give to all

		So Stephen, "being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.<a name=284:2></a>"

		Such is the true place of the believer, rendered capable by the Spirit of fixing his eye on Jesus in glory, and this in presence of the world and its prince, who crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=284:3></a> It is not simply nor vaguely his eye opened to glory, but he sees the Son of man there, and the Spirit forms his heart, and mind, and walk according to that pattern.<a name=284:4></a> For the veil is rent, and Jesus is seen in heaven.<a name=284:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have heaven opened four times in the New Testament; and of these the first when the Lord was upon the earth.<a name=284:6></a> There was nothing in the actual condition of man which God could look on with pleasure till the Man Christ Jesus was seen on earth.<a name=284:7></a> That the heavens should open on Him was no marvel.<a name=284:8></a> God had found perfect rest upon earth, and said, when the heavens opened, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<a name=284:9></a>" On the last occasion, namely, in Revelation 19, heaven is opened for the fourth time, and Christ is seen as coming to judge.<a name=284:10></a> In each of these heaven opened to Christ.<a name=284:11></a> But there was a third scene when heaven opened, and not to Christ.<a name=284:12></a> He had been rejected from earth, and was no longer a link between it and God.<a name=284:13></a> Where then is He?<a name=284:14></a> At God's right hand.<a name=284:15></a> When He was crucified, the whole world was condemned, and the prince of this world judged.<a name=284:16></a> All had joined together -- governor, priest, people -- against the Lord and His anointed.<a name=284:17></a> The world deliberately rejected the holiness of God, and had no heart for the love of God.<a name=284:18></a> Yet after this, and in spite of this, we get heaven opened once more before Christ comes to execute judgment.<a name=284:19></a> Heaven is opened upon a believer in Christ, upon a witness to His glory outside the world.<a name=284:20></a> "Behold, I see the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.<a name=284:21></a>" Christ Himself was the object on earth upon whom heaven opened.<a name=284:22></a> Christ is now the object in heaven presented to the believer on earth.<a name=284:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Are we then looking steadfastly into heaven?<a name=285:7></a> Alas!<a name=285:8></a> what inconstant hearts we have: how fickle and changing!<a name=285:9></a> The Holy Ghost ever leads the eye to, and would keep it fixed on, Jesus.<a name=285:10></a> He is the object of the Spirit from all eternity; whether as the Son in the bosom of the Father; or as the rejected Messiah on earth; or as the Son of man exalted at the right hand of God.<a name=285:11></a> To reveal and glorify Him is the habitual aim of the Spirit.<a name=285:12></a> When we have not much power for prayer, or even to follow others, and our hearts get full of distracted thoughts -- when there is little energy in our souls for praise and worship, we have but a feeble measure of the power of the Spirit; we are not filled with the Holy Ghost.<a name=285:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavens, then, can be opened upon a believer here below, when Christ, the Son of man, is up there.<a name=285:14></a> What a thought, what a truth for our heart!<a name=285:15></a> Indeed, more than this; for in Ephesians 2 we learn the blessed fact, that God has quickened us together with Christ, has raised us up together, and seated us together in Christ in heavenly places.<a name=285:16></a> He has taken His place at the right hand of God: and we are made to sit there in Him, because united to Him who is there.<a name=285:17></a> "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=285:18></a>"

		Indeed Stephen's discourse to the Jews had strikingly paved the way to this; for while he had sketched the history of the people from the very first, he had singled out Abraham, called away from his country and kindred by the appearing of God in glory.<a name=286:3></a> Abraham, a stranger in the land of promise, and not a foot of it as yet his own.<a name=286:4></a> He had traced the sins, sorrows, and bondage of "our fathers," till God delivered the people out of Egypt, as He had previously called Abraham from Mesopotamia.<a name=286:5></a> Two individuals stood out most significantly;but they were scarcely more characterised by the honour of God, than they had been previously by the rejection of Israel.<a name=286:6></a> Joseph given up to the Gentiles, afterwards the most exalted in the personal administration of the kingdom, and the instrument of the goodness and wisdom of God, in behalf of the very brethren who had persecuted and sold him; Moses, the refused ruler and judge, whom God sent, long after, to be a ruler and a deliverer; just such had been the features of their recent sin, and such should be the path of God in His grace.<a name=286:7></a> But they had no ear for Him as yet.<a name=286:8></a> From the very first, their idolatrous hearts had departed from Him, however slow He had been in executing judgment.<a name=286:9></a> And however their pride might rest complacently in this holy place, God Himself in truth was, and had been, as great a stranger, so to speak, in Canaan, as had been Abraham His friend.<a name=286:10></a> It was true that "Solomon built him an house.<a name=286:11></a>" But this had furnished the occasion for the prophet to tell them in due time, that the Most High, whose hand had made all things, would not rest in a temple made with hands; and this, in connection with restored idolatry in the temple, and the consummated wickedness and judgment of Israel in the latter day, before the Lord shall create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy.<a name=286:12></a>

		Nothing is so difficult as to take a man out of himself; it is impossible, except by giving him a new nature.<a name=289:1></a> Man glories in anything that will bring honour to himself -- anything that distinguishes him from his neighbour.<a name=289:2></a> It does not signify what it is (it may be that he is the tallest man); anything his pride may come into in that which gives him advantage over others.<a name=289:3></a> Some may glory in their talents.<a name=289:4></a> There are differences in men's minds; vanity is seen more in some, wishing for the good opinion of others; pride more in others, having a good opinion of themselves.<a name=289:5></a> Wealth, knowledge, anything that distinguishes a man, he will glory in, and make a little world around himself by it.<a name=289:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing, too, that men glory in, besides talent, birth, wealth, etc.<a name=289:7></a>, and that is his religion.<a name=289:8></a> Take a Jew, and you will find he glories in not being a Turk; the Christian, so called, glories in that he is not a heathen and a publican.<a name=289:9></a> Man will thus take the very thing that God has given to take him out of himself to accredit himself with.<a name=289:10></a> Those who are so deluded as to be throwing themselves down to juggernaut may have less to glory in, or to fancy they can glory in; but the measure of truth, connected with the religion men hold, is the very occasion of their glorying.<a name=289:11></a> Thus the Turk, who owns God, will glory in his religion over those who do not; the Jew, in his religion -- he has the truth, and "salvation is of the Jews"; the Gentile Christian, too, has truth, but then he prides himself upon it, and this brings in the mischief.<a name=289:12></a> The subtlety of the enemy is seen in proportion as it is truth in which he makes a man glory; and it is not so difficult to detect, either, for if you are proud of being a Christian, the whole thing is told at once.<a name=289:13></a>

		It is quite another thing, of course, for the true, genuine child of God walking in the power of the cross, etc.<a name=289:14></a>, who glories in that he knows God.<a name=289:15></a> With Jonah there was just this pride at work: he was proud of being a Jew, and would not go to Nineveh, as God told him, because he was afraid of losing his reputation.<a name=289:16></a> He had rather have seen all Nineveh destroyed, than have his own credit as a prophet lost.<a name=289:17></a> Jonah was a true prophet, but, glorying in himself, he turned his <a name=290>[Page 290]</a>

		Glorying in religion is a deeper thing.<a name=290:4></a> Whatever comes from man must be worthless.<a name=290:5></a> A man cannot glory in being a sinner.<a name=290:6></a> Conscience can never glory, and there is no true religion without the conscience -- not speaking now of righteousness in Christ.<a name=290:7></a> What is it then in religion that man glories in?<a name=290:8></a> It always must have a legal character, because there must be something for him to do -- hard penance, or anything, no matter at what cost, if it only glorifies self.<a name=290:9></a> "As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh constrain you to be circumcised .<a name=290:10></a>.<a name=290:11></a>.<a name=290:12></a> they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.<a name=290:13></a>" Man could bind heavy burdens.<a name=290:14></a> Why should he?<a name=290:15></a> Because self would have to do something.<a name=290:16></a> When man glories in self there may be the truth in a measure, but it is of the legal character always, because there must be something man can do for God.<a name=290:17></a> Glorying in the flesh is not glorying in sin, but, as in Philippians 3, religious glorying, glorying in something besides Christ.<a name=290:18></a>

		There is more in the cross.<a name=292:8></a> God accomplishes all His purposes by it.<a name=292:9></a> He is bringing "many sons to glory," and how could He bring these defiled sinners into the same glory with His own Son?<a name=292:10></a> Why, God has so fully accomplished the work that, when in the glory with Him, we shall be a part of the display of that glory.<a name=292:11></a> Therefore He says, "That in the ages to come, he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace" -- a Mary Magdalene, a thief upon the cross, trophies of that grace, through all eternity!<a name=292:12></a> And how could He set them in such a place with His own Son?<a name=292:13></a> His own glory and love rise over all our sin and put it all away: He Himself has done it.<a name=292:14></a>

		What we find written in the Psalms is primarily connected with the Jews, or the Lord Jesus Himself, and particularly as Messiah.<a name=311:1></a> They have a special reference to the godly remnant in the latter day.<a name=311:2></a> Many of their expressions wholly belong to the Jews, and cannot be used by the church.<a name=311:3></a> Hence, the true solution of those passages which have been such a terrible stumbling to Christians not seeing it.<a name=311:4></a> The saints of the present dispensation cannot rightly be looking for the destruction of their enemies, as a way of escape from their sorrows.<a name=311:5></a> But in the time of trouble, such as never has been, that is to come, it will be quite proper for the suffering Jews to look for judgments as a way of deliverance.<a name=311:6></a> They are God's promises, and what their hope rests upon.<a name=311:7></a> But the church looks to be caught up, and escape from sorrow, by being with the Lord in the heavens, whilst it is quite true that she has His sympathy in her sorrow down here.<a name=311:8></a> But what the Psalms are chiefly occupied with is the suffering of the soul, the sorrows of the godly Jews and remnant, and God coming in judgment, as their deliverer, by the execution of vengeance on all their foes.<a name=311:9></a> Christ is viewed there as associated with Israel, and enters into all the sufferings of the holy remnant.<a name=311:10></a> Then there are certain psalms which belong personally to Himself.<a name=311:11></a> They shew out the character of the spirit of Christ, as the Gospels shew His walk and work.<a name=311:12></a> The Gospels display the one in whom was no selfishness.<a name=311:13></a> They tell out the heart that was ready for everybody.<a name=311:14></a> No matter how deep His own sorrow, He always cared for others.<a name=311:15></a> He could warn Peter in Gethsemane, and comfort the dying thief on the cross.<a name=311:16></a> His heart was above circumstances, never acting under them, but ever according to God in them.<a name=311:17></a> We see that He was always sensible to them, and often get in the Psalms expressions of what His heart felt in them: "I am poured out like water.<a name=311:18></a>" "My bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax.<a name=311:19></a>" He was the tried man; and, as man tried, I am called to follow Him.<a name=311:20></a> I should forget self, and the things belonging to self, in shewing love to others.<a name=311:21></a> The true effect of being near Christ puts me into fellowship with Himself about others, instead of being under my own circumstances.<a name=311:22></a> How can I be turning my

		In the history given us in Mark 10: 17-27 we see a man whose position is in contrast with that of the apostle (in Philippians 3), which shews in a striking manner the effect produced by the Holy Spirit.<a name=322:8></a> The apostle had left all for Christ.<a name=322:9></a> Advantages, in which a Jew could boast, he had had beyond what the young man referred to in Mark 10 possessed.<a name=322:10></a> He had been brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, the most celebrated Rabbi; he was a citizen of Tarsus, a city renowned (if we adopt modern phraseology) as a university; he had been well trained in all the acquirements of the day.<a name=322:11></a> Moreover, he was privileged in having led a blameless life, as he tells us in verse 6.<a name=322:12></a> All this was very precious to him as a man, so long as he had not seen Christ.<a name=322:13></a> All that a man can pride himself in, Paul possessed.<a name=322:14></a> If any thought that the flesh might be gloried in, Paul could shew that he had more therein than they.<a name=322:15></a> But Christ in glory revealed Himself to Paul, and then he could say, "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss, etc.<a name=322:16></a>, that I might win Christ.<a name=322:17></a>" What was the state of Paul's soul?<a name=322:18></a> I must gain Christ.<a name=322:19></a> This is all I have to do, my whole, sole business; everything else found in my pathway is but loss.<a name=322:20></a> Such is the effect produced by the Spirit of God in the

		In comparing this with Mark 10 the contrast is seen, namely of a man who has not the Spirit: for this chapter presents us with one in circumstances similar to Paul, but not full of the Holy Ghost.<a name=323:7></a> He is portrayed, however, as a man of a character altogether lovely; but Christ was not his object, and natural loveliness availed naught.<a name=323:8></a> Yet his character was such that it attracted the attention of the Lord.<a name=323:9></a> Jesus "loved him," verse 21.<a name=323:10></a> He also was as to the law blameless.<a name=323:11></a> A Jew, he supposed that he was to have eternal life by the law.<a name=323:12></a> His thought as to Jesus was, That is the man that can tell me what I must do in order to inherit eternal life.<a name=323:13></a> The pure, excellent, and perfect character of the Lord had convinced him that the knowledge of the most excellent commandment might be learned from Him; and He hastens to Him.<a name=323:14></a> He was <i>ardent</i> in his desire to know what he had to do, and he drew near to Jesus with all possible respect, with "Good Master" (Jesus received not this praise from one who regarded Him only as a man), he even kneels before the Lord.<a name=323:15></a> There was something very lovely in the character of him who could say (and the Lord admits it as a truth) "All these things have I kept from my youth up.<a name=323:16></a>" But the Lord puts his heart to the proof, in order to make manifest what are the motives which sway it, and He does so by means of the cross: "Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, etc.<a name=323:17></a>, and come take up the cross and follow me.<a name=323:18></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		However lovely and estimable the young man may have been, he does not take up the cross.<a name=323:19></a> When the state of his heart is in question, he has no will for what is Christ's.<a name=323:20></a> He looked for righteousness in the law; and Christ, present with him, succeeds not in engaging him in another course.<a name=323:21></a> He said not, as Paul, "I have suffered the loss of all things, and do esteem them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him -- not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.<a name=323:22></a>"

		When the grace of the gospel is presented, it may be received very sincerely, and yet often without the full practical discovery of the evil within, or of the law of sin in the members, to the extent that is afterwards learnt practically; and the result is, that, in measure, the knowledge of the grace of God is superficial, and the soul often gets alarmed.<a name=333:7></a> But whenever the soul has been really brought to the experimental knowledge of the law of sin working in the members, and the grace of God in dealing with sin in Christ Jesus; then it knows that God is for us, thus evil as we were, and so ceases to be harassed by the workings of the law.<a name=333:8></a> God's grace has judged the condition of the sinner, thus fully shewn, and put away the sin by Christ; and we have only to adore and praise Him for what He has done.<a name=333:9></a> The sin has been imputed to Christ, and He has put it away, and that is all, and the conscience has peace.<a name=333:10></a> The soul knows God, not as under the law, but under grace.<a name=333:11></a> This being settled, we have altogether ceased from our anxieties; as it regards the conscience, we have peace then through the blood of Christ.<a name=333:12></a> But this is preliminary to all true labour, and to the divine rest.<a name=333:13></a>

		THE PRESENCE OF THE SPIRIT IN JOHN 14 COMPARED WITH CHAPTERS 15 AND 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things quite distinct from each other -- conscience, life, and power.<a name=343:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There may be conviction of conscience, as in Herod when he heard John preach; but he was not converted.<a name=343:2></a> A man may know he is doing wrong, but this does not give him power against it.<a name=343:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Life, a new spiritual being, is another thing.<a name=343:4></a> It gives activity to the conscience.<a name=343:5></a> A new nature is there with its feelings, desires, affections, but without power.<a name=343:6></a> There will be less peace perhaps than before there was life, because there may have been false peace before.<a name=343:7></a> The state is, of course, better than that of the mere natural man: there will be no levity in that state.<a name=343:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third thing alluded to is the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=343:9></a> We must distinguish between gift for service, and the power which gives enjoyment.<a name=343:10></a> There will be peace.<a name=343:11></a> In order to our having the power, Christ has made peace through the blood of His cross.<a name=343:12></a> "There is, therefore, no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus.<a name=343:13></a>" We want this power.<a name=343:14></a> It could not be conferred on man in the flesh.<a name=343:15></a> Divine righteousness must be there, or God could not put His seal on man.<a name=343:16></a> Can God put His seal on a person full of the sense of sin?<a name=343:17></a> -- in conflict about his sin -- say such a state as Peter's, when he said, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord"?<a name=343:18></a> There may be good desires and tenderness of conscience, but it will run into legality, because not as yet resting in the favour of God.<a name=343:19></a> These experiences may be all very useful in their place, but they are not peace.<a name=343:20></a> We have peace made by the blood of the cross, and divine righteousness wrought out in Christ.<a name=343:21></a> I can now look up to God without hiding my sin.<a name=343:22></a> The way I come at the sense of the immensity of sin is by the immensity of the grace that has met it.<a name=343:23></a>

		The reality of the presence of the Holy Ghost, who has come down and dwells in us, is most important.<a name=343:24></a> The Holy Ghost is given as a seal.<a name=343:25></a> Christ said, "If I go away, I will send him unto you.<a name=343:26></a>" The Comforter brings to me the fullness of His grace, being the witness of accepted righteousness to our hearts.<a name=343:27></a> He convicts, or demonstrates, of righteousness, and this righteousness is mine.<a name=343:28></a> I stand in it.<a name=343:29></a> He convicts the

	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought now is not, I am so full of sin that He cannot bless me; but, God has accepted the righteousness and I stand in it.<a name=344:3></a> We are of God, and Christ is made unto us righteousness.<a name=344:4></a> We are born of God, and as such we need something to bring to Him.<a name=344:5></a> It is all furnished in Christ.<a name=344:6></a> There is not only peace as to the past, but I have Christ's standing in the presence of God.<a name=344:7></a> We stand in Christ, the second Man, and have the second Man's place in virtue of redemption.<a name=344:8></a> So sure as I have the first Adam's place as turned out because a sinner, so I have the last Adam's place according to the counsels of God in Christ.<a name=344:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of John 17 we have Christ's righteousness title (verse 22) and His personal title (verse 24), spoken of.<a name=344:10></a> He is bound to bless.<a name=344:11></a> "I am glorified in them.<a name=344:12></a>" He could not bless sin, but now righteousness being perfected, all the purposes of His heart in love can flow out to us, because we are the righteous ones.<a name=344:13></a> Whatever the love of God -- the righteousness of God -- all that by which He stands in the presence of God, because of His work and Person, we have, and are blessed in virtue of it.<a name=344:14></a>

		The Spirit is the seal and the earnest -- the Spirit of holiness -- the Spirit of adoption -- the Spirit of truth.<a name=344:15></a> All that God can give we are made possessors of by the Holy Ghost, and our "bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost.<a name=344:16></a>" How do I know Christ is in the Father and myself in Christ?<a name=344:17></a> The Holy Ghost has come down, and as Christ said in chapter 14, "in that day," referring to the present time, "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=344:18></a>" As many as are led by the Spirit are the sons of God.<a name=344:19></a>" "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<a name=344:20></a>" He makes us the servants of Christ, and all is founded on the work of Christ, but realised by the presence of the Holy Ghost.<a name=344:21></a> "If I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you.<a name=344:22></a>" He tells them that all they had before, it was a good thing for them to lose, because we have got more by the Holy Ghost being given.<a name=344:23></a> Christ's humiliation, did they understand?<a name=344:24></a> "That be far from thee, Lord.<a name=344:25></a>" Would a Christian say this now?<a name=344:26></a> They could not' think what it could mean, that He should die and rise again.<a name=344:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God said to Christ, "Sit on my right hand till I make," etc.<a name=345:20></a> (Acts 2).<a name=345:21></a> The Holy Ghost acts in power till Christ comes in power.<a name=345:22></a> Everything will be displayed when He comes in His kingdom.<a name=345:23></a> Everything will then be set right; crowns given, etc.<a name=345:24></a> Christ is exalted on the right hand of the Father, and received the Holy Ghost afresh as Head of His body, and thence sent Him forth.<a name=345:25></a>

		There are two points seen distinctly in our salvation and in the ways of God.<a name=377:1></a> The first is God bringing His thoughts to pass about us in grace, the second is the dealings of God with us, so as to bring our souls into the full enjoyment of both the source and effects of all His thoughts.<a name=377:2></a> And I am sure we ought to take heed to the difference of those two things, if we are to walk wisely as Christians.<a name=377:3></a> We need to hold both distinctly -- God accomplishing His thoughts about us in grace, and His dealings with us to bring us into the enjoyment of them.<a name=377:4></a> The first is as sure, settled, and stedfast, as God Himself is, because "Hath he spoken, and will he not do it?<a name=377:5></a>" But the other is His work also, and it is a process that must be carried on in our souls.<a name=377:6></a> For God never can depart from what He is.<a name=377:7></a> None of His counsels can deny His nature.<a name=377:8></a> His nature is holy, and He must have us holy; His nature is love, and He must have us in love.<a name=377:9></a> He cannot have us enjoy Himself, which is His purpose in grace, in a way different from what His nature is.<a name=377:10></a>

		What man got in the fall is the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=377:11></a> This must be worked out in our hearts, if I may so say, to the measure and thoughts of God.<a name=377:12></a> It is there that all kinds of exercises come in -- discipline, if needed, sifting processes, etc.<a name=377:13></a>, which go on in people's hearts.<a name=377:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first of these points, it is important to look at it as all settled.<a name=378:12></a> While our souls are exercised, and have got perhaps under law, we cannot understand this.<a name=378:13></a> We are looking at our own responsibilities, and are not thoroughly brought down and emptied of self.<a name=378:14></a> We have not yet real faith that the first Adam never has reached God, and never will.<a name=378:15></a> These are exercises of the heart short of the full knowledge of redemption.<a name=378:16></a> But when I have understood that our whole condition as children of the first Adam is a rejected one, that all are sinners, and that sin cannot get into the presence of God -- when that is wrought, I look to another thing.<a name=378:17></a> I see in a sense that that responsibility is over -- that I am entirely lost.<a name=378:18></a> Through grace Christ takes my place, and I get into another position altogether; I am a new creature in Christ Jesus.<a name=378:19></a> This is not speaking of my practical condition, but of the place that I have got into in Christ.<a name=378:20></a> Not one single bit of the old nature can come in there.<a name=378:21></a> And this is as true of the life I received from God as it is of redemption -- "that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.<a name=378:22></a>" Of course, when the glory comes, there will be no difficulty in saying, It is entirely of God.<a name=378:23></a> All is perfect and settled, whether I look at the individual saint or the church of God as a whole.<a name=378:24></a> He has loved it, and given Himself for it.<a name=378:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The more one looks into it, the more there really is a deep sense of perfectness.<a name=379:5></a> I see the perfect love that is the source of it all -- infinite unspeakable love, a love which God's very nature, and being, and purpose about us too, express.<a name=379:6></a> When I look at the way it is accomplished, I see the perfectness of Christ's work, the absoluteness of His obedience in giving Himself up entirely.<a name=379:7></a> He gave Himself for us altogether, not merely His life, but Himself.<a name=379:8></a> He "hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God," etc.<a name=379:9></a> The more I study it, the more I see the intrinsic blessedness of it, and the delight that God takes in it.<a name=379:10></a> It is a "sweet smelling savour to God.<a name=379:11></a>" We cannot see it too completely in God's hands.<a name=379:12></a> Christ "loved the church and gave himself for it"; that is the first thing.<a name=379:13></a> And then He sets about, after He has got it and made it His own, to sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.<a name=379:14></a> It is according to His own mind that He does it, and then He presents it to Himself a glorious church.<a name=379:15></a>

		OUR RELATIONS TO CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Revelation 1: 4-7; 22: 16-21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have taken these two passages which precede and come after all the prophetic part of the book, as giving us the relationships in which the saints stand to Christ, to whom the book is confided.<a name=386:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these opening verses we get an address, and the answer of heart in the saints to that address; and then, when the book closes, the address of the Lord to His people as the bride, and the answer.<a name=386:2></a> I desire to shew the place in which the Spirit of God sets the saints, and the connection of it with their character, affections, and duties.<a name=386:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One abstract remark may be made: our affections and our duties flow from the relationship in which we are set.<a name=386:4></a> It is clear that, if we are creatures of God, our duties as such flow from our knowledge of that.<a name=386:5></a> So with our earthly duties and affections -- they flow from our relationship one with another, whether as husband and wife, or as father and child.<a name=386:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very simple remark, but of all importance, with regard to the saints' position.<a name=386:7></a> But then I must be in this relationship to have these affections, and I must know what the relationship is to which those duties belong.<a name=386:8></a> If I had no consciousness of being a child and happened to meet my father, I should have no sense of the duties and affections belonging to me as a child.<a name=386:9></a> In order to have right affections, I must be in the relationship to which the affections belong, and I must know that I am in it too.<a name=386:10></a> The relationship must be known as mine, in order to possess the affections belonging to it.<a name=386:11></a> I cannot love Christ as a Saviour, if I do not know whether He is a Saviour or not to me; I cannot love God as a Father, if I am not sure whether or not I am a child.<a name=386:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the importance of this is, that a full settled knowledge of salvation is the spring and foundation of our duties to God -- not only the knowledge of the fact of salvation, but of what that salvation has brought me into.<a name=386:13></a> It has made me a child, and I am bound to walk and feel as a child.<a name=386:14></a> It is so if I take Christ as He presents Himself at the end of this book: immediately the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=386:15></a> If I do not know that I belong to the bride of Christ, how can I, when He thus presents Himself to me, say to Him, Come?<a name=386:16></a> It is

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=387>[Page 387]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the relationship in which I am from which an must flow, and no duties and affections are rightly founded until we know ourselves to be in this relationship to God.<a name=387:1></a> There may be a craving after the thing, and there will be.<a name=387:2></a> If I am an orphan, I would give anything to have a father; but I cannot have the affections of a child, because I have not got a father to love me.<a name=387:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wherever the divine nature is, there is the spring of these thoughts and feelings of love to God, and of holiness; but I cannot have them in perfection for my soul, because I have not the constant enjoyment of my relationship.<a name=387:4></a> A law may be imposed upon a person, but it never produces any affection.<a name=387:5></a> There may be a law which claims certain feelings and affections from me, but this gives no consciousness of the relationship by which these affections are produced; consequently it gives me no power.<a name=387:6></a> This is the real character of the law.<a name=387:7></a> Instead of being founded on a relationship that is existing, it promises that by keeping it I shall get life.<a name=387:8></a> If I keep the law without having real life, I am to get life by keeping it.<a name=387:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find this principle laid down in Scripture -- duty called for in order to the obtaining of life; but never does it produce the thing.<a name=387:10></a> Law claims from man what he ought to be, but it does not and cannot place man in any relationship with God, in which he may enjoy the blessing that belongs to God.<a name=387:11></a> Now it is not so with Christ.<a name=387:12></a> He does bring us, by the salvation which He has wrought, into relationship with God; He gives us a known settled place before God; and then our affections and duties flow from the place we are in.<a name=387:13></a> They are not the means of obtaining the place, but that which belongs to the place we are in.<a name=387:14></a> If we are the bride of Christ, we ought to have the feelings and wishes of one that is so.<a name=387:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Throughout, when you enter into these verses, this suggests itself to the heart.<a name=387:16></a> In whatever way Christ is spoken of, there is at once what calls forth a response from the hearts of the saints.<a name=387:17></a> Whatever may be said as to His titles or offices or what He is, the effect of speaking of Him with whom we are in relationship is to awaken feelings in our own hearts of what He is to us.<a name=387:18></a> For instance, if I were to speak to a child of its father, as one who had eminently distinguished himself as a hero or a statesman, the child's feelings at once would be, That is my father.<a name=387:19></a> He would not say, That is a great conqueror.<a name=387:20></a> The child's feelings would be, That great man is my father.<a name=387:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So it would be with a wife.<a name=388:1></a> If she were told that such a person had greatly distinguished himself in any place, and she knew it was her husband, she would say, That is my husband; because all this glory awoke, in the mind of the child or the wife, the consciousness of the relationship in which they stood to the one to whom they belonged.<a name=388:2></a> Now, this is the case with the church of God.<a name=388:3></a> You cannot speak of any glory of Christ or of God, that does not awaken in the heart of the saint the consciousness of what God and Christ are to itself.<a name=388:4></a> This is characteristic of the existence of such a relationship, and the affections that belong to it.<a name=388:5></a> You cannot speak of the person with whom others are in relationship, without awakening in their hearts the sense of what the person is to them.<a name=388:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole character of this book is one of judgment.<a name=388:7></a> It is not the Father communicating with the church by means of the Holy Ghost which dwells in it.<a name=388:8></a> And when Christ is described, it is as One whose eyes are like a flame of fire, judging in the midst of the churches, or as One coming out of heaven on a white horse, a sharp sword going out of His mouth that with it He should smite the nations.<a name=388:9></a> When it is God, He is sitting on a throne from whence lightnings and thunderings proceed, and sending out preliminary or final judgments on the earth.<a name=388:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we shall find here, by the feelings that are expressed, the way in which the saint, the child of God, feels when Christ is brought forward.<a name=388:11></a> We shall find that, even when He is presented in judgment -- that is, in an earthly character -- the church has immediately awakened in her heart the place and relationship in which she stands to the one thus presented.<a name=388:12></a> Jesus, the Prince of the kings of the earth, is alluded to: at once the answer is, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.<a name=388:13></a>" If the "Root and offspring of David" is named, the "Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=388:14></a>" It is the characteristic of the soul that lives in the conscious blessedness and enjoyment of an existing relationship with God.<a name=388:15></a> However Christ is presented, it is her own relationship with Him that is at once awakened in the bride.<a name=388:16></a> What I see in the word is not merely God visiting us as sinners, as He has done, but that when He has visited us, He has brought us into blessed connection with Himself, and having brought us there, He calls us, as in that connection, to live in the delight and in the duties that belong to it.<a name=388:17></a>

		We do not thoroughly understand how lost we are in our natural state, because we do not look simply to our place in Christ.<a name=389:1></a> It is in the measure that we understand that they who are in the flesh cannot please God, and that the flesh is not subject to God and cannot be remedied, that we rest by faith in our place in Christ.<a name=389:2></a> The moment I come to know that my relationship with God depends upon what He is for me and what He has made me by grace in Himself, and not upon what I am to Him, it is all simple.<a name=389:3></a> It may astonish many to see that it does not depend upon what they are to Him.<a name=389:4></a> They will say, Are not men judged according to their works?<a name=389:5></a> To be sure they are.<a name=389:6></a> But who among you will stand this judgment?<a name=389:7></a> It is not merely a truth; but what is your condition if it is a truth?<a name=389:8></a> We are lost.<a name=389:9></a> We can only say, "Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.<a name=389:10></a>" There is an end of all flesh as such.<a name=389:11></a> If Christ came, He came to call sinners -- to seek and save that which was lost.<a name=389:12></a> It was all a settled thing to a man in the flesh.<a name=389:13></a> You and I, looked at as moral responsible beings before God, have walked in such sort that we could not stand in the judgment -- no one, not even a Christian could.<a name=389:14></a> I am not talking of grace saving, but of man judged as a responsible being to God.<a name=389:15></a> If God deals with us on this ground, we could not, as job says, answer Him one in a thousand.<a name=389:16></a> This we know to be true.<a name=389:17></a> There is not a single person, if it were a question of the most careless person in the world, who does not know that he cannot stand in the judgment.<a name=389:18></a> If he were brought today into the presence of God, he would do what Adam did -- go and hide himself if he could; he would not dare to stand and be judged of God.<a name=389:19></a> The saint knows it, but the sinner knows it too.<a name=389:20></a> As a present thing, he has no desire to be with God.<a name=389:21></a> If it was offered to ever such a decent man of the world to go to heaven today, he would not -- nor to-morrow either.<a name=389:22></a> When then is he to go?<a name=389:23></a> When he cannot help it.<a name=389:24></a> If he must die, he would rather go to heaven, but there is not a man of the world but would stay out of heaven as long as possible.<a name=389:25></a>

		AFFLICTION'S LESSONS -- A LETTER FROM A FRIEND ON THE DEATH OF A CHILD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Sister,<p>I thank you and dear M -- much for having thought of sending me the account of the accident to your dear babe.<a name=401:1></a> It is indeed a sore trial to see one who is a part of ourselves thus taken off at one blow, and unexpectedly.<a name=401:2></a> Still, what a difference, to have the Lord's love to look to, and to believe one's babe -- as I surely do -- the object of it.<a name=401:3></a> It is a consolation which changes everything, because everything is changed.<a name=401:4></a> The knowledge of the love of God, which is come into this place of death, has brightened with the most blessed rays all its darkness; and the darkness even only serves to shew what a comfort it is to have such a light.<a name=401:5></a> There is nothing in the heart but light: nothing can make darkness when we have it.<a name=401:6></a> It is a world of sorrow; and the longer we know it, and the nearer even we walk to the Lord, the better we shall know it to be such.<a name=401:7></a> I do not mean that none of our sorrows are chastenings: we know that they often are such to His most beloved ones, as we see in Job.<a name=401:8></a> By all, save Christ, there is all grace to be learned by them; and even He entered into the sorrows of others, as arising from their faults and foolishness; for His sympathies were perfect, and, blessed be God, they are.<a name=401:9></a>

		He suffered for righteousness, and He suffered for sin; but, besides this, He entered, as taking by grace a place among the godly remnant in Israel, into all which that remnant would feel as seeing the state of Israel (of which they were actually part) under the chastening hand of God for sin.<a name=401:10></a> All this He felt as none else could feel.<a name=401:11></a> His sympathy is as perfect now, though no longer passing through the sorrows by which He gained the experience of it.<a name=401:12></a> Besides, it is only in the part which has to be broken and corrected that we suffer; a touched affection, when Christ is with us in the grief, is of infinite sweetness, though the sweetness of sorrow.<a name=401:13></a> It is only when the will mixes itself up with the sorrow that there is any bitterness in it, or pain in which Christ is not.<a name=401:14></a> But then this is all useful and what we need.<a name=401:15></a> The Lord takes your dear babe to heaven (certainly he has no loss): what is the rest of

		God's dealings in it with us -- with one's heart?<a name=402:1></a> He who has made a mother's feelings knows what they are -- knows what He has wounded, and knows why -- has a purpose of love in it.<a name=402:2></a> There is a mass of things in the sincerest of us of which we are not aware, which are not brought into subjection to God, which work and shew themselves unsuspected.<a name=402:3></a> God breaks in upon us; how many things He shews -- how many cords He cuts at one blow!<a name=402:4></a> A whole system of affections is touched: we feel that death has its place and part in them.<a name=402:5></a> I never saw a family the same thing after the first death that it was before.<a name=402:6></a> There was a breach in the circle.<a name=402:7></a> What belonged to the whole body of affections and life of this world was touched, was found to be -- mortal: it was struck in its very nature.<a name=402:8></a> The course of life went on; the wave had closed over that which had been cast into it; but death, and the affections which belong to this world, had been found to meet.<a name=402:9></a> But all this is well; for death is come in.<a name=402:10></a> Besides we live in these things; our will lives in them; and when the will is broken, so far as it is so, it is broken for everything.<a name=402:11></a> We learn much more to lean on what never breaks -- not to lose our affections, but to have them more in connection with Christ, less with this will of our own nature; for nature must now die as well as sin.<a name=402:12></a> But then Christ never makes a breach, except to come in and connect the soul and heart more with Himself; and it is worth all the sorrow that ever was, and more, to learn the least atom more of His love and of Himself; and there is nothing like that, nothing like Him; and it lasts.<a name=402:13></a>

		But, besides, there is a useful work by it in our own hearts; and so more capacity to know, and enjoy, and learn communion with, Him; more capacity to delight in and understand God; to know, and to know the value of, what He delights in; more moral capacity to delight in what is excellent.<a name=402:14></a> We little know what high and blessed things we are called to.<a name=402:15></a> Oh that the saints knew it better!<a name=402:16></a> to be with, and have common joy and communion with, God!<a name=402:17></a>
