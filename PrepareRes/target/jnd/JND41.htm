		THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		@JOHN 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not the offices of the Lord that the Gospel of John so much unfolds, but His Sonship of the Father, and of man associated with that which He really was.<a name=1:1></a> The Word was with God, and was God.<a name=1:2></a> All the historical matter is ministration of the exhibition of this great, leading, central truth, the hinge of heaven and earth as its centre in truth and dispensation.<a name=1:3></a> For I must add here, also, that the association of our Lord with the Jews as the dispensed form and purposed revelation of this character is also, in its place, brought in here, with all the development of truth of which prophecy gives the formal accomplishment or display.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter accordingly presents us, as a sort of introduction, so to speak, with the Person of Jesus, in its existence, incarnation, and all the various relationships in which it stood to God and man, centring in its revelation to us (the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, declaring Him), adding the form and character of the dispensation.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there not something in the frame of John's spirit, and his communion with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, which peculiarly fitted him to tarry, as said the Lord Christ, till He came?<a name=1:6></a> And may we not learn what peculiarly holds its ground against the subtlety of disorganising heresy and antinomianism (which separate from the love and communion of God) from the exhibition we have of the mind that was in him?<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 1 - 3.<a name=1:8></a> There would seem to be more meaning in <i>pros ton Theon</i> ("with God") than merely <i>apud</i> (<i>nigh</i>), expressed by <i>para Theo</i>.<a name=1:9></a> I know of no case of <i>pros ton</i> being used merely in this sense.<a name=1:10></a> The most analogous passage is "that eternal life, which was with the Father," but there is <i>ending in</i> included in this word <i>pros</i>, and communicative association.<a name=1:11></a> It stood there in the presence of, and associated (vitally) with God.<a name=1:12></a> Also "in the beginning" means in existence prior to time; we find Him in essential, eternal existence.<a name=1:13></a> Everything else had a beginning, a cause commencing it, but He "was in the beginning.<a name=1:14></a>" Therefore it is said, "The devil sinneth <i>from</i>," not <i>in</i>, "the beginning.<a name=1:15></a>" The comment on <i>Theos</i> (God) here is idle, and proves only the ignorance of the commentators.<a name=1:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Every affirmation of nature or quality concerning an object is without the article, and the object or subject matter affirmed of with it.<a name=2:1></a> Had it been <i>ho Theos</i>, it would have made <i>ho Logos</i> (the Word) exclusively God, and denied the Deity of the Father and the Spirit.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here, also, the most solemn statement, as of the eternal existence, so of the personality of the Word.<a name=2:3></a> He was the Mediator of creation as well as redemption.<a name=2:4></a> God could do nothing towards the creature but by mediation.<a name=2:5></a> And there was another reason, and that was, that the whole scheme was to manifest the Son, and in and through Him the other two Persons; and therefore all things were created by Him and for Him (to the end of verse 3).<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 4, 5.<a name=2:7></a> Then we have the full development of Him concerning whom these things were, and who was revealed in them.<a name=2:8></a> Then what He was amongst men (for "as in Adam, so in Christ"; for this Sonship was above the dispensation of Judaism, and so this gospel presents Him).<a name=2:9></a> He was "in the beginning" (<i>en arkee</i>).<a name=2:10></a> And now in man was death and knowledge entered into the world by sin; but knowledge without the power of truth is darkness and confusion.<a name=2:11></a> But the Lord was the power of knowledge in all those things as to which knowledge had come in.<a name=2:12></a> "In him was life," not merely here as manifested, but to be manifested, as compare <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:2">1 John  1:2</a>.<a name=2:13></a> Light was the perfect rectitude of divine conversation in which this life, being of power, formed and exhibited itself through all that was scattered in darkness and confusion in the knowledge of that which had not the power.<a name=2:14></a> Therefore, "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<a name=2:15></a>" So, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=2:16></a>" The life, that which was in the Son Himself, therefore was the light of men.<a name=2:17></a> He was, therefore, antecedent to all dispensation, morally as well as actually the light of men, such as they were.<a name=2:18></a> But there was another point, their intelligence of this light; hence another truth: "The light appears in darkness," for in light, so to speak, there is no appearance of light, "and the darkness" (now the fact) "comprehended it not.<a name=2:19></a>" Hence the whole need of dispensation, and the ground of specialty of grace; I do not say <i>the cause</i>.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 6.<a name=2:21></a> There was a man who had a mission from God whose name was John.<a name=2:22></a> He came not <i>to be</i> but "<i>for</i> a witness

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		concerning the light, that all might believe.<a name=3:1></a>" Hence John's mission, though of dispensation in its exercise, in one sense was universal in its character, or rather subject.<a name=3:2></a> Repentance is light in darkness, or darkness seeing the light.<a name=3:3></a> But still, in its exercise, it was confined, but "That was the true light which, coming into the world, lighteth every man.<a name=3:4></a>" Such was the character of Christ's (the Word's) manifestation.<a name=3:5></a> So, therefore, it was "in the world.<a name=3:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the personal facts, for the moral is here brought into fact, as drawn from fact before, "In the beginning.<a name=3:7></a>" The divisions of subjects are: verses 1 - 5, original truths; verses 5 - 14, display of them abstractly considered in dispensations; verse 14, the truths resumed in the actuality of dispensation.<a name=3:8></a> Though I think the Persons are implied, yet the expression is, I think, characteristic: <i>hos monogenous para patros</i> (as of an only begotten with a father).<a name=3:9></a> We might translate it in English, conveying these two things: "as firstborn with his father.<a name=3:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 7.<a name=3:11></a> Note also an omitted circumstance, that no testimony was competent, that is, because of man's darkness, to lead or influence the human soul, for there was not only light but testimony concerning the light, see chapter 5: 32, and following verses.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 10.<a name=3:13></a> Most wonderful sentence!<a name=3:14></a> Yet the simple history of the whole matter, and when we consider the statement of His character which went before, what do we learn of the world!<a name=3:15></a> But all was divided between these two: "He was in the world" (let the world remember it, the world which "was made by him," for we have it here not in abstract but in fact), and "the world knew him not.<a name=3:16></a>" It was pitch darkness, and the light of God gained no entrance, found no single chord of response which could know that it was light; but farther dispensations had been arranged by which, as entering in by the door in a way appointed of God, owned of them, every tie of personal interest should be awakened and fulfilled.<a name=3:17></a> "He came unto his own," for our Lord was the Son of David and King born of the Jews, and "His own received him not," adding rebellion and folly.<a name=3:18></a> The light that was in them was darkness, and how great therefore was it!<a name=3:19></a> "But as many": it is general, but applies specifically to the Jews.<a name=3:20></a> Here we find the characteristic fruit of the mission in grace from His office.<a name=3:21></a> "As many as received him, to them gave he right to be children

		of God.<a name=4:1></a>" It was the position and title in which He placed them.<a name=4:2></a> Thus called from the darkness, He gave them authority to be and walk in this character, what none ever had before, for even Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, but now He "as Son over his house" (but the time of that is simply the millennial day).<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 12, 13.<a name=4:4></a> This word <i>tekna Theou</i> (children of God) is John's delight, and is of vast importance.<a name=4:5></a> See <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>, and following verses; compare also <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>, 16, 17.<a name=4:6></a> "Children" (<i>tekna</i>) is, I take it, the family name towards God; sons (<i>huioi</i>) the prescriptive character in which we stand to the world.<a name=4:7></a> This speaks, then, of the familiar blessedness of their relation towards God, not their dignity merely toward man; and in truth they were born, they did really derive their life from God; it was by no act towards Him.<a name=4:8></a> "Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<a name=4:9></a>" So Peter.<a name=4:10></a> There is much contained in this assertion.<a name=4:11></a> Here, then, we have the whole result of the manifestation of the Word simply considered in its efficiency as of God, as before of its independent existence, and the result of its outward manifestation.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 14.<a name=4:13></a> Here we come to the whole method and order of this glorious blessing and truth.<a name=4:14></a> Having spoken of those as made sons of God, he now speaks of the great root and source of sonship, Christ come in the flesh; for here we have it not as of light merely, and therefore damnatory of darkness, but what it was, and now in fulness of communicated grace to those who received Him, who were made partakers of the same sonship, "sometimes darkness, but now light in the Lord.<a name=4:15></a>"

		This was from the will of God; before, what He was in Himself, and as representing God in character; now what He was in grace, replenishing human nature with His fulness as Son of God, and making others partakers in the same: "The Word became flesh.<a name=4:16></a>" As the other was the essential character, so this is the revelation of the <i>mesne</i>; yet also the way of glory, for "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father also.<a name=4:17></a>" Christ is the consummation of glory, but it is the Father's glory, while it is His therefore as "an only begotten with a father" ("with" used as we saw it before).<a name=4:18></a> Here He is not known; His manifestation, His dwelling among us, was the question; but this is <i>what</i> the glory <i>was</i>.<a name=4:19></a> Further, I note this is as manifested, that is, as man, for He was manifested in the flesh.<a name=4:20></a> Nor do I

		-- 15.<a name=5:5></a> In that which was now necessary, then, to be declared, lest by humiliation that which was to be declared might be concealed, we have the great harbinger of the light at once brought forward to testify, "This is he of whom I said," etc.<a name=5:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 16, 17.<a name=5:7></a> For indeed it is out of His fulness we have all received (these the words of the second John commenting on the force of the statement of the former, connected with his own to which that bore testimony) and that not vaguely, or as grace commonly understood, but by being the fulness available in man, and exhibiting itself according to the purpose of God in all the circumstances in which the Son of God was to be placed, we adopted (and as Firstborn, and Only Begotten, having it in Himself, for "all fulness was pleased to dwell in him") into unity with Him.<a name=5:8></a> "Grace upon grace," grace corresponding to every grace in Him, for it is His grace in a man, and ours in Him by union into it; for the law was given as a transferable thing to those who received, or to whom it was made known by Moses.<a name=5:9></a> But grace and truth were by Jesus Christ, or the Anointed.<a name=5:10></a>

		-- 18.<a name=5:11></a> In connection with this, and in superiority over the law, which was indeed the perfect testimony of His will in testimony in law, there is another thing: "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son," the subject now in treatment, "who is in the bosom of the Father," that is His place, "He hath declared him.<a name=5:12></a>" The Word, then, was made

		<a class="footnote" name="#5:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>I read this over, fearing lest there might in human expressions be any colour for that approach to Sabellianism which is not uncommon in connection with the term Son, which I believe to destroy the basis of all truth, but if taken simply it is free from this danger (I hate the heresy, and would guard against the fibre of its roots), and I think takes the truth out of the hands of the heretics Still the manifestation of Him is as "an only begotten with a father"; and what is still stronger as to the fact, "the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" The confusion is in not seeing He is Son in creation as well as in redemption, and the order of both, and that He redeemed as Son what He created as Son.

		flesh; that is the declaration of the fact by the Spirit.<a name=6:1></a> Then we have the aspect of faith concerning this, and the testimony of John (that is, the Spirit as residing in him) concerning it as the height of the Jewish dispensation, for indeed in principle he was the restorer of all things.<a name=6:2></a> We have then faith so apprehending and declaring Him, capacity to understand what the experience of the apostle, in the power and testimony of the Holy Ghost, declares of His fulness, for here was the grand difference of the dispensation.<a name=6:3></a> But further, this was the declaration.<a name=6:4></a> What?<a name=6:5></a> That of which we have received portion -- blessed be God!<a name=6:6></a> -- of God, even the Father.<a name=6:7></a> "Lord," said one, "shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.<a name=6:8></a>" This, then, in all its fulness, thus fully spoken of, He is, as become flesh, and so revealed to faith, the only begotten Son; therefore so the apostle speaks in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:16">Ephesians  3:16</a> - 19, etc.<a name=6:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 19.<a name=6:10></a> We have now the testimony of John, and that associated in matter with what we have before had of the Lord, but therein the discovery of the place he held towards Christ and Israel; for in giving honour to Jesus he manifested his own place.<a name=6:11></a> Christ was to come among the Jews, and here testified to as the Lord amongst them.<a name=6:12></a> He answers their expectations: Christ, the Prophet, that is, like to Moses or Elias.<a name=6:13></a> If a person has a direct office from God, it may be as much a matter of faithfulness to affirm what he is (and a test of truth, too, for he commits himself to God's making good his assertion) as to disavow what he is not.<a name=6:14></a> He acts, not for or from himself, but from God, in obedience.<a name=6:15></a>

		We have here the first assertion made good in the circumstances.<a name=6:16></a> "He was not that light, but came to bear witness of the light," and, "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not"; and the incipient development of "His own received him not.<a name=6:17></a>" This addressed to the Jews; testimony to them of John's ministry among them, and of the Lord in that.<a name=6:18></a>

		the outgoings of the Spirit in him.<a name=7:1></a> So we see it in the Psalms.<a name=7:2></a> It is a recognition of Him as such, not properly a testimony.<a name=7:3></a> Verse 32 is the testimony on which this is founded, but it is still the prophetic Spirit.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 29.<a name=7:5></a> Here is John's prophetic testimony to Him generally, identifying the Person all through these testimonies as the One who "was before me.<a name=7:6></a>" His specific office he states in verse 31.<a name=7:7></a> Personally, he did not know Him.<a name=7:8></a> He was pointed out prophetically to him, and by him; and so he spake; but there was no difference in this in John from the rest.<a name=7:9></a> We see the difference of the prophetic Spirit and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and how the least also in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he, though "of those born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John Baptist.<a name=7:10></a>" Observe here also the prophetic testimony reaches out to His generic character: "Who taketh away the sin of the world.<a name=7:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 32.<a name=7:12></a> We have another definite testimony to a distinct point -- the Sonship of Jesus; and this by the testimony given of all adopted sons; also the Spirit of God sent down upon them: "Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus"; and, "Because ye <i>are</i> sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts.<a name=7:13></a>" So because He was the beloved Son (we also loved as He) the Spirit was sent upon Him, token to John that He was so.<a name=7:14></a> Here we see the importance of seeing His <i>Sonship</i> in the flesh.<a name=7:15></a> If we look at it simply in His divinity all this is lost, and our interest and union in it, though it be also by our being made partakers of the divine nature that we have indeed this portion and union which He had by virtue of being such.<a name=7:16></a> Dispensatorily I believe also the Sonship was associated with the Jewish people, for "Israel is my first-born," and, "I have called my Son out of Egypt"; but as "Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world" we know that Gentiles are brought in to be fellow-heirs by the gospel, and receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.<a name=7:17></a> In this we have the two great characteristic testimonies as to the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=7:18></a> First (though "He was before me," the same Person here testified of), "The Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world," subject and passive as come in the flesh on account of sin, His work in the flesh; as in Person the Displayer of the Father's glory.<a name=7:19></a> This is Jesus.<a name=7:20></a> Secondly, as actively, and constituted, the Baptiser with the Holy Ghost, manifested the Son of God, not only by the testimony of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 19 to 34 therefore we have the testimony of the prophetic messenger to the Jews on requisition officially, and the open testimony to those that had ears to hear, upon seeing Him coming, as drawn out by that which He was in Himself (blessed be His name!<a name=8:2></a>) as come in the flesh.<a name=8:3></a> Happy he who could say, though even but prophetically, yet faithfully: "I have seen, and bear witness, that this is the Son of God"!<a name=8:4></a> This his joy was fulfilled.<a name=8:5></a> May we not say, though most unworthy and infinitely less faithful, Happier yet they who have His words: "That your joy may be full"?<a name=8:6></a> The same Spirit in measure that He had, branches of the vine, knowing Him reconciling the world, yet what return of faithfulness and love?<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 35.<a name=8:8></a> Here again we have the apprehension of John, that is, the Spirit drawn out by seeing Jesus.<a name=8:9></a> It is not so properly a testimony publicly as the pouring forth the mind of the Spirit as acted upon by the manifestation of Jesus, which all, from the Father downwards, unite, taught of God in one common fulness (and to us unspeakableness of delight), to recognise and delight in.<a name=8:10></a> The Spirit must, so to speak, relieve itself of its testimony.<a name=8:11></a> It is too its office.<a name=8:12></a>

		sought to abide with Him, at least to know where He abode.<a name=9:1></a> But He tells not only, but says, "Come and see.<a name=9:2></a>" The whole circumstances of the scene are full of interest.<a name=9:3></a> Here is the testimony which the ministry of repentance must always bear: "Behold the Lamb of God!<a name=9:4></a>" Repentance dwells ever in the wilderness, but in the leadings of God Jesus is manifested to it, and it owns Jesus the Lamb of God, and the abode of the disciple of repentance is with Him.<a name=9:5></a> Yet there is an actual simplicity in the whole which is very remarkable, for these were the first disciples that were led to Jesus.<a name=9:6></a> This "What seek ye?<a name=9:7></a>" marks no haughtiness, as it were, of purpose in our Lord's first presenting Himself, though conscious willingness to receive to Himself, for the Spirit now dwelt in Him fully as manifested to office; and we have noticed a manifested development of progress in relationship towards the existing body, His opposition to whom was drawn out by their manifested enmity against the grace and truth of which He was the real depositary.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This progress is peculiarly exhibited in this Gospel of John.<a name=9:9></a> Its simple and unassuming opening is here stated, though its full manifestation in the uprising of the authority of His mind is exhibited in all the gospels, as detailed in facts conversant about the closing of the Lord's ministry with and amongst them; and their deliberate enmity accordingly is marked, and so shown in this gospel, progressively, and the results apparently strange; for, after all, whatever was due, and so owned of God and Himself too, the place of His willing acquiescence, though fully felt trial and strangeness, was in fact to yield then to the evil opposed, it was (but into this, save that it was for His glorious triumph, and the letting in of rich blessings, we cannot enter) "their" -- oh!<a name=9:10></a> a strange word!<a name=9:11></a> -- "hour, and power of darkness.<a name=9:12></a>" But, I say, the humbleness of purpose, the unsectarian spirit (though I dread the abuse that may be made of this word) in which our holy, patient, Servant-Lord undertook the work, or fell, as it were, into it, His acts were as of necessity imposed.<a name=9:13></a> I speak of this as manifested for our example.<a name=9:14></a> Oh, that we may be kept always in some measure, at the least, in the meekness of the same spirit!<a name=9:15></a> Oh!<a name=9:16></a> teach Thy servant, Lord, always to be the least, and the last, serving Thee only in boldness, and valuing the secret of Thy love in the everlasting sight of the Father's love above all, all the nothingness valuable only as Thy service.<a name=9:17></a> Keep Thy servant to this!<a name=9:18></a>

		There is this very important principle in the Gospel of John not, I think, noticed; and that is, that it takes up the existence of the Word as God, and draws dispensation (and union of glory for the Church) from this; giving, though coming after, preferred before, for it was before even the creation, and the source, therefore, even of its blessing.<a name=12:1></a> "In the beginning God created.<a name=12:2></a>" Of that creation Judaism was the highest dispensed form, if good could have been in the creature.<a name=12:3></a> And they had therefore the sabbaths given to them as sign of covenant.<a name=12:4></a> But the creation was spoiled by sin, by man; nor could man enter in any way thus into the rest of God.<a name=12:5></a> But here it is brought that even when and therefore antecedent to creation itself, "In the beginning was the Word," was One existing who was God, the source and power and substance of dispensation, not depending on, though bringing in, creation; but, hanging on union with the Creator, the dispensation of this by the incarnation (amongst the Jews, yet paramount to it all) is what John's gospel brings forth and develops.<a name=12:6></a> This gives it its amazing importance.<a name=12:7></a> Hence our hope is in resurrection, our rest in union by it, paramount to creation and creation-rest.<a name=12:8></a> Union is the secret of it all.<a name=12:9></a>

		All the Spirit's mind, the mind of Christ, the wisdom of God, is revealed now in the Scriptures, Jesus Christ being the great Key; for till He was glorified, and set in His place, it could not be so done, "for the Holy Ghost was not yet, for Jesus was not yet glorified," and God never gives the Spirit by measure.<a name=38:7></a> He gives <i>it</i> now.<a name=38:8></a> This could not be till Jesus was, because He was the One, the Man, in whom it was all to be, the appointed One, as He saith, "Behold my Servant, whom I have chosen, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him; he shall shew forth," etc.<a name=38:9></a> Men of old were indeed moved by the Holy Ghost; the Spirit of Christ which was in them did testify beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glory which should follow; but He, the Son, on whom it was to descend because He was the Son, the Man of God's good pleasure, and all fulness of blessing and of communion be restored between heaven and upon earth, was not as yet come, and the Spirit could not be given.<a name=38:10></a> The authority of Sonship did not exist, the title of inheritance did not exist, save abstractedly in Christ; the inheritance was not acquired; there was no man in heaven to whom the Father had given, no Son on earth sustaining the deposit which was witness of the glory to be believed.<a name=38:11></a> But when Jesus, the Man of God's love, appeared, then the Spirit was given, the Person

		Having come, then, to this great point, that God giveth not the Spirit by measure to His Son, we have another immense and hitherto unopened truth: "<i>The Father</i>" (for such Jesus manifested, being the Son whom God loved, proved by the Spirit given fully), "The Father loveth the Son.<a name=39:3></a>" This is the blessed and glorious truth which shines upon and crowns the whole, the great crowning and all-comprehensive discovery in Christ, the essence of revelation; as one said indeed, "Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.<a name=39:4></a>" But He not only showeth us this, but that He loveth the Son, and this also through all the humiliation; and, further, we know by the Spirit He hath given all things into His hand; therefore "he that believeth on the Son <i>hath</i> everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son," not obeying Him to whom the Father hath given all things, "shall not see life, but the wrath" (not of the Father, there is no wrath there, not an atom, perfect fulness of blessing, of love; He is Father, always Father, and nothing but Father in love and perfectness, "the Father loves the Son" but) "of God.<a name=39:5></a>" He is not recognised in the Son, nor is a son.<a name=39:6></a> The contrary is disobedience to Him whom the Father honours in the place of a Son, giving all things into His hand.<a name=39:7></a> He is not in the relationship of a son; he is not therefore before the Father, as it were; but besides, he actually disobeys Him on whom the Father has conferred, and in whom the Father claims, all honour.<a name=39:8></a> "The wrath of God abideth on him"; for whenever a sinner meets God, wrath must be on him, for he is by nature the child of wrath.<a name=39:9></a> God so loved that He gave His only begotten Son.<a name=39:10></a> Whoever therefore meets Him in Him meets perfect love, and finds God his Father.<a name=39:11></a> Nor is it right to say God is reconciled, for He meets the world in

	<div class="paragraph">
		When the incarnation of the Word is introduced, then this John bears witness that He who came after him was before him; as Man, succeeds, but, as the Word, as God, was before him.<a name=45:10></a> When the Jewish enquiry is presented, then he is not the Christ, but sent before <i>the Lord</i>, according to the prophecies.<a name=45:11></a> Herein he says He whom Israel knew not amongst them came after, but was preferred before him.<a name=45:12></a> He was not worthy to unloose His shoe-latchets.<a name=45:13></a> In this last it is not pre-existence and subsequency, but excellency; entirely superior, though succeeding or coming after.<a name=45:14></a> This really was the place of testimony to Messiahship; but it is to the Lord.<a name=45:15></a> He is sent before the face of the Lord, and excellency beyond Comparison as to John himself, such as He was here.<a name=45:16></a>

		Next we have testimony to the functions of Jesus as Saviour, and in the Church, connected with His Person and nature: Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world; a Man coming after, but preferred before, John, because He was before; that is, Man, excellency, and pre-existence; also Son of God; and, finally, baptiser with the Holy Ghost.<a name=45:17></a>

		Having seen their general circumstances and its position, we may notice the truths conveyed in this most interesting account, worthy of all our attention.<a name=48:1></a> The interview with Nicodemus showed the necessity that Jews, children of the kingdom, should be born again.<a name=48:2></a> Here we have developed, as a gift communicable to the desirer of it, if there were such, the grace of God, and the Person of Jesus opening the door, and breaking down the distinction there was between a Jew and a woman of Samaria.<a name=48:3></a> It is on the whole, then, a testimony to Christ as the Giver of the Spirit, and that contrasted with the temporal blessings and associations of the Jacob of old, and the displacing the distinction, to this extent, of the Jew and the Samaritan.<a name=48:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, then, we have noticed the grace of God, the great principle of the gift, the dispensation of gift.<a name=48:5></a> The next point is the Person of Jesus: If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is who in this state of humiliation asking of you a Samaritan for water to drink, thou wouldst have asked, and He would have given.<a name=48:6></a> The freeness of the gift asked for is stated freely, and the result of such knowledge; but this all depends on the knowledge that God was giving, and what understanding the gift and of the Person and glory of Jesus in His humiliation.<a name=48:7></a> But these were spiritual things.<a name=48:8></a> They supposed a spiritual person.<a name=48:9></a> The natural man understood them not: "Thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.<a name=48:10></a>" She was thus shown ignorant of the gift, and of the Person of Jesus.<a name=48:11></a> "Art thou greater," etc.<a name=48:12></a>, than he who did all these things for us?<a name=48:13></a> It was needful, however, that the total alienation of the mind from spiritual things should be shown.<a name=48:14></a> The woman was not opposed to listen, and the Lord would explain what He meant as to the nature of the thing, but it exhibited her incapacity to understand this also: "Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.<a name=48:15></a>" She was simple and absorbed, that which was her sorrow, but all darkness as to the spiritual things.<a name=48:16></a> Such is the exhibition of the nature of this gift, and the capacity of the natural man to receive it.<a name=48:17></a> He stumbles at the first word.<a name=48:18></a>

		There was something very affecting in our Lord's alluding to the request He was constrained to make.<a name=48:19></a> I am persuaded He saw this woman's mind was not closed, dark as it was; at any rate, even such a reception was in a measure new to the

		In the next place we must remark that this living water is no influence from without producing results in the soil over which it flows.<a name=49:3></a> It is something given; the gift of God given to the person asking, given consequent upon the knowledge of Jesus, and bestowed by Him on request, as of God, flowing out of that knowledge: "If thou hadst known," etc.<a name=49:4></a> As to this we have spoken before on <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, and the case of our Lord Himself, and other passages.<a name=49:5></a> The next thing is it is positively given to the person.<a name=49:6></a> It is not merely a draught of something by virtue of those influences, but in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=49:7></a> This in the man is a constant indwelling spring, flowing into eternal life.<a name=49:8></a> Next I would also remark it is here spoken of the great general truth as personally indwelling for the hope of eternal life, its substantial witness of inheritance, not collaterally as conferred, as the instrument of power for the purposes of the manifestation of Jesus.<a name=49:9></a> The simple freeness of it is markedly shown ("Ye have received gratuitously, give gratuitously"); and as to the receiver, If thou knewest, thou wouldst have asked, and He would have given.<a name=49:10></a> Knowledge of Jesus, itself the gift of God, is the only circumstance, and He is the giver.<a name=49:11></a> The freeness of the gospel is here distinctly stated, put in its order of God.<a name=49:12></a>

		We have seen the character of the gift of the Spirit by Jesus, and its freedom, and the utter and absolute incapacity of the natural man, though hearing the words, to understand the nature, or anything, of spiritual things, or Jesus by whom they are given.<a name=49:13></a> "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well?<a name=49:14></a>" "Sir, give me this water.<a name=49:15></a>" But the Spirit of God hath another method by which, in the name of Jesus, it as Jesus takes up man where he is, and acts upon the conscience.<a name=49:16></a> We speak not of it now as indwelling as the water of life, but as acting in conviction by opening the conscience to itself.<a name=49:17></a> Nothing more simple in its power, where the discerning eye of God, to whom all is open and unconcealed, awakes by touching on the spring of its actual state, the consciousness of where it is (and such is the constant experience under the preaching of the word): "Go, call thy husband.<a name=49:18></a>" You will observe that it is by stating the order of God, what would have blessing if it had been, that the consciousness of her state

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 18, though here explicitly given, because Jesus was He who was to be actually made known to her by it, is the work of the Spirit in every such case.<a name=50:2></a> It brings to light all our ways, and that with consciousness not only of them but of the light into which they are brought, that Jesus is there, by which we are made conscious of them.<a name=50:3></a> "Thou hast set my secret sins in the light of thy countenance.<a name=50:4></a>" Conscience, real conscience, is exercised in the recognition of God, who has thus opened the heart as light in it, for that which maketh everything manifest is light, and Christ the Life is the Light of men, and this He is by His Spirit now.<a name=50:5></a> It does so responsibly now towards all, for "their sound went into all the earth" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:18">Romans  10:18</a>), effectually in the consciousness of those whom it awakens to find itself in the light.<a name=50:6></a> Whenever conscience as of God can be acted on, then the gospel has a way, and hypothetically that is man.<a name=50:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		God has broken in: "I perceive that thou art a prophet.<a name=50:8></a> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say," etc.<a name=50:9></a> But this passage serves here as a great development of the order of God's dealings, as we have seen.<a name=50:10></a> It was in her mind a question between Jerusalem and Samaria, upon indeed the ordinary plea of all false worship, "Our fathers worshipped.<a name=50:11></a>" On the other hand, it was merely a "Ye say <i>we ought</i>.<a name=50:12></a>" A convinced conscience enquired of Him as a prophet.<a name=50:13></a> The Lord answered her as a point He felt near His heart as come, the Son's word from God: "<i>Woman, believe me</i>, the hour cometh" (He doth not as yet say "is come") "when neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, ye shall worship <i>the Father</i>.<a name=50:14></a>"

		I can conceive nothing more blessed than this verse as coming from the Son of His love, sent into the world.<a name=51:13></a> At the moment, the state of Samaria and Jerusalem, the people of His love, was just brought before Him.<a name=51:14></a> It was manifestly the outgoing of His mind (though written for our learning and the very truth of the mind of the Spirit from God; yea, so to speak, specially, and so it must when His mind came forth, for He spake the words of God), both here and from His conversation with His apostles.<a name=51:15></a> It was a mind full of pain indeed, and as is ever the case when the mind is full of felt sorrow for the present state of things in those nominally associated with God, having the prospect of larger purposes of God's love (for He knew God) opening out before it.<a name=51:16></a> There is sorrow in that word, mixed as it is with blessing: "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<a name=51:17></a>" It was perfectness, and perfect obedience in consciousness, which is true happiness; yet it was of that which was written: "Then have I laboured in vain, and spent my strength far nought; yet my work is with the Lord, and my

		There is peculiar depth to me in the union of these two words, "Woman, believe me," and "the Father seeketh such to worship him.<a name=52:3></a>" There was a throwing Himself upon His Father, and a consciousness of the sympathy of the Father with Him in the spirit of His work which is full, full of what saints alone know, and angels desire to look into.<a name=52:4></a> But the universality of the Father's character required always such worship.<a name=52:5></a> The Father seeketh such worshippers.<a name=52:6></a> But God <i>is</i> a Spirit, and they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth; they must so from His nature; they do not worship <i>Him</i> insofar as they do not.<a name=52:7></a>

		As we have seen the free gift of the Spirit, the total incapacity of man to apprehend anything about it, the method which God uses then to bring the soul into the knowledge of Jesus, through whom the Spirit is received, by bringing intelligence into the conscience, so we find here the effect at once in taking the mind off the things which filled it up, and hid it from the capacity of receiving anything, and that by the value of Jesus, knowing who it was that <i>spake</i> to it.<a name=52:18></a> The woman's whole engagement had been her water-pot; beyond that it went not; a more sensible and real thing than that which fills the mind of most.<a name=52:19></a> But it was now forgotten, or despised.<a name=52:20></a> She left her water-pot, and went into the city, filled with the thoughts of

		The freedom of the Spirit finds its way most readily, and only (for it goes into a sinful world), in a heart where the conscience is most readily brought into humiliation and conviction (and so brought to Jesus, through whom the Spirit alone is received, and who must be known in order to its being received, and is thus known by opening the heart to itself, and presenting Himself as the convincing object of a heart which finds its resource therefore in Him, and thereon the testimony of who He is).<a name=53:4></a> <i>A priori</i>, therefore, in the free gift of this Spirit of life the poor sinner is the most in the way of the kingdom, for the natural man receiveth nothing of it at all, and such a one has little to oppose to the light in the conscience when God pleases to shine in.<a name=53:5></a> Accordingly this poor degraded woman (for most degraded she was) was chosen of God (amongst the most-rejected of men by those who had the Law and the promises) as the object in and through whom the revelation of the way and power of the Spirit of life should be made known to the world.<a name=53:6></a>

		The angelical ministration of the Jews, and all that required the exertion of man, failed as a remedy for evil when there was real destitution and need, what required it most and called out most compassion.<a name=62:4></a> It came to "I have not," for he was "under his infirmity.<a name=62:5></a>" The Lord knew this, He had compassion, He felt for such.<a name=62:6></a> The point only He puts is, "Wouldest thou become well?<a name=62:7></a>"

		The fact is then mentioned on which hangs the reasoning of our Lord and the Jews on the real position in which things were according to the mind of God.<a name=63:4></a> It was Sabbath on that day; could the law give rest?<a name=63:5></a> The Jews said to the healed man, It is Sabbath, it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.<a name=63:6></a> The reply at once brought the question to issue: He that made me whole bade me do it.<a name=63:7></a> It ought to have brought out the conviction of One present in power of health, acting in and from God.<a name=63:8></a> But the Jews preferred resting in their own ordinances (in which they had found no rest, and had not kept) to recognising <i>the Son</i>, the Heir of all the ordinances.<a name=63:9></a> I observe here that it was not faith in Jesus here, but the exercise of Jesus' power in will, as flowing from Himself.<a name=63:10></a> Therefore it is noted that he did not know Jesus, nor afterwards, till Jesus met him, and spoke to him in the temple.<a name=63:11></a> Therefore Jesus treats him as still under the discipline of the Law: "Behold," take notice of this, "thou <i>art made whole</i>" (it is not, -- Thy faith hath saved thee, or the like); "sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee.<a name=63:12></a>"

		It was then the supreme exercise of Jesus' prerogative on which He founds His argument, as the Son having had compassion on one as it were dead, incapable of anything (or therefore of helping himself under law), and quickening whom He would.<a name=63:13></a> Accordingly the Jews persecuted Jesus.<a name=63:14></a> They set themselves up on the righteousness of that which they had not kept, in enmity against the Son, Jesus the Saviour.<a name=63:15></a> He did these things on Sabbath.<a name=63:16></a> Our Lord's answer embraced the two great points, and at once brought the whole question to an issue.<a name=63:17></a> He was the Son: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<a name=63:18></a>" God had not entered into His rest as a God of love, the Father, but being such must yet work, and in the manifestation and Person of the Son.<a name=63:19></a> The rest of the seventh day was the rest of the creation; and in the law the creation could not find its rest.<a name=63:20></a> God rested from His natural works then and this also the law took up, and witnessed, but it could not accomplish it in man, for sin had entered in the flesh, and weak through the flesh.<a name=63:21></a> If man were to have a share in

		Having stated the great broad principles as it related to the Persons of the Father and the Son, our Lord proceeds to develop its application to men as the objects and subjects of it.<a name=66:8></a> It is as receiving the word of Jesus we are quickened.<a name=66:9></a> "Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth," etc.<a name=66:10></a> Thus we believe Jesus as sent of the Father.<a name=66:11></a> "He that receiveth his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true," etc.<a name=66:12></a> But there is a perception of the Person also herein, as well as the mission.<a name=66:13></a> At least, it is involved in it, though not expressly.<a name=66:14></a> But -- there is a reception of the mission as by the word, and Jesus herein: "He that heareth my word, and <i>believeth on him that sent me</i>," that is, the Father.<a name=66:15></a> However, He here speaks of Himself as the word or speaking, for so He speaks, and thus we hereby know the Father, by the revelation of the Son, and that He is indeed the Son hereby; but I say He here speaks of Himself as speaking the words of God, and this by the anointing of the Holy Ghost, wherefore also as doing it now by the Holy Ghost it is equivalent, which is important to observe; for He does not say, Whosoever believes on Me, the Son, but, "Whosoever hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, hath"; for it is the manner of its operation (as revealing also the Father, the Sender in love and power in Jesus) that the Lord here speaks of, not the Persons acting, for He spoke as Man, though the words were to be believed as God's (and led to believe on Him that sent Him, and therefore Him).<a name=66:16></a> So also He judges as

		The other manner in which the Son's honour is developed has therefore no place or opportunity in him (or indeed it would be, as it were, denying the real power in the former manner); he "does not come into judgment.<a name=67:5></a>" The power has been manifested in another manner in him; he "is passed from death unto life," a life therefore having (being by this faith) fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, with Jesus the Man and the Father that sent Him, but the Man Christ, the Son; as He says, "With his Son <i>Jesus Christ</i>.<a name=67:6></a>" The "judgment" is one thing given to Jesus, and into which those quickened by the Word believed, and believing on Him that sent Him, cannot come; for then He would be judging the Father's children, and, we may add, His own redeemed.<a name=67:7></a>

		This then, while addressed to the Jew, took the broad ground of man in principle, as we have seen elsewhere in this gospel, and took the present testimony as addressed to those amongst whom He was manifested, taking on Him in this even their seed; also, as the object and subject of the testimony, was the life-giving Son, made the Son of <i>Man</i>, and as Man Judge of men; and all that all men should honour the Son, in the largeness of the revelation of the Father, even as they honour the Father.<a name=72:5></a> Nothing can be more distinct than the position of the whole matter.<a name=72:6></a> Moreover, it was the rejection of Jesus as <i>from the Father</i> that was the ground of accusation.<a name=72:7></a> But they received not honour from God only, and therefore He that was from Him, and had His honour, they could not receive.<a name=72:8></a> If one came in his own name, having therefore man's honour, which they recognised and loved, him they would receive.<a name=72:9></a> This is a deep, important principle morally, and grows into the corruption of the Church; for God's gifts are the occasion of man's honour; and if this be at all recognised, the spirit, motive, and therefore, necessarily, character of service is lost.<a name=72:10></a>

		It is the full picture, before the Lord shows the character in which He was to be intermediately received, of the historical dealing with the Remnant, who, as He refused to be King then for the madness of the people, were left alone by Him, to be rejoined when He would bring them to land.<a name=76:2></a> It embraces the two epochs when He had to say to the Jewish Remnant: His desertion, so to speak, and rejoining of them, and the consequence.<a name=76:3></a> Then comes, connected with the subject, in which the beams of His royalty, or estate as royal, actually shine forth, the development of His intermediate position as rejected, and the true reason and moral force of it.<a name=76:4></a> For His royalty was not to be exercised merely in abstract external power over the Jews, lifeless, according to the mere carnal notions of their own will, but to be the vivifying sustenance as broken [of those] who receive the blessings of that life-giving power with which His royalty was associated, in which, as Head of the creation, He had life to give; because the Son, who was the rightful Heir of all things, was given also to have life in Himself, of which they must be partakers to be associated with Him (and this could not be but by the vital union of grace), and that as broken for redemption, for an unbroken Saviour could be no sent source of grace: "He that eateth me, even he shall <i>live</i> by me.<a name=76:5></a>" And in the power which He had thus could they alone have the sure mercies of David, which even rested on His resurrection, as we know.<a name=76:6></a> Thus is the full, large link of His royalty (actual over the Jews), connected with the Sonship of inheritance, and associated with the Second Adamship of quickening Spirit, by which the largeness of that character brings into redeeming union by His death, fully closed round and linked together; or rather, the effectual sustenance of redemption, unison in His death, by which any were brought into co-partnership with Him in that glory: "He that eateth me shall even live by me.<a name=76:7></a>" This is a most important association.<a name=76:8></a>

		Observe, further, the fulness of character.<a name=79:3></a> He was not merely Messiah, but "out of heaven, and gives life to the world," the bread of God therefore; though "My Father giveth you"; yet having this power of life intrinsically.<a name=79:4></a> It is therefore (which note) "he that comes," and "he that believes.<a name=79:5></a>" It appears to me that there is a difference between the hungering and thirsting, the coming and believing.<a name=79:6></a> It appears to me that the coming to Him is as in the flesh, the bread, the coming to Him in this character as come in the flesh; seeing Him, God manifest in flesh.<a name=79:7></a> Such shall in nowise hunger.<a name=79:8></a> He that believeth on Him receives of His Spirit, and shall never at any time thirst, as He saith.<a name=79:9></a> We "have all been made to drink into one Spirit," as we know now, after the Spirit is spoken of as water and drink.<a name=79:10></a> It is not that the two things are not associated.<a name=79:11></a> We have seen in chapter 4 that they are immediately so associated; but though associated they may be distinct; and the coming of Jesus in the flesh, and the drinking into the Spirit as from Him so come, are alike primary truths of dispensation; for the Spirit is received from Him as having come in the flesh and been humbled, and therefore now exalted; so He gives the Spirit.<a name=79:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another propriety in this, and that is, it is as believing in Jesus not present that we receive the Spirit, and thirst not, howsoever it be hence the force of that which He speaks in the end of the chapter; for it is not the flesh, but as dead, which is profitable for us, or its death rather: "For he that has died is justified from sin"; "but the Spirit is life because of righteousness"; and hence it was the Gentiles were let in to the full feeding on Christ; for the enmity was in His flesh (wrongly translated, I think, in the English), and neither so was there justification for the believer (sinner), though there have been blessing for the righteous; nor could therefore a Gentile be let in but in this, the way of life; He believed on as dead, and a receiving of the Spirit, he could, and a Jew so come to equal privileges; for the Spirit was, as we have seen, through and after death (therefore "believe"); though

		It was, however, as we have said, matter of faith to come to Him, even as in the flesh, because He was God manifest in the flesh.<a name=80:3></a> Nor could He receive any who did not see the Son.<a name=80:4></a> Therefore He says, "But I have said to you, That ye have also seen me, and do not believe" (compare Thomas afterwards; as Peter, "In whom, though now," <i>not eporntes</i>; so <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1">1 John  1</a>on the other hand; but this applied to Jews).<a name=80:5></a> And then comes the full development of this important doctrine, applicable, as we have said, to Jews, but by the principle of faith, not actually <i>eporntes</i>, for we walk by faith, and not by sight, letting him that believeth in, as our Lord's answer to Thomas above, Himself the point of access or approach; for His word would be such as might be directly and fully applied by the Jews on the spot, and yet declare the result in full blessing, into which we are admitted by faith, but presented as receivable then in Him come in the flesh; for as yet He has not spoken of its breaking, but what He will do for them coming to Him then sent of the Father.<a name=80:6></a>

		of the Father's love (for this gospel is most <i>morally</i> methodical) behind the rejection of Jesus by the body: "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life"; that is, I find it first brought out into operation here as the satisfaction of Christ's soul; so in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>, end; and here, accordingly, the blessing of this is developed, that of those whom the Father had given Him He should lose none.<a name=81:1></a> It would not be left to that nature whose weakness had as such rejected Him, but to the effectual securing in the Son the will of the Father, now to be manifested in blessing of its own authority.<a name=81:2></a>

		The subsequent passage seems to come in to avoid the preclusion of individuals under the unbelief of the body, or man's will exhibited in them.<a name=81:3></a> They might have all been rejected as a body.<a name=81:4></a> This saves the opportunity to every individual (to be formed, indeed, into a new body or fold in Him) who <i>does</i> see the Son, and believes on Him, of all the blessing that [is] in Christ; for this was the will of Him that sent Him; and he would get the blessing, the full blessing, in due time (in God's way; that is, the Father's way), in spite of the rejection of the body; he has everlasting life, and as a son he shall enjoy the blessings of the Father's kingdom; that is, as risen from the dead, for this was part of the Father's will.<a name=81:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hitherto our Lord had only spoken of Himself as come down from heaven, come for blessing; but as the body had seen, and did not believe, blessing in spite of them (for their unbelief had been manifested) for every one who <i>should</i> not be included and precluded by their unbelief, who did believe in or came to Him.<a name=81:6></a> Not yet had He presented the apparent stumbling-block of His being broken; for, as we have said, unbelief is progressively manifested, and the progressive security to believers of blessing (in spite of the unbelief of those [with whom] they might seem associated), by the progressive development of the supremacy of God's ways, still more distances the apathy of unbelief.<a name=81:7></a> Here we may remark, in <i>principle</i> the letting in of Gentiles is provided for, but not as yet brought to might.<a name=81:8></a> But as yet, I say, the Lord has only manifested Himself the bread come down, and he that came to Him, and drank, say, of His doctrine (for His words were spirit and life) should have everlasting life.<a name=81:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This being done, He proceeds to the blessing of believers, not to save the credit of unbelief by not propounding full and blessed truth; nor does He hesitate, on the distinct rejection

		of one truth, to make the matter worse to them by propounding further.<a name=82:1></a> They had shown their unbelief: "Is not this the son of Joseph?<a name=82:2></a>" They were Socinians; they recognised the natural birth; that is, simply, they did not see that He was the Son of God, that He came down from heaven.<a name=82:3></a> He then puts the full principle of their rejection of Him before them: You need not murmur among yourselves; I will tell you the simple truth, says the Lord; ye are reprobate.<a name=82:4></a> "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.<a name=82:5></a>" Death indeed must be the consequence of all this state of things, but "I will raise him up in the last day"; for our Lord has been all through suggesting death as the consequence, and that which intervenes before blessing, in so repeating the raising up.<a name=82:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark that our Lord, when the body as such has rejected Him (as He says, "I <i>said</i> unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not"), as in [the] former chapter, instead of confining Himself to those things which might not seem to hurt or drive them away, on the contrary boldly produces the things which would, while objects of faith to all, draw out of the body those who had ears to hear; because He came to do His Father's will, and boldly avows the principle that they cannot come to Him unless the Father which had sent Him draw them.<a name=82:7></a> And this is a leading moral point in this chapter, for it commenced to be developed, as we have said, in this chapter, and this is the only way of doing the <i>Father's</i> will, whatever may please men.<a name=82:8></a> The Remnant are preserved by the very character of the words themselves, and their believing necessity: "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=82:9></a> Thou hast the words of eternal life," etc.<a name=82:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, we may remark that this argument with unbelief draws out a new principle, not merely that those whom the Father gives shall come, but that they shall come by the Father's drawing, and that none can come but by the Father's drawing.<a name=82:11></a> Our Lord, though declaring what was true in general, and in a general way, has not here passed out of the Jews in address and application.<a name=82:12></a> "It is written in the prophets, And they," that is, Messiah's people, "shall be all taught of God.<a name=82:13></a> Whosoever therefore hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me"; for as yet He had not gone beyond this "cometh unto me.<a name=82:14></a>" This was all receivable simply by a Jew, and upon the only (true) principles on which he could come to or receive Messiah.<a name=82:15></a> But it introduces our

		Lord to further thoughts; namely, an association with the Father, which, as it isolated Him in character, brought Him into a thought of His place with Him, which enlarged fully the scene of His power, but as ever in the way of entire humiliation and emptying in Him; for indeed thus this chapter is a development of <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:6">Philippians  2:6</a> - 8 in its two parts; for "being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself.<a name=83:1></a>" "Not," therefore our Lord says, "that any one hath seen the Father, save he that is <i>with God</i>, he hath seen the Father.<a name=83:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives Him a character solely of faith, and in which He is life-giving; and then is developed the full unfolding of faith, given "even unto death.<a name=83:3></a>" The very title of the life, "that eternal life which was with the Father, and was," etc.<a name=83:4></a>, being from God, reached hence out over and beyond the dispensation of the Jew; and this could only be by death, in which He therefore became the life-sustaining principle of power to all that believed, and by a principle of faith, therefore letting in all who did so, in point of fact, through His grace; though (as is the character of this gospel, as we have seen), this was dispensatorily administered amongst the Jews.<a name=83:5></a> The intelligence of this verse just shows out the character of this gospel.<a name=83:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may remark that verse 36 is that which introduces the principle of election; but this opens the supremacy of God, and the fact of the Father's will; and this, though it may be first to the Jews <i>as here</i>, yet is a supremacy reaching forth to the Gentiles, even as says the apostle, etc.<a name=83:7></a>; and this is the point reasoned out in Romans 11; and this in life-giving supremacy; but it is through death, and that even to the elect Jew.<a name=83:8></a> The transition is very marked in verses 45 - 50, from that which is purely Jewish -- in all its expressions to the power of eternal life in Christ; and we may observe the very language noticed before, "he that comes," "he that believes," with that very character in Him (verse 46) which introduced the principle of faith.<a name=83:9></a> They are just brought into contrast in verses 48 - 50: "<i>Your</i> fathers did eat," etc.<a name=83:10></a>, "and died.<a name=83:11></a>"?<a name=83:12></a> "This is the bread that descendeth from heaven, in order that any one may eat, and not die.<a name=83:13></a>" It has life in itself; as indeed our Lord goes on to say: "I am the living bread.<a name=83:14></a>"

		to heaven, universal in its actual dispensation, for it resumed its position of universality, while the rejection of the Jews gave it dispensatory righteousness as regarded their claims, for they ceased in the new mercy; and sin being put away, enabled the communication of the indwelling life to all that believed in Him so risen, as the bread that came down from heaven; for Jesus in the millennial glory will not be an object of faith, though present on earth in some sort He was; so, "We believe, and are sure," because the life was revealed in humiliation.<a name=84:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the general point see chapter 3: 31.<a name=84:2></a> It is, however, still in the vivifying power of life, as made flesh still, though in the power of an endless life; and the power of it consists in the association by faith of the power of the risen life with the death of which we are partakers, planted in the likeness, sin being therein put away, and we therefore receiving a life free from sin; for it is the same Jesus which is alive (we being quickened, and feeding on His life), which was crucified, broken, and His life given; "for he that has died is justified from sin"; so we, receiving life from Him who died, are "justified from sin," for in that life risen we recognise that He was dead, and we with Him, therefore "justified from sin.<a name=84:3></a>" He also was justified in the Spirit.<a name=84:4></a> Hence our Lord also opens out into the full statement in this verse.<a name=84:5></a> Had He not been the living bread there could not have been this association, for there could not have been the identification of a life so passing through death.<a name=84:6></a> "I am the living bread which came down from heaven; he that eateth of this bread shall live <i>for ever</i>" (receives through the death of Christ communion with His resurrection); "and the bread which I will give is my <i>flesh</i>, which I will give for the life of <i>the world</i>" (verse 51).<a name=84:7></a>

		After this conversation or doctrine in Capernaum Jesus went about Galilee, for He would not Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.<a name=95:8></a> This goes on from chapter 5, the last time He was in Jerusalem (which compare); but the Feast of Tabernacles was near.<a name=95:9></a> The note below<a href="#95:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>gives the general view of this; but there are many things else we must note.<a name=95:10></a> There are three divisions in this subject or chapter:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, the typical facts as to His going up to the Feast of Tabernacles;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		The point of the chapter here proposed by His brethren after the flesh was the publicity of our Lord's manifestation: "himself seeks to be known in public .<a name=95:12></a>.<a name=95:13></a>.<a name=95:14></a> .<a name=95:15></a> Manifest thyself to the world.<a name=95:16></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this there are two points: His going to Judaea, the manifestation of His presence, <i>then</i> "in public," that His disciples might see His works; the other, if He did these things, to show Himself <i>to the world</i>, and the expectation of this as showing the unbelief of His natural brethren (the Jews).<a name=96:4></a> Our Lord's answer to this was not that He would not do so, but that His time (for manifestation to the world) was not yet full come.<a name=96:5></a> Their time for passing through and putting themselves forward in it was always ready.<a name=96:6></a> The world could not hate them, for they were of it.<a name=96:7></a> It hated Him because He testified of it that its works were evil.<a name=96:8></a> "Go ye up.<a name=96:9></a>" He would not go up to the feast, for His time was not yet fulfilled, and He abode in Galilee.<a name=96:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 10.<a name=96:11></a> I am not sure also whether it does not imply also the expectation of the Jews of the ingathering, and their going up, as if it was come, to the feast (and being, but not Christ's, in it), before Christ joined them there, and the worldly and unbelieving character in which they will go up in this expectation, He waiting His Father's full time.<a name=96:12></a> The expectation of Him, however, was fully raised among them, and they sought Him at the feast, but with the usual uncertainty and doubtings of unbelief.<a name=96:13></a> But this was in the not determined multitude; the Jews, properly, were determined in their opposition to owning Him as the Messiah.<a name=96:14></a> Such, I believe, will be the result also in that day, but a bringing into its full, final development what there was at work with Jesus amongst them.<a name=96:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also a marked distinction, I think, between the multitude and the Jews, though involved in the ruin of the latter by not coming out from them to Christ.<a name=96:16></a> What our Lord was blamed for not doing was making Himself known openly.<a name=96:17></a> But He could not do this.<a name=96:18></a> He spoke openly, but He could not make Himself known openly, for He was a moral Saviour.<a name=96:19></a> He spoke so, and therefore the world hated Him.<a name=96:20></a> If He had manifested Himself, it must have been in judgment.<a name=96:21></a> But He did speak quite openly, and thus manifested Himself, being content to glorify the Father, let His own glory be hidden,

	<div class="paragraph">
		give effectual testimony, saving, or condemning by the responsibility of man, in the full witness of the Father's glory.<a name=97:1></a> They indeed, that is, the multitude, did not dare speak openly; but Jesus did.<a name=97:2></a> He did not conceal His righteousness and truth in the great congregation.<a name=97:3></a> He had not refrained His lips, and that God, even His Father, knew.<a name=97:4></a> The great congregation is always the nation, as such, of the Jews.<a name=97:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was the way in which He had manifested, not Himself, but His Father and the truth.<a name=97:6></a> Nevertheless, He did not fail here to declare Himself, showing also that, when He did, only the full hatred of the world, of Satan, was brought out against Him.<a name=97:7></a> He came to bear witness to the truth, and avowed Himself to be the Son of God; whereupon, because He told them the truth, they would not believe.<a name=97:8></a> He must be received by faith, and morally, or the whole nature and order of the kingdom would be set aside, which was founded upon the necessity of God.<a name=97:9></a> Therefore He showed not Himself to gratify the flesh, but glorified His Father, and presented the truth, which could be received by the Spirit.<a name=97:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next division which we have, therefore, of this subject is the then teaching of Jesus, instead of His showing Himself at the feast (as future); for His time was not yet full come.<a name=97:11></a> Our Lord accordingly rests it on the principles we have been stating.<a name=97:12></a> Jesus taught; the Jews wondered, as it is written.<a name=97:13></a> These wilful, blind ones yet recognised the guilt of their unbelief in seeing that He had instruction which He could never have learned (so of the disciples before the council).<a name=97:14></a> Our Lord at once assists them, and confesses the source of His teaching: "My doctrine is not mine," therefore has nothing to do with My learning, "but his that sent me" (My teaching therefore must have been divine in its nature).<a name=97:15></a> But the critical point lies here: If there be willingness to do the will of God, as such, such <i>shall</i> know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or I speak from Myself.<a name=97:16></a> Here also He affirmed His mission.<a name=97:17></a> But their moral state was the real thing in question.<a name=97:18></a> Hence the importance of so sending Messiah.<a name=97:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was a distinct and sure moral evidence on this point: he that spoke from himself sought his own glory.<a name=97:20></a> This point in our Lord was illustriously brought up to us here in this very teaching, as we have seen, refusing (though indeed He was all that could be claimed) to go up to the feast, and show Himself to the world.<a name=97:21></a> Yet so indeed He obtained and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		showed far higher moral glory for the truth of God and His own glory.<a name=98:1></a> On the other hand, if He sought only His glory that sent Him, as it was plain He did, and did now, ascribing to Him all the glory even of His words, in which He was faithful (in which yet again He had yet more and divine glory around Him even as a Teacher) then it was plain that He was true, and there was no unrighteousness in Him.<a name=98:2></a> Why not receive His instructions?<a name=98:3></a> Here, I say, was the full, condemning (though unwillingly so) moral test.<a name=98:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But indeed He could go yet further.<a name=98:5></a> It was not merely their rejection of His words, which were manifestly the teaching of God: "Did not Moses give you the law, and not one of all of you keeps the law?<a name=98:6></a>" And this was shown in their dealings with Him: "Why go ye about to kill me?<a name=98:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was addressed to the Jews.<a name=98:8></a> The multitude, not privy to their evil, said, "Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?<a name=98:9></a>" Where the truth is not received the very ignorance of the multitude of the wickedness of their rulers plunges them only deeper in their rejection and distraction as to Him who charges this wickedness upon them.<a name=98:10></a> How large is the labyrinth turned round the unbeliever!<a name=98:11></a> how simple the clue, when once it is had, by which we pass through it!<a name=98:12></a> Note the fact in many ways, also the careful distinction the Scripture keeps up all through between the wilfully blind Jews and the multitude, who yet <i>as so walking</i> perished in their unbelief.<a name=98:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- 21.<a name=98:14></a> I refer this to the pool of Bethesda.<a name=98:15></a> It is manifest that our Lord did rarely, or not at all, miracles at Jerusalem, and these bringing their judgment of Himself to a crisis.<a name=98:16></a> Hence also the words of His brethren.<a name=98:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Jesus answered, and said to them"; generally now, and explanatory, so as, continuing the general bearing of His discourse, He should bring them all in, they not having wished to kill Him: "I have done one work, and ye <i>all</i> marvel.<a name=98:18></a>" In this state they perished, as it is written, as before, now including all, and His works as well as words: "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days," etc.<a name=98:19></a> "Moses" (to him they looked) "gave you circumcision, not from himself but from the fathers; and ye circumcise a man on the Sabbath.<a name=98:20></a> If therefore a man receive circumcision on the Sabbath, that Moses' law" (on this they rested, not the promises or covenant in it), "be not broken, are ye angry with me because I have made the whole man sound on the Sabbath?<a name=98:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, observe, is to the multitude, consequent on their remark as to seeking His death, from which the Jews seemed to have shrunk back, knowing its truth, but having the ignorance of the multitude as their defence with them, Satan willingly using this with them; to which our Lord therefore applies Himself in this way to meet their thoughts and reach their consciences.<a name=99:2></a> I know not that to the Jews He says, "Judge righteous judgment.<a name=99:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Upon His thus addressing the multitude some of the Jerusalemites, not of the body of the Jews as rulers, but who being such knew what they were about, said, "Is not this he whom they seek to kill?<a name=99:4></a>" (verifying and justifying all our Lord's knowledge of their thoughts and conscience against Him), "and, lo, he speaketh boldly.<a name=99:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To this, His special part, they also bear witness, and they say nothing to Him.<a name=99:6></a> It is evident, I think, from this, they (the Jews) had shrunk from the former charge.<a name=99:7></a> "Have the rulers really recognised him to be the Christ?<a name=99:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position into which the first charge of our Lord had thrown the Jews gave occasion to this.<a name=99:9></a> How various are the shades and forms of unbelief!<a name=99:10></a> This drew out the action of the Jews in the authority they possessed, though they could not meet His charges.<a name=99:11></a> It drew out the full testimony of our Lord in connection with those, and their state of mind who made the enquiry.<a name=99:12></a> The point of their difficulty upon His speaking boldly without the rulers venturing to speak to Him was that they knew whence He was, though they discussed the point afterwards.<a name=99:13></a> Our Lord takes it up, and proposes hereon in all boldness to them, thus led to enquiry, the great, eternal and all-important truth to which His testimony was required and all its truth hung.<a name=99:14></a> These remarks, however, were not addressed to Him, and His testimony was a public announcement, and not an answer to them, but it was as it regards us therefore.<a name=99:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our Lord, in this portion of this chapter (where He places testimony in the place of His manifestation, as at the Feast of Tabernacles; that is, making it matter of faith, so as that they should know the Father, by which, being critical and so separative, yet of the full blessing to those who received it, as see before, chapter 1; in truth, that portion contains the subject of John's gospel), has given us two important but

	<div class="paragraph">
		closely identified testimonies: <i>whence</i> His testimony was, and <i>whence</i> He was; the import of which, as bringing it to the crisis, we have noticed is manifest; that is, receiving Him so as to receive the Father in a way which included moral apprehension, and so indeed gave, or was the order of, everlasting fellowship with the Father and the <i>Son</i>; for so receiving Him by faith they received Him (compare again John 1), and were born (again), and children of God.<a name=100:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our Lord here charges them with indeed knowing Him, and whence He was; for indeed our unbelief is always of that which we know, and of which the evidence is before us.<a name=100:2></a> The veil is not on the glory, but on the heart, as elsewhere: "If, etc.<a name=100:3></a>; but now have they both seen and hated," etc.<a name=100:4></a> (chapter 15: 24); and so they proved immediately after (verse 30).<a name=100:5></a> But there was no reception of the Father in this knowledge.<a name=100:6></a> They had full evidence of who He was, but they knew Him only after the flesh; and indeed He had not come of Himself.<a name=100:7></a> But He that sent Him (for now He came in mission and testimony) is true in testimony in the words which He declared by Jesus, and in the judgment which necessarily followed, for the words were the revelation of Himself in and by Jesus to men.<a name=100:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is knowing the Father by Jesus which is alone the full evidence of saving faith, and the resting-place of the soul.<a name=100:9></a> Men may know Him, and whence He is; but unless they know Him as sent, unless by Him they know the true Father, they are strangers to eternal life, and come under judgment.<a name=100:10></a> It is not knowing what Jesus is intrinsically, but knowing Him as sent of the Father, knowing Him as Man, and so knowing Him as the Son, that saves: "Who by him do believe in God, who," etc.<a name=100:11></a> (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:21">1 Peter  1:21</a>).<a name=100:12></a> It was in this character that Jesus acted, that Jesus presented Himself.<a name=100:13></a> "I know him, that I am from him, and he hath sent me" (verse 29).<a name=100:14></a> How the unbelief was drawn out into light and action!<a name=100:15></a> The believers may believe that Jesus is a Man, or rather know it.<a name=100:16></a> Men may recognise that this Jesus came from heaven; nay, they may believe in the Trinity, that is, own it; but unless they know Jesus as the Son of the Father, as God indeed from everlasting, and one with the Father, but also as Son, they are set in no position, no saving fellowship, which is only with the Father and the Son.<a name=100:17></a> "This is the record," "and he that hath the Son hath life.<a name=100:18></a>" "The Father sent the Son," and Jesus was the Son, and we believe in Jesus by the Spirit, even in the Son of God, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence as a Man His very faithfulness, His truth, was in this that which was vital to us.<a name=101:2></a> "I know him, that I am from him, and he hath sent me"; and as this was truth in Him; the knowledge of this is eternal life with us.<a name=101:3></a> The acknowledgment of this truth was faithfulness, was the truth in Him.<a name=101:4></a> It is eternal life in us, knowing the Father and Him.<a name=101:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in all this fully recognised that Jesus will be manifested at the great feast, even the Feast of Tabernacles.<a name=101:6></a> It was in the confession of this His faithfulness was shown, when He was seeking, not His own glory, as He could not justly as a Man, but His Father's; but He will then come in His Father's glory and His own, which was now hidden, being come as a Servant.<a name=101:7></a> But the point at present was the truth, whether of the Father or Himself, but now as the great point to which indeed His truth was affixed.<a name=101:8></a> That He did not speak of Himself the truth of the Father, verse 29 is, we have said, the great confession, which constituted the truth in Him, as the Father was the crown of all.<a name=101:9></a> It was felt they sought to kill, for he [the devil] was a murderer from the beginning.<a name=101:10></a> Because He told them the truth, this was the great secret.<a name=101:11></a> And this <i>was</i> the truth, the victorious truth, which through grace overcame; for truth alone, without grace, would have been no salvation, but rather brought us more entirely under the power of Satan, or made us as enemies.<a name=101:12></a> Grace with truth overcomes, and is salvation.<a name=101:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some, probably Jerusalemites, sought to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come.<a name=101:14></a> They showed their mind, but God also showed His.<a name=101:15></a> He was true.<a name=101:16></a> How marvellous to behold the Lord thus confessing the truth, the Slave of all evil, but waiting upon God who delivered Him from all; as He saith also: "I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest: I have not hid," etc.<a name=101:17></a> So was He doing here.<a name=101:18></a> But many of the multitude (still thus distinguished, nor was our Lord's reproach thus without fruit, though He might, seemed to, have laboured in vain, and spent His strength for nought and in vain), many of the multitude believed with this stunning rebuke to the Pharisees, though of doubting faith in them: "Will Christ do more works?<a name=101:19></a>" in a word, on the works which His Father had given Him to do; as He says, "If I

		had not done among them the works which no other man did," etc.<a name=102:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there were those whose character now developed itself, who dreaded to lose their influence, if Christ were received.<a name=102:2></a> The Pharisees sent officers to take Him.<a name=102:3></a> It was but the occasion to our Lord to bring out another great truth of His doctrine: His being hidden, being rejected as what He was; until the great feast really came; thus completing as to Himself the mystery which was involved in His not as yet being manifested to the world.<a name=102:4></a> He had come to them, manifested and taught who He was, and they would not receive Him.<a name=102:5></a> But they should seek Him in earnest soon, and find Him not; nor could they come where He was.<a name=102:6></a> Nothing could savour more, on the one hand, of rest to the Lord, but, on the other, of deep and solemn judgment to them, than this solemn word of the Lord's.<a name=102:7></a> All the bearings of its deep, judicial truth-telling are perfect and consummate.<a name=102:8></a> Christ was to be hid, hid in God (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>) till the time of the restoration, the true Feast of Tabernacles; He was to be with the Father, sitting there till, etc.<a name=102:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Strange the pride and confidence of man!<a name=102:10></a> Where shall He go, that we shall not find Him?<a name=102:11></a> Will He go and teach?<a name=102:12></a> etc.<a name=102:13></a> But their thoughts in vain sought to reach this, for they knew Him no otherwise than as One teaching the people, and thus they had listened.<a name=102:14></a> It is remarkable, this reference to the Greeks (in this as hiding Him, as it was indeed associated with His being hid), these distant, despised, worthless Gentiles.<a name=102:15></a> The truth is, pride is destitute of grace.<a name=102:16></a> They were silenced here.<a name=102:17></a> It was evidently something beyond them.<a name=102:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here closed the doctrine in connection with our Lord's Person on this subject, and He proceeds to teach that which would be the substituted Comforter, but the Earnest during this His absence, and hiding of His glory, and of it as in that last great day; that is, in the heavenly glory.<a name=102:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must remark here that to the Feast of Tabernacles alone there was an eighth day, the day of restraint or solemn assembly, including typically (as it appears to me) the great celebration of the universal ingathering; and as the seven days showed the completion of God's temporal purposes, so the eighth or first showed the inlet to the eternal purposes, the bringing into, while it passed beyond, the temporal estate, the glory of that which was without it, the gathering into one in Christ risen and ascended, the resurrection glory herein in faith.<a name=102:20></a> It was upon

		the resurrection day, and the Lord's day is the resurrection day; for indeed the resurrection is the great link between both; that is, the heavenly and the temporal or earthly.<a name=103:1></a> The last day of the feast was then the great and distinctive type of that which is to be gathered together on the appearing of the Lord Jesus, then no longer hid in God, but manifested in all glory and that in a way specifically breaking forth and having its place in, and character from, the heavenly glory; for it was without the week.<a name=103:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence in the meantime the Spirit was the witness of all this, coming (though obtained by Jesus as having fulfilled all righteousness and been humbled, which it therefore marks as the way to glory also, that He might fill all things) from Him ascended; or as here, referring to the earthly estate, hid.<a name=103:3></a> Hence our Lord (who could not now be manifested as at the Feast of Tabernacles, which He had developed as to all the other, the working, days, the perfect doing of the Father's will, and as to the rest that He was hid in it, and it from them), on the last day, that great day of the feast, promulgates the intermediate and substituting power of the Spirit, Witness and Earnest of His re-appearance.<a name=103:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our Lord, however, uses language which, while it admits present coming to Him for the purpose (it is to be observed, however, that in speaking of drinking He refers only to the Spirit; He was now rejected as presenting the truth generally), yet in its full application goes forth into the general estate, truth, of faith in Him.<a name=103:5></a> He "stood and cried.<a name=103:6></a>" This was His now great proclamation, this was the great thing for the world, the position in which it was to be set, and to which He now invited those that thirsted then: "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink, he" (then He gives the great proposition) "that believeth on me, .<a name=103:7></a>.<a name=103:8></a>.<a name=103:9></a> out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=103:10></a>"

		The quotation from the Scripture here does not, it appears to me, refer to any one specific text so apparently stated, but shows the Christian meaning and power of that which we might otherwise pass over.<a name=103:11></a> There is a mind of God all through the Scriptures, of which the dispensations of God themselves are but the expression.<a name=103:12></a> This is true of this sentence also, and of chapter 4 before.<a name=103:13></a> I believe such scriptures as <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#18:4">Proverbs  18:4</a>, <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#10:11">Proverbs  10:11</a>, are moral truths, which find their real fulfilment here, just as the waters of Ezekiel's temple are exact

		During the development of all this the Lord stands by; the work, indeed, being real and His in the man, but left <i>to its results</i>, and apparently without support in the trial and manifestation of what is real.<a name=141:3></a> In the man's testimony we have the distinct evidence of the progress of his soul, or of the divine work upon it, in knowledge: "He is a prophet.<a name=141:4></a>" The work is in the believer, and he knows it; but the evidence of the work in another is alike ineffectual as the word, though it be the evidence of the power of that word.<a name=141:5></a> "If I had not <i>come</i>" (that is, in the flesh), "and spoken unto them" (in which however His words were not His own in the flesh but His Father's, who says He doeth the works), "they had not had sin; but now they have no cloke for their sin.<a name=141:6></a>" For this adequately exposed it to their consciences.<a name=141:7></a> "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.<a name=141:8></a>" As it is said therefore here, for this chapter is on the works, not the word simply, and brought before them in the evidence of the object of it: "Since the world began was it not heard that any one opened the eyes of one that was born blind.<a name=141:9></a>"

		Having now viewed Himself as the Shepherd in His exalted position, He looks at those belonging to Him as thus the exalted Shepherd, confirming I think distinctly the distinct positions of the office and order of the passage as followed here: "And other sheep I have" (of the Gentiles), "who are not of this [Jewish] fold," the "fold" in which He then was: "them also I must" (it was an obligation on Him of His Father, and the dueness of His own love), "bring," not "lead out," as before as to the Jews, or sheep among them at least: "and they shall hear my voice"; it is Christ's voice now, "therefore," "turn away from him that speaketh from heaven"; "and there shall be one" (not <i>aulee</i>, "fold") <i>poimnee</i>, "flock, and one Shepherd," to wit, the Church and Christ.<a name=160:5></a>

		Martha, loved as she was, yet acted on the impulse of her nature, with no holy fulness of deference to Jesus, yet not without gracious acknowledgment of Him, yet also with no full perception of what He was, and occupied with her natural anxieties, which clouded this, and destroyed her deference: "I know that even now whatsoever thou askest of God, God will give it thee.<a name=182:8></a>" This itself may be a love of the object given, not of Jesus the Giver; makes Him the Servant, not the Master, of our blessing.<a name=182:9></a> If He makes Himself so, in the riches of His grace, blessed as it shall be, blessed be His name!<a name=182:10></a> But it was, too, but as an accepted Man with God, the Teacher: "God will give it thee"; no consciousness of what Jesus was in <i>Himself</i>.<a name=182:11></a> Though He might even glorify the Father, who glorified Him, though He might glory in the title, the special witness of His love, of Son of Man, yet should His disciples see through and understand His love indeed to them in this; but His glory in Deity withal.<a name=182:12></a> To Him be the praise and glory.<a name=182:13></a>

		The whole of this exceedingly interesting chapter is very imperfectly gone through; for there is the whole depicting of the infirmity of unbelief and man's necessity, and the sympathy and energy of Jesus for the glory of God, and that detailed with the utmost beauty, so as in effect to declare the Father.<a name=183:14></a> The present quickening power of Jesus, Sonship, is the great point (with the perfect sympathy with our weakness); and yet the necessity of Christ's presence felt by man is unbelief.<a name=183:15></a> Compare the centurion's faith; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:7">Luke  7:7</a>.<a name=183:16></a> This, as applied to the whole scope (followed on that word, subsequently: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again"), is of most important consequence and extensive bearing, as to which the "Lord, if thou hadst been here," is of great import.<a name=183:17></a> I speak as to the scene before Christ's death, as well as after.<a name=183:18></a>

		You may also notice how, from the statement of the great truth of power of deliverance, we are passed through the sorrow and power, as it were, of the thing to be delivered from, and then into the result of the delivering power, taking the subject of the sorrow up out of it.<a name=184:6></a> This was just the mission of Christ, "who, being rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich"; and the soul is ever (sin being entered in) so passed through this.<a name=184:7></a> If He had been simply received, the result of blessing would have been simple and immediate on the manifestation of the power.<a name=184:8></a> But the necessity which caused its manifestation implied its entering into the sorrow; that is, in result; for faith would not have led it there; but so would not the sympathy of Jesus have been known.<a name=184:9></a> Our comfort is that He who voluntarily led us in, and entered in Himself, can, passing through it, exhibit in His and the Father's glory deliverance, a deliverance enhanced by the expression of His love.<a name=184:10></a> But it is quite the way, though it ought not to be, of the daily experience of our souls.<a name=184:11></a> It results from unbelief, but Jesus in His quickening power can enter down into our sorrows to make us rich by His poverty.<a name=184:12></a> Compare, "The hour is come that the Son of Man," though there willingly, and what then follows here.<a name=184:13></a> It was in sympathy merely with others, but the same thing: "I am the resurrection.<a name=184:14></a>" But they led Him to the tomb.<a name=184:15></a> He went there; yea, He wept there.<a name=184:16></a> But, brethren beloved of the Lord, He neither remained there, nor left Lazarus there.<a name=184:17></a> He remained, and that in immediate power, till He called Lazarus forth from it.<a name=184:18></a>

		Note also how His entering into the grief enabled Him to call out of it, and produced that groan of sympathy which drew out the exercise of the Father's power.<a name=184:19></a> For it is the sympathy of man with Jesus which calls in the exercise of the Father's power and is the exercise of the Son's.<a name=184:20></a> The Son of God is glorified thereby; that is, in this raising power, I say, disclose the Father, for it does so abstractedly.<a name=184:21></a> It is the glory of God, but being wrought by the Son it brings out this, is the great mystery

		We have noticed, I believe, the full recognition of our Lord in His three great characteristic points: Son of God here; then King, the Son of David; then Head of the heathen, but this in attractive power by death.<a name=187:9></a> The whole order of the gospel we have been pursuing is very plain; chapter 3, the general character and Kingdom not yet manifested; chapter 4, its extension by the Spirit taking the worst; to wit, the humiliation of Jesus, and the gift of the Spirit in life, and therefore to any, the stranger, the Samaritan, the worthless one; chapter 5, life and light as contrasted with the law, but in quickening power; chapter 6, His flesh broken, the bread of life contrasted, as life-giving humiliation, with kingly power, so love; chapter 7, the union of the Spirit contrasted with the joy, the universal joy, of that Feast of Tabernacles in which He (the Lord) should be shown to the world, the King, the Blesser; this is what He was then; chapter 8, His word's rejection; chapter 9, the power of His work manifest to the simplest and most needy by its operation; its rejection; then, chapter 10, His sheep called out, that is, God's purpose, and what He would do <i>further</i>, and His discussion with the Jews in the assertion of who He was thereupon, and their final confirmed rejection of them; then the exhibition of His real power and title in the which He was rejected, as we have here traced it; and after discussion upon it, from chapter 12, what He was to His disciples thus rejected.<a name=187:10></a> This we reserve until we come there, by the Lord's mercy.<a name=187:11></a>

		We have, it appears to me, a definite witness of our Lord's remanifestation in resurrection state and fulness in that word noticed: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again"; and hence was the difficulty that hung over it when there noticed.<a name=210:7></a> Christ manifested the full glory of the Father in respect of His claim on the first Adam, or more properly the first Adam's subjection to the law, and victory over death in Lazarus; and, "If a man keep my saying.<a name=210:8></a>" Adam was exhibited in nature "the son of God.<a name=210:9></a>" He came directly from God: "the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.<a name=210:10></a>" But in this sonship he wholly failed.<a name=210:11></a> We know our failure.<a name=210:12></a> The Lord took us up here, but all He did was merely vindicating the position of the first Adam from the evil; the position of which had been most fully shown in the Jew, as specifically put under the law: whence Christ was the Son of Man, born of a woman, made under the law, to redeem, etc.<a name=210:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the full extent of this was shown in the resurrection of Lazarus, which completed therefore the witness to that.<a name=210:14></a> It was the glorifying the Father's name in Adam by the Son of God.<a name=210:15></a> In all His life, and fully in this, the Father's name was glorified; for Lazarus was raised or brought forth into natural life again; the power of death merely set aside; God glorified as the Father, to wit, of man also by the Son, in respect of this first supremacy of natural life, vindicated by Him over evil.<a name=210:16></a> But (for this was in the moment of transition after, as we have seen, His recognition in all His various characters being rejected) He was to glorify it again, declared or determined to be "the

		It appears also that the temptations of our Lord; that is, His exposure to the trial and power of Satan, followed the two great branches of His life in which the Father's glory was thus manifested.<a name=212:5></a> The first, after which the devil departed from Him for a season, applied itself to cause to fail the righteous life of the living Man, in which He was conversant as Son of God in obedience and acknowledgment of the supremacy of God: "Thou shalt worship Jehovah thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.<a name=212:6></a>" He was a Jew recognising Jehovah righteously, the Son of God.<a name=212:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark that in the first two temptations (I call them the first two, following the order of their occurrence as facts in Matthew) the proposal to the Lord is as Son of God: "If thou be, command, or cast.<a name=212:8></a>" But the Lord acts simply in obedience, the place of the living Man, not raising His Sonship or His power (which would have shown a wrong spirit) but taking the holy line of obedience which, worthy [of], yea exalting the Son, was the clear and only righteous path of the Man in which He then stood, and thus baffled Satan.<a name=212:9></a> Having therefore overcome him thus in the character of the obedient Man, the Son of God, and vindicated this character and place exactly where Adam had failed, and dishonoured God, as He now honoured Him, the Lord then exercised His power as Son of God in this character, exhibited in the course of His life and walk through the world.<a name=212:10></a> The devil, the tempter or accuser, departed from Him for a season.<a name=212:11></a> He exercised His power over Satan or the adversary, recognised as what he was, and subdued.<a name=212:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our Lord's subsequent temptation we see Him in a deeper and fuller trial; one in which He not only overcame Satan as one who sought to lead the living Man out of obedience in the world, and make himself the god of it, but in which He through death (to which obedience was needful, if he should be overcome, because he had got the title of death by the truth of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The act was perfect, so that there was now no abstract barrier, and all are doubly without excuse.<a name=213:5></a> The act was effectual; for He had no need of it for Himself, and He gave Himself effectually for the Church: and in that sense He was the sinner; His sins and iniquities went over His head, a sore burden, and too many for Him to bear; and the Great Shepherd of the sheep offering Himself without spot to God was brought again from the dead through the blood of the everlasting covenant; for He was identified with the sins of His people.<a name=213:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the act of our Lord, looked at in His personal act and trial, was meeting Satan for the vindication of this new character, otherwise alone, "abiding alone," for all were dead and under the power and liability to death; and meeting Satan in the power of death, Satan being overcome herein, He rose in the power, and His Father was glorified in the Son; that is, in the name of the Father in resurrection life.<a name=213:7></a> It is this name which is declared to the brethren therefore in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, which hangs on this truth in all its bearings.<a name=213:8></a> Into this point the apostle of the Lord now conducts us: Christ after resurrection through death.<a name=213:9></a> His testimony had closed.<a name=213:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very full subject, but we cannot enter into it here, only remarking that it is not only a sanctification of person but the principle of vitality of character from determining power which is here, so that we are "<i>clean</i>," so as to bring fruit suitable to the vine, because the vital principle, life from God, is in us, though there may be much to be subdued and purged, much to be brought into subjection which belonged to the old man, a vessel made to honour, fit for the Master's use, though this has different application.<a name=264:5></a> Compare with this passage <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:22">1 Peter  1:22</a> - 25.<a name=264:6></a> This purifying process of the Father's love is most important.<a name=264:7></a> All allowance of thoughts <i>not of the resurrection vine</i> (according to the knowledge especially vouchsafed) hinders fruit-bearing power; and <i>hasteners</i> show signs of not being vitally branches.<a name=264:8></a> The purging is applied to the branches, not to the fruit, as arid tends directly to the grieving of the Spirit, defiling the channels of its operation, and arresting the progress of the glory of the Father in our service.<a name=264:9></a> That which follows is the remedy, and is practical; that is, it is not the fact of the necessary security of vital union but the exercise of the Spirit so united: "Abide in me.<a name=264:10></a>" It assumes connection: "Now .<a name=264:11></a>.<a name=264:12></a>.<a name=264:13></a> clean.<a name=264:14></a>" It is not seek, apply to, or recur frequently, but "abide.<a name=264:15></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this is a most important principle, the barrier to the inlet of evil, which chokes and defiles the channel of good from God.<a name=264:16></a> I do not say God may not overrule it, and is supreme to restore the soul.<a name=264:17></a> I know, know in humble dependence and blessing, He is.<a name=264:18></a> Still, I say, the portion of the Christian is <i>abide</i>, a most important and searching word of great power to meet Satan with: "Abide in me"; for the strength is great when (practically) it is unmixed, and the channels (as it were) open with God.<a name=264:19></a> The streams are then filled with water, and coming fresh.<a name=264:20></a> It is not when coming washing the channels, and showing even the mud it carries away (that may be benefit), but flows clear and refreshing, so that there is refreshment within and around, and the mud and

		dirt in the channel ever so, prove to it so, earthy, is not contracted.<a name=265:1></a> Now, the simple precept here is, "Abide in me, and I in you"; that is, as vitally united.<a name=265:2></a> This abiding in Christ is the order of His (thus) abiding in us.<a name=265:3></a> The abiding there is evidence, too, that we are vitally united.<a name=265:4></a> But here it is practically, and hence is the great principle, including most definitely, however, the latter force: It is in those who abide in Me that I abide.<a name=265:5></a> This is the verified "and I in you.<a name=265:6></a>" "Abide in Me.<a name=265:7></a>" It is in Christ.<a name=265:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, here is the emphasis, the point of association as the communion of all vital energy, the standard and communication of fulness, and thus all fulness is there.<a name=265:9></a> But as the branch bears nothing out of the vine, but withers itself, so we bear no fruit but as abiding in Christ, and this <i>practically</i> proportionately, for all the fulness is in Him.<a name=265:10></a> It is not merely the fact, but the exercise of the blessing.<a name=265:11></a> There is no fruit "<i>of itself</i>"; "<i>unless .<a name=265:12></a>.<a name=265:13></a>.<a name=265:14></a> abide in me</i>.<a name=265:15></a>" But this, while it is vitally true, always is proportionately true daily.<a name=265:16></a> Then first the relationship between Him, as the Vine, and the Father.<a name=265:17></a> Then, as the conclusion of the practical result in this, being by His quickening word, "Abide in me.<a name=265:18></a>" Then the relation between Him and the branches, the abiding in Him, the intimate connection of which we have seen, with the question of the Father's purging, is therefore thus shown to be the occasion of bearing <i>much</i> fruit; the force of which cannot be mistaken from what we have said, if we have seen internal purging the way for external fruit-bearing, and abiding in Christ the very power of keeping evil as mentally a stranger practically; and hence the flow of healthful sap, no cankered branch, alas, "apart from me.<a name=265:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But not only is this true as to one really in communion with Christ, but, however apparently planted, if one do not abide in Him, he is cast out as a branch not in the tree, withers, is dried up, there is no supply.<a name=265:20></a> They gather them, cast them into the fire, and burn them.<a name=265:21></a> All this parable brings in the end (in principle) in view, so as to show [it], for this shall be in [the] close.<a name=265:22></a> While the individual source of much fruitbearing strength is mentioned before, the Lord here seems to speak of what hung in a measure on their common position, as we know the force of agreement in this: "If <i>ye</i> abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done <i>to you</i>.<a name=265:23></a>" There are two points referring both to their condition or state: "If <i>ye</i> abide in me" (a Church

		Then another aspect of this question of the vine opened out: "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.<a name=266:4></a>" The Father's glory was in their fruitfulness, and they were His disciples.<a name=266:5></a> Well, as He in the world was loved of the Father, so they of Him.<a name=266:6></a> Then how had He continued in this love?<a name=266:7></a> Keeping His Father's commandments.<a name=266:8></a> If they kept His commandments they would abide in His love.<a name=266:9></a> <i>All</i> this shows the practical position of the vine under the care held to be over it; not here mystical, and sure in its results, but practical, and exhibited in its plain characters.<a name=266:10></a> The object of this was not requisition in judgment, but that His joy might remain in them, the joy of full communion with the Father, as in One that ever had the consciousness of pleasing Him.<a name=266:11></a> Christ's joy was to do His Father's will, and the perfect consciousness of His union with Him, and so doing His will.<a name=266:12></a>

		Now, Christ's joy is our portion (Christ's joy was in His own blessedness of obedience, and His union with the Father), and not only to have the same joy, but to have His joy, and we do stand in Him as in the close: "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"; but here that it might <i>abide</i> in you, and so their joy might be full.<a name=266:13></a> He knew the blessedness of this earthly fellowship with the Father.<a name=266:14></a> In Him this was their portion, and so nothing would be wanting to their joy.<a name=266:15></a> But the manner of His joy was perfect obedience.<a name=266:16></a> He had loved them as the Father loved Him.<a name=266:17></a> If they walked in His commandments, as He in His Father's, the abiding of love would be theirs.<a name=266:18></a> Here was a full joy for a full communion.<a name=266:19></a> But the assertion was that thus it would be full.<a name=266:20></a>

		There was another point connected with their so standing incorporated on earth, so as to have the full blessing: loving one another.<a name=267:1></a> "This," says our Lord, singling it out, "this is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.<a name=267:2></a>" That is, <i>self</i>-giving-up love, true love.<a name=267:3></a> "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.<a name=267:4></a>" Now, the Lord is not here speaking of His love to enemies, the manner of God's love to the world, but His love to His friends, the peculiar application of it to them as developed in the previous verses, and connected with their keeping His commandments, <i>universal</i> obedience, which is obedience and nothing else.<a name=267:5></a> If I (knowingly) do not obey in one thing, I obey in none, for they are my will.<a name=267:6></a> On universality of obedience blessing hangs, and must hang; otherwise God would be showing blessing on what was not consistent with His character, which cannot be.<a name=267:7></a> There would be no blessing.<a name=267:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And we cannot but remark how obedience is insisted on here, the preliminary of blessedness, the order of abiding blessedness.<a name=267:9></a> The state of the matter is stated in verse 6.<a name=267:10></a> Persons in Him, or as in Him, are spoken of; then the practical order; then abiding in Him, and His words in us, is the source of all fruitfulness; then comes the love of it: "Abide in me.<a name=267:11></a>" But then I have loved: "abide in my love.<a name=267:12></a>" "If ye keep my commandments," etc.<a name=267:13></a> In Christ, and His words the director of our minds, we ask what we will.<a name=267:14></a> What lack, then, of fruit, if indeed <i>seeking the Father's glory</i>, as His disciples?<a name=267:15></a> Loved of Christ, and abiding in His love, Christ's joy abides in us, and our joy is full.<a name=267:16></a> This, while it hangs immediately on the last matter, yet flows from all that precedes in the chapter.<a name=267:17></a> Then in the order of it, while it flows from that, it is, "This is my commandment," the central point of this blessing, "that ye love one another, as I loved you.<a name=267:18></a>" The name of servant (though indeed he is His servant, and nothing but His servant in willingness) no longer attaches to the disciple.<a name=267:19></a> He is not set in the place of a servant.<a name=267:20></a> He cannot be, for he is a son, a branch, one with Jesus the Vine.<a name=267:21></a> He is not so dealt with of the Lord; no longer because they were now viewed (as faithful, obedient servants) as planted in the Vine.<a name=267:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		But, though friends, it does not put them in equality of circumstances, though of blessing; there is blessed sureness of grace in it: "Ye have not chosen me.<a name=268:6></a>" It was not their choice of Him that put them in this position, but that which, while it infinitely enhanced the blessing, gave it the sure settledness of divine love.<a name=268:7></a> They could not have put themselves in the place of friends by their choice of Him.<a name=268:8></a> They had nothing to communicate to Him, unless their sorrows and their sins, when He had opened His heart in friendship to them.<a name=268:9></a> He had treated them as friends, having chosen them as such.<a name=268:10></a> In the sovereign certainty of His own choice they had all the blessing.<a name=268:11></a> There is always a certain superiority in friendship, lasting friendship.<a name=268:12></a> Here, as perfectly lasting, it was entire and perfect superiority, but it brings into the equality of love, and shows its greatness in bringing up into it; not conferred acts (that is God's love to us; though we have fellowship with the Father also), but bringing us into the apprehension of all His will, and Himself treating us on this ground.<a name=268:13></a> The sign of friendship is making known one's thoughts, which He does not to others; of perfect friendship, if such could be, unreserve.<a name=268:14></a> Christ's is perfect; it has no reserve; nothing which it need, nothing which it wishes, to keep back one point; and in that love [that] is not knit there is a holding back of the heart from another.<a name=268:15></a> But Jesus has none such.<a name=268:16></a> His love is perfect, and He makes us its sure objects; and the greater the superiority the greater the blessing.<a name=268:17></a> And here is the amazing exaltation of the believer, the secret intimacy of all Christ's mind.<a name=268:18></a> Amazing love!<a name=268:19></a> How is the tone of mind exalted, however little we realise it; how, if we really in any sort fully did so!<a name=268:20></a>

		This quite closed the series of revelations which treated of the transition from earthly, Jewish relationships, or risen with His disciples on earth, to His place with the Father in right of His Person, and in divine counsel, giving the revelation of their condition in His absence in respect of this, both as regards His Person and the presence of the Holy Ghost; their future portion and present peace, meanwhile.<a name=301:2></a> Though there could yet be some communications, it would not be much, for the prince of this world now came: for Satan is such; for the rejection of the Son has shown it.<a name=301:3></a> He had nothing in Christ, but His passing through the sphere of his power in death was that the world might know that He loved the Father, and obeyed to the end.<a name=301:4></a> The world, alas!<a name=301:5></a> would have hoped something from Satan's power to stop this witness to God.<a name=301:6></a> How often does it!<a name=301:7></a> But in Christ all this power of evil was truly the occasion of the full and perfect proof of love to the Father, and obedience to Him.<a name=301:8></a> Here the Lord closes His relationship with the world.<a name=301:9></a> "Arise," says He, "let us go hence.<a name=301:10></a>"

		What follows is a developed doctrinal discourse founded on all these truths.<a name=301:11></a> We may remark the parallel between verse 7 and verse 37 of chapter 13; Peter could no more know the bearing of that (typical) purification, necessary to have a part with Christ, in His real, now as Man realising, relationship with the Father, than go by the way of death, which proved Christ's moral and perfect competency for it, into the Father's presence; competency for the glory of God, for He had perfectly glorified Him there where God needed it, in a new way (so to speak), and where man must do it.<a name=301:12></a> What a wonderful mystery!<a name=301:13></a> for who should obey for man but man, or could?<a name=301:14></a> for it would not have been according to the exigencies of God as regards man, nor of man under sin towards God.<a name=301:15></a> But Christ was Man obedient under sin, and with the perfect feelings He ought to have towards and before God there, and death, and Satan's power indeed, too.<a name=301:16></a>

		Chapter 15 takes up the fact of the two great positions of Christ as setting aside the old or Jewish state.<a name=301:17></a> Christ Himself was the True Vine.<a name=301:18></a> Israel had been but the outward form.<a name=301:19></a> Note, all is on earth here.<a name=301:20></a> The disciples were already of it.<a name=301:21></a> But then it is in principle also the system continued <i>on earth</i>

		in its responsibilities.<a name=302:1></a> This might have been fully realised if the Jerusalem form of administration had continued.<a name=302:2></a> It is always true in principle of the Church viewed as on earth: fruit (whatever the gift) is derived from communion.<a name=302:3></a> They were to have Christ's place in testimony on earth, not as servants, but as friends who had His mind; that is, all He had received of His Father; that is, as down here on earth, perfect in His prophetic place among the Jews, come in by the door, though one with the Father, and speaking from Him.<a name=302:4></a> They were to be united among themselves, have this spirit in common which He had had towards them.<a name=302:5></a> All the means of true and full fruit-bearing in their position on earth are gone into.<a name=302:6></a> Their place in this was association with Him, and obedience, and disposing thus of all power in supplication.<a name=302:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He provides for their own proper joy also in this position.<a name=302:8></a> They would be persecuted, as He had been.<a name=302:9></a> Blessed privilege!<a name=302:10></a> But the Father not known, and He hated without a cause.<a name=302:11></a> The personal testimony of Jesus had left them without excuse.<a name=302:12></a> Had the old vine not rejected this last, this one proper, full testimony of the Father Himself, they might have remained in their position.<a name=302:13></a> Much, many, and various sins God could have pardoned in government; but they had hated the Father manifested in grace, and the Son (who had manifested Him) present in grace, so that the breach was irreparable, and they must be left in their sin.<a name=302:14></a> And so it was written in their law.<a name=302:15></a> Thus the old vine was wholly set aside.<a name=302:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was another, of whom He had spoken already, who was to replace Himself; the Comforter, whom He would send from the Father (for now He takes His place on high), who would bear witness, and they also, as regards all His life here.<a name=302:17></a> Hence their entire rejection by the old vine as an ecclesiastical system, and that even in their blindness in thinking to serve God, as (they supposed) they knew Him according to the old system.<a name=302:18></a> But it was total ignorance of the Father and Him, the true, full, only real revelation of God (who was their God), the truth and perfect light which had now only really come into the world; the rest having been only really provisional.<a name=302:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord had now told them what concerned their relationship with the old system, so that it would be a confirmation of their faith when it arrived.<a name=302:20></a> His presence with them (supporting all Himself) had rendered it necessary while He was with them.<a name=302:21></a>

		But they were still too exclusively occupied with the old, and their own circumstances, as left down here.<a name=303:1></a> None had his soul lifted up to enquire of what a God who was acting, and was not surely frustrated by the evil of His enemies, was going to do when Jesus was going.<a name=303:2></a> If (apparently by the wickedness of His enemies) He left, and all link was broken off down here, surely larger purposes of God were to be accomplished.<a name=303:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remark here that, as up to His rejection He had put in contrast His revelation of the Father and the Jewish order, now He is the True Vine, instead of the old one; and the Holy Ghost reveals Him, while He puts them in immediate relationship with the Father.<a name=303:4></a> We may remark that chapter 14 speaks particularly of the personal relationship of the Lord with His disciples in connection with His absence; the effect that this had upon them, and how both as to His having them ultimately with Him, and how He would be with them meanwhile, how they would enjoy it; the Comforter He would obtain, and the like; and this also in connection with His Person, what they had really had in Him when He was present, and how that bore on their association with Him even that He was going.<a name=303:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other grand element, then, dependent upon the breaking of the connection of the Lord with the old vine (at least, of His apparent place in connection with it), was the presence of the Comforter, the Holy Ghost whom He would send, and that in connection with His going up on high.<a name=303:6></a> The effect and sphere of His presence was entirely above and independent of the Jewish question.<a name=303:7></a> He dealt with the world of which Christ was now the exalted Head.<a name=303:8></a> He took totally other ground than the law and the Jews.<a name=303:9></a> He demonstrated the sin of the <i>world</i>, and that because they believed not on Him.<a name=303:10></a> His presence was the consequence of the Son's being rejected, and by the fact brought them in guilty.<a name=303:11></a> It demonstrated righteousness, because it showed Jesus above, received of the Father, and taken from the world who would not have Him, to see Him no more.<a name=303:12></a> Awful effect of the justice of God the Father!<a name=303:13></a> But judgment was not executed on the world, but its prince was judged; for Satan was proved to be that; but he had committed himself to the utmost in the death of the Lamb (and He being raised up and glorified), fatally for ever committed himself; he was judged; and the triumphant presence of the Spirit proved it.<a name=303:14></a>

		Besides this effect of His presence, He would guide the disciples, and show them things to come; and, further, take of Christ's (and all that the Father had was His), and show it to them.<a name=304:1></a> Truth, prophecy, and the full glory of Christ was their portion under His teaching.<a name=304:2></a> Yet, further, Christ's absence was but for a time.<a name=304:3></a> He was not cut off, but going to the Father; and as this was really what was about to be accomplished they would see Him in a little while.<a name=304:4></a> This is a general principle.<a name=304:5></a> He was not lost, but soon to be here again; true for testimony on His resurrection, and finally at His return.<a name=304:6></a> Further, He placed them in immediate relationship with the Father.<a name=304:7></a> They should not ask Him, as if they could not go to God themselves; but being thoroughly associated with the efficacy of His work, and the acceptance of His Person, would go to the Father in His name, who loved them as attached to Him.<a name=304:8></a>

		Note, in practice as to this, what is said: "We are <i>clear from the law</i>.<a name=331:6></a>" We have not ceased to exist, but we have been nullified (<i>vernichtet</i>, <i>annulled</i>) as regards, cease to have any existence, <i>as to law</i>; my existence is annulled (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:6">Romans  7:6</a>, flowing from verse 4).<a name=331:7></a> Then on the other hand <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:4">Galatians  5:4</a>: "<i>Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ</i> whosoever of you are justified by law.<a name=331:8></a>" So death: "<i>Who has annulled death</i>," <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a>.<a name=331:9></a>

		But other things are opening in the chapter, besides those heretofore found.<a name=332:3></a> What characterises John's gospel in the most peculiar manner is the Son's being equal with the Father, one with Him, and yet at the same time subject to Him as Son upon earth; all His language that of equal with Him, yet doing nothing without Him; all in obedience, receiving all now.<a name=332:4></a> Evidences of this run through from the first chapter all on.<a name=332:5></a> Now, this is the case here.<a name=332:6></a> He is (though just going; the hour come) speaking in the world; and His disciples (save verse 24) looked at as in it.<a name=332:7></a> All the unities then are in the world, though the last be in glory.<a name=332:8></a> But the first is as the state from which the activity parts, not the activity itself; that begins verse 14.<a name=332:9></a> The Lord there looks that they may be one, "as we.<a name=332:10></a>" Now, He is on earth, but one with the Father.<a name=332:11></a> Hence, through unity of nature and divine union in the Godhead, He has the purposes, objects, thoughts, way of feeling, seeing (to speak with human language), the same mind with the Father.<a name=332:12></a> He takes the place of service, but is one with the Father: "All mine are thine, and thine are mine.<a name=332:13></a>" He looks for this for the apostles according to their places; not only one morally, as partakers of the divine nature, but through the Holy Ghost one and the same in all; and as filled with Him they should have complete unity, the Spirit being the source of a divine oneness in all their thoughts, mind, purposes, and way of thinking and feeling, as flowing from, and the mind given by, the Holy Ghost; several persons, but one in the Holy Ghost.<a name=332:14></a> Paul could say, "We have the mind of Christ" (the "<i>nous</i>").<a name=332:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If all had this they were one; yet as receiving, of course, in their case, and in the place of service; but it was the mind for service that, as I said, comes in verse 14.<a name=332:16></a> In verse 21, as heretofore observed, those who believed through them are brought in, and it is in communion, not in the power that goes forth: "one in us.<a name=332:17></a>" The same divine power of the Holy Ghost, but leading to this union in fellowship with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ (compare <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:3">1 John  1:3</a>); one in worshipping, and conscious dwelling in God; for fellowship is also common thoughts, joys, feelings, mind, as to all we are occupied with.<a name=332:18></a> Only, as is manifest, all the fulness of this is in

		It is another thing to have the secret of the Lord, and go forth with it in power; yet here with no pretension, for in this unity it is common to all; yet hence evidently divine, for for fellowship one with another we must be in the light, as God is.<a name=333:3></a> The last is evident in the display in glory: "I in them, and thou in me" is the form it takes.<a name=333:4></a> The glory is the same.<a name=333:5></a> Still in it the Son displayed the Father, and He will be displayed in us; but then for that it must be the same glory, His glory, or He is not displayed; and then perfectly in result.<a name=333:6></a> They are kept in the name in which Christ knew the Father.<a name=333:7></a> They are kept in immediate relationship as children with the Father, and in the holiness of the divine nature; and so in the power of the Holy Ghost are one, <i>nothing</i> diverse entering in.<a name=333:8></a>

		We have seen the special place of Christ in this gospel, one with the Father; God; the Word; but more, when the actual, present, concrete fact is brought forward, the Word is made flesh, and dwelt among us, was the Shechinah amongst us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of an only begotten <i>para patros</i> ("<i>with a father</i>"); <i>von Sieten des Vaters</i> (<i>from the side of a father</i>).<a name=333:11></a> He represented the Father.<a name=333:12></a> He who had seen Him had seen the Father.<a name=333:13></a> The Father dwelt in Him, as He was always divinely in the Father.<a name=333:14></a> So <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>; chapter 3: 13; chapter 14: 20.<a name=333:15></a> But this is the other side of the truth, the divine side, so to speak.<a name=333:16></a> He stood there, however, recipient as Man, now and in glory (though He had had it before the world was).<a name=333:17></a> The Son represented Him personally, as He was in Him, and declared Him, as in His bosom, yet Son down here in Manhood.<a name=333:18></a> Words, glory, life, all is named; and so the Son is seen in John, though with reference to His eternal Sonship, in which He was one with the Father.<a name=333:19></a> "He hath

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This name, then, the Father had given to Him.<a name=334:4></a> All He did was in it, as He came in His Father's name.<a name=334:5></a> (The band came from the chief priests, and acted, not for themselves in anything, but wholly in the name of, and their actings were the actings of, the chief priests.<a name=334:6></a>) "The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<a name=334:7></a>" This was direct; the disciples clearly through Him, but as kept directly by the Father, whom they now knew: "Keep in thine own name which thou hast given me," and in which they were thus directly kept in immediate relationship and as conscious sons in communion, as filled with the Holy Ghost.<a name=334:8></a> Only the Son now, who once had kept them in the Father's name, now went up as Man ("I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee") into the glory He had with the Father before the world was, so as to be objectively with the Father, with whom He was always one.<a name=334:9></a> "I come to thee"; and they stood in His place, kept by the "Holy Father," in the name given to Christ to make good, and which He had made good at all cost and perfectly in His Person in the world; and by this they were to be one.<a name=334:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thine are mine, and mine are thine," and He now, Christ the Son in Manhood, was now to be glorified in them in the power of the Holy Ghost, who was the Spirit of sonship, hence of association with Christ, [the] Son; but directly with the Father, because they were sons, and represented Him whom the Father would glorify.<a name=334:11></a> And as they knew the Father, so the Holy Ghost took the things of Christ, and showed them to them.<a name=334:12></a> And all that the Father had was His, not as Christ, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the first disciples were to carry this work on in this world; and as Christ, always in communion with His Father in His work, revealed Him, and carried His name before the world, so they would His Father's, and the Son's, the knowledge of which is life eternal.<a name=335:4></a> Being wholly this and in this, by and according to the power of the Holy Ghost, they were one (only in grace by the Holy Ghost); as we are in their place of service, and as led by the Holy Ghost.<a name=335:5></a> That was their place, though receiving all.<a name=335:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the Lord directly connects it all with what He had, before the world was, with the Father, both at the beginning and end of the chapter.<a name=335:7></a> This gives a wonderful place to the disciples in the Lord's mind.<a name=335:8></a> It was noticed before, in the former part of the paper: their starting-point, <i>Stellung</i> (position), not the service itself, and a prayer that it might be their <i>Zustand</i> (condition); their place down here, and what was needed to connect it with Christ's place in heaven, with what went before; He being glorified is in what follows (verses 14 - 19).<a name=335:9></a>

		In the first unity (verses 9 - 11), I find much more distinct Persons in Christ and the Father (though ever divinely one); but here, as Mediator, "I pray for those whom thou hast given me.<a name=335:10></a>" Hence "Mine" and "Thine"; though all Mine Thine and Thine Mine.<a name=335:11></a> "They are thine, and I" (not those that had been in Christ) "am glorified in them.<a name=335:12></a>" "I am no more in the world.<a name=335:13></a>" "I come to thee.<a name=335:14></a>" Thus, though one, the distinction of the Persons (Jesus being as One that had been on earth, and had His place there as Man) is distinctly brought out; I do not mean merely in Godhead, but in the accomplished order of events.<a name=335:15></a> But then with this there was no difference or duality of counsels, work, whose were the

		Then the Lord adds, "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.<a name=339:2></a>" He was this in the world, because He came down from heaven, and was heavenly, and while here as positively declaring God, did so because while here He was (not had been) in the bosom of the Father, and drew from and lived "on account of the Father," had no cause, motive, principle of life but Him.<a name=339:3></a> Now, while personally thus on earth separate from sinners, kept from the evil, He was in this state alone; but when, in the full accomplishment of this separation, He was made higher than the heavens, then He could take us, redemption being accomplished, into it with Him, and minister it to us.<a name=339:4></a> Thus He sanctified Himself, that we might be sanctified through the truth.<a name=339:5></a>

		He has taken the full, new, heavenly place of man, what we may call the new man, the second Adam, according to God's counsels, and hence the affections are filled <i>positively</i> with that which tells the truth, and there is a real deliverance, because it is not keeping from, but being filled with Christ, having the affections filled with the new blessings according to the new life and nature, and there is the communication and ministration of grace and strength in Christ.<a name=339:6></a> So in chapter 8: "The truth shall make you free"; "The Son shall make you free"; the attraction of the tempting things go when the mind is filled with Christ; another nature is at work, and the thoughts are filled with its objects.<a name=339:7></a> In this state the evil is repulsive.<a name=339:8></a>
