		OUTLINE OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rome was the centre of the universal empire of the world, the Gentile metropolis; and Paul had not been there; but God had made him apostle and teacher of the Gentiles; 2 Tim 1: 11.<a name=1:1></a> In fulfilling his apostolic function, his heart was naturally drawn toward that seat of the empire and the Christians living there, or who flocked thither from all sides, to confirm them in the faith, and to establish the church forming in that important locality on the foundations of divine truth.<a name=1:2></a> This is what the epistle to the Romans presents us with.<a name=1:3></a> It is a summary of the great truths which form the groundwork of the gospel of Christ.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us consider a little the position of man, and of the world, before God.<a name=1:5></a> Christianity, it is evident, was not introduced at the beginning of the history of the human race.<a name=1:6></a> Already nearly 4,000 years had elapsed before the Son of God appeared among men.<a name=1:7></a> How many things had taken place under the eye of God during that long period!<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine the grand traits of this history.<a name=1:9></a> God had created man innocent, and had placed him in a state of happiness in a terrestrial paradise.<a name=1:10></a> He, following the sad example of his wife who had listened to the seductive words of the tempter, disobeyed God, and lost at once his innocence and his happiness.<a name=1:11></a> He dares not to present himself before God.<a name=1:12></a> A bad conscience leads him to avoid His presence, even before the just judgment of God drives him from the garden, and from Himself, source alone of true happiness.<a name=1:13></a> Man, ungrateful, disobedient man, who had taken Satan for his friend and his counsellor, in preference to God, having believed him rather than God Himself, was the slave of Satan and his own will, was lost!<a name=1:14></a> Being driven from the garden was but a natural consequence of his fall.<a name=1:15></a> The way to the tree of life was closed to him.<a name=1:16></a> He stays in the world outside, the slave of sin and death.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God, in driving man out from His presence, had not forgotten to be gracious; and, in pronouncing sentence on the serpent, He speaks of a Redeemer who should destroy the power of the enemy of man.<a name=1:18></a> It was pure grace; and testimony was given of it in the very title of the Deliverer, "the Seed of the woman," of her who by listening to Satan had plunged man into ruin; but before sending the Redeemer for the accomplishment of the work of redemption, man must be tried, and in every way, to see whether, such as he is, he could attain to the power of life eternal, or secure himself in a state of happiness.<a name=1:19></a> God knew well what he was.<a name=1:20></a> Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<a name=1:21></a> But we are prone enough to entertain a good opinion of ourselves for it to be salutary for us to make trial of what we are, that the conscience, convinced of sin, may be willing to profit by pure grace and the goodness of God.<a name=1:22></a> So, during centuries, God left man without checks to the inclinations of his own heart.<a name=1:23></a> The Saviour had been announced, it is true, and a living testimony had been given on the part of God.<a name=1:24></a>

		The names of Abel, Enoch, and Noah, shine in the pages of the holy scriptures, like lights in those remote ages.<a name=2:1></a> But the light itself shone in vain.<a name=2:2></a> Man corrupted himself more and more, so that after long patience God was led to wash corrupted humanity in the terrible scourge of the deluge.<a name=2:3></a> But He who is ever remembering His mercy in the midst of His judgments, pointed out a means of salvation to those who alone had listened to His word; and Noah, with his family, becomes the parent stock of a new world.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the terrible lesson of a world destroyed was lost upon man.<a name=2:5></a> Chastisements do not change nature.<a name=2:6></a> We soon find that idolatry is introduced and propagated in all quarters of the world.<a name=2:7></a> That is to say, to avail ourselves of the words of the apostle Paul, "the heathen sacrificed to devils and not to God.<a name=2:8></a>" God called Abraham in order to preserve in the midst of the world the knowledge of the true God, and that he might be the depositary of the promises of God, and that the promised seed should rise from his family.<a name=2:9></a> And Abraham, as well as Isaac and Jacob, his son and grandson, were strangers and pilgrims on the earth through faith.<a name=2:10></a> Of his posterity the Lord raised up an earthly people (called Israel, known generally, in the present day, under the name of Jews), that it might be a witness and preserver of the doctrine of the unity of the true God, against the errors of the heathen.<a name=2:11></a> In Abraham the call of grace from out of the world, and free salvation through faith, had been signally shewn in the ways of God.<a name=2:12></a> Now, a striking testimony as to the deliverance by the blood of a victim, substituted for the sinner whose penalty it bore, was presented in a figure; and this thought, this answer to the needs of conscience harassed by the conviction of sin, was spread through all nations; disfigured, doubtless, by the gross and abominable ideas of idolaters, who falsified the character of God in worshipping demons; but, in its first principle, as in its origin, a divine provision for the necessity of the sinner before a just God.<a name=2:13></a> When God called Israel to Himself that they might be His people, He put ransom as the ground of their deliverance.<a name=2:14></a> The blood guarded them from the just judgment of God, and guarded them perfectly.<a name=2:15></a>

		The people, come out of Egypt, are led through the desert to be tried, and at last are brought to Sinai.<a name=3:1></a> And now a principle quite new is presented to them.<a name=3:2></a> The covenant of the law is offered to the people; that is to say, the blessing and the enjoyment of promises under condition of obedience to the law of God.<a name=3:3></a> "If ye obey my voice," said Jehovah to the people; "thou shalt be a peculiar treasure unto me.<a name=3:4></a>" "Do this, and thou shalt live.<a name=3:5></a>" This then is the principle of the law of God, a principle perfectly just, like the law, which was the rule of conduct which God proposed, and which the Lord Jesus summed up in those holy words: "Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.<a name=3:6></a>" It was a perfect and admirable rule of what man ought to be, and which would secure happiness to the creatures living according to its requirements.<a name=3:7></a> Jehovah therefore proclaimed the law, under the form of Ten Commandments, with His own mouth to the people, at Sinai.<a name=3:8></a> If they kept it, they should be blessed; if not, they would be condemned and cursed.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the law, as it ought, proposed to them a perfect obedience, even (what is in fact alone such) the perfect obedience of the heart.<a name=3:10></a> "Thou shalt not covet.<a name=3:11></a>" It is evident that, if God was entering into relationship with man, He must look to the heart.<a name=3:12></a> "Thou shalt not covet.<a name=3:13></a>" To act otherwise would be to justify the hypocrite.<a name=3:14></a> The law was thus given.<a name=3:15></a> It was a holy, just, and perfect law, which declared what man ought to be, in order to please God, and to have life eternal.<a name=3:16></a> If God was pure, holy, and just, man must be so to be happy.<a name=3:17></a> But mark here, if the law described what man ought to be, it did not at all declare what God was, except that He was just, and would punish the sinner.<a name=3:18></a> It is the gospel which shining, while it fully recognises this justice and the perfection of the law, reveals what God in grace is to him who transgresses it.<a name=3:19></a> We shall speak of it presently.<a name=3:20></a> Here let us follow our subject.<a name=3:21></a> The law, which required perfect righteousness and obedience in man, had been given -- to whom?<a name=3:22></a> To man already a sinner?<a name=3:23></a> What can a perfect law do (and the law of God must be such) for a sinner?<a name=3:24></a> Condemn him in convincing him of his sin.<a name=3:25></a> Was it the law which was in fault?<a name=3:26></a> Quite the contrary: it was its holiness and righteousness which did thus.<a name=3:27></a> It was the necessary result of a perfect law given to a sinner.<a name=3:28></a> A rule gives neither life nor strength; it requires certain things, it gives nothing.<a name=3:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another result of the law.<a name=4:1></a> There is a will of his own in man.<a name=4:2></a> One knows it, one feels it, one sees it.<a name=4:3></a> The law forbids the gratification of our will.<a name=4:4></a> It is the expression of the will of God which we ought to obey.<a name=4:5></a> Our wills kick against the will of God.<a name=4:6></a> We always desire to do that which is forbidden.<a name=4:7></a> Forbid a child to look into a basket to see what is therein, and a longing will begin to stir at once in its heart.<a name=4:8></a> It would not have thought of it, had it not been told not to look inside the basket; but now it wishes to examine it.<a name=4:9></a> Sin finds an occasion in the law.<a name=4:10></a> The unbeliever will say, perhaps, "How unjust to give us a law which can only condemn us!<a name=4:11></a>" One might say so indeed, however useless it would be to contend against God, if it were true that God had given it in order that we might be saved through its means; but this is what He has not done.<a name=4:12></a> God gave the law that sin might be made manifest, and that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful -- to shew, not only that man had committed sins, but that his will was wicked and corrupt, and so audacious, that he would commit them in spite of God's prohibition; and so wicked, as a will, that a prohibition was only an occasion for this will to wish to leap clean over the barrier which might oppose itself to it.<a name=4:13></a> It is Christ who saves, not the law.<a name=4:14></a> Israel, to whom God committed the care of this law, had transgressed it in making a golden calf even before Moses had come down from the mount with the tables upon which God had engraved it.<a name=4:15></a> The patience of God, however, still shewed itself in sending prophets to put Israel in remembrance of the requirements of the law, and of the goodness of God, proclaiming with increasing light the accomplishment of the promise of the Messiah.<a name=4:16></a> Israel despised their warnings and their testimony.<a name=4:17></a> At last John the Baptist, herald of the King of Israel, of the Christ of God, arrives; and soon after the Lord Himself appeared on the scene.<a name=4:18></a> "I have yet my Son, my only Son," said God, proclaiming Himself under the figure of a parable -- "they will reverence my Son.<a name=4:19></a>"

		We all know what happened to the Man of sorrows.<a name=5:1></a> "Behold," said the husbandmen (to use still the words of the parable), "Behold the heir!<a name=5:2></a> come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.<a name=5:3></a>" The Son of God appeared -- they spat in His face, and crucified Him.<a name=5:4></a> Such is the history of the world: is man wicked or not?<a name=5:5></a> And consider what the Son of man was -- it was no more the law; for, although the Son was born, in His grace, under the law, He was the manifestation of the love and of the goodness of God, even towards those who had transgressed it.<a name=5:6></a> He did them good -- He did not impute their sins to them.<a name=5:7></a> It was God in the midst of men and their misery -- God delivering them from it without imputing to them the sin that had brought them there.<a name=5:8></a> He required nothing, bore everything, and healed their sick.<a name=5:9></a> He gave to eat to those that were hungry; He raised their dead.<a name=5:10></a> It was power and divine love; but it was the light, it was God Himself; and whatever His goodness might be, man would not have Him.<a name=5:11></a>

		The Jew alas!<a name=5:12></a> hated Him; the Gentile, despising Him, rid himself of Him, to avoid the tumult raised by the jealousy of the Jews: all, unknown to themselves, accomplished the will and the counsels of God.<a name=5:13></a> The crime, without parallel, which the sin of man committed, was the testimony and the accomplishment of the perfect love of God.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The victim of propitiation was sacrificed.<a name=5:15></a> The blood which redeemed, which accomplished our salvation, was spilt.<a name=5:16></a> Man had been left without law -- corruption and violence had characterised the world.<a name=5:17></a> Man had been put under the law, with all the privileges of the presence of God in His temple, with the testimony of the prophets, the ordinances and the direct government of God; he had transgressed the law, despised the prophets, and forsaken God for idols of his own choice.<a name=5:18></a> The Son of God Himself, God manifested in the flesh, had appeared on the scene of misery which man had created for himself by his own sin, the testimony of the infinite goodness of God.<a name=5:19></a> The world knew Him not, the Jews would not have Him -- they all united together in rising against the Lord and His Anointed.<a name=5:20></a> They spat in His face and crucified Him; they hated Him without a cause.<a name=5:21></a> Sad picture!<a name=5:22></a> We prefer our own way to everything.<a name=5:23></a> Thus man has been tested in every way -- the tree was bad.<a name=5:24></a> Now comes the question.<a name=5:25></a> What will God be with regard to man, wicked man?<a name=5:26></a> A just Judge doubtless, of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, to look at sin.<a name=5:27></a> Grace and love will He be before He begins with judgment.<a name=5:28></a>

		It is here that the epistle to the Romans begins its instruction, addressing the Gentiles on the one hand, and the Jews on the other.<a name=6:1></a> Let us sum up in a few words the thread of thoughts which the Holy Spirit presents us with in this important part of the word of God.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1, after having announced Christ as the Son of David, heir of the promises made to Israel, and Son of God in power, addressing himself affectionately to the Christians at Rome, he proclaims at once the gospel as the power of God unto salvation, to the Jew first; and also to the Gentile, because a righteousness of God is revealed therein.<a name=6:3></a> Man had none for God; God has one in His grace for man, sinful and wretched man.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if God has revealed it as a righteousness which is His own, and which He has made available for man; if God, I say, has revealed it as a righteousness perfect and accomplished on His part, it is through faith that we must receive it.<a name=6:5></a> It is faith which receives a revelation; it is faith which lays hold of and trusts to an accomplished fact.<a name=6:6></a> The apostle Paul asserts that the wrath of God is revealed against all unrighteousness.<a name=6:7></a> What was there else amongst the heathen?<a name=6:8></a> Against all ungodliness in men who held the truth in ungodliness.<a name=6:9></a> Had not such been the case with the Jews up to that day?<a name=6:10></a> And may we not add now, alas, with many of the most orthodox persons who call themselves Christians.<a name=6:11></a> The patience of God had lasted long, but He has fully revealed Himself in Christ, and every sin whatsoever, put into the light, is unbearable.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the course of chapters 1 and 2, the apostle shews the horrible iniquity which characterised the state of the heathen, and the culpability of the Jews.<a name=6:13></a> Noah's family had known God; his descendants would not retain this knowledge.<a name=6:14></a> Proofs also of scripture, and of the power of the only true God, surrounded them everywhere!<a name=6:15></a> They were inexcusable.<a name=6:16></a> They had degraded the very idea of God.<a name=6:17></a> They were left to degrade themselves.<a name=6:18></a> Philosophers and moralists judged well of this state of things.<a name=6:19></a> Were they changed themselves?<a name=6:20></a> By no means.<a name=6:21></a> Could God accept of such things?<a name=6:22></a> Surely not.<a name=6:23></a> What of the Jews who boasted of the law, and wished to be the instructors of the ignorant?<a name=6:24></a> They transgressed the law of which they boasted, and the name of God was blasphemed among the heathen through their means.<a name=6:25></a>

		It was not the outward appearance of man that was of any value in the eyes of God.<a name=7:1></a> He looks at the heart.<a name=7:2></a> Did the apostle deny then the privileges the Jews had above the heathen?<a name=7:3></a> By no means.<a name=7:4></a> But the possession of religious privileges renders those who do not profit thereby more guilty; so likewise the doctrine of Christ renders more culpable those who possess it, if they are not real and living Christians.<a name=7:5></a> Now the apostle shews to the Jews, by passages taken from their own scriptures, that they were condemned; so that, he says, every mouth is stopped, and the whole world stands guilty before God.<a name=7:6></a> By the works of the law shall no man be justified before God, for those who had the privilege of that law were so much the more guilty in that they had transgressed it.<a name=7:7></a> Who can stand before the law of God?<a name=7:8></a> Who can say, "I have not transgressed it!<a name=7:9></a>" How can one justify oneself by a law one has transgressed?<a name=7:10></a> By the law is the knowledge of sin.<a name=7:11></a> What is to be done?<a name=7:12></a> Hear what the apostle says: "But now the righteousness of God without the law is made manifest, being witnessed to by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.<a name=7:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the precious blood of Christ, the Lamb of God, which is the only answer (which God Himself has furnished to us) to the demand of the justice which condemns the sinner.<a name=7:14></a> It is the righteousness of God by Jesus that makes righteous the man who has no righteousness to present to God, so that God is just in justifying him that has faith in Jesus.<a name=7:15></a> What grace!<a name=7:16></a> What a blessing for the poor sinner who has a heart broken enough and cleansed, sufficiently true for him to condemn himself!<a name=7:17></a> Boasting is excluded through faith in Jesus.<a name=7:18></a> We have now summed up the great principles of the first three chapters.<a name=7:19></a>

		In chapter 4 the apostle, in reasoning with the Jew, presents to us other considerations in support of the divine thesis which he treats of.<a name=8:1></a> What shall we say of Abraham, the honoured and recognised chief of Israel, and the father of the faithful?<a name=8:2></a> He was justified by faith before the law was given, before even he himself was circumcised.<a name=8:3></a> But this is not all.<a name=8:4></a> On what did he himself rest?<a name=8:5></a> On the power of God who raises the dead.<a name=8:6></a> For there he was, as to the promise that was made to him; and this was imputed to him for righteousness.<a name=8:7></a> "If we believe in him who has raised Jesus from among the dead.<a name=8:8></a>" That is to say, faith is in Him who, not only by the blood of the precious Saviour has satisfied the demands of the justice of God; but (when Jesus has borne in our place the punishment due to sin, has borne our sins in His own body on the tree, has been delivered for our offences and died for us) God, in His mighty power, raised Him, and has there done with our sins once for all, and has placed us (who believe in Jesus) in Him, in His presence, fully justified by means of what Jesus has done, since He has done it for those who believe.<a name=8:9></a> In believing, therefore, in this work of Jesus, we know that He has taken away our sins, and has placed us in the actual enjoyment of the favour and of the grace of God, before whom we find ourselves according to the efficacy of the work of Christ, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<a name=8:10></a> This is what chapter 5 reveals to us.<a name=8:11></a> There also we find two principles of infinite importance.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love of God does not find any motive in us, but in Himself, in His nature, all the while that it finds the occasion of displaying itself in our misery.<a name=8:13></a> The gospel is the glad tidings, that the love of God has made provision of a perfect righteousness in Christ Jesus for poor sinners who had none-a righteousness which we enjoy through faith in Jesus, so that all is a gift -- all is gratuitous -- to Jesus belongs all the glory-He alone is worthy.<a name=8:14></a> We are made partakers of it through grace.<a name=8:15></a> Perhaps a man would die for a good man.<a name=8:16></a> It was when we were yet without strength that Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=8:17></a> We may reckon on that love.<a name=8:18></a> If God has reconciled us by the death of Jesus when we were enemies, He will save us to the end through His life.<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second principle in this chapter is, that the question is not only concerning the law, we must go back as far as Adam, the head of the human race.<a name=8:20></a> All fell and were ruined in him, having superadded, at the same time, their own sins -- "The law entered to make the offence abound.<a name=8:21></a>" Sin was already known as a principle: the law in forbidding it, made of it an offence, a positive and formal transgression of every act which sin has produced in us.<a name=8:22></a> But God be blessed!<a name=8:23></a> Where sin abounded, grace has much more abounded.<a name=8:24></a> But as by the disobedience of one (that is to say, Adam) many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one (we are made just through the obedience of Jesus) many shall be justified; so that as sin has reigned in death, grace has reigned through righteousness unto life eternal by Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=8:25></a>

		Now the unbeliever, man's wicked heart, may be ready to say here, "Ah!<a name=9:1></a> since it is through the obedience of One that we are constituted righteous from being unrighteous, which I am; and since where sin abounded grace has much more abounded, let us sin that grace may abound.<a name=9:2></a>" Doubtless that is what the flesh likes.<a name=9:3></a> Here is the answer of the apostle.<a name=9:4></a> How are you made a partaker of this divine righteousness in Christ?<a name=9:5></a> It is because He has died to sin, that He has done with sin in His death (He, who always was without sin), and that He is risen; and that you have been baptised unto His death, in order that you might thus have part in His resurrection.<a name=9:6></a> Now if you are dead to sin by faith in Him (and that is what faith would say, that is the meaning of your baptism), how live in sin?<a name=9:7></a> You have no part in the death of Christ if you still live in the flesh.<a name=9:8></a> If you are made partaker of justification, it is in Christ, by the power of the life in which He is risen.<a name=9:9></a> To have part in Christ as being dead and risen, is not to live in sin, but quite the contrary.<a name=9:10></a> So that to enjoy this perfect justification in the soul implies necessarily the death to sin and the life of God in the soul, because we possess this justification in Him alone, who, for us, has died to sin once, and lives to God always.<a name=9:11></a> But what is to be done with the law?<a name=9:12></a> Here is the answer.<a name=9:13></a> We have shewn that the true Christian is dead with Christ, being made a partaker with Him who died on the cross.<a name=9:14></a> Now, the law knows not how to accuse a dead man: so that instead of being condemned by the law as sinners, we live (as of a new life) unto God, in order to glorify Him by good fruits, which we bear by His grace, being already fully justified by the work of Christ Himself.<a name=9:15></a>

		At the end of chapter 7, the apostle pictures the inward conflict which is found in a soul, which, being renewed, loves the righteousness of the law; and in its desire to fulfil it, makes experience of its own weakness and want of capacity, and which has not yet learned, notwithstanding its sincerity, to submit itself to the righteousness of God -- a righteousness already accomplished through grace.<a name=10:1></a> The moment it submits and seeks (not to do something to make itself better, but) the Deliverer, it is made free.<a name=10:2></a> The soul is made free -- fruit of grace -- when, instead of looking to itself, it looks to Jesus and to His work.<a name=10:3></a> It will never be satisfied with itself if it is sincere, and if it recognises what it ought to be before God.<a name=10:4></a> But God Himself is satisfied with Jesus, and with the work He has done for that poor soul.<a name=10:5></a> He has been fully glorified as to His love, as to His righteousness, as to His majesty and His claims for the obedience of man, as to His truth, in every way.<a name=10:6></a> God has been glorified in the work of Christ on the cross, and the soul can trust itself to it fully before God.<a name=10:7></a> There is, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Christ.<a name=10:8></a>

		Now if they are in Jesus Christ, what belongs to them?<a name=10:9></a> what characterises them?<a name=10:10></a> "NO CONDEMNATION.<a name=10:11></a>" -- Then they are made free from the law of sin and of death.<a name=10:12></a> Sin, as a principle of their nature, is no more a law to them.<a name=10:13></a> The conflict still continues; but sin is no more a law to us, because the power of the Spirit of life that is in Christ Jesus has made them free, which the law could not do because of the flesh.<a name=10:14></a> God has made for us, by the coming of Jesus, sacrifice for sin.<a name=10:15></a> He has condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=10:16></a> That is to say, the law could not get to the end in condemning this criminal, this rebel, who always justified himself in the flesh which nourished him, and which the law could not change.<a name=10:17></a> Now Christ, as sacrifice for sin, in delivering us from the imputation of sin, having taken it upon Himself, succeeded in condemning sin in our nature, while making us ourselves free from the condemnation.<a name=10:18></a>

		Having life in Him, sin is no more really as it was before; the believer, born of God, and quickened by the Spirit of life, loves the things which are of the Spirit; as those who are of the flesh love and seek after the things which are of the flesh.<a name=10:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we thus make this solemn discovery, that the affection of the flesh (that is to say, our whole nature before we are renewed) was enmity against God, and thus it was impossible that we should please God.<a name=10:20></a> Now it is evident that a real change of heart is necessary when the question is about enmity against God.<a name=10:21></a> For what art thou that provest that we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit?<a name=10:22></a> It is not something of man, it is that the Spirit of God dwelleth in us.<a name=10:23></a> But if it be thus, the body is not the source and the motive power of our life.<a name=10:24></a> It is considered dead, for it produces nothing but sin.<a name=10:25></a> It is the Spirit who is life, for He produces righteousness.<a name=10:26></a> Now we have this precious confidence, that if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus dwells in us, this same power operates likewise in us, and God will raise up again our mortal bodies by His Spirit which dwells in us.<a name=10:27></a>

		Now see the beautiful reasoning of the Spirit of God.<a name=11:12></a> If I am a child, then am I an heir, an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ.<a name=11:13></a> What titles to the glory!<a name=11:14></a> Then the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.<a name=11:15></a> Afterwards the creation itself, not only the soul, at the time of the glorification of the children, shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption.<a name=11:16></a> Grace delivers the soul from it now.<a name=11:17></a> Glory is about to deliver even creation itself.<a name=11:18></a> We have salvation.<a name=11:19></a> We are waiting for the redemption of the body.<a name=11:20></a> While waiting we have the earnest of the Spirit who dwells in us, and He groans in us according to God, and gives a voice to the actual sufferings of the creation, although often we ourselves know not what we should pray for -- to help us in our infirmities.<a name=11:21></a> Now God who searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit when He intercedes thus in us.<a name=11:22></a> Thus, in the real believer, who has submitted to the righteousness of God accomplished in Christ, the Holy Spirit dwells, as the spring of a faith holy and infinite, while giving me the consciousness of being a child of God and heir of the glory, and as Comforter amid the sufferings of the present time, urging the soul to seek relief in God, with groanings that cannot be uttered.<a name=11:23></a>

		Now in all this, that happy soul is the object of the thoughts and of the counsels of God.<a name=12:1></a> It is not of our own will that this has happened; neither the Gentile nor the Jew sought Jesus according to the Spirit.<a name=12:2></a> It is of grace.<a name=12:3></a> It is the counsels of the God of love.<a name=12:4></a> He makes all things work together for good -- for the very best -- to those who love Him, whom He has called according to His purpose.<a name=12:5></a> For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son -- what grace!<a name=12:6></a> -- that He might be the firstborn amongst many brethren.<a name=12:7></a> Those whom He did predestinate, them He also called, and whom He called, them He also justified, and whom He justified, them He also glorified.<a name=12:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here terminates the doctrine of the epistle properly so called.<a name=12:13></a> In the three chapters which follow, namely, chapters 9, 10, 11, the apostle answers an objection which an unbelieving Jew might very well make to trouble a sincere believer of his own nation.<a name=12:14></a> "If you say that there is no difference; that Jew and Gentile are equally sinners, and that we must, as being in the same abyss of condemnation, submit to God's righteousness; what do you do with the promise made to Israel?<a name=12:15></a> How reconcile the privileges of that people, as descendants of Abraham, with the complete levelling of everything, in order to make of all men, without distinction, a race of sinners in Adam?<a name=12:16></a>" In chapter 9 the apostle answers, "You cannot support your own thesis.<a name=12:17></a> If you trust to your descent from Abraham, without having respect to the sovereignty of God, you must admit Ishmael to the privileges of Israel; moreover you must admit the Edomites as the posterity of Esau.<a name=12:18></a>

		"God has been sovereign to your profit, and it is well He is so.<a name=13:1></a> Now, He will exercise this sovereignty in favour of some poor Gentile sinners, in calling some to participate in the salvation by Christ.<a name=13:2></a> But if you will have righteousness, you have made the golden calf.<a name=13:3></a> God did spare you on the principle of His sovereignty -- the passage is quoted from Exodus, and it is what God told Moses on the occasion of the idolatry of Israel at Sinai -- 'I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion; and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.<a name=13:4></a>' Now, if He spared you on this principle, He will do likewise towards some poor Gentile sinners.<a name=13:5></a>"

		Afterwards, it is proved by the prophecies, how God had foretold that there would be only a little remnant that would be saved from among the Jews; that the nation would stumble upon the stumbling-stone, that is to say, upon Christ (He being the end of the law for righteousness to every believer), and that God had declared at the same time, that whosoever should call on the name of the Lord should be saved.<a name=13:6></a> Precious promise!<a name=13:7></a> Thereupon He shews that consequently the gospel was to be preached to all, that they might all call on the name of the Saviour.<a name=13:8></a> And he quotes the testimonies of the prophets against Israel as a proof of their rebellion against the gospel of Christ.<a name=13:9></a> In chapter 11 He asks, "Will the promises of God fail towards this people?<a name=13:10></a>" By no means.<a name=13:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the chapters following the apostle rests on these principles (mercy in God) -- exhortations to a walk that responded to this goodness, and that sought only His perfect will with the intelligence of a renewed mind.<a name=13:16></a> He exhorts them to moderation, to meekness, to use their spiritual gifts, whatever that might be, with diligence, confining themselves to what God had communicated to each of them, to the spirit of grace -- of kindness towards the saints that were in want, to patience when they suffered wrong ("vengeance belongeth to God"), to submission under the authorities as being ordained of God; in short, to imitate Christ in their walk, and not to seek to satisfy the flesh.<a name=13:17></a> He sums up his doctrine in chapter 15, and confirms it by quotations taken from the Old Testament, and sends affectionate salutations to the Christians whom he personally knew at Rome.<a name=13:18></a>

		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following little work is composed of notes taken down from lectures, which had an entirely practical object.<a name=13:19></a> They have been corrected, as such notes generally need to be; but I have thought, as the aim was entirely practical, a short analysis of the structure of the epistle might help the reader in understanding it.<a name=13:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great subjects in scripture, when the truth is fully brought out as in the New Testament: the responsibility of the first Adam and his children; and the purposes of God in the last Adam.<a name=13:21></a> The work of Christ accomplished in His infinite love meets both for those that believe.<a name=13:22></a> He has met their responsibility in dying for them, and bearing their sins; and, glorifying God in that death, laid the ground of the accomplishment of those purposes in their favour.<a name=13:23></a> Of this latter part, the epistle to Romans only just leads us to the edge in chapter 8, and the very last verses of the epistle.<a name=13:24></a> The epistle to the Ephesians unfolds it fully.<a name=13:25></a> Hence the epistle to the Romans considers men as walking in sins -- the Ephesians as dead in them, and establishes the truth of a new creation, not the justifying of a sinner, though sealing that truth.<a name=13:26></a> Colossians is between both.<a name=13:27></a> This I cannot go farther into here.<a name=13:28></a> These truths are incidentally mentioned in other parts of the New Testament.<a name=13:29></a> But the structure of the epistle to the Romans is very important as to the truth it contains, and this I will now endeavour to point out.<a name=13:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first 17 verses of chapter 1 are a kind of preface, in which, in the first instance, the person of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, is put forward as the primary subject of the gospel: seed of David according to the flesh, and so fulfilment of the promise, and proved Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, in which, while His life was according to that power, resurrection was the proof of it, so that power was witnessed as well as promise fulfilled, and that in the place of man's weakness and Satan's power, and even where man in life was tempted.<a name=13:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the close of this passage he declares he was not ashamed of the gospel, for it was God's power to salvation to every one that believed, Jew first and then Greek.<a name=13:32></a> Because God's righteousness was revealed in it on the principle of faith, and so to faith wherever that faith was found.<a name=13:33></a> He was a willing debtor in grace to all, according to this gospel.<a name=13:34></a> He then shews why God's righteousness must be revealed, the only ground for man to stand on.<a name=13:35></a> Because the wrath of God was revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness where the truth was held in unrighteousness; not governmental judgments, as in the Old Testament, in Israel, and even in the flood, but the necessary rejection and judgment of all sin by the very nature of God.<a name=13:36></a> He then proceeds to shew the state of sinfulness which called for this wrath, and made this righteousness necessary.<a name=13:37></a>

		All are under sin.<a name=16:1></a> This reaches from chapter 1: 19 to chapter 3: 20, when he returns to the righteousness of God again.<a name=16:2></a> Gentiles are proved guilty, chapter 1: 19 to the end; moralists, chapter 2: 1-16, where responsibility and the place of conscience are dealt with; the Jews, chapters 2: 17 to 3: 20 (in the last section, verses 1-20, admitting their claim of the law as theirs, and addressed to them, and shewing what it said of them).<a name=16:3></a> Then, from verse 21, the righteousness of God is treated of, and declared in propitiation through Christ's blood for Old Testament past sins of believers, and present revelation of it, so that God was just, and justified believers.<a name=16:4></a> This only confirmed law in its requirements.<a name=16:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4.<a name=16:6></a> The resurrection of Christ is applied as the seal of this work, but it does not carry righteousness farther than forgiveness, and all applies to sins and offences -- things done when each individual has his own place.<a name=16:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 5: 1-11 draws the blessed conclusion, peace, favour wherein we stand, and hope of the glory of God; then glorying in tribulations, God's love being known for the profit derived, and finally in God Himself, through Jesus, through whom we have received the reconciliation.<a name=16:8></a> Here first the Holy Ghost, as given to us, comes in.<a name=16:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 12 of chapter 5, the apostle treats not of sins, where all must be individual, but of sin, and so heads all up in Adam and Christ, the disobedient man and the obedient man, and distinguishes the law as that which came in by the bye to make the offence abound; but what were really in question, were sin and grace -- grace reigning through righteousness by the obedience of Christ.<a name=16:10></a> The question here is not of sins, but of sin; one man's disobedience.<a name=16:11></a> not each man's offences, though the obedient man had to meet these too.<a name=16:12></a> But if one man's obedience made us righteous, might we live on in sin?<a name=16:13></a> This leads to the truth that the profession of Christianity was the profession of having a part in death, hence not of living on.<a name=16:14></a> Christ died to sin once and lives to God; we are to reckon ourselves dead and alive to God in Him.<a name=16:15></a> Thus the old man is counted dead: how shall we live in it?<a name=16:16></a> This sets us free -- free to live to God.<a name=16:17></a>

		Chapter 7 applies this to law, because law has power over a man only as long as he lives.<a name=17:1></a> We are dead to it by the body of Christ; and are married to another, Christ risen.<a name=17:2></a> The end of the chapter gives the salutary experience of the state of the renewed mind under the law, which leaves a man captive under the law of sin in his members.<a name=17:3></a> In Christ all is changed, the man is delivered, though the flesh, as such, would serve the law of sin; but (chapter 8) there is no condemnation in Christ, the power of life in Him has set us free, and sin in the flesh has been condemned when He died a sacrifice for sin.<a name=17:4></a> Then comes the Holy Ghost in us; first as the power of life and the new man, and deliverance into resurrection (verse 9-11), then His presence in us, a person dwelling in us.<a name=17:5></a> Being sons, He gives witness with our spirit that we are so, shews us the glory in hope, and helps us in our infirmities on the way, gives a voice in our hearts to the sorrows of a creation subject to vanity, of which we are a part as to our body.<a name=17:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 28 we have the security and portion in every respect derived from God's being for us, from His own foreknowledge, to glory itself.<a name=17:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 5: 1-11 gives what God is for sinners in grace and its fruit; chapter 8, the state of the delivered soul before Him.<a name=17:8></a> What leads up to the former being our sins met in grace, in Christ's propitiation -- to the latter, our sin from which we are delivered by our having died with Christ, and so being freed from it, and alive in Him.<a name=17:9></a> In the former case the sins are forgiven, in the latter the sin has been condemned, but in a sacrifice for sin, and we, having died with Christ, are delivered.<a name=17:10></a> This finishes the doctrine of the epistle -- the way in which God in grace has met the sins, and the sinful nature of man, his whole condition in Adam, through Christ.<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The place of chapters 9 to 11, as reconciling the obliteration of Jew and Gentile in Christ with the special promises to the Jews, is sufficiently indicated in the notes themselves.<a name=17:12></a> On the hortatory part which follows no notes were furnished me.<a name=17:13></a> I give here a general idea of the contents: the details must be learned from the chapters themselves.<a name=17:14></a>

		It begins with the principle of all practice connected with the doctrine of the epistle, which supposes man a sinful creature, and dealt with in grace.<a name=18:1></a> The Ephesians takes higher ground, as the Christian is there simply a new creation, and so associated with God; and as dear children, God's own ways and dealings are the principle and pattern of the Christian's walk.<a name=18:2></a> His works are fore-ordained, as is his place.<a name=18:3></a> See chapters 4 and 5, where God, as love and light, gives the measure of our ways.<a name=18:4></a> In Romans we have sinful man dealt with in mercy, the death of the old man being alone the means of walking aright.<a name=18:5></a> In both Ephesians and Romans Christ is the pattern in absolute giving up of self.<a name=18:6></a> "I beseech you," says the apostle, "by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice.<a name=18:7></a>" The two hinges of all Christian service -- the mercies of God, and our presenting ourselves, made free by grace, as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.<a name=18:8></a> The unity of the body is then assumed, which is no part of the doctrine of the epistle; any more than our resurrection with Christ, which involves it; on this are grounded our duties within amongst the saints, and as such.<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 13 gives our duties to those around, with a double motive: love to the neighbour fulfils the law, and the night far spent, the day at hand, full deliverance drawing near.<a name=18:10></a> Then in chapter 14 is our relation to Christ, and consequently to all who belong to Him, that we should not put stumbling-blocks before the feet of those with whom we are alike subject and responsible to Him, and for whom He died.<a name=18:11></a> This part goes down to the end of verse 7 of chapter 15.<a name=18:12></a> Then he sums up what he had been teaching concerning Jew and Gentile, to whom reference had been made in what precedes concerning the weak in faith.<a name=18:13></a>

		The whole closes with the statement of his thoughts and plans, and his salutations, which are more numerous than usual, as forming a link between him and the saints at Rome, whom he had never seen.<a name=18:14></a> The last verses of all are a statement of what the work was that was going on by his means according to eternal counsels, and now made known for the obedience of faith by prophetic scriptures.<a name=18:15></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up this epistle to the Romans, not with intention of entering into every detail, but to trace the general idea of the purpose of the Spirit of God in it, and the course of the apostle's reasoning.<a name=19:1></a> We have before noticed the distinction between the epistles of Paul and those of John.<a name=19:2></a> The main subject of John's epistles being the character of the divine life which was with the Father, manifested in the Son, and communicated to us through the Spirit -- so that the divine nature in us should be able to realise the affections of the child of God; of Paul's, the presenting of man to God.<a name=19:3></a> Thus the general scope of John's epistles is, first, the manifestation of the divine life; second, the communication of it; while Paul's epistles have another character altogether -- insisting on justification, and revealing the counsels and ways of God, and the consequent relationship in which the redeemed are put before Him.<a name=19:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great subject of the New Testament, besides the blessed person of the Lord and the revelation of God in Him, is the manifestation and communication of the divine life, the making us partakers of the divine nature, and the bringing man to God according to His righteousness and counsels in Christ.<a name=19:5></a> The child derives his life from his father, and there results not merely likeness of character but a peculiar relationship.<a name=19:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would just advert here to the four truths prominent in the New Testament:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		first, the manifestation and communication of life;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		second, the accomplishment in Christ of all the promises given from Adam downwards, presented in Christ to the Jews, His people;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		third, mercy to the Gentiles (as in Romans 15: 8, 9, Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers, and that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy);
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		fourth, our place as sons, and the church as united to Christ, its Head.<a name=19:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is especially in John's epistles -- the manifestation, then the communication, of the divine life.<a name=19:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second and third are found in Romans, with the groundwork of our place as sons, and only a glance in the second part at the fourth, which is fully brought out in Ephesians.<a name=19:9></a> The character of this is only hinted at practically, not taught, in Romans.<a name=19:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth point of truth, which is revealed in the epistle to the Ephesians, is distinct from the promises to the Jews and the mercy to the Gentiles, being a new thing, though connected with the latter.<a name=19:11></a> The seeing these distinctions greatly facilitates the understanding of the epistles, and clears up passages, otherwise obscure.<a name=19:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=20>[Page 20]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans we have two great subjects brought out: the accomplishment of the promises made to the Jews; and mercy to the Gentiles; and, in so doing this, Paul lays the foundation of all relationship between God and man.<a name=20:1></a> The beginning of this first chapter is thus an introduction to all that is afterwards unfolded in the epistle.<a name=20:2></a> Remark here, that in the first presentation of the gospel, it is the person, not the work, of Christ which is found in grace, but important as to the claim of subjection to Him, Son of David and Son of God with power.<a name=20:3></a> Then, in verse 16, he is not ashamed of the gospel, because the righteousness of God is revealed in it.<a name=20:4></a> The epistle to the Romans has this large character naturally enough, as it consists well with the address to the great centre of the world's empire; for Paul was writing to the Romans, whom he had never seen, as the apostle of the Gentiles, and takes his stand on the high ground of being the one to whom God had committed His counsels.<a name=20:5></a> So Peter, in addressing the Jews already scattered in the world, presents resurrection as a living hope, and, speaking to them on this new principle of resurrection, says, "as strangers and pilgrims," etc.<a name=20:6></a>, thus carrying on what was consequent upon it, in reference to those who are to participate in it.<a name=20:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a great many of the various epistles we see the instructions and exhortations suited to the varied need of those addressed and called out by their state: as, in Corinthians, moral evil is treated of; in Colossians, warning against slipping away from the Head; in Galatians, falling from grace through the adoption of the law, is insisted on; in Thessalonians, the coming of the Lord and the errors into which trouble of mind had thrown them in this respect.<a name=20:8></a> But the epistle to the Romans, being addressed to the capital of the world and to those with whose circumstances the apostle was not familiar, takes the wide scope of man's responsibility, Jew and Gentile, and how grace has met it, and lays the sure foundation of the relationship of man to God.<a name=20:9></a>

		There are two parts in the doctrinal teaching of this epistle.<a name=20:10></a> Up to the close of chapter 8 forms the first part; and chapters 9, 10, 11, form the second part; while the concluding chapters are occupied with precepts.<a name=20:11></a> In the first part you get Jews and Gentiles reduced to the common condition of sinners; but the Jew would object, and say, If this be so, that there is no difference between the Jew and the Gentile, how then is God to make good His promises to the Jews?<a name=20:12></a> This difficulty is answered in chapters 9-11, the infallibility of the promises of God being shewn in chapter 11.<a name=20:13></a> But the common ground, on which both Jews and Gentiles are set, is in perfect salvation in Christ Jesus, and remains in all its force.<a name=20:14></a> It is important to remark in this epistle the way in which Paul sets man aside as being proved a sinner, poor, vile, and lost, and that he does this to bring God in.<a name=20:15></a> It is not merely that he introduces man as a sinner, but man must be thoroughly put down, in order to bring in God Himself instead of man, that God may act toward man in His own way and according to His own character.<a name=20:16></a>

		We see a striking example of the same way of exhibiting grace in Ephesians 2.<a name=21:1></a> After the Jews and Gentiles had been spoken of as alike children of wrath, all is passed over, and God is brought out in His own character as rich in mercy, shewing what He has done, and what He is to such as they are.<a name=21:2></a> We can have no settled peace or rest of heart till we are on this ground; nor can we know God so as to trust Him, to rest in Him, and adore Him, till we prove Him thus.<a name=21:3></a> Then it is a settled question: our hope and trust are in God, as it is written, "who by him do believe in God.<a name=21:4></a>" Therefore the apostle does not say we are justified before God, though it be true, but it is God who justifies, that the heart might be brought to rest in God Himself.<a name=21:5></a> Paul, though righteous as to legal righteousness, had gone to the extreme extent of what sin really is: it was not a mere looseness of expression when he called himself the chief of sinners, for Paul in heart was the wickedest man that ever trod the earth; not, of course, guilty of immorality (as he says of himself, as touching the righteousness which is of the law he was blameless) "After the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee"; but he was the ardent enemy of Christ, and it was when he reached to the highest point of his wickedness, "being exceedingly mad against them," that at that moment he was "separated unto the gospel of God.<a name=21:6></a>" He knew what grace was.<a name=21:7></a>

		I will now rapidly go over, without entering into detail, what man is, and has shewn himself to be.<a name=21:8></a> Though cast out of paradise, God had borne with man, but at first left him to himself, though not without a testimony; but the result of leaving man to himself was such corruption and violence, that he must be destroyed from off the face of the earth.<a name=21:9></a> God put a close to his abominations by a flood.<a name=21:10></a> The promise having been given as a witness that grace was the true source of blessing, the law followed, and it was broken.<a name=21:11></a> The prophets came next, and they were rejected, stoned, and slain.<a name=21:12></a> And last of all God sent His Son: Him the world killed.<a name=21:13></a> It was not merely that man had broken the law, and slain the prophets, but when the goodness of God came, they hated Him revealed in goodness.<a name=21:14></a> Well, Jesus prays for His murderers, pleading their ignorance, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"; as in the case of one who owed ten thousand talents, and, forasmuch as he had nothing to pay, his lord forgave him the debt.<a name=21:15></a> (And this is what I take to be the meaning of the parable, though it has a general application.<a name=21:16></a>) So the Holy Ghost takes up again and carries on this very intercession of our Lord, when forgiveness of sins is preached by Peter at Jerusalem, saying, "And now brethren, I wot, that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers .<a name=21:17></a>.<a name=21:18></a>.<a name=21:19></a> repent ye therefore and be converted.<a name=21:20></a>" And what was the result?<a name=21:21></a> Did they repent?<a name=21:22></a> No; not only had they killed the Prince of Life, but they now fill up the measure of their iniquity in stoning Stephen, thus rejecting the testimony of the Holy Ghost to the grace and goodness of God in the gospel of Christ glorified, as in His humiliation.<a name=21:23></a>

		At this point it is that Saul of Tarsus comes out, and so mad against the followers of Christ that he was the very apostle of the enmity in the heart of man against the testimony of the Holy Ghost to the grace and goodness of God.<a name=22:1></a> But here God meets him in the way, and his mouth is closed as to goodness in man; for while all God's means were used to bring man's heart to return to Himself in blessing, Paul was found in the most active hostility to Him, being determined to put a stop to this testimony of grace and goodness if he could.<a name=22:2></a> Then the Lord appears to him in glory in connection with the church, owning all the saints as Himself, "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=22:3></a>" -- "for he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=22:4></a>" Thus Paul sets out as being the leader of the active energy of man in opposition to God, that he might be a perfect witness of the grace that overcame him, as he anew sets out on his way testifying that there is grace and forgiveness for one such as he.<a name=22:5></a> Everything that could have religiously sustained his heart was broken down when God met him by the way.<a name=22:6></a> Take conscience, for instance: outwardly he was blameless, yet thought he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.<a name=22:7></a> How terrible must it have been to Paul to find that his natural conscience, blameless as it was, had left him all wrong, as of no avail!<a name=22:8></a> We know that he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink, so terrible was the upsetting of his soul.<a name=22:9></a> Then take the law, his boast and glory as divinely given: it had been his ruin before God in self-righteous enmity to Christ.<a name=22:10></a> The religious teachers he had looked up to, the priests and Pharisees, and his own zeal, had only brought him into opposition and open rebellion against God.<a name=22:11></a> Everything in which his heart had trusted left him a mere sinner, naked in the presence of the glory of God, his enmity only the greater by that trust.<a name=22:12></a> Thus ended all means, leaving Paul a "child of wrath," as he says, "even as others.<a name=22:13></a>"

		The Jews accused the Lord of breaking the sabbath, the sabbath being the sign of the covenant between God and His people, and to be kept the seventh day, a rest connected with the first creation.<a name=23:6></a> God's rest is at the end of labour.<a name=23:7></a> It was founded in Israel on the principle of the law.<a name=23:8></a> Man's labour in righteousness gave him rest at the end.<a name=23:9></a> But in fact, when divine truth came in, we find in John 5: 17 there was no sabbath for Christ in this world.<a name=23:10></a> Sin had come in, and there is no rest for God where sin is: "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<a name=23:11></a>" Thus He had come down where sin was, and He was working in the accomplishment of that grace, which gives a better rest to man.<a name=23:12></a> Paul comes in here as the servant, or slave, bound to the work: a bondman to Christ, separated unto the gospel of God; that was his business, and if he could further the gospel by making tents, of course he would continue to make them; but he was an apostle called to the gospel of God.<a name=23:13></a> And where God gives ministry, it is as the vessels of God's activity in grace, for the calling of sinners and the building up and edification of His saints.<a name=23:14></a>

		It is very important to distinguish between teaching the church, and the testimony of grace to the world.<a name=24:1></a> The Old Testament is full of mercy; but even so there could yet be no proclamation of an accomplished work of redemption.<a name=24:2></a> But further, that is not the church (nor indeed is the church the doctrinal subject in this epistle).<a name=24:3></a> It was what He had promised afore by His prophets in the holy scriptures.<a name=24:4></a> The church was not the subject of promise, but the "gospel of God" was: from the beginning it had been said, the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.<a name=24:5></a> The Gentiles had not the promises, though there were special ones to the Jews.<a name=24:6></a> The promises of God were made to the second Adam, and not to the first; the promise in Genesis that the serpent's head should be bruised was made to the Seed of the woman, which Adam was not.<a name=24:7></a> So it is said: to Abraham were the promises made, and to his seed; and that Seed was Christ.<a name=24:8></a> The promises, then, were entirely connected with Christ, who is the Seed in whom all these promises centre.<a name=24:9></a> The person of Christ, as we see here, is the great subject of the gospel even before His work, though we could have no part with Him without His work.<a name=24:10></a> This is of all importance, as God is now claiming subjection to His Son.<a name=24:11></a> There is not an infidel or a rebel, however great, who shall not bow the knee to Jesus; if in grace, it is salvation: but, if the heart does not bow to the grace, the knee must bow under the judgment.<a name=24:12></a>

		In verse 3, "concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh," the apostle is bringing out the double character of the Lord.<a name=24:13></a> In verse I we have the person of the Son as the subject of the gospel; then, secondly, as the seed of David according to the flesh, according to promise.<a name=24:14></a> Then Paul brings out definitely the character of the Son, "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.<a name=24:15></a>" Thus we have the Son of God with divine power, though clothed with humiliation.<a name=24:16></a> Then, again, we have the Son coming down in the midst of defilement with divine power, passing through it according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=24:17></a> This was shewn through all His life by absolute separation from all defilement.<a name=24:18></a> He passed through the whole scene of evil untouched and unsullied by sin, though in contact with it, touching those in it all around, yet separate Himself.<a name=24:19></a> He touches the leper, who saw His power, but was uncertain of His goodness: and was He defiled?<a name=24:20></a> No!<a name=24:21></a> but in touching it He chases away the uncleanness without becoming unclean Himself, and none but the Son of God could do this.<a name=24:22></a> But His was perfect grace coming down into the defilement, banishing and dispelling it, without receiving it Himself.<a name=24:23></a>

		But, besides sin and defilement in us, the manifested power of Satan was this -- that he had the power of death, and this Satan had on man by the judgment of God Himself; for God had said, "In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.<a name=25:1></a>" Thus man was under the power of him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; and if the Son of God is to deliver man from under the power of Satan, He Himself must go down to his stronghold, this last citadel of Satan.<a name=25:2></a> He must Himself go down under the power of death, if He could not be holden of it, that He might "deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage"; and He, the Son of God, feared it, as He piously should, as the judgment of God (Hebrews 5); but He was heard in that He feared; He bore it as the judgment of God, but He broke all the bars by which Satan held us, and He has set us free.<a name=25:3></a> Satan committed himself entirely by putting his hand on the spotless person of the Prince of Life, who bore our sins; and in His rising from the dead, the sins, and Satan's power, were all gone before God and for faith.<a name=25:4></a>

		If Christ said, "It is my meat to do the will of him that sent me," Paul could say, through grace, "whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son.<a name=28:1></a>" It is not service at all, if it be merely outward; unless we can say, "Of thine own we have given thee.<a name=28:2></a>" All true service must flow from communion with the source of service; it is no service if we are not drinking in Christ, and conscious that we are doing His will; if I should take up any service, without being confident that God would have me do it, there would be no power in it Service then, if real, must flow from direct communion with God.<a name=28:3></a> We may go on in a course of action as a consequence of communion for a good while.<a name=28:4></a> Thus, for instance, we may compare the state of the Thessalonians with that of the church of Ephesus in Revelation.<a name=28:5></a> To the Thessalonians it is said by Paul, that he knows their work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope: here we see the three cardinal points -- faith, hope, and charity, as springs of work, labour, and patience; but not so in the address of the Lord to Ephesus -- it was work, labour, and patience; but there was not the present spiritual power, which comes from God direct, therefore the candlestick was threatened to be removed.<a name=28:6></a> How often do our attempts at service flow more from thought of something we may have to do, than from direct communion with God!<a name=28:7></a> It then becomes, or is in danger of soon becoming, the mere activity of the flesh, and at any rate is the drudgery of duty without power, instead of serving with the spirit; what a comfort that all my life through I may be serving the Lord with my spirit!<a name=28:8></a>

		I take the close of chapter 3 as being the summing up, and application of the apostle's argument, drawn from the sin of the Jews and Gentiles; then in chapter 4 he passes on to another principle, as brought out in the testimony of Abraham and David.<a name=30:16></a> But in this first part of the epistle the apostle opens out man's need, and the way in which it had been met by redemption, as that on which alone the soul could rest.<a name=30:17></a> Having in chapter 1, from verse 18, gone through the horrible evil of the Gentiles and man generally throughout the world, and shewing that without any subsequent revelation, through the knowledge of God possessed by Noah, and God's dealings with men through the creation, God being to be understood by the things that are made in His eternal power and Godhead, they were left (chapter 1) without excuse, conscience itself telling them what was right and wrong, and that hence, as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, He gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts; for if a man is left alone of God, he always turns to the lust of his own heart.<a name=30:18></a> Thus God in judgment brought upon them, that as they had not discerned what became God, they should not be able to discern what became man.<a name=30:19></a>

		It is God's way, when the light He gives is rejected, to give men up to blindness, and this giving up by God is an act of judgment on God's part; as these Gentiles, not liking to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.<a name=31:1></a> It was so with the Jews; rejecting the testimony God had given them, God says by the mouth of the prophets "make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy," etc.<a name=31:2></a>; of the Gentiles it is said, "who changed the truth of God into a lie"; so of the professing church, fallen from the light, God says, "I will send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.<a name=31:3></a>" Thus we see, whether Jews, or Gentiles, or nominal Christians, the effect of man being given up of God -- what man is when left to himself, and the judgment of God in his neglect or abuse of light.<a name=31:4></a> Natural light was given in the beginning in the testimony of creation, and man began with the knowledge of God as thus dealing with him; but men did not like to retain God in their knowledge.<a name=31:5></a> There is the pleading, too, of conscience, for every man has a conscience, distinct from grace.<a name=31:6></a> But conscience cannot bring us to God.<a name=31:7></a> Conscience is the sense of responsibility, united to the knowledge of good and evil, and this last part acquired in the fall.<a name=31:8></a> But we must remember, if the conscience becomes awakened, it is not life and peace, and therefore only drives us away from God, like Adam in the garden hiding himself from God.<a name=31:9></a>

		As the Gentiles did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.<a name=31:10></a> So the Jews, having been disobedient to God's testimony, sentence is passed upon them by Isaiah seven hundred years before it was accomplished: "Make the heart of this people fat," etc.<a name=31:11></a>, for such is the patience of God; as Stephen also says, "Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost, as your fathers did [in the past dispensation], so do ye [in this dispensation].<a name=31:12></a>" Both guilty of the same sin, and according to Peter's testimony of the witness given to Jesus, those very things by which Christ was testified to have come from God, will be the very thing that will lead the Jews to receive the false Christ in the latter day.<a name=31:13></a> "Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know," Acts 2: 22.<a name=31:14></a> Compare this with 2 Thessalonians 2: 8, "Then shall that wicked one be revealed .<a name=31:15></a>.<a name=31:16></a>.<a name=31:17></a> with all power [miracles], and signs, and lying wonders.<a name=31:18></a>" Thus as the Jews rejected what God did in their midst by Jesus of Nazareth; so they will receive what Satan will do by that wicked one; and all this, as the apostle goes on to say, because they received not the love of the truth.<a name=31:19></a>

		As in chapter 1: 18-32; and chapter 2: 1-16, all the Gentiles are brought in guilty, so, in spite of real privileges, the Jew: from chapter 2: 17, and then from chapter 3: 9-18, we find all are under sin -- the Jew under law, as well as the Gentile without law.<a name=32:1></a> Both are alike equally guilty; for if the Gentiles be given over to a reprobate mind, the Jew is proved by his own scriptures, which he boasted belonged to him only, to be just as bad.<a name=32:2></a> Thus, there is none righteous, no, not one; there is no understanding; none that seeketh God, the will being gone wrong; blind in mind, and perverse in will, and guilty before God; not only as to the nature being sinful, but as slighting the testimony, rejecting the light which God had from time to time revealed to them.<a name=32:3></a> But the God of judgment was there, and now it is proved that by the deeds of the law no flesh can be saved, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<a name=32:4></a> Thus we see how those under the law are brought under condemnation, as well as the heathen they despised; it is useless for a Jew to attempt to get in by his own condition, for the law he boasted in condemns him.<a name=32:5></a> If it applied to him, it condemned him it applied to.<a name=32:6></a> The Gentiles have no right to put themselves under the law; but we all do so somehow or other; and as a process it may turn to good in the conviction of sin; but as a position, and if we stay in it, see where it brings us!<a name=32:7></a> "The Lord looked down upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand and seek after God.<a name=32:8></a>" No; they have all gone out of the way; and the Jew learnt by the law which he claimed, and with reason, to belong to him only, that on his own ground he was utterly guilty, though the apostle does not here bring against them their hardness of heart in rejecting Christ; and thus both Jew and Gentile are alike thoroughly guilty, and every mouth stopped.<a name=32:9></a> Such is the end of man's righteousness.<a name=32:10></a>

		But now by grace all is changed.<a name=33:1></a> The righteousness of God without law is revealed, and the apostle then develops this truth very fully, as far as its principles go.<a name=33:2></a> In point of fact, this joins on to chapter 1: 17, the intermediate verses giving the proof of what made God's righteousness necessary.<a name=33:3></a> He states the nature of this righteousness in a direct and absolute manner, and in contrast with man's.<a name=33:4></a> It is altogether on a different principle; it is righteousness, not even mercy, though the fruit of grace, but it is a righteousness without law at all; it is God's righteousness, and who can give law to Him?<a name=33:5></a> Had it been man's righteousness, law would have been the measure and principle of it; but being God's righteousness, it is altogether on a different principle from law, As man stood in sin, God's law only condemned him, and it cannot give life.<a name=33:6></a> Put a man under righteous obligation, and it is all over with him, because man is a sinner.<a name=33:7></a> Man has a will (I speak practically, not metaphysically), and law brings it out; and man's will never submits, for it would cease to be a will if it did; it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=33:8></a> God never meant righteousness to be by the law; it would have been cruelly mocking man, who is a sinner, to have proposed it to him.<a name=33:9></a> The law was given, that the offence might abound -- not that sin might abound, for sin was there before the law was given; but it is not offence, or transgression, until there is a law; and thus it is that the law worketh wrath, for where no law is, there is no transgression.<a name=33:10></a>

		In referring to Abraham, who had nothing to do with law, we find the double character of faith, its nature, and its particular object in the Christian; in the second character of justification, he says, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.<a name=35:1></a>" It is not here said that he believed in God, but he believed God.<a name=35:2></a> Such is faith in its subjective elementary character; we set to our seal that God is true; and that is how Abraham got his righteousness.<a name=35:3></a> It was not man's working, but one that worked not.<a name=35:4></a> But the word of God reveals God Himself, and God in grace; hence, though there may be much struggling first, when we simply believe God, we believe in Him that justifies the ungodly, and of such David describes the blessedness.<a name=35:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the character of our faith is carried farther here; the object is God who raised the dead.<a name=35:6></a> Our confidence is a righteous one: we believe on One who raised up Him who had been delivered for our offences -- raised for our justification.<a name=35:7></a> But there is this difference between Abraham's faith and ours.<a name=35:8></a> He believed in God's power to fulfil His word.<a name=35:9></a> We believe that God has raised up Jesus after He had stood in our place 'as sinners.<a name=35:10></a> We have thus the resurrection of Christ applied to our justification.<a name=35:11></a> Yet in all this part of the epistle justification does not go beyond forgiveness, as chapter 4 plainly shews.<a name=35:12></a> Righteousness goes farther, but not what we have here.<a name=35:13></a> Here we have the active clearing away of all the guilt that attached to the deeds of the old man.<a name=35:14></a> This completes the work of grace for us, as responsible beings.<a name=35:15></a> The effect is, we have peace, stand in divine favour, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God; we glory in tribulation by the way, for it is for our good, and we have the key to all in the love of God, shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given to us.<a name=35:16></a> Besides, we joy in God Himself, thus revealed in the perfectness of His grace towards us when we were sinners.<a name=35:17></a>

		Having shewn thus the result of grace, in the beginning of chapter 5, in the way in which God justified each individual sinner, passing by sins, the apostle turns to the headship of the two Adams, and shews where the law came in.<a name=35:18></a> Our place is not in the first, not under the law, but in the second, according to the efficacy of the work He had wrought.<a name=35:19></a> What went before applied to our sins.<a name=35:20></a> Now he speaks of our nature and place.<a name=35:21></a>

		I will summarily review his reasonings founded on this, before entering into detail.<a name=36:1></a> The disobedience of one made the many sinners -- the obedience of One constitutes the many connected with Him righteous, and thus we are righteous by the work of another.<a name=36:2></a> In chapter 6 he goes on to notice that some will say, "Oh, if Christ has done all, it is no matter what I do: if it is righteousness without works, then we may walk as we like.<a name=36:3></a>" The answer is, not "That ought not to be," but "That cannot be," for we speak of death -- I have part in righteousness by death.<a name=36:4></a> If the thing be real, I cannot live in what I am dead to, and that makes this become impossible; if I live, being thus dead, it is by being alive to God, in Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=36:5></a> A new and holy life (for it is Christ in the power of resurrection) brings with it, not only hatred of sin, but deliverance; the same principle is applied to law in chapter 7.<a name=36:6></a> If I am dead to the law by the body of Christ, I am delivered from that which had power over me while I was alive, that I may walk in newness of life.<a name=36:7></a>

		We have the application of Christ's death and resurrection to man, for his justification before God, in the beginning of chapter 5; as dead to sin and consequently leading a holy life, in chapter 6; as dead to the law in chapter 7.<a name=36:8></a> The law, as Galatians also teaches us, has killed you, therefore it can do no more; its greatest work was, so to speak, to kill Christ, as in grace taking its curse; but He rose again, and we are in Him beyond the law -- in Him who had borne its curse.<a name=36:9></a> Thereupon chapter 8 brings out the Christian in perfect liberty, in the last Adam of chapter 5 in virtue of His being risen.<a name=36:10></a> There is no condemnation for him who is in Christ.<a name=36:11></a> The Christian is necessarily viewed in Christ in chapter 8, but resurrection with Christ is not developed in Romans as a doctrine.<a name=36:12></a> The power of a new life in the Spirit is stated in verse 2; the condemnation of flesh on the cross, so as to put an end to that for faith and before God; our affections consequently shewing our life in Him.<a name=36:13></a> Being thus fully and freely justified and accepted in Christ, we are only waiting for the redemption of our bodies.<a name=36:14></a>

		In the next chapter we get, as the certain effect of this newness of life, the principle of death and resurrection brought forward.<a name=50:6></a> But if you do not see the need of your having righteousness in Christ you do not know yourselves, you do not know the holiness of God's heart, and the unholiness of your own.<a name=50:7></a> Christ's death may be considered as in itself glorifying God, apart from its results; but we have the double effect or aspect of the death of Christ shewn in the two goats, one of which was the Lord's lot, and the other was for the bearing away into a land of forgetfulness the sins of the people; the first was for the glory of God, the second for the sins of the sinner, in the conscience of what he had done -- both were needed.<a name=50:8></a> I have sinned, says the awakened conscience; but all my sins were laid on Christ, says the believer.<a name=50:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 20.<a name=50:10></a> The entering in of law was that the offence might abound; wherefore the law?<a name=50:11></a> not to make sin abound, but to make sin exceeding sinful, and that the offence might abound, "but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound," and abounding grace has been shewn, for God gave His own well-beloved Son: and sin was suffered to rise up to its full wickedness, even in putting Christ to death, and then to shew how powerless sin is in the presence of God's grace, that very thing, in which its greatest evil was shewn as hatred against God, is that which puts it all away; God's grace rolls over it all, yet thus in righteousness.<a name=50:12></a> He has thus shewn the utter impotency of sin in His presence.<a name=50:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not said righteousness reigned: if it had, it would have been for the eternal condemnation of all (righteousness will reign when He comes in judgment), but now grace reigns through righteousness, grace goes on in spite of all the neglect in men's hearts to it -- it reigns; it does not give up its ways and purposes; grace reigns over sin, man is unable to get the mastery over Christ's love but Christ's love overcomes man -- it overcame everything that lay in the way of His fulfilling His Father's will, and His obedience overcame everything; grace reigned on the cross, yet righteousness was there; grace reigns in the subjection of our hearts -- where sin did reign, grace reigns.<a name=50:14></a> Grace means love working where there is evil.<a name=50:15></a> How?<a name=50:16></a> By the obedience of One: hence, it is through righteousness.<a name=50:17></a>

		Then if there is the reign of grace in the heart, there must be practical holiness, a righteousness consistent with it; if God's love works in the heart, it is to produce in it something like Himself.<a name=51:1></a> His love is such as has never been seen before in heaven or on earth.<a name=51:2></a> His perfect love and grace, and righteousness bring out what God is, Christ is grace reigning: and God has the upper hand even as to our sins, and has put them away.<a name=51:3></a>

		CHAPTER 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get in this chapter the practical application of the great principle of which the apostle has been speaking at the end of the preceding chapter, namely, our connection with the second Adam, as previously with the first.<a name=51:4></a> We shall see that it is practical in its nature, and we shall do well to see the double aspect of it; the power of practice and the real groundwork of that power.<a name=51:5></a> Liberty is always the ground on which grace sets us, and liberty is the only ground of the Holy Ghost's power.<a name=51:6></a> Liberty is that to which we are called, it is not slavery, even unto holiness, but liberty always, but that liberty death to sin.<a name=51:7></a> The apostle first sets forth the ground simply and clearly, and then proceeds to the fruits, for there is actual righteousness which bears fruit.<a name=51:8></a> As He says, "Now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.<a name=51:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is wonderful depth and value in this chapter, as there must be in that which comes from God.<a name=51:10></a> This practical righteousness does not merely produce a fruit down here, that is man's thoughts, and man's thoughts end always with himself; but flowing from Christian life, as we shall see, and walking in the path suited to it here below, it frees from obscuring lusts, and tends to purify the heart practically, so that we see God.<a name=51:11></a> It has fruit unto holiness.<a name=51:12></a> The daily details of a Christian's life have thus the deepest importance, not only as doing right, but that this produces fruit that goes up in holiness to God, leads to a state of soul in which God is known and enjoyed, the soul being set apart for Him.<a name=51:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All that comes from God must go back to God again: so in the meat-offering -- the frankincense which was laid on the meat-offering was burnt, and the savour of it all went up to God: the priest might eat of the meat-offering, but the sweet savour of all ascended up to God; just as Christ Himself came down from God, His whole life down here being one continued savour rising up to God, and at the end He offered up Himself, a sacrifice well-pleasing to God.<a name=52:1></a> The reality of the fruit of righteousness is that it is living to God, as the apostle says, "Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love, as Christ hath loved us, and given himself an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=52:2></a>" This is Christian morality, it is God's nature in man.<a name=52:3></a> Here, however, it is only seen as a fruit or effect -- the divine life coming down from God, to God it must return, and where this is wanting, it is all nothing.<a name=52:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the value of an action is in the motive.<a name=52:5></a> Fruit will be manifested; but it is not so much what a man does, as his motive for doing it.<a name=52:6></a> Even in nature, two men may do the same thing from very different motives; the motive of the one being himself and his own pleasure, will be evil; while the other, being the good father of a family, and doing it for their good, his motive will be good; it is in the motive of our ordinary actions that we have to be continually judging ourselves, that we be not judged of the Lord.<a name=52:7></a> The saint, in judging himself, must be grieved when he sees so many other things come in and mix up with that which he presents to God; self comes in, and like the dead flies, spoils the savour of the ointment.<a name=52:8></a> It may not be seen by others, but our own hearts before God know how very much of self comes in, making the ointment send forth a bad savour, yet we know God graciously and lovingly accepts all our service through Christ, being a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=52:9></a> The great principle laid down in chapter 3 is that the blood meets our sins.<a name=52:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4 brings out faith in the God who had come in, in power, and raised the One who was under death -- raised Him from the dead.<a name=53:1></a> "Believing on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.<a name=53:2></a>" Christ was put to death in the flesh; looked at as man, we see Him going down into death, and a divine power coming in, and raising Him up again.<a name=53:3></a> It is precious to our souls to observe in scripture the same divine power is attributed to the three Persons, thus giving us a proof of the Trinity being engaged in the work.<a name=53:4></a> The Lord Jesus said, "Destroy this temple (this spake he of the temple of his body), and I will raise it up in three days"; and again, "Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father," Romans 6: 4.<a name=53:5></a> And He was "quickened by the Spirit.<a name=53:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the former part of chapter 5 we get faith applied to justification; the conclusions from Christ's being delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification, and the results of this are given: we have peace, present favour, and hope of glory; we rejoice in tribulations, for God's love is shed abroad in our hearts, and finally, are able to joy in God.<a name=53:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes, beginning with verse 12, the question of sin in our nature, where all heads up in Adam and Christ, and we see that the law was brought in by the bye, when man was already a sinner, with no thought of producing righteousness, but that the offence might abound and so manifest man's sin.<a name=53:8></a> The law is righteous, and comes in, convicting of unrighteousness those to whom it was given, because those to whom it was given could not keep it.<a name=53:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man's only ways of being with God are, to be innocent, or to be saved.<a name=53:10></a> If a man is innocent, he does not want the law; Adam could not have known what it meant.<a name=53:11></a> If it had been said to Adam, "Thou shalt not lust, thou shalt not steal" -- how would it have applied?<a name=53:12></a> Whom was he to steal from?<a name=53:13></a> But the law supposes lust to be there, therefore says, "Thou shalt not lust.<a name=53:14></a>" The commandment which forbids, supposes the forbidden thing to be there, or the tendency to it, where the thing prohibited is a sin in its nature.<a name=53:15></a> The fruit of the tree was in the garden, which was the very thing prohibited to Adam; but till Satan got hold of Eve, there was no lust to eat of it.<a name=53:16></a> "Thou shalt not eat of it," was a simple test of obedience, but even then the object was before them.<a name=53:17></a> A right rule only proves a fraudulent thing to be fraudulent, it does not make it right.<a name=53:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=54>[Page 54]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible for a man to be saved by the law, as the law supposes the presence of sin; an innocent person does not know what sin is, but man by the law is addressed as a sinner, that he might be saved by grace; but God having now come in, He could not confine Himself to those merely under law, but extends His grace to all -- grace is the only ground He can be upon.<a name=54:1></a> Again, the law was not given till four hundred years after the promise.<a name=54:2></a> The promise was first.<a name=54:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5: 19, we have the two headships brought out in their results.<a name=54:4></a> By one man's disobedience, etc.<a name=54:5></a>, and, note here, all are thus alike, the individual's sins do not come into account, though they do in judgment, for we are judged according to our works.<a name=54:6></a> But here, one man's disobedience made us sinners, and one Man's obedience makes us righteous.<a name=54:7></a> That seemed to make it no matter how we lived; but the subject of chapter 6 is just to meet such a thought as this.<a name=54:8></a> The perverseness of the flesh will turn the law to a different purpose from that for which God gave it, and grace for a different end from that for which God bestowed it.<a name=54:9></a> The law that was given to convict man of sin, man takes up to make a righteousness of his own out of it; and grace that was really given to make man holy, man turns into licentiousness.<a name=54:10></a> Though it is true that souls were quickened before Christ came, by virtue of His divine power to quicken whom He would, yet we get this great fact, that Adam became a fallen man, a sinner, and lost, before he was the head of the fallen family.<a name=54:11></a> So Christ finishes the work for righteousness before He becomes the head of the redeemed family.<a name=54:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not only come into the position of fallen Adam, but we have got a nature that likes sin; and where there is the life of Christ there is a nature which loves holiness: this is the argument of the apostle.<a name=54:13></a> But if a man naturally likes unholiness, how is he to get rid of this?<a name=54:14></a> His reply is, "How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?<a name=54:15></a>" It is not an argument as to what we ought to be.<a name=54:16></a> That which forms the groundwork of Christian life is that we have died with Christ.<a name=54:17></a> It is never said to man, You ought to die to sin.<a name=54:18></a> The believer is placed in Christ.<a name=54:19></a> How?<a name=54:20></a> In a Christ who has died and is risen.<a name=54:21></a> That life which I have in Christ is after Christ is dead and risen again; thus I have life in a Christ who has died (that is where I exist), in whom I have died unto sin, for if we are made partakers of justification through Him, it is because we are made partakers of His death.<a name=54:22></a> But, if, as regards the old sinful Adam, we are made partakers of death -- have our part in and by it -- we cannot live on.<a name=54:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=55>[Page 55]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To follow more precisely the apostle's argument: If I am a Christian, justified by Him, it is that I have part in His death.<a name=55:1></a> It is my very profession.<a name=55:2></a> I have been baptised to His death.<a name=55:3></a> But if I have died to sin to be made righteous, I cannot live in it because I am righteous.<a name=55:4></a> You have died unto sin in Christ.<a name=55:5></a> There is more than that when we look into it, as to detail: the blood of atonement was put upon the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot of the priest, thus shewing that we are not only saved by the blood, but that nothing was to be allowed in thought, word, or deed, discordant with its holy claim.<a name=55:6></a> There is that which becomes a Christian, but that is not what is brought out here, but the truth of our having part in His death, so that we are to reckon ourselves alive to God through Him, not through the first Adam in his flesh.<a name=55:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How have you got your place, your life, your character in Christ, but through a dead and risen Christ?<a name=55:8></a> Well then, if I am dead, I am not still alive.<a name=55:9></a> Hence it is that the exhortation is never to us, to die, for we have died with Christ.<a name=55:10></a> How then can a man live in that to which he is dead?<a name=55:11></a> It cannot be.<a name=55:12></a> If I am dead to sin I cannot live in sin, God forbid!<a name=55:13></a> There is putting to death, for practically we are to mortify our members, that is power, but we are never told to die to sin.<a name=55:14></a> You may try to die to it, but it will not do.<a name=55:15></a> It is still there.<a name=55:16></a> But the cross of Christ has for faith killed your sin, when He put your sins away.<a name=55:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We first get a new life and a new nature, and then we can begin to kill the members of the old nature, reckoning oneself dead, otherwise it is hopeless.<a name=55:18></a> I can now deal with this old thing as not me, for now I have a new thing which is me, therefore I do not admit that old thing to be me at all.<a name=55:19></a> I have for ever done with it, having got this new thing by which the old is overcome.<a name=55:20></a> In this chapter 6, the apostle is speaking of our liberty, as scripture always addresses the believer as dead with Christ.<a name=55:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What Christ have you a part in?<a name=55:22></a> Not one living on the earth before death, but in His death, though He be now alive again.<a name=55:23></a> "Buried with him by baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<a name=55:24></a>" Thus we get the glory of the Father as all engaged in the resurrection of Christ, and in result, as the measure of our walk down here.<a name=55:25></a> "By the glory of the Father.<a name=55:26></a>" I can rest upon that expression, because it is that which can feed the heart, for Christ, as man, is brought out by and into the full glory of the Father, and that which meets the subtlety of the world's pretension (for the world had rejected Him), and the subtlety in our hearts, for all that leans to what obscures that, is the old man, which would have, not that which is of the Father, but of the world.<a name=55:27></a>

		The Christian is fed and settled by what shews the perfection of Christ, as raised by the glory of the Father.<a name=56:1></a> There is not a single thing that was connected with the glory of the Father that was not made good by the death and sealed by the resurrection of Christ.<a name=56:2></a> Take death, for instance, God's righteous judgment, but the ruin of His creature, and the present display of Satan's power.<a name=56:3></a> We had all come under the power of death.<a name=56:4></a> Divine power comes in, and raises Him who, in grace towards us, went down under death, and by raising Him makes good God's judgment, while it sets aside what it was exercised in, and destroys him that had the power of death, that is the devil.<a name=56:5></a> There was the power of God, the love of the Father shewn out besides, for it was the Son who was there; and yet His righteousness, too, for Christ had fully glorified Him there, where it would seem impossible, made sin -- and in death, its wages -- for us.<a name=56:6></a> Was ever the love of the Father drawn out in like manner, as in the resurrection of Christ?<a name=56:7></a> Never!<a name=56:8></a> There was in Christ's death a fresh motive for the Father's love, in the Son's sacrificing Himself to shew forth the Father's glory.<a name=56:9></a> Then the Father's own glory was concerned in it, because it was the Father's own Son, one with Himself, who was under death; therefore the Father must come in and raise Him up, for His own glory.<a name=56:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then also the righteousness of God is concerned.<a name=56:11></a> The world was to be convinced of righteousness, therefore God could not leave His soul in hell, neither could He suffer His Holy One to see corruption.<a name=56:12></a> He was God manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, received up in glory.<a name=56:13></a> The angels must be witnesses of this great work of the resurrection of the Son of God.<a name=56:14></a> There would have been a hopeless gap in heaven, could it have been possible (which it was not, He could not be holden of it) for Christ not to have been raised from the dead and set at the right hand of God.<a name=56:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember what we have been treating of up to the end of chapter 3, all under sin, and propitiation made for our sins by the precious blood of Christ.<a name=64:6></a> All our actual guilt dealt with; so that we cannot overrate the importance of the subject.<a name=64:7></a> So in chapter 4 we have seen the apostle developing the grand doctrine of the resurrection -- the believing in God as the One who raised the dead.<a name=64:8></a> It is not merely putting away sin from the guilty person, but it is God acting on the very Person who was delivered for our offences, and for a little moment under death.<a name=64:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The power of this raising the dead was first exercised on the Person of Christ, here looked at as delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification -- that is, the application does not go beyond the justifying effect of resurrection, the new position of Christ as delivered for our offences, and so raised again by God, a witness of the efficacy of His work, and the new place He has thus entered into as Man.<a name=64:10></a> Elsewhere we learn what the exercise of the same power of God is in us who believe, so that we are viewed as risen with Him, but this is Ephesian teaching.<a name=64:11></a> There we see the saints quickened by the Spirit of God, in the exercise of the very same divine power that raised Christ from the dead and quickened together with Christ, the same being thus associated with Christ in resurrection.<a name=64:12></a>

		From verse 12 to end of chapter, we get our connection with the first Adam, and the Last, so that not merely individual sins are in question, but a single head involving those connected with it in the consequences of his act, and in the partaking of a life or nature derived from that head -- the one constituting his family, sinners; the other, righteous.<a name=65:1></a> The flesh says, if one man's obedience makes me righteous, I may continue in the sin of my old nature!<a name=65:2></a> No: you are dead to sin, and what you are dead to, you cannot live in.<a name=65:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 6 the objections of the natural man to the obedience of Christ constituting us righteous are all met, as the apostle connects practical righteousness and a holy life with being dead with Christ, and the reception of a new life to God through Him as a necessary result.<a name=65:4></a> This important point we must pursue a little more fully.<a name=65:5></a> The Christ in whom we have part, as thus interested in His obedience, is Christ who has died and is risen; and if we are associated with Him, we are associated with Him in death.<a name=65:6></a> The public profession of Christianity was baptism to His death.<a name=65:7></a> We have been planted in the likeness of His death, we cannot live in what we have died to.<a name=65:8></a>

		He does not say we are risen with Him; which would in itself suppose full redemption, with life, and a place and condition before God.<a name=65:11></a> Here it is practical, a new character of life -- we are to walk in newness of life.<a name=65:12></a> I am, then, to reckon myself dead, and alive unto God, through, or in, Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=65:13></a> Yet it is not as raised with Him, but quickened by Him or in the power of His life.<a name=65:14></a> When quickened together with Him, He is looked at as dead, and union is involved in it; not "with" here, but we have the new life through Him.<a name=65:15></a> Hence, I am free, for I reckon the old nature dead.<a name=65:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 7, then, applies this doctrine of being dead to our position in respect of the law.<a name=66:12></a> The practical effect of the new nature in me, if not freed from the law, is to give me such a sense of what God is, and what self is, as to make me perfectly miserable.<a name=66:13></a> It gives me the sense of good and evil, but good unattained, and evil to which I am a slave.<a name=66:14></a> But this chapter 7 shews the effect of my being dead, on my relationship with law: I am delivered from it.<a name=66:15></a> It is not merely that we are justified, nor yet merely that we have a new nature, but that we are delivered from the law.<a name=66:16></a> The apostle takes care to shew that there is no fault in the law, but that we are delivered from it.<a name=66:17></a>

		In chapter 7, the apostle applies the doctrine of death to the law, and he opens it in this way, "Know ye not that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?<a name=68:1></a>" It is true even of human law, and physical death.<a name=68:2></a> He proceeds with the analogy of husband and wife.<a name=68:3></a> You cannot have two husbands at one and the same time -- we cannot have Christ and the law both at once.<a name=68:4></a> We are bound up with one or the other, as a principle, to God.<a name=68:5></a> The woman cannot have two husbands.<a name=68:6></a> "Wherefore ye are become dead to the law by the body of Christ.<a name=68:7></a>" It is not that the law has died, we are dead; the image, so far, changes, but the bond is broken; and this difference is blessed, because I hold also my old evil nature for dead, and this is by the body of Christ.<a name=68:8></a> In His death, as we have seen, I reckon myself dead.<a name=68:9></a> The law was never abrogated, and the principle of it was sanctioned as of God, and those that have sinned under it will be judged by it.<a name=68:10></a> Verse 6 correctly reads: "but now we are clear from the law, <i>having died</i> in that in which we were held.<a name=68:11></a>" It is not then, that the law is dead, but we are dead to that by which we were held.<a name=68:12></a> Hence, note, death to sin goes with it.<a name=68:13></a> Therefore, the apostle says, we are dead to the law by the body of Christ, because Christ was made a curse for us, and died under it, as bearing the curse.<a name=68:14></a> But how?<a name=68:15></a> Why the law applied its full curse to Him, as willingly offering Himself, and He died under it.<a name=68:16></a>

		The law as a weapon took its full effect on Christ.<a name=68:17></a> It did everything it possibly could, by way of its curse coming on Christ.<a name=68:18></a> The curse of the law was the death of the sinner, and Christ in grace was made sin for us; therefore, what could the law do more than spend its full curse on the head of Him, who was made sin for us, who died under the law?<a name=68:19></a> Christ was born under the law and kept it.<a name=68:20></a> He puts Himself under its curse, and goes through it all, and rises entirely out of it.<a name=68:21></a> And faith applies Christ's position to the believer.<a name=68:22></a> But alas!<a name=68:23></a> to how many Christians law is Christianity.<a name=68:24></a> But Christ comes as a Mediator, and takes my place, my whole cause: and faith has received all that.<a name=68:25></a> He thus was in my place, bringing all the good of it to myself, as if I were in His place.<a name=68:26></a> He is not speaking of union with Him now, as in Ephesians.<a name=68:27></a> I come and have my place actually and livingly in Christ, for He is the quickening Spirit, the last Adam, who comes and gives me a portion with Himself in His present position.<a name=68:28></a> All question of the claims of the law upon the believer has passed away in Christ, for in Christ he has died to the life and position in which he could be under it; and now I have a life in Christ after the whole question of law is settled before God.<a name=68:29></a> I am married to another husband, to Him who is raised from the dead.<a name=68:30></a>

		The law was formerly the religious tie with God, but now another is our tie with God.<a name=69:10></a> For it is not now the law, but my new husband, Christ in resurrection; we are dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we should be married to another, even to Him that is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.<a name=69:11></a> And because of this new graft in the heart of the believer, God is looking for new fruit; for God has ceased to look for fruit from man's nature, it has only brought forth wild evil fruit.<a name=69:12></a> This was fully brought out in the cross of Christ; but now there is the new thing, on which God's mind is set.<a name=69:13></a> Well, then, as we cannot have the two husbands at once, so if in any wise we are under the law, we are under its curse; and what is more, you cannot get from under its curse, for you have sin in your flesh, and the law can never allow the working of sin in the flesh, it must necessarily bring out its curse.<a name=69:14></a> You talk of sanctification, but you are not sanctified enough for the law, for it will not let you off in any wise.<a name=69:15></a> You may have the desire to be good, but you have not yet owned how thoroughly bad you are.<a name=69:16></a> God is not looking for any good in you, for He says, "There is none that understandeth, none that seeketh, none righteous, no, not one.<a name=69:17></a>" Now this you do not believe, for you are thinking there is some good in you, or hoping for it; you do not believe yourself to be thoroughly bad, as God says you are.<a name=69:18></a> And the very way God brings to our consciences what we really are, is that He often leaves us under the condemnation of the law, that it may prove to us what our true state by nature is; and when we have learnt this, we shall be glad enough to be delivered from the law.<a name=69:19></a>

		Let me return now to verse 5, which contains an important principle, from which all this sorrow flows.<a name=72:6></a> "When we were in the flesh": compare this with verse 9 of chapter 8, "But ye are not in the flesh" (though the flesh may be in you).<a name=72:7></a> Now this is the key to all that has been said, and gives it its full power.<a name=72:8></a> If you are dead with Christ, and have life through Him, you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.<a name=72:9></a> The natural man, we know, is in the flesh, nor does the law quicken him.<a name=72:10></a> But there is a further case.<a name=72:11></a> Suppose him quickened and under the law: still the law takes up man in the flesh, in principle, as to his position and conscience, and condemns him in the very thing in which he stands, as to his own consciousness before God, that is, his own personal responsibilities, but according to God's intention.<a name=72:12></a>

		Now, as regards my conscious position, I am always in the flesh, that is, as a child of Adam, on my own responsibility, till I know myself to be dead with Christ, and redeemed out of it.<a name=72:13></a> The being born again only makes me apprehend the spirituality of the law, the force of "Thou shalt not lust.<a name=72:14></a>" It does not shew me sin in nature, but it gives me the knowledge of it by its first movements, and the painful discovery that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<a name=72:15></a> I still do what I hate, and do not do what I would.<a name=72:16></a> It does not give the Spirit, which does give power, as it is the witness of liberty, but leaves a man just where he was in his responsibility, according to the first Adam's place, and says, "Keep the law, and there is life; do this, and live"; and if there be life communicated, it does not hinder the working of the flesh, which yet it still condemns, and our conscience says, rightly.<a name=72:17></a> Thus the fact of being quickened by God does not give deliverance, while the conscience is under the law, though such have really a part in it; but it gives through the law the deep sense of the need of deliverance, because we cannot succeed in what we really desire.<a name=72:18></a> The law and flesh, and sin and death, go together, they are correlative.<a name=72:19></a> But if I have died, the other three have lost their power over me.<a name=72:20></a> If dead I am clearly no longer in the flesh.<a name=72:21></a> I say, When we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.<a name=72:22></a> But as to our conscious place, we all are in the flesh, unless the Spirit of God by virtue of redemption dwell in us.<a name=72:23></a> Redemption, therefore, and the knowledge of redemption (of our having died, moreover, with Christ), is what we need for this deliverance.<a name=72:24></a> The apostle, while ascribing the effect to the law, yet carefully guards the law: "Was, then, that which is good made death unto me?<a name=72:25></a> God forbid!<a name=72:26></a> But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<a name=72:27></a>"

		This brings us to the main point of the chapter, not only flesh, of which we have spoken, but the operation of the law, and its effect, and that even on those who can delight in it spiritually.<a name=73:1></a> It works death; for we, Christians, know it is spiritual, but I as a child of Adam, am carnal, sold, that is a slave, under sin; and sin only becomes exceeding sinful by the law, working in me all manner of concupiscence.<a name=73:2></a> It has not, then, as such, sanctifying power.<a name=73:3></a> It cannot make me holy.<a name=73:4></a> Is not the law good then?<a name=73:5></a> Yes!<a name=73:6></a> it is holy, just, and good.<a name=73:7></a> But I, as in the flesh, am not subject to it.<a name=73:8></a>

		There are three things in this chapter.<a name=74:1></a> In the first six verses, we have the doctrine -- we have died to the law by the body of Christ, and we are married to another, even Christ risen from the dead; then verses 7-13, the conclusion, with the inquiry, is it sin?<a name=74:2></a> does it work death?<a name=74:3></a> and verses 14 to the end, experience, before being delivered from the law.<a name=74:4></a> And here it is of importance to mark how the apostle says "I" and "we.<a name=74:5></a>" When he says "I," he is taking us in our individual state; but when he says "we," then it is as Christians, as believers in Christ, that he is speaking of us.<a name=74:6></a> If he says "I," then he is beginning to deal with individual members; for if I begin to talk of myself, then I find sin in myself every day.<a name=74:7></a> It is a personal, practical consciousness of what is working in my heart.<a name=74:8></a> But that is not my place in Christ, and there is the difference.<a name=74:9></a> And this gives us the key to the passage.<a name=74:10></a> It is one who has Christian knowledge, judging what flesh is, but what it is in its effect on me in the presence of, and under the law.<a name=74:11></a> It is what I am in myself, that is, in the flesh.<a name=74:12></a> I am carnal; in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good thing.<a name=74:13></a> In this part of the chapter, all is "I" and "me" therefore, which are used some thirty times; but he never speaks of Christ or of the Spirit at all until the close of the chapter.<a name=74:14></a> It is the experience of what the flesh is, viewed in the light of the requirements of a spiritual law, deliverance being yet unknown, and not the knowledge by faith of what I am in Christ.<a name=74:15></a> It is the personal experience of myself in flesh, but mixed with the clear knowledge of a Christian, who looks back at it; but not the state of a man in Christ, whom the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made free.<a name=74:16></a>

		What is in chapter 7, then, is a man under the law.<a name=74:17></a> It is not simply the effect of conflict between the new and the old nature, but the effect of being under the law when both are there.<a name=74:18></a> It does not say that Christ is good, but takes much lower ground, and says that the law is holy, just, and good.<a name=74:19></a> Chapter 7 is the discussion of the law applied to the practical experience of a man, struggling to live righteously under it.<a name=74:20></a> A natural man cannot delight in the law of God with his heart, the new nature does; but then, according to that nature, we see he always wills what is right, yet he never does it, because he has no power.<a name=74:21></a> Now, do you not find that, in a vast majority of cases, what you want is power to do what is right?<a name=74:22></a> Well, then, the law will never give it you; for the law is as weak to give you power to do right, as it is strong to condemn you when you do wrong.<a name=74:23></a> The secret of it all is, that when in the flesh there is no power, and it is all self till we see that; and till Christ is known as the Deliverer from the law, it is always <i>I, I, I</i>, and we shall be floundering about, and only getting deeper and deeper into it, like a man in a morass, who attempting to lift one leg out, only sinks the other deeper in the mire; there may be a desire to get out, but he must have a deliverer; there is ever the desire to be this or that, or to do this or that, being thus occupied with self instead of Christ.<a name=74:24></a> It is true you ought to desire holiness, but how are you to get power to be holy?<a name=74:25></a>

		There is such a tendency in us to be thinking of these I's and me's, thus to set up self in God's place, that God says, Well, you shall have so much of self, that you shall be thoroughly glad to have done with yourself, and to this end, God often suffers us to be brought through all this, to be put under the law, with a new nature and a good will, which only leads to "O wretched man that I am," for it is only man.<a name=75:5></a> There is the love of good, but no power to do it, for man is as powerless as he is wicked.<a name=75:6></a> He is, through labouring to do, brought to cry out, "Who shall deliver?<a name=75:7></a>" He is looking for another to deliver him; he gives it up as a hopeless thing, yet cannot, dare not, do without it.<a name=75:8></a> It is not that man is to get a better self, but a deliverance from self.<a name=75:9></a> This may be the work of a day or years, according to circumstances; man is brought to his own level, and then God in grace can come in.<a name=75:10></a> Then comes thanksgiving, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=75:11></a>"

		The only way by which man gets power is by being shewn that he has none of himself, and then he is not delivered by getting victory, and so peace, but by finding he is in Christ, has died to and is out of the flesh, and only in Christ, through whom he lives before God.<a name=76:1></a> Then God can give him power.<a name=76:2></a> "When we were without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=76:3></a>" Man must know God as his Saviour, before he knows Him as his strength.<a name=76:4></a> There must be salvation; then comes peace, and progress.<a name=76:5></a>

		The doctrine, then, in chapter 7, is that we cannot have Christ and the law, or the two husbands at once; but, that we are dead to the law, and bound to Christ risen.<a name=76:6></a> The motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.<a name=76:7></a> But it is not the fault of the law, yet it brings death into our consciences; the law, moreover, is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin; and it serves to the renewed man to teach him by practical experience what sin really is, and makes it exceeding sinful.<a name=76:8></a> The fruit of the experience gained under it is, first, to know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing -- not what I have done, but what I am, that is my flesh; next, to distinguish between self and sin, for I hate it, its very pressure makes me know it, thus taught of God; but, thirdly, that if I do hate it, it is too strong for me, has still power over me; a law in my members bringing me into captivity.<a name=76:9></a> But this powerlessness, thus learned, when I feel the evil and the burden, leads me to have done with self, and look for a deliverer; a deep and weighty lesson; but having been crucified with Christ, I am delivered; hence, here he thanks God.<a name=76:10></a> The doctrine he had taught already; he is now come to the point where the effect is realised.<a name=76:11></a> The law has spent its full curse on the person of Christ, and so on us also, as reckoned to our favour, as associated with Christ in death; now we are married to Him risen.<a name=76:12></a>

		The law is often applied by God to bring home to the soul a sense of its powerlessness, for it is easier to learn we are sinful, than to learn that we have no power.<a name=76:13></a> Conscience will soon tell us we are sinful, as regards acts, but it requires this divine teaching to know the sin in our nature.<a name=76:14></a> We often need to be brought through struggle after struggle, before we acknowledge that in our flesh dwells no good thing, that we have no power; we may assent to it as a doctrine, but we must also experience the truth of it in the secrecy of our own souls.<a name=76:15></a> It is a humbling, but most profitable lesson; the difference is evident always to every experienced eye, indeed, to oneself, as to confidence in self, besides turning to the liberty wherewith Christ has set us free.<a name=76:16></a>

		The Lord give you to weigh well this important principle, that there is no forgiveness of sins but of grace, through Christ's death.<a name=77:1></a> For an evil nature, for sin -- Christ having died for us, as "for sin," -- is condemned in His death, and we are set free, for we have died with Him.<a name=77:2></a> Also remember this, that it is the discovery of what we really are, that settles the question of the law.<a name=77:3></a> Then we shall be glad to get rid of what only can and ought to bring a curse upon us, and to be brought into fellowship with Christ the Lord.<a name=77:4></a>

		CHAPTER 8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this well-known and remarkable chapter, we have the results of what we have been considering in what precedes.<a name=77:5></a> Chapter 5: 1-11 gave us the peace, present grace, and hope, which Christ's dying for our sins gave us, and what God is to us in and by it.<a name=77:6></a> This chapter gives our state and place before Him, and as such in the world, a kind of picture of what a Christian is.<a name=77:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three distinct parts in the detail of this chapter.<a name=77:8></a> First -- Our state in Christ -- the fruit of the grace of God.<a name=77:9></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death," brought out in its inward power and fruitfulness, and with that, sin in the flesh condemned, but in Christ's death a sacrifice for it.<a name=77:10></a> This part goes down to verse 13.<a name=77:11></a> Second.<a name=77:12></a> -- The person and presence of the Holy Ghost in us, down to verse 29.<a name=77:13></a> Third.<a name=77:14></a> -- There is a transition from the work of God inwardly, in our souls, to the outward security, what God is for us, what we count upon Him for; and that makes it so sweet, for He says, "nor any other creature.<a name=77:15></a>" And surely any creature whatever must be inferior to God: therefore he says, "If God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=77:16></a>" So that from verse 29 to the end of the chapter it is God for us, the outward security, so to speak, unconnected with the work within us, that he had spoken of in the beginning of the chapter, though preserving them in divine love, in whom it is wrought, for the glory; and so entirely is this the case, that when he says, "whom he justified," he does not add, "them he also sanctified" (though that be true), but "them he also glorified.<a name=77:17></a>"

		I repeat again these three distinct parts in the chapter.<a name=78:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First.<a name=78:2></a> -- The inward effect of the living power of the Spirit of God in our souls, down to verse 13.<a name=78:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second.<a name=78:4></a> -- The personal presence of the Holy Ghost in us, down to verse 29.<a name=78:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third.<a name=78:6></a> -- From verse 29 to the end of the chapter, all the saving power of what God is, according to His counsel, for us outwardly not looking at His work within the soul, but maintaining it to the end.<a name=78:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be noticed by some that I have said nothing on the last verse of chapter 7.<a name=78:8></a> "With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.<a name=78:9></a>" Now a godly person might suppose having come to the deliverance there is in Christ Jesus, that conflict then was all entirely over.<a name=78:10></a> Now that is not the case, as it is after the soul has known deliverance by Jesus Christ that this great principle clearly comes out, "with the mind I serve the law of God"; as the apostle for the same reason could tell us what that state was I cannot do this till I have known deliverance.<a name=78:11></a> I cannot calmly describe how one sinks, as I have said, in the morass, till I am out of it.<a name=78:12></a> I am crying out for help, for my safety; but this last verse states the abiding general principle (flesh remains in us after we have known deliverance), and hence the conflict to keep it down; therefore in chapter 7: 25, we see there is conflict after deliverance, as before, because there are conflicting principles of nature contradictory one to another: but we are no longer under the law after deliverance, we belong to another.<a name=78:13></a> Moreover, the power of the Spirit is there in us.<a name=78:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in chapter 7 the new nature and the flesh are opposed to each other, but under law, while in Galatians 5 it is the opposition of flesh and Spirit.<a name=78:15></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh," because in the Galatians it is about those who have the Spirit, and therefore you get real power here, after the deliverance, which you do not get in Romans 7, because they have not received the Spirit.<a name=78:16></a> So that in Romans 7 it is not flesh lusting against the Spirit, but man under the law; whereas in Galatians it is added, if we walk in the Spirit, we are not under law.<a name=78:17></a> Therefore he does not say here (Romans 7), "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit," but he cries out, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=78:18></a> who shall deliver me?<a name=78:19></a> for what I would that I do not, but what I hate that do I.<a name=78:20></a>" But ye (that believe) are not in the flesh, but "in the Spirit.<a name=78:21></a>" "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<a name=78:22></a>" Therefore in Galatians, when they have got the Spirit, they are exhorted to walk in the Spirit.<a name=78:23></a> But if they have the Holy Ghost, why this exhortation to walk in the Spirit?<a name=78:24></a> Because the flesh is still there, and lusteth against the Spirit.<a name=78:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But when a man is led of the law, he is still, as to his standing and conscience, in the flesh, though, if really Christ's, he cannot be entirely holden there.<a name=79:1></a> But you are not led of the law.<a name=79:2></a> "For ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in you.<a name=79:3></a>" And if ye be led of the Spirit, ye cannot be under the law, for when really under the law, ye must be led of the flesh; for sin loses its dominion as well as its power to accuse only by our not being under law, but under grace, because the law can in no wise place us in known grace nor give the Spirit.<a name=79:4></a> Therefore if under it you cannot be led of the Spirit.<a name=79:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now then we are prepared to see the deliverance and the extent of it, and also that it is God's deliverance.<a name=79:6></a> In the first three verses of this chapter we have the results of the argument in the end of chapter 5, and in chapters 6 and 7.<a name=79:7></a> In verse I we have the result of chapter 5, as in the last Adam, then the displacing of the Adam nature by our being dead with Christ by the power of the Spirit of life in Him.<a name=79:8></a> In verse 2, and in chapter 6, dead to sin, and alive to God through Christ.<a name=79:9></a> In verse 3, as in chapter 7, dead to the law; and then in chapter 8, no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus.<a name=79:10></a> Still he does not merely repeat what is there, but brings forward according to the full light of faith, and divine teaching, the actual condition of the believer, which that reasoning had brought him up to.<a name=79:11></a> That prepared the way?<a name=79:12></a> in contrast with the old state in Adam, and in replying to objections.<a name=79:13></a> This gives the actual condition of him who is delivered.<a name=79:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The conclusion is in the first verse by itself; "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.<a name=79:15></a>" They have passed out of the flesh as before God and are in Christ who has died and risen again; and, having suffered for our sins, is past death and judgment and the whole condition of sin, even as having to say to it for others.<a name=79:16></a> There cannot therefore be condemnation for me in Him.<a name=79:17></a> The 'therefore' is not a consequence drawn as an argument, but a great moral result demonstrated by the condition of things developed in what precedes.<a name=79:18></a>

		Verse 2 begins the full resulting view, as 'for' is constantly used by the apostle -- the result of what is passing in the apostle's mind -- not the proof of his textual argument.<a name=80:1></a> The power of life in Christ, acting in and for itself, has set me free from the law of the old man altogether; I may foolishly listen to it, but I am not, really, at all under its power.<a name=80:2></a> Just as the breath which God breathed into Adam's nostrils gave him power to use his previously formed body, so the power of life in Christ enables me to serve now in the liberty and power of that life.<a name=80:3></a> But another truth comes in to make this good -- redemption and resurrection.<a name=80:4></a> If it were only a new nature, new in its desires, it would give the sense of responsibility, the conscience of sin, and, in the hatred of it, the knowledge that God must be against it, and thus fear and dread as regards God.<a name=80:5></a> This is Romans 7, and in principle, law; but what law could not do, God has sent His Son and accomplished.<a name=80:6></a> The blessed and sinless Lord has come, and in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, that is, as a sacrifice for sin.<a name=80:7></a> Thus God has condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=80:8></a> It has been dealt with; that which my conscience recognised, which held me in bondage, cannot accuse me any more.<a name=80:9></a> Its condemnation is past, but executed, and I have, in that same work of Christ, died to it.<a name=80:10></a> I live to God through Him that is risen, to whom I am bound.<a name=80:11></a> Thus verse 3 shews me that work of God which leaves me free to live in the life of verse 2.<a name=80:12></a> The actual requirements of the law will be thus fulfilled, because I am not under it, and I live by a life which does not do what is contrary to God's will.<a name=80:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the first Adam, who brought in sin and death, there was nothing but what pressed down; while in the last Adam, the Lord from heaven, it is all lifting up, but lifting up from under the power of sin, as well as from its condemnation -- perfect liberty.<a name=80:14></a> God has come in in delivering power; but you say, How is that?<a name=80:15></a> God's Son went down under death for our sins, and rose in the power of the life of the Son of God without them, and by association with Him, we are taken from under our sins, and the law of sin in the old man, into resurrection-life with Him.<a name=80:16></a> Thus, then, if I am dead and in Christ risen, there can be no condemnation, for I have died under God's judgment against sin, and am alive after the judgment has been executed for sin on Him who died for it.<a name=80:17></a> I am alive only to God in Him, not in the flesh in which sin is, the sense of sins put away; there can therefore now be no condemnation, for it is God Himself that justifies.<a name=80:18></a>

		God came in in power when man was a sinner, by Christ's coming and taking us out of the old, and putting us into the new condition altogether.<a name=81:1></a> Therefore now it is no question of hope, where faith is simple.<a name=81:2></a> I do not hope anything about the cross, because it is a past thing, executed and done.<a name=81:3></a> We do not now trust in a promise for salvation, but in the fact, the accomplishment of a promise (of course we do trust in a promise for every day's need and deliverance, but that is quite another thing).<a name=81:4></a>

		By one righteousness the free gift is of many offences unto justification of life.<a name=81:5></a> And the way He is bringing them is beyond death, and hence deliverance from the guilt of sin; but through death alive in God's presence, and thus not in the flesh, in which the power of sin was, but in Christ, and there is no condemnation there; and then the reason he gives for this, saying, "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=81:6></a>" And here is the secret of the walk, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit," for now he enters on the power of the Spirit, but still, first, on the power of life, for what we do not get in chapter 7, we get here fully, that is, Christ and the Spirit.<a name=81:7></a> Having laid the foundation in virtue of what Christ has done, and having given us life, He then works in us; for this is what we find, the living power of the Spirit of life in Christ setting us, as associated with Him, out of the sphere of the power of condemnation, death, and law; because my life, as a Christian, is through Christ, so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<a name=81:8></a> It is this which introduces the doctrine of the Spirit's presence, of which this chapter now proceeds to speak.<a name=81:9></a> "What the law could not do" (that is, effect righteousness by keeping it in the flesh), he that walks in the Spirit does; he fulfils the law, and that is the practical result of our position, but the law could never give that power.<a name=81:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to call attention again to verse 1: there is great force and power in it.<a name=81:11></a> It does not say you are not condemned, but, "there is now no condemnation," and that goes much farther; for if there is any question of sin on the conscience, the nearer we are to God, the more distressed and anxious we shall be, and therefore the soul needs this full assurance.<a name=81:12></a> Could anyone say there was any condemnation for Christ?<a name=81:13></a> and that now even, as regards His connection with us?<a name=81:14></a> surely not!<a name=81:15></a> for He is the Holy One, the accepted Man in the presence of God, having perfectly glorified Him in His work for us.<a name=81:16></a> Then how can there be any condemnation for the one that is in Him, for whom this work was wrought?<a name=81:17></a> Therefore he says, "There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.<a name=81:18></a>" This is more than saying to them for whose sins Christ died, than if it was said on Christ Jesus -- as Aaron wore the breastplate as part of the vestment, so that the names of the children of Israel were borne on his heart; and when the light of Jehovah's countenance fell on Aaron with full favour, the same light shone on the names engraved on the breast-plate.<a name=81:19></a> But this in Romans 8 is much more, being in the presence of God as Christ is; all the old sins gone; himself, as to the old man, dead with Christ, and he himself before God in perfect acceptance.<a name=81:20></a>

		Then He condemned sin in the flesh, and put it away in Christ's sacrifice; thus the whole thing is settled, and that which was a weight on my spirit, and a thorn in my conscience is taken away by the very way in which the condemnation has run out in all its full force, in the crucifixion of Christ.<a name=83:1></a> God has settled the question, condemning the sin in you, which you condemn.<a name=83:2></a> But where has He done it?<a name=83:3></a> Outside of yourself altogether; for if God sets about delivering, He does it perfectly.<a name=83:4></a> If Christ has died, not only for your committed sins, but your sin in the flesh, it is real through redemption: for He does not leave us under our sins, but takes them away, and forgives them.<a name=83:5></a> And not only this, He takes away the condemnation of sin in the nature, by God's judgment being executed on the sinless flesh of the person of His own Son.<a name=83:6></a> Thus sin in my flesh is judged, as well as my committed sins.<a name=83:7></a> This is what the heart wants to be delivered from, and what it is in conflict with every day.<a name=83:8></a> The tree and the fruit -- the root and the sap, that harasses the heart, is settled, and that by God sending His own Son.<a name=83:9></a> There was the greatest grace to meet it; and the very thing that harasses you most God has provided for in sending His own Son.<a name=83:10></a>

		This last is brought out at the end of the chapter: what God is for man, and not what man is for God, but man looked at as a saint; for when the apostle has brought distinctly out what man is, then he brings out what God is for man, such as he is, as a sinner, summed up in chapter 5; and then what the position of the saint is in his life and trials, and God in and for him as such.<a name=93:8></a> Therefore God is fully set forth, that our hearts may rest in what He is, and not in what we are.<a name=93:9></a> The rejection of God's Son proved what man is; but those who believe rest on what grace is, as we saw at the end of chapter 5; and now, made alive to God, they know their position with God according to His predestinating power, and the glory to come.<a name=93:10></a> Faith rests on what God is, and on what God has done, as shewing what He is withal; God has quickened us and sanctified us, and we have a place with God through this, but what is wrought in me is not the object of faith: faith rests on what God is, as thus revealed in His word, which is our warrant for believing.<a name=93:11></a><a href="#93:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		The witness in power is the Holy Ghost.<a name=94:1></a> It is not only believing that the Spirit quickens, but that we stand before God in the Spirit according to the place He has given us actually in Christ, and that if we believe in what God has done, in that He has quickened the dead, and brought into His presence with power Him who had gone down under death for our sins, when everything was against us (for sin can nowhere be shewn out as it was on the cross, when He who hung there was made sin and a curse for us), and that we know He is now the very delight of God -- a man in heaven -- not only as to His person, but His work, we are brought thus to see what sinners we were -- lost sinners -- transgressors from the womb; but at the same time, to see His grace which has wrought deliverance, and that we are placed in Him who is thus accepted.<a name=94:2></a> And God has so brought out and applied to our hearts all this grace, that we can now say, "God is for us," for this is the great general truth at the end of chapter 8; the Holy Ghost giving us to understand it by bringing it home to our hearts, in the conviction of what we are in ourselves, and in Christ; what God is, and that He is for us, "What shall we say to these things?<a name=94:3></a> if God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=94:4></a>"

		In the three things brought out in this chapter, we have, first, the new nature, which has spiritual faculties, capable of enjoying God; as a child, for instance, has the capacity of enjoying its relationship to the parent, but must also be in the relationship to have the affection in exercise; so we are conscious of our place through redemption, but then we want power, because the new nature is a dependent nature.<a name=95:1></a> The first man sought to be independent, and so became the slave of the devil; the second man did nothing of Himself, He came to obey -- He took the form of a servant.<a name=95:2></a> It is the same place we are in, and having a dependent nature, we want power as we have seen in chapter 7, where there is a new nature "delighting in the law of God after the inward man," but neither object nor power; for we must have something to love, and then power to love it, for in chapter 7 the soul has neither Christ nor the Holy Ghost till the end of it, when he finds the Lord Jesus Christ, and then exclaims, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord," and because he can say, "There is no condemnation.<a name=95:3></a>" Now, the soul has got an object, and it has got power, Christ revealing the Father and the Spirit, and it is no longer a question of conscience.<a name=95:4></a> It is not that he is without a conscience, but his conscience is purged by the blood of Jesus, and then there is the power of the Spirit of God in him, and having the new nature, there is the development of God's things in us, by the power of the Holy Ghost; for the Holy Ghost takes of the things of Christ and shews them to us, and is the power in us also to understand them, as the Lord said, "He shall take of mine and shew it unto you," and "shall be in you.<a name=95:5></a>"

		It is the presence of the Holy Ghost with a soul that has been quickened and knows redemption, having submitted to the righteousness of God, and not as quickening the soul at conversion, which is the subject here; nor is it the Spirit, as He is with the church, which truth is taught in another place, but it is the presence of the Holy Ghost in man, in the believer; as the great subject of the epistle to the Romans is, how God can be just and the justifier of the sinner, and man stand accepted before Him -- the relation of an individual soul with God.<a name=95:6></a> Therefore the great fundamental truth is what man is for God, and what God is for man, and lastly, what through grace man becomes before God.<a name=95:7></a> In the early chapters we saw what man in his natural state is for God; in chapter <i>5</i> what God is for the sinner; but in chapter 8 what man is in Christ is brought out, and thus what God is for him, as in this place -- "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God"; he does not say as many as are quickened by the Spirit, though that is true, for they must be quickened, before they can be led by the Spirit.<a name=95:8></a> They are also sealed; then again, if they are led by the Spirit they are not under the law, but, being sons of God, they are led by the Spirit of God For the Christian is looked at here in his own place, according to the word.<a name=95:9></a> If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.<a name=95:10></a>

		In John's Gospel we see, as truly as the Son was sent from heaven, so truly was the Holy Ghost sent from heaven; the Father sent the Son, and the Father and the Son sent the Holy Ghost; the office of the Holy Ghost is quite distinct from the work of the Son come in the flesh.<a name=96:1></a> We will now refer to some passages in John's Gospel, that we may understand it.<a name=96:2></a> In chapter 16: 7, He says, "It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you: but if I depart, I will send him unto you" -- a living mighty agent, God the Spirit, who comes down and dwells with you, and is in you, and He remains.<a name=96:3></a> Christ must go away, but He shall abide with us, and be in us.<a name=96:4></a>

		Of the Holy Ghost the Lord says, "whom the Father will send in my name," and again, "whom I will send from the Father"; that is, Christ obtains it for us, and the Comforter comes from the Father to put us, through that name, in relationship with the Father; then secondly, Christ sends Him from His Father, and the Holy Ghost comes to tell us all the glory into which Christ has entered as Man.<a name=96:5></a> But, that we may be distinct and clear upon the subject, we will look at John 14: 16.<a name=96:6></a> "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever"; and then, verse 17, "for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you"; and then, in verse 20, "At that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=96:7></a>" The Holy Ghost in thus coming down gives to the believer the consciousness of being in Christ, and His being in them, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=96:8></a>" The disciples ought to have known that He was in the Father, and the Father in Him, as He said, Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?<a name=96:9></a> (verse 10).<a name=96:10></a> But they could not know while He was on the earth of the fulfilment of these words, "ye in me, and I in you.<a name=96:11></a>" As He says, "At that day ye shall know," etc.<a name=96:12></a>; then in verse 26, "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name.<a name=96:13></a>" Here we have the Father sending in the Lord's name; and in chapter 15<i>:</i> 26, "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father"; and then in chapter 16: 13, "when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he shall shew you things to come.<a name=96:14></a>"

		Here, then, in John 16 we get the fulfilment of this great promise, that the Holy Ghost was to come down to reveal Christ, and to abide for ever; for here the Holy Ghost is looked at as upon the earth, telling of the things He has heard, taking of the things of Christ, and shewing them unto us; thus carrying on the whole work in our hearts, and then that He is to abide with us for ever: for the efficacy of Christ's work must fail, God must fail, before the Holy Ghost could be taken away, as it is in virtue of our being sprinkled with the blood of Christ, that the Holy Ghost is given.<a name=97:1></a> The Holy Ghost is in us, in virtue of the work of Christ, being the great testimony of God's estimate of the value of the blood of Christ, and of the glorification of the Man Jesus.<a name=97:2></a> We may grieve Him, and hinder His operations in us (alas!<a name=97:3></a> we do grieve Him), nevertheless, that cannot drive Him from us, as His presence in the individual is not in consequence of the condition of the individual, but in virtue of the blood of Christ, and that must be given up before the Holy Ghost could be removed; for the anointing oil, when the leper was cleansed, was put upon the blood; as Peter also teaches when he says, 1 Peter 1: 12, "By them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.<a name=97:4></a>" The Holy Ghost came down upon the person of the Lord when He was upon earth at His baptism, as a seal of His personal perfection, "him hath God the Father sealed"; but when He ascended up on high He received it for others (Acts 2: 33), and therefore promised (Acts 1: 5), "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost not many days hence"; which actually came to pass at Pentecost.<a name=97:5></a> See Acts 2.<a name=97:6></a> So also in John 7: 39, "This spake he of the Spirit," which, in virtue of redemption, they were to receive, "for the Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=97:7></a>"

		In the beginning of chapter 9 the apostle recalls carefully all the privileges of the beloved people.<a name=105:16></a> Far from him was the wish to diminish their importance, or deny God's delight in them; so far from indifference, in his ardent heart he had loved them as much as Moses, who would have been blotted out of God's book rather than not see them forgiven.<a name=105:17></a> All divinely conferred privileges were really theirs: and it was not that the word of God had taken none effect; but all were not Israel who were of Israel; nor, because they were the natural seed of Abraham, were they all children, that is, according to promise.<a name=105:18></a> And here he has just glided, in admitting their privileges, into the heart of his whole argument.<a name=105:19></a> The natural seed were not heirs, because they were the natural seed.<a name=105:20></a> If that were so, the question was really solved.<a name=105:21></a> And this he goes on to prove.<a name=105:22></a> Ishmael was the natural seed, but sovereign grace maintained its prerogative.<a name=105:23></a> In Isaac shall thy seed be called; but the Jewish objector might say, Yes, but Hagar was a slave, and Ishmael slave-born.<a name=105:24></a> Well, but take Esau and Jacob of one mother, that is an unexceptionable case.<a name=105:25></a> Yet Jacob was chosen, not Esau, and it was of pure grace, before they had done good or evil.<a name=105:26></a> The circumstances were natural, but the principle, pure sovereign grace, is to set aside the national pretensions of the Jews.<a name=105:27></a> They must let in Ishmaelites and Edomites, or allow God to be sovereign.<a name=105:28></a>

		Then they would, as now, accuse God of unrighteousness.<a name=106:1></a> His answer is, sovereign mercy alone has spared you.<a name=106:2></a> If God had not retreated into His own sovereignty, and said, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, all Israel, save Moses or Joshua, would have been cut off at Sinai.<a name=106:3></a> They existed as a people only by virtue of this sovereignty.<a name=106:4></a> That sovereignty God would now use in favour of Gentiles, whom He called along with Jews.<a name=106:5></a> As to the general question, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<a name=106:6></a> He hardened, when He saw fit to display judgment, those who despised Him.<a name=106:7></a> And if one demanded, why He yet then found fault?<a name=106:8></a> The answer is, You judge God!<a name=106:9></a> Who are you, a man, to reply to Him, and find fault with God?<a name=106:10></a>

		There is, then, the unqualified assertion of God's power to make vessels of dishonour, if He pleased, but careful avoidance of the thought that He had made any.<a name=106:11></a> What if He had borne with vessels fitted to destruction, all ready for it; but made known the riches of His glory to vessels He had afore prepared for mercy?<a name=106:12></a> There is the maintenance of God's absolute prerogative.<a name=106:13></a> No reasoning allowed to weaken, or even call in question, the patience of God, with vessels fitted for destruction; and purposes of glory, for which God prepares the vessels of mercy.<a name=106:14></a> Thus the claim of Israel to hereditary privileges -- to the exclusion of the Gentiles, was barred.<a name=106:15></a> It involved the admission of those He would not hear of, races forbidden to enter to the tenth generation; and shewing also, that they were excluded themselves, if they did not admit the absolute sovereignty of God.<a name=106:16></a> The apostle applies this sovereignty to the call of the Gentiles along with the remnant of Israel, confirming his doctrine.<a name=106:17></a>

		But a few remarks remain to be made on chapter 9, besides the general view I have taken of it.<a name=107:5></a> There is progress in the assertion of God's prerogative, though the object of the assertion of it be His title to have mercy on the Gentiles.<a name=107:6></a> In Ishmael and Isaac it is the simple denial of hereditary right.<a name=107:7></a> All are not Israel who are of Israel; but it goes no farther than promise.<a name=107:8></a> It is not the children after the flesh, but according to promise -- Isaac, not Ishmael.<a name=107:9></a> But in Esau and Jacob the principle of simple sovereignty comes in.<a name=107:10></a> Both were children of Isaac, and alike so, but the elder was to serve the younger.<a name=107:11></a> Jacob was chosen according to the purpose of God.<a name=107:12></a> And thereupon the principle of sovereignty is asserted in verse 15, still only in view of mercy.<a name=107:13></a> It is not of him that wills, nor him that runs, but of God that shews mercy.<a name=107:14></a> And this applies to hardening (not to making evil), so that He has mercy on whom He will, and hardens, to display His righteous judgment, whom He will.<a name=107:15></a> And the reply to objections is, not first, explanation, but putting man in his place, and God in His.<a name=107:16></a>

		It is not man's place to judge God: none can say to Him, What doest Thou?<a name=107:17></a> He is the potter, with power over the clay to make what He pleases.<a name=107:18></a> But once man is silenced, then there is explanation.<a name=107:19></a> What if He bears, with great longsuffering, with vessels fitted for destruction, as He did with Pharaoh; as He did with the Amorites and Canaanites; and prepared, as He had to do, if He would have any, vessels of mercy for glory?<a name=107:20></a> And so He called from among lost Gentiles, for that is the key to the exercise of His sovereignty, and Jews were really the same, to be His children in grace.<a name=107:21></a> Such is the unfolding of this principle of sovereign grace, without which not one soul would be saved, for none understand, none seek after God, not one of himself will come that he might have life.<a name=107:22></a> Judgment is according to works; salvation and glory are the fruit of grace.<a name=107:23></a>

		But to return to God's ways with Israel: chapter 10.<a name=108:1></a> The apostle now declares, not merely the privileges of Israel, but his earnest desire that they might be saved; they have zeal towards God, but not the knowledge of His ways.<a name=108:2></a> Their fall lay in this: they sought to establish their own righteousness by works, and did not submit to the righteousness of God.<a name=108:3></a> How strange, yet how fitting a word!<a name=108:4></a> If we are to go up, as responsible, to judgment, it must be by our works.<a name=108:5></a> We are judged according to them.<a name=108:6></a> But we are sinners, and there is no possibility of our standing on this ground; yet this our pride will not admit; it will hope to bring it about, if it does not possess it.<a name=108:7></a> Grace provides righteousness for us.<a name=108:8></a> We have it not for God, He has it for us, and gratuitously in Christ; and we have to own that we cannot in any way make good our own case with God, and must submit to His righteousness.<a name=108:9></a> This, neither the Jew, nor man in any age, by his own spirit will do.<a name=108:10></a> He will blame it as a way of sin, as if he really cared for holiness; but finds he must come down, and confession come in.<a name=108:11></a>

		Now the apostle shews that the ruin of Israel was supposed in their own law.<a name=108:12></a> The law gave the intelligible principle -- "do and live"; but after having done that, and shewn ruin and judgment on failure, it speaks of the return of the heart to God, when under the effects of the judgment, and when the plainly revealed ground of legal righteousness was over (Deuteronomy 30).<a name=108:13></a> And the apostle then introduces Christ, as the true object, when once this was the case; the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.<a name=108:14></a> Just as all hope of righteousness by doing was over in the case put in Deuteronomy, so in every heart, when honestly given up, as it must be by everyone that knows himself, instead of judgment, we have in grace, on the part of God, Christ for righteousness, and the law done with, an end to it; while its judgment was sanctioned, righteousness introduced by grace, on another ground, and as to this, an end of the law.<a name=108:15></a> And in fact, Christ is the end of the law, and another ground of relationship with God.<a name=108:16></a> So it is believing on, and confessing Him, the Lord Jesus, and we are saved.<a name=108:17></a> But then this lets in everyone that does so, and the national relationship drops.<a name=108:18></a> "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.<a name=108:19></a>" And now, as before, we had "no difference," in that all have sinned, now we have "no difference," in that the same Lord is rich unto all that call upon Him.<a name=108:20></a> Sin had levelled all alike before God.<a name=108:21></a> Grace raises up all alike through faith.<a name=108:22></a> And so it is written, "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved," and so, a Gentile, if he call.<a name=108:23></a>

		And this brings in the testimony and belief through the word, with the question of the bearing of this on Jew and Gentile.<a name=109:1></a> They must believe, to call; and hear, to believe.<a name=109:2></a> It is a report, a testimony, to the Jew as to the Gentile; and so their scriptures spoke of Him who brought good tidings, and hailed them.<a name=109:3></a> All had not believed; and this proved it was a report even to the Jew, and it was gone out into all the world.<a name=109:4></a> This is the general thought.<a name=109:5></a> Then, specifically applying it to Israel, Moses had plainly declared they would be provoked to anger by them that were no people, and God would be found of the Gentile who sought Him not.<a name=109:6></a> And as to Israel, there was no want of grace, but grace they had rejected.<a name=109:7></a> God had stretched out His hands all the day to a disobedient and gainsaying people.<a name=109:8></a>

		The apostle magnifies his office of apostle to the Gentiles, by shewing its bearing thus on the Jews to put the Gentiles in their place, and guard them against the pride of supposed superiority in the flesh.<a name=110:1></a> And here comes in the solemn warning addressed to them.<a name=110:2></a> The stock of promise, beginning with Abraham, was naturally carried out in this world in the Jews; the root bore the branches, the Gentiles had no ground for pride.<a name=110:3></a> Abraham was the root of promise, and Israel the natural branches.<a name=110:4></a> Some had been broken off; true, because of unbelief, and the Gentiles had been graffed into a root to which they did not naturally belong; and they were graffed in on the principle of faith, contrary to nature, as the old branches had been broken off for unbelief.<a name=110:5></a> The Gentiles stood thus only on the ground of faith; if, therefore, as a body they departed from it -- did not continue in God's goodness, which, contrary to nature (for the question is not of the body of Christ, but their outward connection with the place of promise in this world) had graffed them into the olive tree of promise, to partake of its root and fatness, they would be in turn broken off.<a name=110:6></a>

		We have here nothing to do with the church, or union with Christ; but with the tree of promise in this world, beginning with Abraham, to whom and to whose seed the promises were made.<a name=110:7></a> Goodness, on the principle of faith, had given Gentiles a part in these, which the Jewish branches had lost, but the stock was not Gentile, but Abrahamic and Jewish, and what the Gentiles had by faith, they would lose by the want of it.<a name=110:8></a> And such were God's counsels.<a name=110:9></a> God was bringing in by this means a number of Gentiles, and for yet better things, and when by this outward system of Gentile association with the promises their number was complete, the time of the blindness which had come upon Israel as a nation, for that purpose, would be over, and Israel as a whole, as a nation, would be saved.<a name=110:10></a> God would give them, not then, as such, the heavenly portion of the church, which is not here in question, but graff them back into the place of promise, the enjoyment of what the root Abraham bore in blessing.<a name=110:11></a> And that would be by the coming of Christ, who would turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<a name=110:12></a> What is taught here, then, is a tree on the earth with Abraham for its root, who, when God had formed the nations, and all had fallen into idolatry, had been called out from among them, according to election, to be father (or root) of a race blessed with the promises of God.<a name=110:13></a>

		Israel was the natural heir according to the flesh; but when He, in whom the accomplishment of these promises is, came, they rejected Him through unbelief, and were broken off, the election continuing in the place of promise (not added to the church here); Gentiles were graffed in contrary to nature, to enjoy the blessing of Abraham -- those very nations out of which Abram had been called.<a name=111:1></a> This was by faith, not by descent of nature.<a name=111:2></a> If they left this, they would be cut off, cease to have, as so called, the promises on earth -- at any rate, they were not to boast against the branches, for the root bore them, not they the root, and the cut-off branches could and would be graffed in again, that is, Israel restored in its original place in the enjoyment of promise.<a name=111:3></a> As regards the gospel, they are enemies as a people, in order to the bringing in of the Gentiles; but as touching the election of the people, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.<a name=111:4></a> We see evidently here, it is the election of the people, it is in contrast with blessing by the gospel, and the ground of their being beloved is the fathers, as we find constantly in the Old Testament, as Exodus 32: 13; Leviticus 26: 42; and other passages.<a name=111:5></a> For of His gifts and calling God does not repent.<a name=111:6></a>

		The Spirit of God shews out, then, the wonderful moral wisdom of God in these counsels.<a name=111:7></a> The Gentiles had of old been unbelieving, so now it was pure mercy to them; the Jews had rejected this mercy to the Gentiles, and were themselves in unbelief, so that it had become pure mercy now to them also.<a name=111:8></a> Thus God had concluded all in unbelief, that all might be mere objects of mercy.<a name=111:9></a> The Jews had promises, and if they had received Christ, faithfulness would have fulfilled them in Him.<a name=111:10></a> As is said in this epistle, "Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.<a name=111:11></a>" But the Jews rejected Christ, and so came under mercy like the Gentiles.<a name=111:12></a> This it is that makes the apostle cry out as to God's deep wisdom, that this rejection of the Jews brought mercy to the Gentiles; and brought, seeing they rejected Christ in unbelief, the Jews on the footing of mere mercy also, though God only shewed Himself more abundantly true to His promise, which He accomplishes in spite of all.<a name=111:13></a> We have to read verse 31, "Even so have these also not believed your mercy, that they also might obtain mercy.<a name=111:14></a>"

These were interwoven the last giving rise to corruption inconceivable, the consecration of degrading lusts. The gods, as popularly known, were deified passions, as Venus, Mars, etc., and the powers of nature. Behind all these was always the unknown God. Conscience had no part in the scheme; natural benevolence might, as in India; nor even when something of conscience (for all have one since the fall) mingled with it, as in the Egyptian Amenti, no future intercourse with God, transmigration, exaltation to gods like themselves. But though the root of God-consciousness was always there, fellowship with God was unknown.

		Of this the epistle to the Galatians brings out very distinctly the following points: -- promise, in contrast with law, which brought a curse and no justification of man; redemption from that curse, by Christ's being made a curse for us; then through Christ the promised Seed, come of the woman (once the source of sin), and made under the law to redeem those under it, meeting the two great forms of responsibility and consequent judgment before and after the flood, Himself the Son, that, the blessing of Abraham coming on the Gentiles too, all might receive the adoption of sons.<a name=119:1></a> Thus was Christ the fulfiller of promise in contrast with the school-master till He came.<a name=119:2></a> But, we being sons by faith in Him, the Spirit is given to us, giving the consciousness of the relationship.<a name=119:3></a> The heirs are no more servants but sons, and the Spirit is in contrast with the law.<a name=119:4></a> The flesh, our evil nature, lusts against the Spirit; but, if led of this, we are not under law; nor can there be a law against the fruit of the Spirit.<a name=119:5></a> Thus we have the recognition of the natural evil of man (not the full inquiry as to our place under God's dealings), promise, law, the promised One, redemption accomplished by Him, and the consequent gift of the promised Spirit and the sonship into which we are brought.<a name=119:6></a> The ways and dealings of God are fully discussed, our place ascertained; but the counsels of God are not touched upon.<a name=119:7></a> Hence I said it was elementary, though most important in its place.<a name=119:8></a>

		The Ephesians therefore begins with the counsels of God, first setting us in our place before God morally like Himself -- Christ's position, who is gone to His Father and our Father, His God and our God; then, after briefly stating redemption as that which we have as needed to bring us there, and indeed to make God known, God's purposes as to the Christ Himself, head over all as Man, are stated; which brings in the inheritance and the earnest of the given Spirit till the redemption of the purchased possession, when glory will be revealed.<a name=120:1></a> The present exaltation of Christ, and the working of the same power in us which took Him when dead from the grave to the right hand of God, brings us raised with Him to be in Him on high, the church associated with Him; His body who is Head over all things, and to it.<a name=120:2></a> This work of Christ is unfolded in chapter 2.<a name=120:3></a> Christ is first seen in death where we were lying in sins, and (these put away by His bearing them -- going down to death for us) God's power comes in and raises us up with Him into the same place of glory and blessing.<a name=120:4></a> Thus the purpose of God in the sons and heirs, in the church as Christ's body united to Him, is fully revealed; the practical consequence gone into.<a name=120:5></a> It is a scheme hidden from all ages and generations, impossible to exist or be revealed till the middle wall of partition was broken down.<a name=120:6></a><a href="#120:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		The apostle then enters into his own feelings as to, and interest in, them; and that connected with his universal commission to the Gentiles, in which the love of Christ wrought to make those the objects of his heart, and precious to him, whom he had not even seen.<a name=127:1></a> The apostolic spiritual power he would impart to them, but in unfeigned grace he would be comforted in their mutual faith.<a name=127:2></a> "Debtor to Greeks and barbarians" (for such is the place of love in power), he was ready to preach the glad tidings to those at Rome also.<a name=127:3></a> He was not ashamed of the glad tidings; they were "the power of God unto salvation"; simple words, but how much they contain!<a name=127:4></a> It is not God claiming from man; it is not man acting for God, or making out the means of meeting Him.<a name=127:5></a> But, God acting for man, it is power at work in man's favour; and this, not to help or plead merely, but to deliver from the state he was in -- to save him.<a name=127:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, the way.<a name=127:7></a> It is such to every one that believed, Jew, or Greek; they wanted saving.<a name=127:8></a> God's power, there to save, took man up in his need and sin, not in his titles or claims, even if given of God, and applied to a lost Gentile as to a lost Jew.<a name=127:9></a> It was for "every one that believed" -- the way of it was faith; the order of it recognised God's ways.<a name=127:10></a> It was "to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<a name=127:11></a>" But this did not alter its character; it was salvation to a sinful Jew, who had to come in in mercy, just like a Gentile, by faith in what was on God's part in grace towards him, though in the order of administration it might first be addressed to him.<a name=127:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it is the power of God to salvation, because in it the righteousness of God is revealed on the principle of faith to faith.<a name=127:13></a> Nothing had to be done by man; nothing was required from man.<a name=127:14></a> God's righteousness, perfect and absolute -- that on which He would bless without limit -- was revealed for man.<a name=127:15></a> More He could not require; more, as to righteousness, He could not give; and there it was for man, and revealed, and thus God's power to save him.<a name=127:16></a> This took it clean out of man's doings for God; which I insist on, because it is the great principle of truth, it is God's doing for man.<a name=127:17></a> It is on the principle of faith that it might be by grace; man only believed through grace what was revealed.<a name=127:18></a> Hence the believer withal possessed it, and so Gentile or Jew.<a name=127:19></a> But here the object is its intrinsic nature.<a name=127:20></a> It was "God's righteousness"; it was revealed "on the principle of faith" (works do not make out God's righteousness, but man's), and hence "for faith.<a name=127:21></a>" The just were to live by faith.<a name=127:22></a>

		This closes the introductory verses.<a name=128:1></a> The Person of the Lord Jesus and the righteousness of God are the great thesis of the glad tidings of God.<a name=128:2></a> One revealed as the Deliverer, the Son of God, claimed the obedience of faith; the other, still on the principle of faith, revealed as the ground on which man could have a part in purposed blessing through grace.<a name=128:3></a> The apostle now turns to what made this righteousness of God necessary to us.<a name=128:4></a> "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness.<a name=128:5></a>" This is a most important principle.<a name=128:6></a> It is not governmental wrath, such as bringing the Assyrian against Israel, or leading them captive to Babylon -- a thing of this world, while God was hidden still behind the veil.<a name=128:7></a> It tells us of the incompatibility of God's nature with evil.<a name=128:8></a> God's wrath was revealed against everything inconsistent with His nature -- wrath from heaven against all ungodliness; and, where the truth was known, and men might seem to be nearer to God, as the Jews, if held in unrighteousness, wrath was against such as so held it too.<a name=128:9></a> Wrath against all ungodliness was revealed from heaven; Gentile, Jew, men in every condition, came under the judgment.<a name=128:10></a> It was not a hidden God dealing in earthly judgment, but God Himself fully revealed according to His own nature, abhorrent of evil, in necessary wrath against all evil, wherever it was met.<a name=128:11></a> His nature could admit no evil.<a name=128:12></a> Dispensational ways there might have been -- government, patience.<a name=128:13></a> But now wrath was revealed from heaven against all evil, wherever it was found.<a name=128:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle then shews on what ground the judgment went, as against all men: on the heathen, to the end of the chapter: on moralisers, in the beginning of chapter 2; and from verse 17 of chapter 2 on the Jew, which goes on to chapter 3: 20.<a name=128:15></a> The ground of the condemnation of the heathen is creation testimony, and their not retaining God in their knowledge; for in Noah that knowledge was.<a name=128:16></a> The first ground is stated in verses 19, 20; the second in verse 21.<a name=128:17></a> They turned the glory of the incorruptible God into images of men, birds, beasts, and reptiles; and as they thus turned God's glory into dishonour, God gave them up to turn man's too, and they degraded themselves in vileness as they had degraded God in idolatry.<a name=128:18></a> Yet they knew the judgment of God.<a name=128:19></a>

		And this made the moralisers, the Socrates, and the like, inexcusable; they did the things they judged; see chapter 2.<a name=129:1></a> But God's judgment is according to truth against those who commit such things.<a name=129:2></a> Doing them and judging others was not the way of escaping God's judgment; or, were they despising God's mercy leading them to repentance, and heaping up wrath for the day of judgment -- of the revelation of God's righteous judgment?<a name=129:3></a> God always judges evil morally; but there is a day when that judgment will be revealed, and this dealing with evil take place in a manifest way, according to the nature of God.<a name=129:4></a> Judgment will be executed.<a name=129:5></a> We have seen this infinitely important principle in chapter 1: 17; not dispensational government on those near or those far off, but God revealing His judgment of evil in man according to what He is.<a name=129:6></a> Hence the light of Christianity is thrown here on the grounds of judgment, though the light actually possessed is made to enter into the measure of retribution; but the nature, and, in judgment, the authority of God, rejects evil.<a name=129:7></a> Jew or Gentile, it is all alike.<a name=129:8></a> When He is revealed, evil is dealt with as evil.<a name=129:9></a> The special advantages of one may enter into the ground of judgment, and if they have sinned under law, they will be judged by law.<a name=129:10></a> But evil is evil, while God is God, be the evil in a Jew or a Gentile; nor is there respect of persons with Him.<a name=129:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the revelation of God, which thus brings in the knowledge of judgment according to truth, necessarily supposes the truth there, and obedience to the truth became part of the moral testing of man, as well as law and natural conscience.<a name=129:12></a> Hence, in chapter 2: 7, 8, we have what Christianity has brought to light; verses 9, 10, tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that does evil, and glory, honour, and peace upon every soul of man that does good -- to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<a name=129:13></a>

		The object of the apostle here is evidently not to shew how a sinner could be justified; but that, though God might follow in His administration of blessing what He had accorded to the Jewish people, yet now that He had revealed Himself, He had to do with realities, and that a godly Gentile was more His delight than an ungodly Jew, whatever the privileges of the latter.<a name=130:1></a> The doer of the law would be justified, be he Jew or Gentile; not he who had and broke it.<a name=130:2></a> There was no respect of persons with God, and conscience might take notice of right and wrong where there was no law, and thus become a law to a man who had no law as given of God.<a name=130:3></a> So they that had sinned without law would perish without it.<a name=130:4></a> Here the discussion is not, by what power or grace a man would be led or enabled to walk conscientiously, but that reality of walk, and not privilege of position, was what God owned.<a name=130:5></a>

		It is well to remark that there is no law written in the heart<a href="#130:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> of the Gentile -- that is the new covenant -- but the <i>work</i> which the law requires the conscience recognises as right or wrong.<a name=130:6></a> Conscience knows it is wrong to murder or steal, when no law is given.<a name=130:7></a> Man got the knowledge of good and evil by the fall, and it is of all importance to recognise the difference of this and law.<a name=130:8></a> Law imposes a rule by authority -- here God's authority; conscience on the contrary takes notice of right and wrong in itself, as God does.<a name=130:9></a> "The man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil.<a name=130:10></a>" That is, conscience takes notice of good and evil in itself, as good and as evil, without any law which prescribes or forbids it; and so far a man is a law to himself, that is, not having the thing prescribed to him, or forbidden, as a law does.<a name=130:11></a>

		It is well also to remark here that verses 13-15 are a parenthesis.<a name=130:12></a> The connection is, "judged by the law in the day.<a name=130:13></a>" Remark here, also, on the side of man's liability as before of God's actings, it is not governmental judgment, the ways of God with men on earth, visiting, it is true, sins on a people or on a race with longsuffering and patience; but the secrets of men's hearts judged -- all brought to light, strictly and rightly judged -- according to the necessary requirements of God's nature, taking into account the advantages men have had; not governing in patience, but judging in righteousness, according to what is good and what is evil, as none can deny, and where none can escape.<a name=130:14></a> The secrets of men's hearts would be judged, and men come out such as they really were, however hidden from the eyes of men.<a name=130:15></a>

		In chapter 2: 17 the apostle begins definitely with a Jew, insisting on the same truth, but the converse of what he had said of the Gentile.<a name=131:1></a> A Jew who boasted of the law and broke it was as bad as he who had none; the name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles through them.<a name=131:2></a> He only was a Jew who was so inwardly; whose heart was circumcised in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise was not of men, but of God.<a name=131:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to a very important principle in the ways of God, the possession of privileges where there was no renewal of heart to profit by them, and whether this made such any better, more agreeable to God -- for this the Jew pretended; chapter 3.<a name=131:4></a> The apostle's argument seemed to level all.<a name=131:5></a> It did morally before God, save as privileges added to responsibility; but he fully admitted the existence of very great privileges and advantages where God had placed them.<a name=131:6></a> If the circumcised were uncircumcision really unless they kept the law, what advantage had the Jew?<a name=131:7></a> Much every way.<a name=131:8></a> The apostle fully recognises their privileges, especially in having the scriptures, "the oracles of God"; and if some did not believe, their unbelief would not make the faith -- that is, the faithfulness of God -- of no effect.<a name=131:9></a> God would be true if every man were a liar.<a name=131:10></a> He would fulfil His word.<a name=131:11></a> But if His accomplishing it in spite of man's unfaithfulness only the more proved His faithfulness, so that He was the more glorified through man's unfaithfulness, this did not hinder His judging the evil: were it so, He could not judge the world at all.<a name=131:12></a> If man's unrighteousness made God's righteousness more conspicuous, why should God judge him for it?<a name=131:13></a> This is a general principle, but it has a special application to the Jews; for the more the heathen opposed and were jealous of them, and trampled them down, so much the more God's faithfulness shone out, and He could no more judge the Gentiles, the world, than the Jews.<a name=131:14></a> But it is a general principle that man's unrighteousness commending or proving God's righteousness did not make it unjust to judge.<a name=131:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle returns to the form in which it applies to the Jews -- that their falseness made God's faithfulness to His promises more glorious, so that he had not to find fault; nay, they might do evil that good might come, returning in this latter to the general principle; as, indeed, some charged the Christian with holding.<a name=131:16></a> As to such principle, the apostle does not condescend to reason, but simply says, "whose damnation is just.<a name=131:17></a>" No, all our evil does commend this patient faithfulness of God to His promises, and to His goodness.<a name=131:18></a> Man would soon reject those who dealt with him as he does with God.<a name=131:19></a> But that does not hinder responsibility, and sin, and judgment.<a name=131:20></a>

		We have then additional detail, and the manner of its application to the Old Testament saints and those since Christ.<a name=133:16></a> God, the apostle tells us, had set Christ forth as a propitiatory, a place of access on the ground of redemption and blood presented to God as the atonement or propitiation for sins.<a name=133:17></a> Now, as regards the Old Testament saints, this now proved God's righteousness in having borne with them, where they sinned.<a name=133:18></a> His forbearance had been shewn at the time; but where was the righteousness in thus passing over the sins of the Abrahams, and Samuels, and Davids, and the like?<a name=133:19></a> This was now shewn.<a name=133:20></a> It was in view of the propitiation to be wrought by Christ, ever present to God, on the ground of which He dealt as if it was already accomplished, so far as the forgiveness of sins went.<a name=133:21></a>

		Then, as regards those subsequent to the work, God's full present justice was declared -- His righteousness declared at this time; that through which He could be just and justify, yea, that in which He was manifested just, besides exalting Christ, is in justifying the believers in Christ Jesus.<a name=134:1></a> This was an immense truth.<a name=134:2></a> Forbearance had been before, righteousness in exercising it unrevealed.<a name=134:3></a> Now righteousness was revealed, God's righteousness, first in His exercise of that forbearance, justifying His remission of the sins committed before Christ, but further (righteousness, God's righteousness, being fully revealed), the ground of justifying those who believed in Jesus, God's righteousness in doing so was as clearly manifested as the ground on which it went was perfectly accomplished.<a name=134:4></a> God's righteousness was fully proved in setting Christ at His right hand, as we learn in John 16: 10.<a name=134:5></a> He is gone up on high in virtue of having glorified God perfectly on the cross, and God's righteousness therein revealed and declared.<a name=134:6></a> In the part of Romans we are now occupied with, we have only the fact that God's righteousness is now declared as to remission of past sins, and justifying believers now, Christ being set forth as a mercy-seat through faith in His blood.<a name=134:7></a> The value of Christ's blood brings the witness of righteousness in remission of past sins, but it brings a known present justification of those who believe, maintaining fully the justice of God.<a name=134:8></a> He is just and the Justifier, not a condemner, of those that believe.<a name=134:9></a>

		All boasting then on man's part is shut out, for it is God's work and God's grace by which man is justified (clearly not by a law of works, there would then be man's boasting), but by the law of faith which simply receives, through grace, the effect of another's work.<a name=134:10></a> We may see here that law is used for a regularly acting principle -- the law of faith, the law of works.<a name=134:11></a> We shall find this again.<a name=134:12></a> Hence, as we cannot mingle the two principles of gaining a thing by working and receiving a thing by faith (and, indeed, another thing -- God's righteousness, not man's), one of them excludes the other, and we conclude, not only that a man is justified by faith through Christ's blood by grace, but that it is without -- wholly apart from, to the exclusion of -- works of law.<a name=134:13></a> God is justifying sinners by His dealings for them, not man righteous by a law which he has kept.<a name=134:14></a> For all are under sin.<a name=134:15></a>

		The apostle then develops the principles of the case of Abraham.<a name=137:8></a> The promise to Abraham to be the heir of the world was not through law, but through the righteousness of faith.<a name=137:9></a> If they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void.<a name=137:10></a> To make Israel as under the law exclusively heir destroyed the principle on which Abraham had the inheritance.<a name=137:11></a> He had it by faith, and not by any law at all.<a name=137:12></a> Promise is not law; and to found the inheritance on law, and give it to Israel because of the law, made the promise of none effect.<a name=137:13></a> Promise, and faith in it, went together.<a name=137:14></a> Law was man's work, and on God's part requirement from man, not promise to him.<a name=137:15></a> And indeed the law works wrath instead of giving an inheritance; for where no law is, there is no transgression, for there is nothing to transgress: working wrath and bringing in transgression is surely not promise.<a name=137:16></a> But the inheritance is of faith, not of law, that it might be by grace; for faith just believes in the grace shewn, and thus the promise is sure to all the seed, for grace can give it to a Gentile, and faith in a Gentile can receive it, not simply give it to the seed under the law, though faith there could receive it, but to everyone who had the faith of Abraham, who is the father, not of Jews only, but of us all (as it is written, "I have made thee a father of many nations") before God, the God whom he had believed.<a name=137:17></a>

		But this introduces another principle.<a name=137:18></a> When Abraham received the promise, he was as good as dead.<a name=137:19></a> The God in whom he believed is a God above human failure and weakness, and calls things that are not as though they were.<a name=137:20></a> Abraham believed God in spite of his deadness and that of Sarah: it was a quasi-resurrection.<a name=137:21></a> This introduces yet another great and important principle.<a name=137:22></a> Grace on the part of God, and faith on the part of man, we have had, in connection with promise on the one hand, and the redemption that is in Christ on the other.<a name=137:23></a> Now power comes in -- God's power; not a dealing with man according to any good or capacity that is in him, but God that raises the dead, and according to this power calls things that are not as though they were.<a name=137:24></a> He can make them to be as He calls them.<a name=137:25></a> This applies to Abraham's case, to the Gentiles, and, as to the power in its nature, Christ's resurrection.<a name=137:26></a>

		There is a point here which it is well to note.<a name=139:11></a> We have in this part of the epistle no experience.<a name=139:12></a> Happy in forgiveness, as a result, no doubt we are; but it is not an internal process issuing in deliverance in the power of divine grace, but a complete work done, through which God's righteousness is declared, God's work meeting the sins by reason of which He has pronounced upon us as guilty -- none righteous, no, not one -- and proved us such.<a name=139:13></a> He has demonstrated all, Jew and Gentile, to be under sin, and justified freely by His grace.<a name=139:14></a> It is proved guilt, not experience; complete justification by Christ's being delivered for our offences, not what passes in our hearts.<a name=139:15></a> The experience of what is within, and the deliverance, comes afterwards in chapters 7 and 8.<a name=139:16></a>

		This shews the completeness of this part of the epistle as to its proper subject, and how the gospel refers, first, to guilt and clearing from it -- our justification from that guilt; not to our state or nature, though the fruits of the old man constitute that guilt.<a name=139:17></a> It shews, too, how a full free gospel can be preached without touching on our nature, and state by that; though a solid settled condition of soul cannot exist without the experience and deliverance of the subsequent part of the epistle.<a name=139:18></a> The natural man can understand forgiveness, the payment of a debt, a child about to be punished, what it is to be pardoned; but a soul under the exercises produced by the Spirit of God can alone understand what sin is within, and deliverance from its power.<a name=139:19></a> It is quite true that to have a real work, even as to forgiveness, there must be the conviction of guilt under our sins.<a name=139:20></a> Conscience must be reached, guilt must be owned; the statement of the epistle as to that guilt, that we are under sin, must find its personal application and echo in the conscience, our just condemnation endorsed by the conscience as to oneself; so that we should be conscious that we -- I -- have to be freely justified.<a name=139:21></a> But we can see that with the mere consciousness that we have sinned without any real sense of the existence of the old man, of our exclusion from God by it, forgiveness can be understood, nay, it can be supposed, though no real forgiveness is possessed, nor reconciliation effected.<a name=139:22></a> It is not insincerity, it is self-delusion; but it shews how the gospel of repentance as to sins of which we are guilty, and remission of these, may be preached without the experience of what we are in ourselves having been wrought in the soul.<a name=139:23></a> Genuine acknowledgment of our guilt in the conscience there must be, to have any reality of repentance or forgiveness, but no experimental knowledge of self.<a name=139:24></a> This may come before the knowledge of forgiveness, and will generally then be accompanied by great distress of soul, and forgiveness and permanent rest of conscience will come together.<a name=139:25></a> But the two things are clearly distinguished in the epistle, the experience of what we are, coming last; the testimony -- God's testimony, proof, and judgment as to universal guilt, forgiveness, and justification, with its blessed results, through Christ's work, delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification -- being complete at the end of verse 11 of chapter 5.<a name=139:26></a> Of the experience itself, and our state in the flesh through Adam's fall, we will speak when we come to the subsequent chapters.<a name=139:27></a> All I do now is to shew the distinction between the two.<a name=139:28></a>

		This completes what I receive as the effect of the blessed work of Christ and the grace that gave Him, and to me a part in that work by faith; but it is not all.<a name=143:1></a> Twice the blessed Spirit adds, "Not only so.<a name=143:2></a>" I have indeed, in these three points, peace as to all that could make me guilty and take away peace, present favour, and the hope of glory; all that is given me, right into glory, fully stated.<a name=143:3></a> Past, present, and future-an eternal future -- all perfectly settled in grace; but there is the way there, and more than that, the Giver as well as the gift to think of.<a name=143:4></a> All that concerns me as to what grace gives is complete; but I have much to learn, much to be corrected, perhaps much to be subdued, much that tends to hinder my seeing the hope clearly, and fixing my heart upon it.<a name=143:5></a> I find tribulations on the way, and I rejoice and glory in them also.<a name=143:6></a> They work patience, a subduing of the will, and the quietness of spirit which that gives.<a name=143:7></a>

		But there is another very important element in this, besides the subjective fruit in the state of our soul.<a name=144:1></a> I have both the key to all these tribulations and the power which enables me to bear them, and to know their meaning; to connect them with a blessedness which lifts us above them all, and turns us to the grace that uses them, all to give deeper and eternal blessing -- the grace of Him who withdraws not His eyes from the righteous, who deigns to watch over us in detail, to follow our characters and state, and to make everything work together for our good.<a name=144:2></a> The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=144:3></a> That which is in God -- what He is in His nature -- is shed abroad, is not only known, but pervades in its power our hearts.<a name=144:4></a> It is God's love, but in our hearts, and this by His own presence, here noticed for the first time -- the Holy Ghost given to us.<a name=144:5></a> The cleansing and justifying being complete and absolute, every obstacle thus removed, the Holy Spirit can come and dwell in us, and bring in what God is in His nature into our hearts.<a name=144:6></a> The clearance of evil made way for this, and now the presence of God, such as He is (and He is love), fills the heart.<a name=144:7></a>

		But the introduction of the Holy Ghost in this place is a truth of the utmost importance.<a name=144:8></a> The baptising with the Holy Ghost was one of the two great acts ascribed to the Lord in John 1.<a name=144:9></a> This is the practical application of it consequent on the value and efficacy of that blood by which the sins of those that believe have been put away.<a name=144:10></a> So, in the Old Testament, the leper was washed with water, then sprinkled with blood, and then anointed with oil.<a name=144:11></a> So we are washed with the word, sprinkled with Christ's blood, and then anointed with the Holy Ghost.<a name=144:12></a> It is not being born again.<a name=144:13></a> That applies to the Holy Ghost's work in unbelievers: it is after we believe that we are sealed.<a name=144:14></a> Farther, this sealing is, I think, always associated with forgiveness.<a name=144:15></a> "Repent and be baptised," says Peter, "for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=144:16></a>" In Acts 10: 43, it is when Peter is announcing the remission of sins that the Holy Ghost comes down on believing Cornelius.<a name=144:17></a> And here in Romans the mention of the Holy Ghost comes in when forgiveness and justification have been made known, as in chapter 4, and indeed in chapter 3, and before the experience of what we are, and our being in Christ, is entered upon.<a name=144:18></a>

		Remark, farther, how, while the enjoyment of the love is by the Holy Ghost dwelling in us, the knowledge and proof of it is in a work done outside of us, and wholly independent of us, indeed for us, when in an evil and wholly incapable state.<a name=145:13></a> "For," continues the apostle, "when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<a name=145:14></a>" Ungodly, and without strength -- such was our state when the glorious work of God's love was accomplished for us.<a name=145:15></a> But this gives us the certainty that the purity and perfectness of God's own work and nature were in it.<a name=145:16></a> It suits us, is without a motive for it in us save our ruined state.<a name=145:17></a> God's love as of Himself alone is its source and efficient cause.<a name=145:18></a> It is what is His own.<a name=145:19></a> Perhaps for a righteous man some might die -- for some good one -- dare to die; but God commends His love (that which is proper and peculiar to Himself) in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<a name=145:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now get a principle of grace full of blessing for us.<a name=145:21></a> The Holy Ghost, who reveals the truth, does not reason from what we are to what God will be.<a name=145:22></a> Such is ever the reasoning of awakened man, and naturally so, because for conscience and judgment it must be so; only there is defective sense of sin, and a vague thought of mercy which enfeebles the effect of what sense of it there is.<a name=145:23></a> But even in the repentant soul this reasoning takes place till we have really met God, and known His grace; as the prodigal talked of being made a hired servant when he had not met his father.<a name=145:24></a> The Holy Ghost makes us see clearly that we are lost on the ground of judgment; but He reasons from what God is and has done to the consequence for us.<a name=145:25></a> He reasons according to the grace which He reveals.<a name=145:26></a> So here (verse 9, 10), much more being justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.<a name=145:27></a> If when enemies we were reconciled by His death, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.<a name=145:28></a> The Spirit thus reasons from what God is in grace to its consequences with us, not from our state to its consequences with God.<a name=145:29></a> Wherever this last is going on, the soul is yet in a legal state.<a name=145:30></a> There is either carelessness and self-delusion, or a mixture of law and grace.<a name=145:31></a> In the Holy Ghost's teaching there is no mixture; but either clear condemnation on the ground of responsibility, or salvation and blessing from grace through righteousness.<a name=145:32></a>

		But in this mere Judaism disappears, and the apostle consequently takes a wider range of thought, and views the whole state of man through the sin of him who stood first as man before God, and involved his race in the consequences of his defection from God.<a name=146:9></a> Each one has added his own sins, and that constitutes personal responsibility: but there is the universal state of all.<a name=146:10></a> Adam involved his whole race in sin and death, and in alienation and exclusion from God; only each added his own part; and thus (the reasoning passes from verses 12-18) by one offence, though all were not condemned because of grace, yet the bearing and tendency of the act was universal on the whole race; so by one righteousness was it for justification of life.<a name=146:11></a> All were not justified, any more than all condemned; but the bearing of the act in each case was universal, and had the whole race for its sphere, as that on which it bore, to which it applied.<a name=146:12></a> It is not upon all, but the bearing and direction of the act in each case.<a name=146:13></a> It is the same word as "unto" all, in contrast with "upon" all that believe, in chapter 3: 22.<a name=146:14></a> Adam's work bore on all, and so did Christ's work too.<a name=146:15></a>

		Then, in a parenthesis from verse 13 to the end of verse 17, we have the place the law holds in connection with this point, besides the act of the two great heads of ruin and blessing.<a name=147:1></a> Sin was in the world from Adam to Moses, when no law was yet there; but specific acts could not be put to charge where there was no law forbidding them.<a name=147:2></a> The word "imputed" is another word here from the general word for "imputing righteousness," and means putting a specific thing to the account of anyone; (which the other does not), being found, as already stated, in Philemon 18.<a name=147:3></a> Where no law forbade an act, you could not charge it as a transgression.<a name=147:4></a> Yet death reigned -- the effect and witness of sin being there -- over those who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression (that is, who had not violated an actual commandment, as Adam did).<a name=147:5></a> This is a quotation from Hosea 6: 7, where the same principle as to Adam and Moses is stated.<a name=147:6></a> They (Israel), like Adam, have transgressed the covenant.<a name=147:7></a> Adam had a formal law; a formal law was given under Moses.<a name=147:8></a> But between the two, where there was no formal law, sin and death were found.<a name=147:9></a> The ruin was universal; ought not the grace and bearing of Christ's act to be so?<a name=147:10></a> That is the force of chapter 5: 15.<a name=147:11></a> But what was the bearing of the law on this?<a name=147:12></a> That, when grace came in, it had a multitude of offences to deal with, as well as in general sin and alienation from God; such is verse 16.<a name=147:13></a> Then the superiority of grace is farther shewn in verse 17; that (whereas by one man's offence death reigned by one) not life should reign, but they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness would reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.<a name=147:14></a>

		The law came in by the bye in contrast with a state into which the respective heads brought those connected with them.<a name=149:1></a> What is important to see in this passage is, that the state was the consequence of the conduct of the head, not the conduct of the members met by that of the head.<a name=149:2></a> Judgment refers to works; this is a state the result of Adam's disobedience or Christ's obedience.<a name=149:3></a> The law came in between the two with a special object; it came in that the offence might abound.<a name=149:4></a> This is not the state constituted, but the act of the person under the law which forbade their acts, in contrast with that which affected the universal race by one man's disobedience, and all believers in Christ by His obedience.<a name=149:5></a> The law came in by the bye between the two heads of opposite states, the disobedient and the obedient Man, and came in with this intent -- to make positive "offence" (not sin) abound.<a name=149:6></a> God can do nothing that sin may abound; but, where sin already is, He can send a special prohibition of it, a law, which brings it out in a fuller character -- that it is not only evil but a defiance of His authority, an offence and a transgression; a law which the perverse will of man uses as a provocation to offending.<a name=149:7></a> Such was the law.<a name=149:8></a>

		In His life down here He served God perfectly, and lived by the Father, and every step was perfect, having God His Father always before His mind; but He had to do with sin all around Him; He was pressed by it, grieved, a Man of sorrows through it, He had for us to be made sin.<a name=152:1></a> Perfect in love manifesting God, perfect in obedience as Man come to do His will, still He came about sin, and was necessarily assailed by it in all around, and, as I have said, was finally to be made sin for us, when fully proved the sinless one Himself -- He who knew no sin.<a name=152:2></a> But now He has done with it for ever.<a name=152:3></a> He died to it here, passed (perfectly accomplishing His work) through death out of the whole scene where He had to do with it, in resurrection into a new state as man, where, in thought, object, and life, He has to do as to His state of life with God only.<a name=152:4></a> In that He lives, He lives to God.<a name=152:5></a> Nought where He is but what is filled with God -- so filled that nothing else can be there save what ministers to His glory.<a name=152:6></a> It is not merely the perfectness of His intention (this was always as perfect as His walk; in this sense He always lived to God), but that in which and to which He lives, where for His soul nought else is.<a name=152:7></a> It is a blessed thought of man's life, and shews, though the flesh be always the same, what the true Christian state is.<a name=152:8></a> Compare 2 Corinthians 1: 9; 4: 10, 12.<a name=152:9></a> His death was a single act in which He died to sin; His life a perpetual present, in which God is all from His soul to His object.<a name=152:10></a>

		So we are to reckon ourselves (our old man being crucified with Him) dead to sin, and alive to God through Him.<a name=152:11></a> It was a new and free life; for the believer was entitled to reckon himself dead unto sin; it was his condition and place as a believer to do so.<a name=152:12></a> If we are alive, we are alive to God, not through Adam at all, but through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=152:13></a> Thus it was wholly new, and, reckoning ourselves dead to sin, entirely free -- able to yield himself to God.<a name=152:14></a> Compare Romans 12: 2; and read "intelligent" for "reasonable.<a name=152:15></a>" It is not that sin in the flesh has not its lusts; but the believer as such does not let it reign in the body to obey it in its lusts, seeing he is free in the power of a new life; for so the believer is accounted free to walk in the power and after the things which belong to this new life.<a name=152:16></a> He holds the reins, and does not allow sin to use the body for its lusts -- the lusts of sin.<a name=152:17></a> Nor does this freeman give up his members to be instruments of righteousness unto sin -- that evil thing to which he was once a slave.<a name=152:18></a> He yields himself to God as one alive from the dead, for, as to his life born of Adam, he had died to sin, but now lives, and yields himself and his members as instruments of righteousness to God.<a name=152:19></a>

		For sin has not dominion over us, because we are not under law, but under grace: a grave and important sentence.<a name=153:1></a> Being under law leaves me under the dominion of sin.<a name=153:2></a> What we want is a free life, free from bondage to sin; for he that commits sin, says the Lord, is the slave of sin.<a name=153:3></a> Law gives neither life nor freedom nor strength, nor even an object which may turn our hearts elsewhere.<a name=153:4></a> It forbids, rightly and necessarily, the sins, but gives no life nor power.<a name=153:5></a> But under grace we have power.<a name=153:6></a> Life is given, strength is given, and an object is given; none of which, as we have seen, law gives.<a name=153:7></a> Thus, under grace, sin has no dominion over me; under law it has.<a name=153:8></a> It is beautiful to see, while it is all grace, still how we are given to yield ourselves to God -- true freedom, in which sin has no dominion over us; and, while the power comes from on high, we are really set free, and allowed to give ourselves willingly and freely to God.<a name=153:9></a>

		Here, then, the apostle takes up this freedom and reasons on it -- freedom, not in the old and sinful Adam, but, in that I am alive to God through Jesus Christ, I am free.<a name=153:10></a> The law forbids sin and lust, but does not deliver.<a name=153:11></a> I am not under it.<a name=153:12></a> I am freed from the dominion of sin, and not under law; freed from the dominion of sin, because I am not placed under law but under grace.<a name=153:13></a> Shall I then sin because I am not under a law which forbids it, and which curses me if I do it?<a name=153:14></a> God forbid.<a name=153:15></a>

		And now he returns to the great principle of the Gentile condition.<a name=153:16></a> If I yield myself to sin, as a slave, to obey it, I am its slave; and sin reigned by death without law being there.<a name=153:17></a> Death was the natural and appointed wages of sin, and that as the judgment of God.<a name=153:18></a> We could not say obedience unto life; for if we obey, we are alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord, but it has the fruit of practical righteousness.<a name=153:19></a> And note the character here of what is opposed to sin; not in itself righteousness -- the doing right as known by conscience or law -- but obedience.<a name=153:20></a> We are alive to God, and that is, and must be always, obedience.<a name=153:21></a> We cannot live to God otherwise than in obedience.<a name=153:22></a> So Christ lived.<a name=153:23></a> He was the obedient Man -- came to do God's will.<a name=153:24></a> His Father's will was the motive of all He did.<a name=153:25></a> He lived by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God.<a name=153:26></a> His path, consequently, was practical righteousness, and the pattern of it.<a name=153:27></a> So the apostle thanks God that, whereas they had been slaves of sin, they had obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine delivered to them.<a name=153:28></a>

		And here we learn the spring and character of this obedience.<a name=154:1></a> It is the obedience of faith, the reception of the word of God into the heart.<a name=154:2></a> This forms the link of obedience between the soul and God.<a name=154:3></a> The same reception of the word gives life.<a name=154:4></a> Of His own will begat He us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.<a name=154:5></a> It is life, it is an obedient life, in truth, the life of Christ in us; and He is the obedient Man.<a name=154:6></a> Thus made free from sin -- for this is the great point here -- they had become, yielding themselves up to obey, slaves to righteousness (using "slave" as a figure he excuses, for it is true liberty, but to make it plain to flesh's infirmity of understanding); for as they had formerly given up their members as slaves to uncleanness and to lawlessness, only to be lawless, letting loose an evil will which bore no fruit, so now he exhorts them to yield their members (for they were free) slaves to righteousness.<a name=154:7></a> But here there was a blessed result, holiness, a separation of heart to God in the true knowledge of Him, the soul brought into His image, as expressed in Colossians 3: 10 and Ephesians 4: 23, 24 (there more in its nature, here in practical growth, but the same general truth).<a name=154:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle continues the figure, and appeals to their consciousness of what had passed.<a name=154:9></a> They had been slaves of sin, and in no way subject to righteousness.<a name=154:10></a> What fruit had they then in the things they were now ashamed of?<a name=154:11></a> It was fruitless wasting of their members in lawlessness, and the end death.<a name=154:12></a> But now, free from sin -- his great theme, as we have seen -- free in the sense of out of bondage, no longer sin's slaves (such alone is the sense of the words here), and become slaves to God, entirely given up to serve Him, we have our fruit unto holiness; not only the end everlasting life, but by the way growing in knowledge of God, and likeness to Him, and separation of heart to Him from all evil, according to what He is.<a name=154:13></a> Walking in the path of obedience to Him, and so with Him, the soul is in that delivered from the power of evil, which is in will and lust, neither of which is its obedience.<a name=154:14></a>

		To recapitulate this important chapter.<a name=155:16></a> First, in reply to continuing in sin, we have found part in death, Christ's death, in order to be justified; that is not living on in such a life, but the contrary.<a name=155:17></a> Christ has died, and we esteem ourselves dead (compare 1 Peter 2: 24; 4: 1), the Christian being thus alive to God in the power of a new life.<a name=155:18></a> The first principle then, in which the flesh's judgment of the effect of the obedience of One constituting us righteous is controverted, is that we have part in the righteousness by having part in death, by being associated with Christ in His death (that is, in death to sin, which, clearly, is not living on in it).<a name=155:19></a> And we are to reckon ourselves dead, and alive to God in Jesus.<a name=155:20></a> But then comes the difficulty.<a name=155:21></a> We are not really dead, though called on to account ourselves so: how can we be free from the power of sin?<a name=155:22></a> This brings in the contrast with law.<a name=155:23></a> Law did not give power over sin in the flesh.<a name=155:24></a> It forbade its working and fruits, as it ought to do, but gave no freedom from it, no power against it.<a name=155:25></a> But sin shall not have dominion over us who believe, because we are not under law but under grace, and grace does give power -- does set free.<a name=155:26></a> I am not to let sin reign; and this frees me from its dominion.<a name=155:27></a> I am made free from sin, that is, delivered from captivity to it.<a name=155:28></a> Being free, I am to yield myself to God and righteousness, give myself up to Him, and my members, once instruments of lusts, as instruments of righteousness.<a name=155:29></a> It is the freedom of grace and divine life in power.<a name=155:30></a>

		This is the general doctrine: Christ having died, we reckon ourselves dead as if we had done so.<a name=156:1></a> He who is become our life, the true I, has died.<a name=156:2></a> I have died -- have been crucified -- with Him, and, as a Christian, do not own the flesh to be any more alive at all.<a name=156:3></a> I speak of all that has happened to Christ as if it had happened to me, because He is become my life, and I live by Him; as a son (whose father had not only paid his debts, but made him a partner) would speak of "our capital, our connections," because he is partner, though he brought nothing in, and all was done and acquired before he became partner; so we in much truer, because living, association with the Lord.<a name=156:4></a> Only, as I have remarked, we have not ascension, nor union with Him, nor resurrection with Him, which involves it; but the death of the old man, and life in Christ, and so freedom from sin -- the full answer to the allegation that having righteousness in Him gave license to sin.<a name=156:5></a> One important remark to make here is, that the true question is one of power.<a name=156:6></a> A rule of right is not power over an evil nature.<a name=156:7></a> Of this we shall see more; but even here we find that the reigning of sin in our mortal bodies, having dominion over us, is the real question.<a name=156:8></a> In point of fact we are not under law; but that is subsisting power in life, grace which gives it, for a mere (however just) claim of righteousness from one that was a sinner.<a name=156:9></a> The first answer to the allegation that being constituted righteous by Christ's obedience gives licence to sin is, that we have been planted in the likeness of His death -- have been crucified with Him.<a name=156:10></a> This applies to sin in the nature.<a name=156:11></a> But, besides this, we have grace contrasted with law, giving liberty from the dominion of sin and the slavery we were under to it, which law did not.<a name=156:12></a> We are free to live to God.<a name=156:13></a>

		On this follows a full discussion of law.<a name=157:1></a> We are free from law, following the same great fundamental principle that we have been crucified with Christ.<a name=157:2></a> Now law has power over a man as long as he lives.<a name=157:3></a> This is illustrated by the case of marriage, and the law or bond of husband and wife, which lasts evidently as long as one lives, and can no longer; the survivor is free to be to another when one is dead.<a name=157:4></a> It is of all importance to the understanding of this chapter to see that the whole subject treated is the bearing of the law -- the connection of a soul with it.<a name=157:5></a> First, the doctrine on the subject and the distinction of a soul being under law, or connected in life with a risen Christ; and then the experience of a soul quickened and renewed in its desires and delights, but not knowing deliverance by the knowledge that it has died with Christ, and is now connected with another -- Christ raised from the dead.<a name=157:6></a> The description of the deliverance follows, and the condition of the delivered soul in chapter 8.<a name=157:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Law has power over a man as long as he lives -- and cannot have it longer; the person to whom it applies exists no longer.<a name=157:8></a> If one to be punished for crime dies, law can no longer reach him.<a name=157:9></a> We have seen, in chapter 6, that the fact of not being under law does not cause to live in sin; but that, being under law, one has no power to resist it.<a name=157:10></a> It requires, but it does not free from the dominion of sin.<a name=157:11></a> But we have become dead to the law by the body of Christ.<a name=157:12></a> Had the law reached ourselves, it would have been death, but it would have been condemnation also.<a name=157:13></a><a href="#157:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> But we are delivered, being dead to the law, by the body of Christ.<a name=157:14></a> The figure is changed.<a name=157:15></a> Death puts an end to the bond, but it is we who die; yet not actually we, but Christ effectually for us; and now we are united to Him who is raised, that, the power of life being there, we should bring forth fruit -- not merely be dead to sin -- unto God.<a name=157:16></a>

		But another element comes in here: the spiritual judgment which can thus estimate all this -- "We know.<a name=160:1></a>" This is a technical expression for knowledge belonging to the Christian as such.<a name=160:2></a> See 1 Corinthians 8: 4; 2 Corinthians 5: 1; 1 John 3: 2; chapter 5: 13; and other places.<a name=160:3></a> We know the spirituality of the law; not applying it to crimes merely, but to the inward man.<a name=160:4></a> But if I look at myself as a child of Adam, I am carried a captive to sin, sold under it.<a name=160:5></a> I say, a child of Adam; for the apostle says, "in me, that is, in my flesh.<a name=160:6></a>" He is looking at the man as standing on that ground with Christian knowledge as to it, but as married to the first husband -- the law: "When we were in the flesh.<a name=160:7></a>" It is Christian intelligence applied to the judgment of the state of (not an unrenewed person in mind and desire, but) one under the law.<a name=160:8></a> Hence the law only is mentioned, not Christ or the Spirit, till the cry for deliverance from that state come.<a name=160:9></a> It is not a question whether the flesh is in us; but "when we were in the flesh," the motions of sin there, we being met in that state by the requirements of law in our conscience, not as redeemed and dead with Christ, delivered and having the power of life in Him, consciously in that state.<a name=160:10></a>

		Further, the man here is a slave; in chapter 8: 2 he is set free.<a name=161:13></a> In chapter 7: 5 we are supposed to be in the flesh; in chapter 8: 9, we are not in the flesh, if the Spirit of God dwell in us.<a name=161:14></a> If a man be not dead with Christ, he is fully in the flesh.<a name=161:15></a> If he do not know it, the conscience and mind are on that ground with God.<a name=161:16></a> What he is, not what Christ is, is the ground on which he judges of his state before God.<a name=161:17></a> As to his conscious standing, he is in the flesh; and it is the process of deliverance from this by the thorough humiliation of selfknowledge that is here described.<a name=161:18></a> The operation of the law is what is contemplated; grace working in the man, but he, as to his mind and conscience, under law undelivered.<a name=161:19></a> By the law is the knowledge of sin.<a name=161:20></a> Grace has given him to see that the law is spiritual.<a name=161:21></a> It is not sins, but sin, which is in question.<a name=161:22></a> Conscience has by grace recognised that the law is good, yea, the spirit consents to it; more than that, he delights in it, after the inner man.<a name=161:23></a> He is a renewed man.<a name=161:24></a>

		We have then, further (this being the state of the person's soul), two points in respect of the law -- nothing, mark, in respect of Christ and the Spirit.<a name=162:1></a> He is not there yet, but on the way, getting, while taught of God, knowledge of sin (that is, of himself under law).<a name=162:2></a> In the first case he is doing evil, but would not; he does what he hates.<a name=162:3></a> He does wrong, but would not.<a name=162:4></a> He consents to the law that it is good.<a name=162:5></a> His conscience and mind accept it as right -- coincide with it, but he does the contrary; but thus under grace, by this very word, he is taught that it is not he does it, but sin that dwells in him.<a name=162:6></a> He has a new man, a new life, in which, thus taught, he can treat sin as a stranger, though dwelling in him -- as not himself.<a name=162:7></a> And now he has experimentally learnt, not mere doctrine, even though taught of God, as to something outside himself -- "we know" -- but something about himself, and a great lesson too: "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.<a name=162:8></a>" The flesh is a judged nature, a great point of progress.<a name=162:9></a> And now the second point in the renewed man comes out -- the positive will to do good.<a name=162:10></a> He delights in the law of God in the inner man -- not merely consents, having it as his own approved rule in conscience, but he would do good; but evil is there -- he cannot perform good.<a name=162:11></a> Power is wholly wanting: the law gives none.<a name=162:12></a> There is a law in his members, a constantly operating power of evil which brings him into captivity, though now against his will.<a name=162:13></a>

		Poor wretched man!<a name=162:14></a> But (immense advantage) he knows it; he knows himself.<a name=162:15></a> Desires and efforts to do right have resulted in this -- in the knowledge of himself and his real state: in him, that is, in his flesh, there is no good thing.<a name=162:16></a> But it is not (now he is quickened of God) himself at all.<a name=162:17></a> But that makes out no righteousness for him, no deliverance from the power of sin; he is still under it, being under law.<a name=162:18></a> It is an immense lesson to learn, that we have no power.<a name=162:19></a> (Like the poor man at the pool of Bethesda, the disease of which he had to be healed had taken away, even if he willed, the strength through which he could get healed; John 5.<a name=162:20></a>) Thus taught, the man ceases to look to being better, or to doing; he has learned what he is, and looks for a Deliverer.<a name=162:21></a> The moment God has brought him there, all is clear.<a name=162:22></a> He thanks God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=162:23></a> But though the subject treated be the experience of the soul under the law when its spirituality is known through grace, the thing learned is not what the law is, but what sin is -- what we are.<a name=162:24></a> By the law is the knowledge of sin.<a name=162:25></a> Hence, though the process be carried on under law, by which through the secret working of grace that knowledge is acquired, yet the thing we have learnt to know -- what sin in the flesh is -- is always true.<a name=162:26></a>

		Hence, although as we have said it is the description of a soul under law, yet it is in a way in which the lesson remains for the Christian at all times.<a name=163:1></a> Not that he is ever under law, or in the flesh -- he never is: he has died as connected with that first husband, and for faith the flesh is dead, and he is delivered; but the lesson he has learned remains always true.<a name=163:2></a> In him, that is, in his flesh, dwells no good thing.<a name=163:3></a> And it is experimentally known.<a name=163:4></a> The flesh may deceive him if he is careless, and he forget to bear about in his body the dying of the Lord Jesus, but it can no longer deceive him as to what it is itself.<a name=163:5></a> He may have left a door open in his house to an unfaithful servant, but he does not now take him for a trustworthy or unsuspected one.<a name=163:6></a> And the difference is immense.<a name=163:7></a> The power of flesh is broken.<a name=163:8></a> And, further, he has no thought of being in the flesh before God.<a name=163:9></a> The Galatians shew his position.<a name=163:10></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, that ye may not do the things that ye would.<a name=163:11></a>" "But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<a name=163:12></a>" You are not in Romans 7, though the evil flesh be there.<a name=163:13></a> You are free with the liberty wherewith Christ has set you free.<a name=163:14></a> Be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.<a name=163:15></a> Hence, too, after the deliverance is spoken of here, the abiding fact of the two natures is affirmed, though going on further than the law, the subject before us.<a name=163:16></a> "So, then, I myself with the mind serve the law of God; with the flesh, the law of sin.<a name=163:17></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In result, then, the state described is that of a soul under the law, but sin comes to be known, and conflict with this remains -- flesh remains flesh.<a name=163:18></a> But it is a very different thing to have to say to it, when we have no strength, when we are sold under it, and it has us down, in the combat, under the law of sin, and to be able to say, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=163:19></a>" The natures are the same; but it is one thing, having them, to be under the law, which is the strength of sin, and having died with Christ to have the life and Spirit of Christ, which is the strength of godliness; to be led captive as a rule or law by sin though hating it, or to rejoice in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free.<a name=163:20></a> This freedom, and the state of the believer in it, we shall find developed in chapter 8.<a name=163:21></a> The two points before us are, deliverance, and the abiding of the law of sin in the flesh; only that it is not I.<a name=163:22></a> That is the mind which serves the law of God.<a name=163:23></a> That is experimental and learned.<a name=163:24></a>

		But there are two things the apostle now assumes of the Christian.<a name=164:1></a> What constitutes him such -- being in Christ, and the Spirit of God dwelling in him?<a name=164:2></a> What belongs to such is another thing.<a name=164:3></a> That is being a Christian.<a name=164:4></a> But we must remark that the measure of walk and practical effect is limited, as all here is, to human responsibility.<a name=164:5></a> One passage alone connects us with the counsels of God, and then only as a great general truth.<a name=164:6></a> But the result in practice takes the measure of human responsibility, whatever the deliverance needed to enable us to meet it.<a name=164:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the man in Christ, then, there can be no condemnation.<a name=164:8></a> Such is the first statement in this chapter.<a name=164:9></a> It will be remembered that it was said there were two passages descriptive of the Christian's blessing, chapter 5: 1-11, and chapter 8, the former already treated of, and what now occupies us: that, the blessing flowing from what God was towards us in grace; this, the believer's status before God.<a name=164:10></a> Hence here it is "there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" -- not for those for whose sins Christ has died.<a name=164:11></a> These last are forgiven, the man justified and fully blest; but it is not his new standing as one who has died as in the flesh, and is alive to God in Christ; who is married to Him that is risen from the dead.<a name=164:12></a> How could there be condemnation for those who are in Christ?<a name=164:13></a> It would be, so to speak, like condemning Christ.<a name=164:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the reason is given in connection with what precedes; and that on the side of good in the power of life in Christ on the one side, and as to the evil, the condemnation of sin in the flesh, on the other.<a name=164:15></a> The being in Christ is the great and sure ground; but the conditions and ground of it are added when this is the case.<a name=164:16></a> The law of sin and death has lost its power.<a name=164:17></a> I have another principle of life in power in me, which has its own constant nature and rule; for such is the force of "law" here -- "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.<a name=164:18></a>" This alludes to the breath, or spirit of life, breathed into Adam.<a name=164:19></a> Now it was spiritual or divine life in the power of the Spirit of Christ in us; and this had its constant law and character, and was power which had made the Christian free from the law of sin and death -- the deadly principle which ruled in him before, as alive in the flesh.<a name=164:20></a> It is there, no doubt; but he is set free from it.<a name=164:21></a> It has no dominion.<a name=164:22></a> There is another operative life and power, which has its own determined and unvarying characters, and which works in power; so that I am not under the dominion of sin.<a name=164:23></a> That is the side of God -- what I am before God in life.<a name=164:24></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=165>[Page 165]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes the evil nature, and why I am not condemned for it.<a name=165:1></a> The law could not work good nor righteousness in me because of it; it could not bring the question of flesh to an end before God; it could neither justify nor deliver me; could not clear me of the evil that is in it before God.<a name=165:2></a> Where sin in the flesh was, law could not hinder its acting, nor justify me while it was there; it could not operate the good it required.<a name=165:3></a> It only required the good, and provoked the sin.<a name=165:4></a> But "God, sending his own Son," sinless surely, but in form and fashion of one of these sinners in flesh, "in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin" (that is, as a sacrifice for sin) "condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=165:5></a>" The evil thing, so hateful, condemnable for God and for the new man, has been condemned when Christ was a sacrifice for sin.<a name=165:6></a> Death and condemnation of sin in the flesh went together, and I am dead to it; and its condemnation is past and settled when Christ was a sacrifice for sin.<a name=165:7></a> There is no allowance of it, which the new man even could not bear.<a name=165:8></a> A nature is not to be forgiven.<a name=165:9></a> But its condemnation was in that which removed all condemnation from me, and was at the same time death to it.<a name=165:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus there can be no condemnation for one in Christ.<a name=165:11></a> Not only are the sins blotted out, but the nature which produced them has been condemned, that is, sin in the flesh; and, as to my actual state, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of it.<a name=165:12></a> Thus the old man is condemned and dead, and the new man lives and walks, so that the claim of the law (its righteousness, the sum of what it requires) is fulfilled in us, because we are not under it, but under grace.<a name=165:13></a> The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free, and I walk not according to the flesh, which the law forbids, but according to the Spirit, against whose fruits there is no law; yea, through the power of the Spirit of God I walk after that which it leads me into -- the life of Christ in this world.<a name=165:14></a> And this walking after the Spirit gives its true character to the walk of the Christian in this world.<a name=165:15></a>

		As I have said, as Christ is contrasted with law for righteousness, the Spirit (Christ as life in the power of the Spirit) of God in us is contrasted with the righteous but powerless law for our walk and rule; deadness to sin, and life in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=166:1></a> This the apostle develops.<a name=166:2></a> In fact, commencing with the "no condemnation" to the end of verse 11 is the unfolding of the answer to "Who shall deliver?<a name=166:3></a>" On the words "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit," hangs a full description of both; of the Christian life as flowing from the Holy Ghost, and of the flesh.<a name=166:4></a> Each has its own objects according to its nature.<a name=166:5></a> There are things of the flesh and things of the Spirit -- not merely right and wrong, but objects which belong to each.<a name=166:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus there are two natures, with their respective objects, and with the new one the power of the Spirit of God, instead of one, the old one, and a law which fruitlessly forbade its desires as well as its acts.<a name=166:7></a> They that are after the flesh are governed by its principles: mind, will, have their object in the things which that nature craves after.<a name=166:8></a> They that follow the leadings of the Spirit are under His power in the things the Spirit brings to us, and sets the mind upon.<a name=166:9></a> Now the mind of the flesh is death; the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.<a name=166:10></a> That is, they are characterised respectively by these things as immediately and necessarily flowing from them, or accompanying them.<a name=166:11></a> For the mind of the flesh is enmity against God, resists His authority, rejects His will, rises up against Him and His authority, does not like it should exist, and consequently hates Him.<a name=166:12></a> It is not hence subject to the law, nor can be.<a name=166:13></a> Its lusts will not have what it claims, nor its self-will bow to the claim itself.<a name=166:14></a> God comes in by law, asserts authority, and forbids lust; but the flesh knows no obedience, loves its will and its lust, and hates God.<a name=166:15></a> Self-will cannot like subjection because it is self-will, nor lust what forbids lust.<a name=166:16></a> But God must come in thus with law to flesh.<a name=166:17></a> What is essential to flesh, it is essential to God to contradict, and it is enmity against Him.<a name=166:18></a> They that are in the flesh cannot then please Him.<a name=166:19></a> Those whose life is in the first Adam cannot please God.<a name=166:20></a> There the flesh leads and governs.<a name=166:21></a> Their place of standing is in Adam life.<a name=166:22></a> But this is not so if the Spirit of God dwell in us.<a name=166:23></a> This characterises, leads, forms the life of him in whom it dwells.<a name=166:24></a> God's Spirit, in living power, forms and characterises the state of the soul.<a name=166:25></a>

		We may now come to the second part of the chapter.<a name=169:1></a> It is preceded by two verses of practical consequence; verses 12, 13.<a name=169:2></a> "We are not debtors to the flesh.<a name=169:3></a>" It has no claim or title over us.<a name=169:4></a> It has done us all the evil it can, and only evil; and it has been condemned on the cross of Christ, and we are dead to it, having been crucified with Him.<a name=169:5></a> Living after it ends in death, but, mortifying the deeds of the body (the things which flow from its will if left to work), we shall live.<a name=169:6></a> But now the instruction goes farther, and shews us the relationship the Spirit brings us consciously into, and not merely the state as hitherto; "As many as are led by the Spirit of God these are the sons of God.<a name=169:7></a>" This flows directly from the whole position we are brought into, in contrast with that we were in under the law -- a position God has brought us into by grace, through redemption -- not the bondage and fear in which we were toward Him under the law; the fruit of divine grace in Christ -- not the effect of failure in responsibility in presence of a divine claim upon us.<a name=169:8></a> We are sons of God, and cry, "Abba, Father," having the consciousness of being sons by having the Spirit, which is in us a Spirit of adoption.<a name=169:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to remark, as so frequently occurring in this chapter, that "for" expresses in very many passages no direct inference on the part of the apostle, but introduces some statement confirmatory of the general principle which is in the apostle's mind.<a name=169:10></a> Thus, in verses 13, 14, there is no direct inference, though the connection be more immediate in verse 13.<a name=169:11></a> Verse 14 goes on to give the whole condition of him who has the Spirit, suggested by the mention of the Spirit exercised in moral power over the walk in verse 13.<a name=169:12></a> Such a mortifying of the deeds of the body is natural in the Christian, for such is their real state and character as having the Spirit.<a name=169:13></a> But it is in no way "Ye shall live, for," etc.<a name=169:14></a> But he has in all the chapter the man in Christ before his eye, shewing what is his character, and what qualities and privileges belong to him as such.<a name=169:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now to consider what is said concerning the Spirit as dwelling in us.<a name=169:16></a> We are sons, and by the Spirit cry, "Abba, Father," in the consciousness of being so.<a name=169:17></a> The Holy Ghost Himself (here we have Him definitely as a distinct Person) "beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.<a name=169:18></a>" It is a distinct definite testimony of the Spirit who dwells in us that we are such; not a proving by the word on examination of ourselves (a false and unscriptural and evil procedure), but the testimony of the Holy Ghost Himself dwelling in us, which He bears to us as so dwelling in us.<a name=169:19></a> We have the consciousness and estate of the mind of the Spirit in us; but He Himself, as dwelling in us, bears consciously also to us the witness that we are sons.<a name=169:20></a> We are in the conscious relationship, but He who is in us gives the confidence-producing testimony.<a name=169:21></a>

		But if we are children, we are heirs.<a name=170:1></a> We are heirs of God naturally as His children, and (as Christ is the great heir and firstborn) joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=170:2></a> But then the whole path and character of Christ as Man characterises us.<a name=170:3></a> His life and Spirit being in us, the spring of what we are, our mind must be in character and nature His.<a name=170:4></a> But He suffered here, and now is glorified as Man, ready to inherit all things.<a name=170:5></a> We too, then, must suffer with Him; not exactly for Him -- this is a special privilege -- but with Him.<a name=170:6></a> He could not (walking in holy love and grace, holy in all His ways, and heavenly) but suffer in the midst of a sinful world rejecting His love.<a name=170:7></a> His Spirit must have been ever grieved by sin, and the sorrow that was all around Him.<a name=170:8></a> So the saint in the measure in which he walks in the power of His Spirit, as he says in Timothy, "If we suffer with him, we shall reign with him.<a name=170:9></a>" It is a whole Christ: the same life has its natural consequences here and in heaven in the place of sons; a heavenly Man in this world, and in the heaven of God in holy glory.<a name=170:10></a> We are co-glorified, and co-sufferers.<a name=170:11></a> But the sufferings are not worthy to be compared with the glory.<a name=170:12></a> I apprehend "in us" is our whole state as well as our persons.<a name=170:13></a>

		Such is the general statement.<a name=171:1></a> And in this we get the first and fullest glimpse in Romans of the counsels of God.<a name=171:2></a> We shall find something of them as to the Jews in chapter 11, but in this the general result in the sphere of glory of the Son of man, though only briefly stated in connection with the subject of deliverance, which here applies to the whole creation.<a name=171:3></a> But this is the general statement of this truth.<a name=171:4></a>

		What follows is our personal connection with it as Christians.<a name=171:5></a> We know (we Christians, having the mind of Christ, know) that the world which flesh is trying to improve as its home is groaning and travailing in pain through the fall (though grace and deliverance and reconciliation are received by us).<a name=171:6></a> And this is not simply true of the creature around us: our body is part of this.<a name=171:7></a> We being creatures have to wait for the redemption of this -- the actual adoption and salvation.<a name=171:8></a> The redemption of the body and of the purchased possession, in a general sense, go together.<a name=171:9></a> The redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, we have; but the Spirit we have received in consequence is only the earnest of the other.<a name=171:10></a> It is in this sense we are saved in hope.<a name=171:11></a> What was in God's purpose to give us in salvation we have not yet (that is in glory with Christ); but the work is wrought which saves us, and we have it by the Holy Ghost.<a name=171:12></a> We stand (having received the Holy Ghost) between the accomplished work which saves us and entitles to the inheritance (and know it is accomplished, having, withal, been sealed for the day of redemption), and the exercise of power which shall bring the full redemption in when Jesus comes again.<a name=171:13></a> We, by the Spirit, look back to the accomplishment of the work, and understand its value; and by the same Spirit look forward to Christ's second coming to accomplish all and bring in the glory.<a name=171:14></a> Meanwhile we have these earthen vessels, our unredeemed bodies -- unredeemed as to power and deliverance; for the body also is the Lord's, bought with a price; and though we have the firstfruits of the Spirit (for the Spirit will again be poured out as the latter rain for millennial blessing), we suffer with Him who suffered here, connected with the glorious inheritance by the Spirit, and with the creation fallen in the first Adam by the body; and we groan (saved in hope) for the redemption of the body, and wait for that and the inheritance with patience -- for that which is not yet seen.<a name=171:15></a>

		We have seen that the Spirit bears witness with our spirit, that we are sons, and so heirs -- heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.<a name=172:1></a> For the inheritance we wait.<a name=172:2></a> But He takes part also in the infirmities in which we find ourselves, through our connection with the fallen inheritance through the body.<a name=172:3></a> But the part we take through the body in the sufferings of the fallen creation is not in the selfishness of a sufferer, but we become, by the Holy Ghost, the voice of all this sorrow according to God.<a name=172:4></a> There are cases, no doubt, where we know the will of God, and can (praying in the Holy Ghost) expect an answer according to our demand of God.<a name=172:5></a> But there is a mass of sorrow which we feel according to God by the Holy Ghost, for which we know not what to demand as we ought; but the sense of the evil pressing on the heart is wrought by the Holy Ghost, and, in our weakness through this poor body, the mind of the Spirit is there through the Spirit's working.<a name=172:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus He who searches the hearts, and scrutinises what is found there, finds, not our poor selfish feelings or complaints, but the mind of the Spirit -- what the Holy Ghost has produced in them; for the Holy Ghost Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<a name=172:7></a> He makes intercession for the saints according to God.<a name=172:8></a> Wonderful privilege in our sorrows and sufferings, that, when God searches the heart, He finds the mind formed by the Spirit there, the Spirit itself, as in us, making intercession for us according to God!<a name=172:9></a> It is a privilege to be in suffering thus, God by His Spirit taking part in it.<a name=172:10></a> As Christ personally felt all the sorrow perfectly through which He passed, so we through grace by the Spirit take our part in it (not according to selfishness, but) according to God, with the increased sense of our infirmity and weakness of our dependence and connection with a fallen creation from which we cannot escape down here, and feeling it so much the more as we see the glory, but given by the power of the Spirit to take part in it according to God -- to be its voice, so to speak, in grace felt by ourselves, though having part in it.<a name=172:11></a> It is the mind of the Spirit in it which God finds in us when He searches the hearts, and the Holy Ghost Himself is there making intercession for the saints according to God.<a name=172:12></a> It is wonderful grace: the heart of man is searched; the mind of the Spirit is there, because the Holy Ghost Himself is there interceding, but, though Himself, in groans which are in our hearts.<a name=172:13></a> But (for such is the force of it), though we do not know "what to pray for as we ought," we do "know that all things work together for good to them that love God.<a name=172:14></a>" God works of and from Himself in our favour -- and makes everything work together for our good.<a name=172:15></a> We know not what to look for.<a name=172:16></a> Perhaps in the present state of things there is no remedy, no direct setting aside or remedy for what makes us groan; but this is certain -- God makes all things work together for good to those who love Him.<a name=172:17></a> The sorrow may not be remedied, but the sorrow is blessed.<a name=172:18></a> We are called according to God's purpose, and God orders everything for our good.<a name=172:19></a>

		This evidently brings in God working for us (without us -- not in us); and this is the third part of the chapter.<a name=173:1></a> The work in us we have seen, in life by the Spirit, and the presence of the Spirit giving us the consciousness of being sons, heirs of God, joint-heirs with Christ, and helping us -- taking part in the scene of the infirmities and sorrow -- being come down from heaven to dwell in us while we are in the midst of and, as to our bodies, connected with, the fallen creation, subject to corruption through the first Adam.<a name=173:2></a> The will is right; power is there by the Spirit for the inner man, and hope of the glory to come; and that just makes us feel the infirmity and sorrow, but felt through the Holy Ghost according to God.<a name=173:3></a> It is a blessed place, and shews how true and complete is the deliverance from the power and evil of the flesh; for in that, in which by the body we are connected with the fallen creation, the will is not -- "not willingly," though we be still subject to the effect as sorrow.<a name=173:4></a> As for the will of the flesh, it is dead and condemned; but, on the contrary, He who searches the hearts finds the mind of the Spirit -- a divine sense of the evil, and sorrow through it; the Holy Ghost interceding for us, in that which is beyond the measure of human thought, but God entering, as in our hearts, into the sorrow.<a name=173:5></a> It is a wonderful deliverance in, though not yet out of, the sorrow.<a name=173:6></a>

		Here we may remark the epistle goes wholly beyond and out of its general subject -- the responsibility of man and his failure, and the way that it is met by the death of Christ.<a name=174:1></a> But the delight of divine wisdom was in the sons of men before the world was.<a name=174:2></a> Hence the Son became a man that His redeemed ones might be conformed to Him in glory.<a name=174:3></a> Meanwhile the first Adam was set in responsibility, and this had to be met, and was met in the cross, but therein a righteous ground laid also for the accomplishing the counsels of God, which consequently was then revealed.<a name=174:4></a> See Titus 1: 2, 3; 2 Timothy 1: 9; Romans 16: 25, 26.<a name=174:5></a> Compare Ephesians 3 and Colossians 1.<a name=174:6></a> In the Romans, however, the instruction does not go beyond the individual, even in speaking of the purpose of God.<a name=174:7></a> We are predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son, that He may be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=174:8></a> This surely is clearly sovereign grace.<a name=174:9></a> To set poor worms, and dying worms, in the same glory as the Son of the Father has nothing to do with responsibility, or meeting it; although the act by which our failure in it was met did lay the ground for it, in that Man perfectly glorified God; and hence Man is set in God's glory.<a name=174:10></a> Our sins and our sin were met on the cross, as we have seen.<a name=174:11></a> But besides that God was glorified; and man, exalted to His right hand, entered into the glory as our forerunner.<a name=174:12></a> For, besides His personal and eternal title, it is because of what He did for us that Christ is entered into the glory.<a name=174:13></a> Here then we pass beyond responsibility and get on purpose: only that in this epistle we do not go farther than the individual place.<a name=174:14></a> We are to be conformed to the image of God's Son.<a name=174:15></a> And so scripture constantly testifies.<a name=174:16></a> "We have borne the image of the earthy," says 1 Corinthians 15, and "we shall bear the image of the heavenly Adam.<a name=174:17></a>" "When he shall appear, we shall be like him," says the apostle John; 1 John 3.<a name=174:18></a> "He will change our body of humiliation, and fashion it like his glorious body," says our apostle; Philippians 3.<a name=174:19></a> Such as to this point is the wondrous counsel of God.<a name=174:20></a> For how, as to state, could we conceive anything more glorious, more blessed, than to be conformed to the image of God's Son; to see Him as He is, and be like Him?<a name=174:21></a>

		The Spirit then blessedly states the security of those whom God has predestinated to be so conformed, stating the steps by which they are brought to the great result, only omitting wholly the work in us, which had been fully stated previously, because He is speaking of that which God is for us in His own purpose as its source (and securing that purpose in grace up to its accomplishment), and not of man's responsibility and the necessary requirement of God's nature and righteousness.<a name=175:1></a> These have been discussed in the previous part, both as to guilt and righteousness, and as to nature and state, so as to render it possible to have to say to the holy God.<a name=175:2></a> Grace has wrought that, but has wrought what was needed that we might be reconciled to God.<a name=175:3></a> Here (as already stated), alone in Romans, he touches on purpose and counsels.<a name=175:4></a> So in Ephesians 1: 4.<a name=175:5></a> There it is so according to the purpose of His own will.<a name=175:6></a> Men must be holy and in love to be before Him; but making us sons is according to the purpose of His own will.<a name=175:7></a> He might have made us something lower -- could not, indeed, if we think of Him.<a name=175:8></a> It was part of His perfection to think and purpose thus.<a name=175:9></a> But we can think as a fact of a lower place.<a name=175:10></a> But His counsel was to make us sons, "that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us by Christ Jesus.<a name=175:11></a>" Part of His glory -- of what angels learn -- would have been lost else; part of the glorious offering of the atonement.<a name=175:12></a> This could not be.<a name=175:13></a> Well, He called them, justified them, and brought all to perfection in His plan -- He glorified them.<a name=175:14></a> It is not as yet in historical accomplishment, but all one unbroken chain with God.<a name=175:15></a>

		We have then the great and blessed truth derived from it all -- God is "for us": if so, "who shall be against us?<a name=175:16></a>" It is the great central truth of grace: God is for us.<a name=175:17></a> He is for us, in giving, in justifying, and in securing that in all difficulties nothing shall separate us from His love.<a name=175:18></a> And first, in giving, "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us": with Him given, we can reckon on receiving everything else.<a name=175:19></a> No gift like this: how should He then not give everything else?<a name=175:20></a> Again, it is God Himself who justifies.<a name=175:21></a> It is not here justified before Him, but He justifies us Himself -- little matter who condemns us then.<a name=175:22></a> God is for us in this also.<a name=175:23></a> Compare Zechariah 3.<a name=175:24></a>

		Here alone in this epistle, to bring in His intercession, the ascension is spoken of: "It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.<a name=176:8></a>" He has gone down to the depth for us in sorrow and the ruin of man, and risen in power and victory over it now as the exalted Man; He is interested in us, intercedes for us, finding needed help and mercy: what then shall separate us from His love?<a name=176:9></a> Here it is the love of Christ, that we may know Him and His love, as Man gone down to depth, and gone up on high as Man, still interested in and caring for us.<a name=176:10></a> In verse 39 it is the love of God in Christ, that we may know the love to be divine, supreme, and immutable, above everything that might separate in us -- stronger than everything which, without us, might seek to separate us from this love.<a name=176:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This closes the doctrine of the epistle, carrying us on personally to glory, according to God's counsels, but not beyond our personal place according to those counsels; and surely it is high and blessed enough.<a name=176:12></a> Otherwise the epistle goes no farther than the responsibility of man, of which the law is the perfect rule, and where even redemption and the Spirit (our being dead to sin, and alive through Christ to God) have set us free; it is still "the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us who walk after the Spirit.<a name=176:13></a>" It is being thus dead and alive in Christ which is the way of deliverance.<a name=176:14></a> But no one can read chapter 6: 14, and chapter 7, without seeing that the great object of the apostle is to shew that being taken wholly from under the law and put under Christ -- being delivered from the law -- is the way of godliness as well as of peace; that the law, which gave no new life and left sin its power -- left us therefore under its power, is contrasted with our having died, for faith, to sin, and with being alive through Christ and the power of the Spirit.<a name=176:15></a> That is, obligation, sin, and no new life, which is our state under law, is contrasted with life and the Spirit (having died to sin), giving us power and liberty, though the flesh remains just the same when the mind is renewed, and man is viewed as living still in this earth, only in the life of Christ, and dead to sin.<a name=176:16></a>

		But in one case we, even if renewed, are still under the power of, and slaves to, sin; in the other, we are set free to live to God.<a name=177:1></a> Law is bondage to sin; our new place is life and liberty, sin in the flesh being condemned in the cross.<a name=177:2></a> The natures are the same; but to be bound by the evil one and unable to deliver ourselves is a different thing from being set free by power and able to keep it under.<a name=177:3></a> But this we have through the very fact that this epistle confines itself to the responsibility of man and the way God has met it in grace, man's justification and deliverance, with only just a slight mention of counsels at the end to bring in his security.<a name=177:4></a>

		Thus the whole ground of his personal standing as so justified (God's salvation), is with wonderful fulness completely set forth, searched into, and grounded on God's work of grace, from the utter sinfulness of man alienated from God to the perfect security of the called one, so that nothing can separate him from God's love.<a name=177:5></a> This is of unspeakable value.<a name=177:6></a> Sin is fully stated, searched out; the law, as condemning and convicting of sin, forgiveness, justification, deliverance from the power of sin, all gone into; every question examined relating to how a man can be just with God; divine judgment, and human experience, fully ventilated; and divine righteousness, through grace, effectually established as the ground on which the believer stands, and which he will never be off.<a name=177:7></a> It does not go far on into counsels and privileges connected with the establishment of Christ's glory as Head; but our standing is most completely revealed and gone into, in the Holy Ghost's reasoning, by the word of God.<a name=177:8></a>

		The three following chapters are a special appendix, for the purpose of reconciling the doctrine that there is no difference between Jew and Gentile with the faithfulness of God to the promises made to the Jew, or Israel.<a name=177:9></a> The Jew might say, "I have nothing to answer to your plea against me by the law.<a name=177:10></a> I did break it, and hence must give up my claim under it to be a favoured people.<a name=177:11></a> But there were promises even before the law, and not with a legal condition.<a name=177:12></a> How do you set these aside, so as to make no difference between Jew and Gentile?<a name=177:13></a>" This had a colour of reason, and the Spirit of God, jealous of God's faithfulness, and of the sureness of the promise made to His people, now fully clears up this point, shewing, and that triumphantly, how Israel had forfeited it altogether, and yet that God, faithful to Himself, would accomplish these promises all the same; only that thus, in His divine wisdom, the Jew would have to come in as a mere sinner, entitled to nothing, just as a Gentile would.<a name=177:14></a>

		This sovereignty (verse 24) God would use in favour of Gentiles as of Jews.<a name=179:1></a> But the apostle treats some other points and objections before arriving there.<a name=179:2></a> Verse 14, we have the common objection suggested, there is unrighteousness with God.<a name=179:3></a> The apostle then quotes Moses in reply, affirming that sovereignty, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.<a name=179:4></a>" This was sovereign, but it was sovereign mercy.<a name=179:5></a> And when we examine this and the following case, in both we find the wickedness there.<a name=179:6></a> For sovereignty in mercy and compassion supposes the evil, and pardoning was not as to good.<a name=179:7></a> But when we examine the case, this will appear more strongly still.<a name=179:8></a> When the passage quoted from Moses was spoken, Israel had made the golden calf, and God had threatened all with excision, and on Moses's intercession retreats into His own sovereignty to spare any.<a name=179:9></a> Had He not been sovereign, had He acted in righteousness, all (save Moses and Joshua) would have been cut off.<a name=179:10></a> But He was sovereign, and could use mercy, and He did.<a name=179:11></a> The apostle draws the general conclusion.<a name=179:12></a> It is not willing or running on man's side, but God that shews mercy.<a name=179:13></a> No righteousness was attained by man's willing or running, but by God shewing mercy when man was unrighteous.<a name=179:14></a>

		But this must be more fully developed.<a name=181:1></a> For we have now, not the sovereignty of God letting in the Gentile and sparing a remnant of Jews through mercy, but Israel's rejection, as to the mass, as a nation, and the question whether it was final.<a name=181:2></a> The desire of the apostle's heart was for the salvation of Israel.<a name=181:3></a> He testifies of their zeal towards God, only it was not according to knowledge; and this last statement he now develops to explain their casting away.<a name=181:4></a> The next chapter treats the question whether it is final or not.<a name=181:5></a> They were ignorant of God's righteousness (his great theme in the epistle), and, setting about to establish their own under the law, had not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.<a name=181:6></a> That was Christ, and Christ was the end of the law -- closed it wholly for righteousness to every one that believed.<a name=181:7></a> The schoolmaster went on in his office up to faith for those who had been put under his care till the time appointed of the Father, and so practically and usefully too for many a soul (for most Christians are under law).<a name=181:8></a> Then came the Son, and the whole economy and dispensation of the law closed.<a name=181:9></a> So it was in dispensation -- they could not have two husbands at once; and so it is in conscience, for such is the mind and truth of God.<a name=181:10></a> It is another ground and way of righteousness.<a name=181:11></a> One is by our doing; the other God's righteousness -- ours by faith in Christ who has perfectly glorified Him.<a name=181:12></a> Christ closes the claims of God against us by law, which is condemnation and death; and He is Himself our righteousness who believe through grace.<a name=181:13></a>

		But here the special point is, He is the end of law.<a name=182:1></a> It is done with for righteousness: Christ takes its place.<a name=182:2></a> The law knows nothing but the person who is under it fulfilling it.<a name=182:3></a> It says, he that doeth these things shall live in them; and this is most righteous.<a name=182:4></a> The righteousness which is by faith speaks wholly differently.<a name=182:5></a> It is, "If thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved"; for the real question is the salvation of the sinner, not the keeping of law to live.<a name=182:6></a> The allusion is to Deuteronomy 30, where the question of responsibility was closed as to keeping the law; and, the people being in captivity for their sins, the keeping of it to live was wholly over, they being cast out for not doing so.<a name=182:7></a>

		The apostle introduces Christ as the hope then, as indeed He was to the Jew: only through Him could the law be written in the heart according to the new covenant, even in Jewish hopes; and then he turns to the proof of Christ being the one whom Israel was thus taught to look to; but then it let in the believing Gentile: "Whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed.<a name=182:8></a>" Wherever the word was in the heart and in the mouth, that is, the word of faith preached; for law was over, and faith was not law -- it was another way of righteousness.<a name=182:9></a> Law spoke one way, faith another.<a name=182:10></a> We have then, on the statement of the principle which let in the Gentile, the no-difference doctrine coming out beautifully in contrast with the first use of it.<a name=182:11></a> First, we had, "there is no difference: for all have sinned"; here, "no difference, for the same Lord is rich unto all that call on him.<a name=182:12></a>" "For whosoever [how the apostle glories in these "whosoevers"!<a name=182:13></a>] shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved" -- consequently a Gentile who did.<a name=182:14></a>

		Was the rejection then of Israel final?<a name=183:20></a> Surely not.<a name=183:21></a> The apostle then gives three proofs that it was not final rejection: a remnant was owned now; the reception of the Gentiles, to provoke the Jews to jealousy, not therefore to reject them; and, finally, the testimony that the Redeemer would yet come to Zion and turn away ungodliness from Jacob, and so Israel be saved as a whole -- "all Israel" -- not merely the Jew, nor yet as a remnant.<a name=183:22></a> With this the like responsibility of the Gentile is revealed.<a name=183:23></a> First, then (as himself of Israel according to the flesh, and blessed), he declares God has not cast away Israel; but as in the days of Elijah, when he even pleaded against them as wholly adversaries to God and His prophet, a remnant according to the election by grace had been preserved, so now, of which he, Paul, was a proof.<a name=183:24></a> But "if by grace, not by works, otherwise grace was no more grace.<a name=183:25></a>" Israel had not obtained what they sought amiss, but the election had obtained it, and the rest were blinded.<a name=183:26></a> And so it was written, as Moses testifies (Deuteronomy 29: 4), and David, in spirit, in judgment on their rejection of Christ (Psalm 69: 22, 23) -- from the close of their history in the wilderness dealt with in patience till Messiah was rejected; and they now stumbled at the stumbling-stone and were blinded.<a name=183:27></a> But was it that they might fall?<a name=183:28></a> Was this God's purpose about them?<a name=183:29></a> Nay, but their fall was the occasion of salvation to the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy.<a name=183:30></a>

		The practical exhortation takes the ground of the whole doctrine of the epistle, with which indeed the last special part as to the Jews closes withal -- mercy on all, Jew or Gentile.<a name=187:8></a> There was no other ground of hope, and this mercy had been fully developed in the doctrinal part.<a name=187:9></a> The first general principle refers directly to the doctrine of chapter 6.<a name=187:10></a> We have seen that the first part, closing at chapter 5: 11, gives neither experience nor practice.<a name=187:11></a> It is just the full mercies of God in redemption.<a name=187:12></a> Then, set free, and in the new power of the Spirit of life, we present the body having no will (an instrument I dispose of), a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is my intelligent service.<a name=187:13></a> I am not innocent, I am not under the dominion of sin, and I have the privilege in the free power of life to give up my body as a sacrifice wholly to God, but in living service.<a name=187:14></a> It is consecrated to Him, set apart, and acceptable.<a name=187:15></a> The intelligent soul knows what it is doing in this.<a name=187:16></a> It is not a blind ceremony, done according to rule, nor a legal obligation, a yoke "neither we nor our fathers were able to bear"; but the free service of a willing mind, offering with intelligence all its powers to God, and in particular that body which (if it governed us -- had a will of its own) would be the seat and power of sin bringing us into captivity, but is now a living sacrifice to God, and an acceptable one.<a name=187:17></a>

		This answers perfectly to the practical point of the epistle, while in Ephesians the Christian is seen as having been dead in sins, and a new creation as directly coming from God.<a name=188:1></a> Hence the Christian walk is seen as following God in love, and being light in the Lord.<a name=188:2></a> The epistle to the Romans does not reach that ground.<a name=188:3></a> It has seen the body as the practical seat of sin, and as such called flesh, and brought in death.<a name=188:4></a> We are to reckon ourselves dead; but then (being alive to God in Christ, free from the law of sin and death, through the power of grace) we can yield ourselves to God as those that are alive from the dead -- present our bodies a living sacrifice to God.<a name=188:5></a> It is the purpose and divinely wrought will, the intelligent service of the free Christian, who has to view his dealing with the body as a sacrifice to God though a living one.<a name=188:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is that, the world around us being all astray from God, an immense system built up by the enemy, we cannot as Christians be conformed to it; only it is not a mere outward discordance, but a difference flowing from an inward renewing of the mind.<a name=188:7></a> Hence it goes much farther, having its positive side.<a name=188:8></a> The Christian seeks through this world the path of God's will -- that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.<a name=188:9></a> Not acceptable to us, as sometimes said, but in itself, acceptable to God Himself, that is, in its very nature acceptable to every one that judged rightly.<a name=188:10></a> This is a great privilege, to have a will of God in a world departed from Him.<a name=188:11></a> Christ has marked it and revealed it, in walking with divine perfectness as Man in a way of which His walk was the perfection and the pattern.<a name=188:12></a> It was not mutual righteousness, for all were against Him, and went their own way; it was not, I need not say, wrong.<a name=188:13></a> It was a heavenly way on the earth, a life of perfect obedience; but a life of grace on the earth -- God manifest in the flesh.<a name=188:14></a> There needed no way in paradise, but to remain where and what man was.<a name=188:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where the whole system was departure from God, when man had left Him, there was no right way in it, none but to return to God; but back again -- this was impossible.<a name=188:16></a> Innocence was over, never to be recovered; the tree of life was lost.<a name=188:17></a> The Son of God could bring down heavenly motives on earth, and live a life of grace and separation from all evil in the midst of all the evil in the world, holy and obedient, displaying a new and divine character on the earth, heavenly in its nature, yet adapted in grace to man, such as He was on the earth.<a name=188:18></a> This way we have to learn, to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God -- that will Christ came to do, and in which He has walked in the midst of evil; a way not only right, but of obedience; God fully restored to His place, and man to his as a perfect one, of grace (that is, above the evil, but suited in goodness to those in it) not only to seek and save, but in our own demeanour so as to represent God.<a name=188:19></a> Here, however, it is represented in its character of God's will.<a name=188:20></a> It is the obedience of one who has yielded himself to God, and now seeks what His will is, knowing it is perfect, and delighting in it, in itself, and as obedience.<a name=188:21></a>

		This self-sacrificing subjection to the will of God hinders our setting up self, and that by its very nature; and the mind takes quietly its place where God has set it.<a name=189:1></a> This it does with more firmness, because one does it as serving God.<a name=189:2></a> He quietly serves there, where God has set him, and made it a duty.<a name=189:3></a> What he does in faith, he does with God in service.<a name=189:4></a> And each takes his place in the one body as God has set him, confines himself to its own service, and waits upon it -- one body in Christ, and all members one of another.<a name=189:5></a> Here alone we find the body in the epistle.<a name=189:6></a> Christian position is assumed in various respects.<a name=189:7></a> We are in Christ, we are members of His body; the developed doctrine of the epistle enters into none of this.<a name=189:8></a> The point of exhortation is not going beyond the gift given by grace, but serving in it.<a name=189:9></a>

		But the apostle passes on to more general service, as giving, unfeigned love, and then many other points in Christian life.<a name=189:10></a> But all this part of his exhortation refers to personal qualities or characters, and state -- the spirit in which we are to walk.<a name=189:11></a> If a man give, it should be with freedom of heart; his love is to be unfeigned, abhorring evil and cleaving to good, kindly affections, brotherly love, and putting others before oneself.<a name=189:12></a> Grace and generosity of heart should in general characterise the Christian; sympathy with others; not heeding the fashion of the world or high things, but associating<a href="#189:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> with those of low estate (it is not "condescending"); walking so as to have things irreproachable before men, and, as far it depends on oneself, walking in peace with all; in nothing overcome of evil, but overcoming evil with good -- a noble, indeed divine, principle.<a name=189:13></a> I am myself by grace in spite of the evil of others, I do not avenge self, I am above the evil of others, as God is, in principle doing good to those who hate us.<a name=189:14></a> All this is personally characteristic -- the spirit in which we walk.<a name=189:15></a>

		Chapter 13 turns to relative duties, with the addition of the Lord's near coming.<a name=190:1></a> Two principles are presented thus in the chapter: duty, to which he exhorts as the principle of love with which they were imbued in Christ; and that the night was far spent, the day at hand.<a name=190:2></a> First, he exhorts to subjection to the civil authority.<a name=190:3></a> These are God's ordinances: the powers that exist are ordained of Him -- a precious direction, sparing us all question of who has the right, and political partisanship.<a name=190:4></a> "The powers that be"!<a name=190:5></a> that is all I have to concern myself about.<a name=190:6></a> There is no power but of God.<a name=190:7></a> Where power therefore is, it must be of God; and I own Him in it.<a name=190:8></a> Wherever power is established, the Christian obeys.<a name=190:9></a> Resisting it is resisting God's ordinance.<a name=190:10></a> They are God's ministers to maintain order.<a name=190:11></a> On the same principle we pay tribute.<a name=190:12></a> From this the apostle passes to every one's due, tribute, custom, honour.<a name=190:13></a> The Christian pays it, owing no man anything, save one debt that always remains; and this it is which fulfils the law, for love to our neighbour will work him no ill.<a name=190:14></a> The principle of love makes good the requirements of law, which the law itself could never make good.<a name=190:15></a> This is the first great principle.<a name=190:16></a>

		Then the thought of the Lord's coming is used to enforce all: "It is high time to awake out of sleep; for our salvation is nearer than when we believed.<a name=190:17></a>" The night of this world is the absence of the Sun of Righteousness.<a name=190:18></a> Let us clearly conceive this.<a name=190:19></a> In the busy and pleasure-seeking course of this world, for him who has understanding, and to whom Christ is known, it is still night; the gloom of night is over it, but the day has dawned to his faith, the Morning Star is arisen in his heart, but the world is asleep in the still-continuing darkness of night.<a name=190:20></a> For us indeed the night is far spent, but the world is asleep in the night.<a name=190:21></a> The waking soul sees in the horizon the Morning Star, the dawn along its edge, and waits for day.<a name=190:22></a> The heart is in the day, and walks as in the day.<a name=190:23></a> As Christians, we have done with works of darkness.<a name=190:24></a> In conflict we are still; but our armour against evil, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, is the light in which we walk.<a name=190:25></a> The power of light, and truth, and godliness, and judgment of evil, which belongs to that day, is in our heart, and the weapons and snares of darkness are foiled and detected, getting no entrance into, no hold on, the soul.<a name=190:26></a> We walk honestly as in the day, we put on in our ways and heart the walk and character of Him who is the true light of it, the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=190:27></a> Having the hope of being like Him there, we purify ourselves as He is pure, we walk as He walked.<a name=190:28></a> We do not provide for the lusts of the nature which belongs to the darkness to satisfy it, but walk as Christ walked.<a name=190:29></a> Such is the Christian in view of Christ's coming and bringing on this dark and benighted world the light and day of God, in His effectual power; and such are the two springs and characters of Christian conduct; recognition of, acting up to, every relative duty in love; and knowing the time, the near approach of day to which he belongs.<a name=190:30></a> Compare 1 Thessalonians 5.<a name=190:31></a> "The night is far spent, the day is at hand.<a name=190:32></a>"

		The apostle now in chapter 14, turns to special cases of the spirit in which Christians should walk in their relationships with one another.<a name=191:1></a> There were those weak in faith, not living fully in the light and power of the new creation as dead with Christ to the rudiments of the world.<a name=191:2></a> It was weakness of faith, but Christ was loved; they were the purchase of Christ's precious blood.<a name=191:3></a> Christ had died for them.<a name=191:4></a> They were to walk in grace, receiving the weak, but not to doubtful questions which might bewilder his faith.<a name=191:5></a> And as to that, wherever he was weak (meats, days, etc.<a name=191:6></a>), as a Jew might well be, though it be weakness, the weak should not judge the strong as doing evil because his conscience did not allow him to do it, nor the strong despise the weak because he had scruples which a fuller faith would have delivered him from.<a name=191:7></a> It was judging another's servant.<a name=191:8></a> He stood or fell to his own master, and God was able to make him stand fast, weak as he was.<a name=191:9></a> That every one was to be fully persuaded in his own mind, not act on another's faith To Him they must look as the Lord to whom they were responsible, as Him to whom they had to live.<a name=191:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, as ever, then breaks out as to that which belonged to Christ in this respect.<a name=191:11></a> Christ was Lord of dead and living; to this end He died and rose again.<a name=191:12></a> Finally, He alone was judge.<a name=191:13></a> It was to God every one would give account of himself.<a name=191:14></a> All would be before Christ's judgment-seat; every knee bow to Him; "every one of us give an account of himself to God.<a name=191:15></a>" This, rather, the Christian should judge, not to put a stumbling-block in his brother's way.<a name=191:16></a> It is uncharitable to destroy, as far as the bearing of our act goes in leading him to violate his conscience, or drive him back from Christ, as if Christ made lawless the one for whom He died.<a name=191:17></a> He that serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God, and approved of the sound judgment of men.<a name=191:18></a> We are to follow what makes for peace, and edifies others.<a name=191:19></a> "To the pure all things are pure"; no meats are defiled meats, if the heart is pure; but if a person defiles his conscience, even through an unfounded scruple to him, it is unclean.<a name=191:20></a> Happy for him who, in boasting of his liberty by faith, does not go beyond his faith in what he does -- does not offend in what he allows himself to do; for whatsoever is not of faith (done with God as that which is allowed with Him) is sin.<a name=191:21></a> If a man thought he ought to honour such a day, or abstain from such and such food, and, to shew his liberty, does not, to him it is sin.<a name=191:22></a> It is not of faith with God.<a name=191:23></a> If a man has faith as to these things, it were better to keep it to himself before God than stumble his brother by acting on it where it does so.<a name=191:24></a>

		The first seven verses of chapter 15 are a summing up of the same point, and belong to chapter 14.<a name=192:1></a> The strong are to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please themselves.<a name=192:2></a> So acted Christ.<a name=192:3></a> He did not seek to please Himself, bearing in meekness the reproaches that fell on Him, and walking so faithfully, so perfectly with God that, when men were disposed to reproach God, the reproach fell on Christ; so perfectly did He present God in His ways -- the image of the invisible God.<a name=192:4></a> Christ served others (such should be our path), He did not please Himself; His life, on the contrary, was a life of reproach which He bore, but it was the reproach of God He bore.<a name=192:5></a> The quotation of this passage gives occasion to the apostle to justify his use of it by a principle of the utmost importance, that what was written aforetime was written for our instruction; that walking in patience, perhaps in reproach here, the comfort of the scripture might be ours, that we might know that God's mind was in it, our reproach His reproach, because as serving Him we had our part with Him, and hence have hope and bright confidence of soul in any and every trial in the whole path of faith.<a name=192:6></a> For all these things brought the apostle and the right-minded saint into the patience of the gospel; and this is the path of love, serving others, and for Christ's sake.<a name=192:7></a> But God is the God of patience (of patience, how great with us all!<a name=192:8></a>) and, blessed be His name, of comfort too.<a name=192:9></a> What a name to give to God, perpetually bearing with us, with our stupid, ignorant, and often inconsistent hearts, and occupying Himself with all our little trials to comfort us!<a name=192:10></a> He consoles those who are cast down, never withdraws His eyes from the righteous, is patient where we are impatient even with Him, and comforts us in grace.<a name=192:11></a> So have we to walk, like-minded one toward another, and receiving one another as Christ received us -- weak in faith, that we might be to the glory of God.<a name=192:12></a> This closes the exhortations of the epistle.<a name=192:13></a>

		The apostle then judges those who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine they had learned: activity of mind, seeking personal self-importance, working mischief to themselves and others.<a name=197:1></a> Such activity separates the heart from God, with whom subjection of spirit is always wrought in us, a confiding learning in the secret consciousness that all is received from God.<a name=197:2></a> We see this spirit so sweetly in John the Baptist; and so wherever the Spirit of God works.<a name=197:3></a> Its coming from God brings not only knowledge but the love of God into it.<a name=197:4></a> It is no charity to sanction such workings of the human heart.<a name=197:5></a> We are to avoid them.<a name=197:6></a> And faithfulness in this, in ever such a weak one, brings a testimony from God with it which has power -- more power than the pretension of man -- and works by the Spirit to preserve the saints wherever the Spirit of God rules in the heart, wherever the soul is subject to God.<a name=197:7></a> The rest are made manifest.<a name=197:8></a> The hearts of the simple are preserved: the mischievous though fair speeches are judged for them.<a name=197:9></a>

		The apostle closes with ascription of praise to the only wise God; but, in doing so, and owning Him as He who is able to establish them according to His gospel, he recalls the character of the testimony contained in that gospel -- that of which he speaks in so many places in so remarkable a manner.<a name=199:1></a> In this epistle he has not developed this mystery; his object was to shew how a soul stood in liberty before God; and that is individual, and must be so.<a name=199:2></a> Conscience and justification are always necessarily individual.<a name=199:3></a> Still he supposes the Christian estate (as in Romans 8: 1) that we are in Christ, and (chapter 12) that we are one body in Christ; as here the full scope of the counsels of God in the mystery hidden from ages.<a name=199:4></a> None of them is unfolded in the epistle; but his preaching of Jesus Christ was according to the revelation of the mystery, which set Christ at the head of all things; and not only so but brought Jews and Gentiles as one body, with all distinction lost, into union with Him in heaven as Head -- a truth which left the system of the law entirely aside, though confirming its authority in its own place.<a name=199:5></a> This had been kept secret since the world began, but was in the counsels of God before the world was (compare 2 Timothy 1: 9; Titus 1: 2; Ephesians 1 and 3; Colossians 1), and was revealed now that the foundation for the heavenly and eternal blessing was laid in Christ's work.<a name=199:6></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first epistle to the Corinthians consists of details more than of great truths, and therefore not so much has been written on it.<a name=200:1></a> Sosthenes is associated with Paul, as having laboured there, where he had also been chief ruler of the synagogue; Acts 18.<a name=200:2></a> The association of others does not hinder the sole authorship of Paul.<a name=200:3></a> So, in addressing the Galatians, he speaks of "all the brethren which are with me," because he was shewing that the whole church of God was against them.<a name=200:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 2 brings to view the roots of the main question of the church of God, two classes of persons being taken up there.<a name=200:5></a> This gives importance to the epistle.<a name=200:6></a> "Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.<a name=200:7></a>" Those that call on the name of the Lord Jesus are professors, assumed to be faithful till they went or were put out, not necessarily the body of Christ but the house of God.<a name=200:8></a> The assembly in Corinth, as elsewhere, is recognised as representing the church there.<a name=200:9></a> They were not born like the nation of Israel, but saints by call; sanctified in Christ Jesus, not after an external sort merely.<a name=200:10></a> The universality of the application is carefully maintained, its divine claim over all Christians everywhere.<a name=200:11></a> The direct address is to the Corinthian assembly, but the apostle takes in all the Christian profession elsewhere.<a name=200:12></a> He addressed them as saints, and I have no doubt that he considered them truthful, unless they were proved hypocrites.<a name=200:13></a> But calling is professional simply; just as John says that whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him; but of hypocrites this would not be true.<a name=200:14></a> Though there might be hypocrites there, they would be characterised as of the church of God at Corinth.<a name=200:15></a> It is not what my judgment of individuals may be, but the statement of what their character is in such a place.<a name=200:16></a> There may be, and there was, an assembly of God in Corinth; and the apostle treats them as sanctified in Christ Jesus; then the rest as calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is a different thing from sanctified in Christ Jesus.<a name=200:17></a> Though a man who calls on the name of the Lord, unless he be a hypocrite, is sanctified, yet the calling on the name of the Lord does not give him title as such to be styled "sanctified in Christ Jesus.<a name=200:18></a>"

		The epistle is addressed to the church of God with all that call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; that is, generally, till chapter 10, to the house of God; after that, to the body specifically.<a name=201:1></a> There is a different state of things now.<a name=201:2></a> If men take the name of the Lord, they are bound by all that is written to such; but it does not follow that Paul would have written such a letter to them now, nor do I believe he would.<a name=201:3></a> He gives meat in due season.<a name=201:4></a> He would have to do with what is practically fallen away from the truth, and he would not deal with this as with a body of persons like those gathered in Corinth.<a name=201:5></a> As yet we have not the fact that false brethren had crept in.<a name=201:6></a> "Sanctified in Christ Jesus" is not the same thing as "sanctified by blood" in Hebrews, but quite different ideas; the latter not necessarily rising beyond external consecration, though, where faith is, it consecrates to God.<a name=201:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians 4 the distinction re-appears more definitely, which we have seen in 1 Corinthians already.<a name=201:8></a> First, "one body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling"; next, "one Lord, one faith, one baptism," the wider circle of profession; and then the largest of all, "one God and Father of all," etc.<a name=201:9></a>, returning to the intimacy of His children "who is in you [or 'us'] all.<a name=201:10></a>" So the apostle, in Acts 17, quotes a Greek poet, "for we are also his offspring.<a name=201:11></a>" Compare also Ephesians 3: 15, "Every family"; and Adam was thus called son of God.<a name=201:12></a> It is not, of course, the spiritual bearing of the name; it is used as here naturally.<a name=201:13></a> At the time when the epistle was written, all that bore the Lord's name were looked at as true believers, unless proved to the contrary.<a name=201:14></a> It is wholly different now; and Paul would not have written to them as to the Corinthians, though professors are now bound by what he then wrote, because they make the profession.<a name=201:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find another thing in the epistle: that the consequence of the association in verse 2 is, that the local church has taken the standing of the whole body.<a name=201:16></a> It will come out more in chapter 12; but in associating all professors of Christianity with the church at Corinth, he deals with them as they stand, upon the ground of the body of Christ, though only a local assembly.<a name=201:17></a>

		It is striking to see how the apostle, after the salutation in verse 3, takes up all that he saw to be good, as a testimony to their reality, before he begins to deal with the evil (verse 4-9).<a name=202:1></a> "Ye come behind in no gift.<a name=202:2></a>" There was gift, but very little grace.<a name=202:3></a> "The testimony of Christ was confirmed in you"; "In everything ye are enriched by him in all utterance, and in all knowledge.<a name=202:4></a>" They had the truth and power to communicate it.<a name=202:5></a> They were waiting also for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; not exactly His "coming," nor more (I think) than that He is hidden as yet.<a name=202:6></a> There is nothing about the rapture here, nor the judgment.<a name=202:7></a> In Hebrews 10: 26 it is the stronger word, meaning <i>complete knowledge</i>, or, as often elsewhere, recognition.<a name=202:8></a> Peter, in his second epistle (chapter 1: 5-8), uses the two words.<a name=202:9></a> A speculative mind might learn all ever so accurately, without faith or renewal.<a name=202:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony is said to be "of Christ" here, "of God" in chapter 2: 1; because it is, not another testimony, but another way of looking at the same.<a name=202:11></a> Here it is personal to Christ.<a name=202:12></a> Christ's testimony confirmed in you is the testimony of God brought to you.<a name=202:13></a> You give a different name to a thing from the different feeling you have about it.<a name=202:14></a> In chapter 2: 1 he did not bring what was human, because it was the testimony of God; and he determined not to know anything among them but Jesus Christ and Him crucified.<a name=202:15></a> Words are used, but really with the power of them.<a name=202:16></a> He did not come with man's wisdom and man's speech to bring God's testimony; but it was the testimony of Christ all the same.<a name=202:17></a> The great thing is to see why he uses a word, not that it is a different thing necessarily, but why that particular word comes in.<a name=202:18></a> It is God's testimony, not man's.<a name=202:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking, I think, that the apostle addresses them here as "sanctified," enriched with gift, etc.<a name=202:20></a>, and also says they shall be confirmed to the end, that they may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ; but then he goes on to blame them for everything.<a name=202:21></a> They had got testimony to their place in Christ by the gifts, etc.<a name=202:22></a> They had the Holy Ghost in consequence of their faith in Christ, and then he reckons on God's faithfulness; so that there is a point of departure from which he can deal with them.<a name=202:23></a> Many were to be blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus; how be so blameable now?<a name=202:24></a>

		As to the difference between wisdom and understanding (verse 19) in English, wisdom is the attempt to use what a man has learnt, but you could hardly call it that in Greek.<a name=206:1></a> We may say that the understanding of the prudent is more the character of discernment, whereas wisdom is acquaintance with truth more.<a name=206:2></a> In the Hebrew a great many more words are used for wisdom than we have in English.<a name=206:3></a> In Isaiah 29 (verse 14 quoted here), the prophet is taking up the case of Christ's coming.<a name=206:4></a> He had taken up Sennacherib and that leads him on, and he launches out into the Assyrian of the last day.<a name=206:5></a> That is how the prophets speak, and that is what Peter means by "of no private interpretation.<a name=206:6></a>" You cannot take up a few words without the connection.<a name=206:7></a> In Isaiah 33 the whole scheme is developed.<a name=206:8></a> Verse 20 is a quotation from Isaiah 33: 18, which follows, "Thine eye shall see the king in his beauty": sinners are afraid, and then he says, Where is the wisdom of man?<a name=206:9></a> Here they were 'counting up the towers' and so on; but to what purpose after all?<a name=206:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "foolishness of preaching" (verse 21) is more the way of doing it, the means, but it also takes in the thing preached: you cannot separate them here.<a name=206:11></a> The "power of God" (verse 24) is not exactly the same as "kept by the power of God.<a name=206:12></a>" In the latter it is more absolutely in Himself, and Christ is the one in whom it is all deposited; but when you speak of "Christ the power of God," it is more the means by which it is brought out.<a name=206:13></a> In the one case it is "unto salvation" because righteousness of God is revealed in it: there is power of God in it to save us.<a name=206:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The expressions "foolishness of God," and "weakness of God" (verse 27) are used merely to put the thing in the strongest way.<a name=206:15></a> For instance, death is weakness: "crucified in weakness"; yet everything of man was set aside by it, and in that sense the weakness of God.<a name=206:16></a> It is the setting up of God absolutely.<a name=206:17></a> The weakness of God was the gospel, that is, as man would speak of it; and foolishness as man looks at it.<a name=206:18></a> And God chose that -- took it on purpose, though to man it was merely some one hanging on a gibbet, and yet God was glorified in it.<a name=206:19></a> As to "things which are not" (verse 28), out of death is a thing which is not, but the apostle takes it as an extreme case in the whole scene of God in Christendom.<a name=206:20></a> God has brought to nought all of heathenism and Judaism.<a name=206:21></a>

		At the end of our chapter we get the fuller expression of what a Christian is: "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption," verse 30.<a name=206:22></a> Not wisdom in the mind being acted upon and so I am wise about God, but "of him," that is of God, "are ye in Christ Jesus.<a name=206:23></a>" I am of God, and I have my wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption of God, all in Christ.<a name=206:24></a> I am of God in Christ, and have all there of God in Christ.<a name=206:25></a> It comes from Him; it is not my thinking about Him.<a name=206:26></a> And so man is totally set aside, flesh is put down.<a name=206:27></a> The world by wisdom was not to know God, but I am in Christ as a new being, a new creature, created again; and I have wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption all in Christ.<a name=206:28></a> These verses are a remarkably complete statement of what a Christian is, with full redemption itself at the end, body and all.<a name=206:29></a>

		Here it is the measure and character and fulness of sanctification; it is not legal nor outward, but what is in Christ.<a name=207:1></a> It is practical: sanctification always is, except in Hebrews.<a name=207:2></a> We have the nature and the quality of it.<a name=207:3></a> If we look at Christ we see what sanctification is.<a name=207:4></a> People talk of its being imputed, but that is absurd.<a name=207:5></a> Think of the absurdity of talking about imputed redemption!<a name=207:6></a> But in Christ all these things are real to me.<a name=207:7></a> I say, what wisdom I have!<a name=207:8></a> Am I a Platonist?<a name=207:9></a> No, Christ is my wisdom.<a name=207:10></a> Righteousness is imputed; the term is applicable, but you do not get it in this passage.<a name=207:11></a> What sanctification I have!<a name=207:12></a> Christ and redemption too when it is all complete in glory.<a name=207:13></a> It was all accomplished, but is not yet in its full effect.<a name=207:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the order of the words, I take it that wisdom is separated somewhat because that is what the apostle has been talking about.<a name=207:15></a> This was not man's wisdom: God had chosen the foolish things of the world, and so on; and then he brings out that Christ is made unto us wisdom, laying a little more emphasis on wisdom.<a name=207:16></a> There is a question of different text here, I know, and very likely it may be taken as, "who is made unto us wisdom of God"; but that only gives an emphatic character to it, and there is no real difference.<a name=207:17></a> Redemption comes in at the end as the full complete thing.<a name=207:18></a> The difference between <i>ek</i> and <i>apo (</i>verse 30) is that, when we say we are "of God," it is positive life; the other is 'from,' on God's part; whereas we derive our life and nature from God by the Spirit's quickening power.<a name=207:19></a> In John 3 it <i>is ek:</i> " that which is born <i>of</i> the flesh is flesh," etc.<a name=207:20></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 we have the apostle's use of what precedes, and it is remarkable how he sets man aside altogether, and then takes the ground, that when he came to this wise people he knew nothing but the cross, and not only this, but that, looked at as a man, he was in weakness himself, and in fear, and in much trembling.<a name=208:1></a> He has only the foolishness of the cross, and his speech and preaching are not with man's wisdom, that their faith might stand in the power of God.<a name=208:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first five verses we have Paul coming to sinners -- his way with these wise ones.<a name=208:3></a> There was neither excellency of speech nor wisdom to man's eye.<a name=208:4></a> It is not strictly the cross of Christ but Jesus Christ, the positive fact of preaching Christ; and then he takes Christ in the lowest and most degraded way, Christ and Him crucified.<a name=208:5></a> The preaching of the cross is not exactly the same thing, but the point is that he was not reasoning philosophy with them but preaching Christ and then, if you take up Christ, it is in this way, as crucified man.<a name=208:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is difficult for us, used as we are to look upon the cross as redemption, to feel what the effect was on a number of philosophers, what it was to go and say, There was a man gibbeted in -- ; trust him.<a name=208:7></a> To man it was the grossest folly that could be.<a name=208:8></a> And see, it is Jesus Christ, His Person here, He crucified.<a name=208:9></a> He adds, "which none of the princes of this world knew," or "they would not have crucified the Lord of glory," verse 8.<a name=208:10></a> Because He was that, you get His Person, and not merely the fact of the cross.<a name=208:11></a> And it is a very strong thing to put before man; it is what wrote folly on their wisdom and on the grandeur of this world.<a name=208:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment man is a sinner, it is another thing altogether; and, the infinite love of God coming in and speaking to man as man, what comes of all grandeur and of all wisdom and of all else?<a name=208:13></a> The whole of man in flesh is swept away by it.<a name=208:14></a> All that flesh could glory in is there totally put an end to.<a name=208:15></a> There is no kind of fleshly glory in the cross whatever.<a name=208:16></a> It was God's wisdom to do this: no dignity, no heroism, but shame, reproach, ignominy, and death; it is all of man brought down to where nothing could be found -- no, not a stone to put his foot on, to keep it out of the water.<a name=208:17></a> None but slaves were put upon the cross, and this is what God takes up to bring the world to nothing, first to nothing in judgment, and to nothing too, when we know He is in glory.<a name=208:18></a>

		"Them that are perfect" in verse 6 are those that are brought by the cross into this new condition with God; it really is in resurrection if you come to examine it.<a name=209:5></a> They are grown men in that condition.<a name=209:6></a> What the apostle is looking at here is a person who had the flesh put down with death written on all; all brought into God's presence and all the world put an end to; there is a new state of things altogether; the beginning of the new creation; what the Holy Ghost reveals and the Lord of glory.<a name=209:7></a> It is that the person is brought into the state that the cross brings into.<a name=209:8></a> You do not begin expounding blessedness and glory to a person who wants his conscience reached; but the contrast here is the world and the man who has been brought out of the flesh into God's place of blessing in the new creation.<a name=209:9></a> "Perfect" is in contrast with <i>carnal</i> and <i>babes</i> in chapter 3: 1; it is the full-grown man.<a name=209:10></a> Judaism was flesh in that sense of the word: "as unto babes in Christ" is another thing.<a name=209:11></a> You have three things, carnal men, natural, and spiritual men.<a name=209:12></a> You may meet a person you cannot concur with because, though having the Holy Ghost, his practical state is "carnal," yet not "natural.<a name=209:13></a>"

		In Galatians the apostle says, "the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all"; but here he is talking of Christianity in so low a state that he could not talk with them of certain things.<a name=209:14></a> As to knowledge they were "perfect," but in practical state he could not deal with them as such.<a name=209:15></a> I believe there are real Christians who are not <i>perfect</i> in this sense.<a name=209:16></a> If one does not know the forgiveness of his sins, he has not the consciousness of his new standing and is not <i>perfect</i>.<a name=209:17></a> The apostle is here speaking of their standing, he is taking up the question of those who had God's wisdom instead of man's.<a name=209:18></a> When he came to sinners, he preached Christ crucified; and when he had people in a Christian state, he speaks of all the fruits in glory.<a name=209:19></a> When he says, "Ye are carnal," it is the particular state of certain Christians who ought to be up to the measure of their standing, but are not.<a name=209:20></a>

		Here we come to things offered to idols.<a name=232:1></a> There are two distinct directions about that.<a name=232:2></a> They had to own the idol was nothing, and yet own it was something to the consciences of men.<a name=232:3></a> Looked at it in itself, as an idol, it was nothing; and the meat offered to it was what God created.<a name=232:4></a> But then the consciences of men got into connection with demons about it.<a name=232:5></a> He says at first, "We know that an idol is nothing in the world"; and then again, "As touching things offered to idols, we know, for we all have knowledge.<a name=232:6></a>" But knowledge only puffs up, and the man who knew all this, might go with a clear conscience himself and eat this meat, but would stumble his brother who had a weak conscience.<a name=232:7></a>

		In verse 6 the word "in" should be "for": "Of whom are all things and we for him.<a name=232:8></a>" I believe that is the right force of <i>eis</i>.<a name=232:9></a> And in the same passage, the different uses of the words "God" and "Lord" are seen very clearly.<a name=232:10></a> It is not the divine nature as such, but the place that the divine Persons hold in what men call the economy of grace.<a name=232:11></a> The Father rested in simple Godhead, but the Son has become a man and taken the place of Lord in His manhood.<a name=232:12></a> Then when I speak specifically of God, I speak of the Father.<a name=232:13></a> As to Christ, "he shall call his name Jesus" -- Jehovah the Saviour -- for He shall save His people from their sins; but the place He has now taken is that of Lord.<a name=232:14></a> "God hath made him whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ.<a name=232:15></a>" It is not that He ceases to be Jehovah, but He has taken the place of Lord, while the Father rests in simple abstract Godhead.<a name=232:16></a> I notice it, because in Christ as Lord I get the grace administered.<a name=232:17></a> I am a child with the Father, but if I am looking for administration, I go to the Lord: "<i>Lord</i> Jesus receive my spirit.<a name=232:18></a>" "Lord, we have heard by many of this man," and so on.<a name=232:19></a> "To us there is but one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=232:20></a>" It does not say what the nature of that Lord is.<a name=232:21></a> He is God and He is man both, but you have the place, the leading place He has taken.<a name=232:22></a> "All power," He said, "is given to me in heaven and on earth; go ye therefore, and disciple all nations.<a name=232:23></a>" Defiling the conscience (verse 7), means that, if a man has a conscience about anything as evil, he must follow his conscience, or he defiles it.<a name=232:24></a> Mark here, there is no building up on knowing evil.<a name=232:25></a> If I think I ought to eat herbs, I must eat them or my conscience is defiled.<a name=232:26></a> I must depart from iniquity; but I cannot build up on the negative.<a name=232:27></a>

		In verse 18 of this chapter we find the word "abuse" again; but the Greek means that I use outright for myself.<a name=234:14></a> It would not have been abusing his power in the gospel, but he did not use that power as something to which he had title of possession; he only thought about it as a thing he could use for the sake of the gospel.<a name=234:15></a> There is really no thought of "abusing" in it.<a name=234:16></a> It would not be "abusing," to take a salary, or whatever you call it.<a name=234:17></a> "Abuse" is a bad word, but it is difficult to give the sense in one word; no single English word suits.<a name=234:18></a> As to the other passage -- "Using this world and not abusing it" -- you hear it quoted by people who are up to their neck in it; and it is, perhaps, more important to notice it there than here.<a name=234:19></a> It is using this world as not having it in possession; simply handling it therefore, and that not as property.<a name=234:20></a>

		In verses 20, 21, he sought to win Jews, not to Judaise.<a name=236:8></a> Judaising was very common.<a name=236:9></a> In itself Judaism was God's dealing with human nature, to see if good could be got out of flesh.<a name=236:10></a> God dealt with Adam and then with the Jew (promise coming in between), but Judaism was God taking up man on his responsibility, and giving him a rule or law, and with it all appliances to help, a priesthood and temple, every kind of help to a man as man, to see if any good could be got from him.<a name=236:11></a> It was the orderly essaying and proving whether man could be on terms with God.<a name=236:12></a> He could not please God; but yet it is the constant tendency of human nature to go back and try again, for it does not bow and own; there is no good in it; and so it is always talking about keeping the law, but never does it.<a name=236:13></a> Really man's responsibility is not in question at all.<a name=236:14></a> There is such a thing; but Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost.<a name=236:15></a> "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.<a name=236:16></a>" But that is it which has been brought into the light and condemned, and I have therefore now a right to say I am dead.<a name=236:17></a> "Through the law I am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.<a name=236:18></a>" I am dead and finished as a child of Adam.<a name=236:19></a> Because this is not apprehended, there are always some remains of Judaism.<a name=236:20></a> "When we were in the flesh, the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.<a name=236:21></a>" And the result is, we discover we are lost.<a name=236:22></a> Take the whole system of setting up law in any form, and the moving of men's hearts by it: it all owns man still -- alive in the flesh.<a name=236:23></a> You get it grossly in a self-righteous person, and in a mixed shape in those who try to put law and grace together; but in each and all it is just human nature thinking it can be something.<a name=236:24></a> There is something terrible in putting a man under law after grace has come in; it is setting him to responsibility after flesh has been proved unable to meet it.<a name=236:25></a>

		The principle was that the eaters were identified with the altar.<a name=250:10></a> If it were a thanksgiving, it must be eaten on the same day, but two days were allowed in the case of a vow, because there was a stronger energy in it, and none might be eaten on the third day at all.<a name=250:11></a> And so, if they were at table at a feast, he says, Eat what is set before you, unless it is given you as having been offered at an idol's temple, and then eat not.<a name=250:12></a> Of course you could do the act of eating of idols' sacrifices, but you cannot eat to God and to the demon together.<a name=250:13></a> Then comes the question, whether it is only those who are eating who are identified; and the local church is spoken of as the body of Christ, but I must take in all Christians when I go out into the mystic body.<a name=250:14></a> The communion <i>(koinonia) is</i> merely the external act of partaking, but if it is of Christ, it is the whole body.<a name=250:15></a> I cannot call an assembly the body of Christ, except so far as it may represent the whole body.<a name=250:16></a> At the altar there is identification, I am in communion with it; you do not get communion with the Lord's table, but taking a part in it; 1 Corinthians 10: 21.<a name=250:17></a>

		Turning to 1 Corinthians 12 we have both the manifestation of the Spirit and miraculous gifts.<a name=274:4></a> The apostle was speaking in contrast with demons, etc.<a name=274:5></a>, but it is a manifestation of the Spirit in power: so in chapter 14, if all prophesied, they were convinced of all, and judged of all, and thus the secrets of his heart were made manifest, and so, falling down on his face, he worshipped God, and reported that God was in them of a truth.<a name=274:6></a> It is more the outward manifestation that is in his mind here.<a name=274:7></a> It applies in principle to what remains now.<a name=274:8></a> There is the word of wisdom, etc.<a name=274:9></a> Speaking by "two or three, and that by course," applies now.<a name=274:10></a> I never did speak, if three had spoken.<a name=274:11></a> Simply reading a chapter is not speaking.<a name=274:12></a> Ordinarily we call prophecy the foretelling future events, but this is not the meaning of the word.<a name=274:13></a> It is "forth-telling," not "foretelling.<a name=274:14></a>" We have this prophecy spoken of in verse 10, for edification, exhortation, and comfort, but not as inspiration of some new revelation.<a name=274:15></a> The word is used both in a general way, and as a direct gift.<a name=274:16></a> We have not it in the special way.<a name=274:17></a>

		The body (verse 12) is for eternity, though a person when he dies passes out of the body, as manifested in time; he ceases to be part of that which was formed of God, by the Holy Ghost down here, but in result the whole will be Christ's body.<a name=275:13></a> If a person dies, he is like any one on furlough, and forms no actual part of the regiment in active service.<a name=275:14></a> We must recollect that the Holy Ghost has come down to earth.<a name=275:15></a> Christ, as God, created everything, but that was not His actual existence as when He came, but still He had been working, and had created everything.<a name=275:16></a> And so as to the Holy Ghost Christ said, "If I go not away, the Comforter will not come.<a name=275:17></a>" Now, every direct action of God on the creature is by the Spirit: yet He came on the day of Pentecost.<a name=275:18></a> Our Lord says, "When he is come," and so on.<a name=275:19></a> Of course, when He forms the body, He forms it where He is; but as God He does not give up the person that dies, neither his body, for He has got it all in His hands, and under His eye, to be raised.<a name=275:20></a> Even the body is not given up, but it ceases to be in that corporation which the Holy Ghost has formed on earth.<a name=275:21></a> If one die, he belongs to the body, and is held to belong to Christ.<a name=275:22></a> His body is in the dust, and his spirit is with Christ.<a name=275:23></a>

		In Ephesians 1, we may notice, Christ is head in title, and not yet: in God's counsels the church is Christ's body, neither present, future, nor past, for it is all in counsel; but here, in Corinthians, it is the actual thing in accomplishment, distinct quite from Ephesians, which is purpose and counsel.<a name=276:6></a> And here, too, it is the nature of the thing.<a name=276:7></a> Then we have the dependence of the members down here; and it is important to see that all this is down here, because when I read, "He set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets," and so on (verse 28-30), then all this is not in heaven.<a name=276:8></a> The apostle says, "in the assembly" (verse 28), so not "in the body," because it is a matter of historical fact.<a name=276:9></a> The body is a figure; and he is stating the fact of the realisation of this in the assembly; so that it would not suit so well to say, "He set some in the body.<a name=276:10></a>"

		Verse 25 -- "The members should have the same care" -- proves that all the saints ought to have a care one for another; and that would include every member of the body on earth.<a name=276:11></a> "The same care," he says: it is not simply his taking a care for them, but I ought to care for you in the sense of love, and interest and heart being there; it is not "taking care of," but a different idea.<a name=276:12></a> We are all one body: my hand is interested in my eye, and my eye in my hand.<a name=276:13></a> All are dependent one on another, in spite of themselves, though it ought to be in love.<a name=276:14></a>

		It is to be noticed, that, in verse 26, the apostle does not say (though it would be right to say it) that if one member suffer, all the members <i>do</i> suffer with it.<a name=278:14></a> God has tempered the body, that it should be so; and I trust it is in measure the case.<a name=278:15></a> The realisation of it is diminished by divisions and distances, and all that kind of thing; but do you suppose that, if there is a great work of blessing going on in India or Canada, there is not a blessing, too, in Ireland?<a name=278:16></a> Of course there is, as far as living energy goes.<a name=278:17></a> The thing is true, though spoiled in a measure.<a name=278:18></a> In an assembly where a brother is not walking in the Lord, if the gathering is spiritual, they will feel it, and there will be an immediate consciousness that something is grieving the Spirit.<a name=278:19></a> But if my soul is deadened, as you may sometimes see, of course it is not felt so distinctly.<a name=278:20></a> If a person cuts my hand, I do not merely say, "Why did you cut my hand?<a name=278:21></a>" but my whole body feels it.<a name=278:22></a> If an individual were chastened, the assembly feels it in a measure; if they were insensible to it, they would be all the more hardened.<a name=278:23></a> The suffering here is any kind of trial, but it applies to chastisement, because we have all one life.<a name=278:24></a> It is, by there being one Spirit in it all, that it is so, and it always has a certain effect, though the body may be so divided as to feel it but little.<a name=278:25></a> We can be awakened by the work of the Spirit and the word of prayer.<a name=278:26></a> If any can apply the word, let them apply it.<a name=278:27></a> When there is sin in an assembly, if they judge it, they prove themselves clear; but if they do not, things will get worse, or the Lord deal with them.<a name=278:28></a> "Leaven" would apply to both the sin and their refusing to judge it.<a name=278:29></a> The thing the apostle wants in 2 Corinthians is to bring them all into obedience: he says, "When your obedience is fulfilled.<a name=278:30></a>" Our own condition is of first importance.<a name=278:31></a> We are never independent of the state we are in, or of the Lord's judgment of it.<a name=278:32></a>

		The apostle now speaks of resurrection.<a name=286:7></a> His keeping it till the last, in this way, is remarkable.<a name=286:8></a> We have a great truth brought out in the chapter, in the total identification of Christ with men -- saints, but man as man, because he says, if men do not rise, Christ is not risen.<a name=286:9></a> I have not the least objection to verse 22 as it stands in the English Version, for all the wicked will be raised, as well as the righteous.<a name=286:10></a> As in Adam everybody in Adam dies, so in Christ all in Christ will be made alive.<a name=286:11></a> Verse 21 is more general; it is merely the fact that resurrection comes by man.<a name=286:12></a> You could only say "in Christ" of the wicked, if you take it in the power of Christ.<a name=286:13></a> The whole account is the resurrection of the saints.<a name=286:14></a> When you take in resurrection of the dead, it is abstract, and it is resurrection that is insisted on.<a name=286:15></a>

		The destruction of death, if you take it for the wicked, will be the second death.<a name=286:16></a> The wages of sin is death in general, but strictly the first death; though wrath of God from heaven is revealed along with the gospel.<a name=286:17></a> I know of no scripture that speaks of Christ bearing the second death.<a name=286:18></a> He bore what brings us into it.<a name=286:19></a> It is a great thing to keep to Scripture.<a name=286:20></a> "The lake of fire," "the second death," is not annihilation.<a name=286:21></a>

		In our Lord's speaking with Peter (John 21), two words are used: <i>phileo (I am attached) is more intimate, agapao</i> (I love) is more general.<a name=291:1></a> Peter says, I love you with the intimacy of a friend.<a name=291:2></a> It is curious, that, though the verb <i>phileo is</i> used, the noun from it is never used in the Greek.<a name=291:3></a> The Lord uses the general word first, and probes his heart; and then again, "Lovest thou me?<a name=291:4></a>" and the third time He says, "Affectionest thou me?<a name=291:5></a>" "I not only love you," says Peter, "but have affection for you.<a name=291:6></a>" I think there is great instruction there.<a name=291:7></a> The Lord never reproaches Peter, but goes to detect the root that had produced the fault: and Peter is not really restored until he had judged the root.<a name=291:8></a> I do not mean that he may not have confessed it honestly, but he is in danger of the same again.<a name=291:9></a> The moment he had been put to the test, he did not know the Lord at all, and nothing but divine knowledge could have said that he loved Him.<a name=291:10></a> Divine knowledge could say all things; and then, when the Lord has completely humbled him, He puts entire confidence in him: "Feed my sheep.<a name=291:11></a>" The very thing Christ loves most on this earth He trusts to this man.<a name=291:12></a> It was a complete destruction of Peter's self-confidence, and then he knew what the resource for a poor sheep was: since he had judged himself thoroughly, he knew where to take the sheep.<a name=291:13></a> The Lord never can trust anybody that trusts himself.<a name=291:14></a> It is not that a person is not sincere.<a name=291:15></a> Peter was perfectly sincere, but he did not know himself.<a name=291:16></a>

		Then the Lord, we may say, leaps over to His coming.<a name=291:17></a> Then there was another thing as to Peter I may mention -- He puts an end to his will.<a name=291:18></a> Peter had declared he would follow Him to prison and to death -- the thing he could not do.<a name=291:19></a> If only a servant girl asks him, "Are you one of them?<a name=291:20></a>" he is afraid, and begins to curse and swear.<a name=291:21></a> The Lord now says, "When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<a name=291:22></a> This spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God.<a name=291:23></a>" 'When your will is gone, you will follow Me.<a name=291:24></a>' The very thing he said he would do, and could not, because he trusted the flesh, that thing, when he had no confidence of his own, was what he would do, and really did so.<a name=291:25></a> It was a thorough breaking down of the flesh, and then Christ trusts all to him, both His sheep and His lambs.<a name=291:26></a> There is a difference there: first, "Feed my lambs"; then, "Shepherd my sheep"; and then, "Feed my sheep.<a name=291:27></a>" "Shepherd," in that way, is sometimes important; the elders are called on to shepherd the flock; the Greek word means not to feed merely, but to care for and watch over them.<a name=291:28></a> We have no ascension here; all passes over to Christ's coming: we have nothing of Paul, but only Peter and John; Peter, the apostle of the circumcision, and John's ministry going on till the Lord came.<a name=291:29></a>

		All that is told of the first resurrection is testimony against the entire idea of taking people to judgment in the way the evangelical system does.<a name=292:8></a> "We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ" -- be manifested there -- that must be, but the saints are in glory before they arrive there: therefore the idea of a judgment, whether they are to have the place or not, is altogether too low.<a name=292:9></a> The real power of redemption has been lost sight of, and the resurrection itself is the fruit of that redemption.<a name=292:10></a> Just as Christ Himself was taken from among the dead (besides, He "could not be holden of it") by the glory of the Father owning Him in righteousness as Son, so the saints will be taken out too.<a name=292:11></a> But there the resurrection was putting the seal of acceptance publicly upon Christ's whole work; and everything is settled.<a name=292:12></a> Whereas, also, if the saints alone are raised, and taken out from among the wicked dead presently, it too is a positive testimony to their acceptance.<a name=292:13></a>

		But I was alluding to the fact that we are raised in glory, and surely, if we are there, the question of judging whether we are to be there is all nonsense.<a name=293:20></a> And so the first resurrection is not merely a notion about some high-flown thing.<a name=293:21></a> "Some have not the knowledge of God"; for this denying the resurrection was connected really with a moral state; there was no real knowledge of God.<a name=293:22></a> A Christian might have fallen into such a state, but the knowledge of God is that revelation of God to the soul which is estimated by the new nature, and is the spring of all acquaintance with truth.<a name=293:23></a> A saint may fall into such a state, for the flesh in the saint is as bad as in the sinner, or worse.<a name=293:24></a> Paul here states the fact, "some have not the knowledge of God," just as we were saying, the other day, a man asleep is, as regards others, just the same as a dead man.<a name=293:25></a> Some needed the exhortation, "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.<a name=293:26></a>" Such are thinking after the flesh, instead of thinking after Christ, though before God not really in the flesh.<a name=293:27></a>

		Those in 2 Peter 3, who were "entangled" and "overcome," had known Christ in a superficial way; there was no real change of life, no vital change, only an outward change through the knowledge brought to them, but, as the old saying is, "A washed sow is no sheep.<a name=295:1></a>" It takes a new nature really to know God.<a name=295:2></a> Knowing Christ may be a little different from knowing God; knowing God is knowing His nature, whereas Christ has come, and there might, in another way, be such and such a knowledge of Him.<a name=295:3></a> Without knowledge of God, you may get your feelings moved about the truth.<a name=295:4></a> Look at Balaam.<a name=295:5></a> He can say, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his"; but there was no change as to his life, or anything.<a name=295:6></a> There may be such now, with no real knowledge of Christ.<a name=295:7></a> The outward manifestation of Christ may have come to a person, without any knowledge of what was inside.<a name=295:8></a> "When they knew God," in Romans 1, was the knowledge of God as in Noah, the preacher of righteousness; but they turned that into idolatry.<a name=295:9></a> They knew there was only one God in Noah's time, and they gave that up for idols.<a name=295:10></a> In one sense you may know everything, if you merely take the acquaintance with it.<a name=295:11></a> In Romans Paul is convicting the Gentiles on two grounds -- their knowledge of God as in Noah, and on the ground of the creation-glory of God.<a name=295:12></a> The starting-point of the Gentiles was the knowledge of God, and they did not like to retain Him in their knowledge; that is the way they lost it, because the human mind, in a moral sense, cannot hold it.<a name=295:13></a> It is <i>ginosko</i> in Greek, in "After that ye have known God.<a name=295:14></a>" It is the word constantly used in such a connection.<a name=295:15></a> The word <i>epiginosko is</i> more, it is consciously to know.<a name=295:16></a> He says of the Corinthians, they were ignorant of God; I think the knowing of God, in Romans, is a little more, because they had knowledge, for they started from a point, and it was abandoned.<a name=295:17></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was at Ephesus, intending to go to Corinth, but they were in such a bad state there that he could not go, but he wrote a letter, and then went up from Ephesus to Troas, in hope to meet Titus with an answer to his letter.<a name=301:1></a> He went into Macedonia, met Titus, and wrote them the second letter, now that his heart could open out more upon blessing.<a name=301:2></a> He could go farther on in the truth now, though they were still babes, yet he could lead them on.<a name=301:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul could go much nearer to Ephesian truth here, and we have the basis of that in a verse or two, though he does not enter into it as the unfolding of God's counsels.<a name=301:4></a> As regards the person of the Christian, it is, "If one died for all, then were all dead"; that is Ephesian truth as a basis in the individual.<a name=301:5></a> "Bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus" is Roman truth, which is much beyond the first epistle; but his mouth is opened and enlarged.<a name=301:6></a> In Ephesians he gives the counsels of God, but here he can take the foundation in Christians.<a name=301:7></a> And here there was another thing had happened which gave occasion to this; he had gone through the terrible persecutions at Ephesus when the town clerk dismissed the assembly (and he seems, indeed, to have gone farther than we have details of in Acts), so that he despaired of his life.<a name=301:8></a> He had been through this which had brought him to the point of all that he sets out in the second epistle -- that life was in God who raised the dead, and the flesh was dead.<a name=301:9></a> That is Roman truth -- dead with Christ; but there are two ways in which men are looked at -- as living in sins, or living to sin, if you please; and on the other hand as dead in sins.<a name=301:10></a> It is the same state, but in two different aspects.<a name=301:11></a> If I look at a man living in his lusts and pleasures, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, then he is both living in sins and dead to God.<a name=301:12></a> I may take him up on either side, and say, You are a living man in sins, and you must die: or I may take him up as dead in sins, and say, Life is God's gift; and without it you cannot enjoy Him, or know Him, for you are dead.<a name=301:13></a> Death is brought to a living man in sin, and the new creature to a man that is dead.<a name=301:14></a> If the man is dead, as in Ephesians, we have all the counsels of God, a totally new creation of everything else, and of the man too, and that is here in Corinthians, not merely "he is a new creature" but there is (that is, the whole thing is) a new creation.<a name=301:15></a> You have the man practically realising death, and also as already dead, and the new creation brought in.<a name=301:16></a>

		What I have indicated is the main thought of the epistle, and then we hear afterwards about collections of money.<a name=302:1></a> It is addressed more specifically to the saints.<a name=302:2></a> In the first epistle there is instruction for the whole of professing Christendom, and governmental directions how to get on.<a name=302:3></a> Here he is thinking of the saints, and opens his heart: it is to the saints which are in all Achaia, where Corinth was situated.<a name=302:4></a> The word "saints" looks at them as to their standing.<a name=302:5></a> Sanctified of the Spirit is always assumed to be a real thing, although there may be a false person amongst those so spoken of.<a name=302:6></a> I do not think the word "saint" is ever used, except upon the supposition that they are really so.<a name=302:7></a> Sanctified by the truth is like it, but not sanctified by blood as in Hebrews 10.<a name=302:8></a> It is not the individual himself sanctified by the Holy Ghost in such cases.<a name=302:9></a> See in Hebrews, "hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing.<a name=302:10></a>" There was positive apostasy from that kind of sanctification, and yet he there speaks to them as sanctified.<a name=302:11></a> The true value of the sacrifice is not only to fit them for God, but to set them apart for God.<a name=302:12></a> It is like the word calling: "many are called, but few are chosen.<a name=302:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle addresses them here as the "church of God"; in Romans there is no recognised church: there was a church assembled there, but he was dealing about individual justification; he had never been at Rome so as to recognise the church.<a name=302:14></a> In Thessalonians it is "the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father.<a name=302:15></a>" They had just come out of idolatry, and there was but one God, and He was God the Father.<a name=302:16></a> Here it is ecclesiastical rather, the church of God; he is dealing with God's assembly in the world.<a name=302:17></a> For the same reason he says to Timothy, "the church of the living God," and tells him how he ought to behave himself there: he adds "living," in contrast with dumb and dead idols.<a name=302:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get hold of the starting-point of this epistle in seeing that God had comforted Paul by the coming of Titus, after all his troubles at Ephesus, and about Corinth too.<a name=302:19></a> When he reached Macedonia, "without were fightings, within were fears"; and then comes Titus, and that is where he is in this epistle.<a name=302:20></a> He had gone through all at Ephesus, and at the same time had the pressure of the Corinthian state on his heart, and not only their state, but sorrow that he had ever written the first epistle at all, because he was afraid he had alienated the Corinthians from him.<a name=302:21></a> And he was now "joyed" by the coming of Titus.<a name=302:22></a>

		He sets out God as "the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<a name=303:1></a>" (Read also verse 5-7.<a name=303:2></a>) Then, in verse 8, he begins with the circumstances we were referring to in Asia, but says "we had the sentence of death in ourselves"; he was almost put to death, but God did not allow him to be killed, and this met a man who held himself to be dead already.<a name=303:3></a> The sentence of death was written on him, and he held himself dead in himself, so that his confidence was not in any life he had as a man, but it was in God who raiseth the dead.<a name=303:4></a> It was the carrying out of Romans 6: 11: "Reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin," that was counting himself so.<a name=303:5></a> We have three things: God sees us as dead; ye are dead; live it.<a name=303:6></a> Faith says, I reckon myself dead; Paul was doing so, and is made to carry it out.<a name=303:7></a> In Romans he applies it to sin, but here it is to everything.<a name=303:8></a> His confidence is in God, and God did deliver him, and did not allow him to be killed, though he feared it.<a name=303:9></a> Verse 11 refers to the part all the saints had in the power of deliverance that was with him.<a name=303:10></a> It is a remarkable expression, "The gift bestowed upon us through the prayers of many persons.<a name=303:11></a>" This was at Ephesus.<a name=303:12></a>

		The country called Asia in Scripture is proconsular Asia, the south-western corner of Asia Minor.<a name=303:13></a> I do not know that all Icaria was taken in.<a name=303:14></a> Then above that was Bithynia, and Cappadocia, and Galatia, and Armenia, and so on.<a name=303:15></a> I do not know that it was quite down to the sea in the south, but near the south-western corner.<a name=303:16></a> I would take in Lydia too.<a name=303:17></a> When he says, "All they that be in Asia," that is the portion spoken of.<a name=303:18></a> Ephesus was a great centre then, where was the temple of Artemis or Diana, "that all the world worshipped," one of the seven wonders of the world.<a name=303:19></a>

		As to the general use of the Greek word in verse 4, "encouragement" is better than "comfort"; but it is the word for "exhort, and comfort, and encourage": it means to stir up our hearts.<a name=303:20></a>

		"The sufferings of Christ abound in us" (verse 5) means sufferings the same in character; as in Colossians he says, "I fill up that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=304:1></a>" The Head had suffered, and Paul was suffering too for the elect's sake, and doing so in the sphere that was given him.<a name=304:2></a> And you can see by their prayers they were all interested in what Paul had from God; they enjoyed it too, though the thing was bestowed upon him: just as we do now when praying for a brother in his labour.<a name=304:3></a> "Filling up that which is behind" signifies that there was more to be done.<a name=304:4></a> The Head had done His part, of course: Paul's was not atonement.<a name=304:5></a> I think this was confined to the apostle Paul.<a name=304:6></a> Peter and the rest never suffered for the church, though they suffered for Christ's sake, but Paul suffered from the Jews, which Peter never did.<a name=304:7></a> Paul was a minister of the gospel to the whole creation which is under heaven, and a minister of the church to complete the word of God; and this is not said of anybody else, it is Paul especially.<a name=304:8></a> I do not say that we ought not to suffer, for we ought; but a dispensation was committed to Paul, and we could not say this.<a name=304:9></a> We may have our share in the privilege, as some great banker takes up a large loan, and other people take up bits of it.<a name=304:10></a> All that take under him have their share.<a name=304:11></a>

		Then Paul gives what I was saying about his journey round the Aegean sea.<a name=304:13></a> "In this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you might have a second benefit, and to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judea," verse 15, 16.<a name=304:14></a> Paul thought to have gone up the west side of the Aegean to Macedonia, and then to have come down the west side again, whereas he did not do so, but came down the east side of the Archipelago again.<a name=304:15></a> He says it was to spare them that he did not go to Corinth; if he had gone, it must have been "with a rod.<a name=304:16></a>" But when Titus came, he heard it was all right, or at least in the main.<a name=304:17></a> Now here we have an instance of what we see in Paul: the instant he touches a certain string, off he goes on that string.<a name=304:18></a> His mind was so full of Christ, that, if he touches that, he goes away into it all; it is so here.<a name=304:19></a> He mentions Christ, and away he is into a whole range of truth in Him.<a name=304:20></a> This would not, however, have been so appropriate in the first epistle.<a name=304:21></a> "Our word," he says, "was not yea and nay; for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us was not yea and nay, but yea is in him; for all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God by us," verse 19, 20.<a name=304:22></a>

		Paul says it was not lightness, nor was it uncertainty, but it was to spare them he came not as yet unto Corinth, and he wrote to them instead of going.<a name=305:1></a> He says, "not yea and nay," not changing, not the lightness of a mere foolish human mind.<a name=305:2></a> In 1 Corinthians 16: 5 he says, "I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia "; this was that they might have a second benefit; and in verse 7 he adds, "for I will not see you now by the way," only he did not tell them why just then.<a name=305:3></a> He had intended to go by Corinth into Macedonia, and come back again by them, but he says, I will not do that now, so he says in chapter 16.<a name=305:4></a> He had intended, and then did not go.<a name=305:5></a> And here he asks, "Did I use lightness?<a name=305:6></a>" No, it was another thing.<a name=305:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 20 "the promises" are all made to Christ, and not directly to the church.<a name=305:8></a> There are promises by the way, such as, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee"; but all the promises in chief are to Christ.<a name=305:9></a> There never was a promise to a man, that is, a sinner, because the first thing that was said for faith to hang upon was a judgment passed upon the serpent; but it was Christ (the Seed of the woman) who was to bruise the serpent's head.<a name=305:10></a> There was no promise to fallen Adam, and had he been unfallen, he would not have wanted a promise.<a name=305:11></a> It was a revelation of the last Adam to which his faith could cling, but it was no promise to himself.<a name=305:12></a> In judging the serpent God says, "Thou shalt bruise his heel" (the heel of the woman's Seed); but "the Seed of the woman shall bruise thy head.<a name=305:13></a>" The Seed of the woman is Christ, not Adam.<a name=305:14></a> The promise in Christ, in Ephesians 3, is everything that God has promised, eternal life, and especially the Spirit, "that ye might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<a name=305:15></a>" And then everything else is thus involved in Christ.<a name=305:16></a> Promise is an abstract idea, which takes a form as may be needed -- bruising the serpent's head; promise of eternal life given is in Christ Jesus before the world began.<a name=305:17></a> and so on.<a name=305:18></a> There is no promise to the Gentiles.<a name=305:19></a> There is a revelation made to the Gentiles about them, as, "Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people"; or, "The promise is unto you and your children, and to them that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call": but all is in Christ.<a name=305:20></a> There is to the ten tribes; and many statements are made about them in the abundance of revelation.<a name=305:21></a> "Afar off," both in Acts and Ephesians 2, leaves it open.<a name=305:22></a> The apostle seizes the word "whosoever" in Acts 2, and gives it to Gentiles, or anybody else.<a name=305:23></a> He often takes up a word, and gives it a larger application than it had originally.<a name=305:24></a> The apostle does not himself apply it to the Gentiles in Acts 2, but, while it is quite true that Peter had the Jews and the ten tribes in his mind then, yet in the mind of the Spirit of God it embraces Gentiles also.<a name=305:25></a>

		In Galatians the promises to Abraham were to Christ and to Christ only: that is the whole of the apostle's argument.<a name=306:1></a> There were two classes of promises and all go with Abraham.<a name=306:2></a> Abraham is the beginning of promise.<a name=306:3></a> If we go back a little, there were no dealings of God before the flood.<a name=306:4></a> He turned man out of the garden, if that can be called a dealing, but nothing between that and the flood.<a name=306:5></a> Then when God brings in the new world, in Noah He brings in government to restrain man; there is the power of the sword.<a name=306:6></a> After this, that it might be understood all was pure grace, God begins with promise.<a name=306:7></a> In the flood judgment came in; and thereupon the devil comes in and says, I govern the world, and men take up their idols.<a name=306:8></a> Well, God divided the world into nations and Abraham becomes the root of God's ways, and we find promises, election, and calling.<a name=306:9></a>

		Abraham is the root of the olive tree: the promises are given to him; he is the elect and called one.<a name=306:10></a> And God gives the principle of all divine life, faith.<a name=306:11></a> Notice that, because people say, Had not God Himself settled all these things already?<a name=306:12></a> I say, Yes, because when He settled them, He called me out of them, to go out by faith: "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy fathers, unto a land that I will shew thee.<a name=306:13></a>" -- I had formed this world into nations, it has gone to idolatry and taken the devil for its god, and now you must come out and belong to Me.<a name=306:14></a> Well, he left his country and kindred, but not his father's house, and therefore he did not get to Canaan then, but after his father's death he went to Canaan.<a name=306:15></a> And Abraham was the first person who was the head of a family; Adam was the head of an evil race, man.<a name=306:16></a> We find plenty of saints, but no heads; but Abraham was to be father of the faithful.<a name=306:17></a> And it is then that God calls out this distinct person to be a stranger and sojourner.<a name=306:18></a><a name=307>[Page 307]</a>

		There were two classes of promises; that a great nation should spring from him and his seed, to be as the stars of heaven (that is not "thy seed," or one).<a name=307:1></a> But in Genesis 12, God says, "in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed," that is not Israel.<a name=307:2></a> Then we find that promise confirmed in chapter 22.<a name=307:3></a> It is never said, "to thee" and thy seed, "to Abraham," but "<i>in</i> thee.<a name=307:4></a>" But when Isaac had been offered up and been received in resurrection, then he says in Galatians, "to Abraham and to his seed were the promises made.<a name=307:5></a>" Genesis 12 gave it to Abraham, and Genesis 22 confirmed it, to the Seed.<a name=307:6></a> The promise is made to Abraham personally in chapter 12, and confirmed to the seed, Isaac, in chapter 22, and that is a figure in which Christ had died and risen.<a name=307:7></a> That was confirmed to Christ (but not in Christ), and the law which came later on could not disannul or add to it.<a name=307:8></a> Hence therefore you cannot bring in the law now; law cannot be tacked on to promise.<a name=307:9></a> Then you see there was only one Seed, and that is Christ, and then he adds, If I am in Christ, I have the promise That is the way he brings the Gentile in.<a name=307:10></a> The Jews were the natural seed, but he says, the promise of the blessing was to the one person, Christ.<a name=307:11></a> Very well, I am in Christ, then I have the promise; "If ye be in Christ, then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.<a name=307:12></a>"

		It is not a promise to the Gentiles, but one confirmed to Christ and then to the Gentiles in Christ, through the Spirit.<a name=307:13></a> Genesis 15 is specific to the Jews, and in Genesis 22 is promise to the seed.<a name=307:14></a> The stars of heaven are the Jews only, as Moses says, "Behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude," Deuteronomy 1.<a name=307:15></a> It is a great thing to see what the Lord is pointing out in a passage.<a name=307:16></a> And He takes two illustrations of a great number -- what we see in the heavens, and what lies on the sea-shore.<a name=307:17></a>

		"New testament" (verse 6) is the "new covenant," which we find also in Jeremiah 31; it is new in contrast with the old.<a name=319:8></a> It is characterised by the forgiveness of sins, and a man no more teaching his neighbour.<a name=319:9></a> Then the prophet says, that they shall no more say, "Know the Lord, for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them.<a name=319:10></a>" The two chief points are the knowledge of God as Jehovah, and the forgiveness of sins.<a name=319:11></a> God's part of that covenant has been done, and Israel would not take it up: so we now are getting the blessings of it, without its being made with us.<a name=319:12></a> Our Lord says at the supper, "This is the new covenant in my blood"; and here Paul calls it the same, saying he is an able minister of it.<a name=319:13></a> How could he minister it before it was made?<a name=319:14></a> The foundation has been laid, and we have the ministry of it.<a name=319:15></a> Christ shed His blood, and then the grace was proposed to the Jews; but they would not have it.<a name=319:16></a> Peter, in Acts 3, told them Christ would come back if they would have Him, but they would not.<a name=319:17></a> God gives the blessings to others, and announces them by His ministers.<a name=319:18></a> But the covenant is not made with anybody.<a name=319:19></a> It cannot, in any sense, be a new covenant with us, because we have no old one.<a name=319:20></a> "This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel," God says.<a name=319:21></a> "After those days," it is said, He puts His law in their hearts, He forgives their sins, makes them know Himself: that is the new covenant, and a very important one too.<a name=319:22></a>

		We are under no covenant, though we have the blessings of it (unless you take in a way the covenant confirmed to Christ).<a name=320:1></a> First, there was a covenant made with Israel at Sinai, on condition of obedience -- "If ye obey my voice," and they said, "Yes.<a name=320:2></a>" Well we know how they failed.<a name=320:3></a> Finally Christ dies, and in dying lays the foundation of a new covenant which was, "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them"; and "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more," and "They shall all know me.<a name=320:4></a>" Now that will be made good to them, but meanwhile we are getting the benefits, the ground of the whole having been laid in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=320:5></a> All the spared Jews will be righteous, but not necessarily those that are born afterwards.<a name=320:6></a> As for Gentiles, they never had a covenant.<a name=320:7></a> In Isaiah and Jeremiah "my people" is Israel, and has nothing to do with Gentiles.<a name=320:8></a> The "blood of the new covenant was shed for many," which is not Israel only.<a name=320:9></a>

		Verse 13 is a very important one, because his argument runs from that to the word "veil.<a name=321:19></a>" It is "that the children of Israel <i>should</i> not look"; for "could" is not right either; it is about half-way between.<a name=321:20></a> The use of the Greek word differs: but here in verse 13 it is not "so that they could not," nor "that they could not," but "so that they should not," as nearly as one can say it.<a name=321:21></a> In the words "look to the end," the apostle took the law as so many commandments about sheep and bullocks, without ever looking beyond.<a name=321:22></a> Christ is really the end of it all.<a name=321:23></a> Moses put a veil over his face, because they could not bear to look at his face.<a name=321:24></a> There is no veil now; but they were afraid of the glory.<a name=321:25></a> The law being a ministration of death and condemnation, they could not look at that.<a name=321:26></a> If you connect the least glimpse of the glory of God with the law, then a man cannot look at it; just as they had before said to Moses when God spake out of the fire, "You go and speak to God for us, lest we die.<a name=321:27></a>" The apostle takes the law absolutely here as law -- death and condemnation; but the way in which it worked in Israel then was that it hindered their looking to the end of that which was abolished.<a name=321:28></a> So Moses put on the veil in order that they might not see the glory itself.<a name=321:29></a> That was before he went in to the Lord.<a name=321:30></a> The veil was not put on in order to hinder, but it was put on to the hindrance of their looking.<a name=321:31></a> "It came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.<a name=321:32></a> And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.<a name=321:33></a> And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him, and Moses talked with them.<a name=321:34></a> And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.<a name=321:35></a> And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.<a name=321:36></a>"

		In John 17 there are two glories, so to speak; the glory as God and the glory as Man, and it is the latter He gives to us.<a name=327:12></a> In John you will always find Christ's oneness with the Father and yet He receives everything, and so it is He says, "Glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<a name=327:13></a>" It is a glorious thing being God and being one with the Father; but then, all that He has as man we have.<a name=327:14></a> There is His unity with the Father, and we cannot have that; but as it is displayed in man, we have it all.<a name=327:15></a> He goes up on high into the glory He had with the Father before the world was; He will come again and we shall see Him as He is.<a name=327:16></a> I do not believe the world will ever see Him as He is; flesh and blood would be struck down blind if they were, as Paul was.<a name=327:17></a>

		The treasure is the light of the knowledge of the love of God; and it is in an earthen vessel, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.<a name=328:1></a> He puts this amazing glory in the vessel in order that all the power may be of God.<a name=328:2></a> There is no fitness between the vessel and the thing that is put into it, and there you will find God and the vessel both brought in.<a name=328:3></a> "We are troubled on every side," that is the vessel; "yet not distressed," because God was there; "we are perplexed," see no way out; "but not in despair," for there was a way out after all, for God was there; "persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.<a name=328:4></a>" The vessel is all broken and dealt with, but still God is there all the while.<a name=328:5></a> Into such an earthen vessel all this glory is put, and so in that sense we can now rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.<a name=328:6></a> The vessel is made nothing of; but it is sustained by another power, which is neither the treasure nor the vessel, and so the man is dependent.<a name=328:7></a>

		Then you come to the way the vessel is dealt with.<a name=328:8></a> A thing with a will is not a vessel: a person is acting for himself if he has a will; he must not think or will anything for himself, and therefore it says, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus.<a name=328:9></a>" That is obedience, of course.<a name=328:10></a> Christ was obedient unto death; that is not a man's will, and I am always to bear about in my body His dying; that is, Christ's dying or being put to death.<a name=328:11></a> There are two Greek words used in verses 10 and 11, for "dying" and "death.<a name=328:12></a>" The first is the fact of death, just the matter of fact, and the other is rather the moral character of it, or includes that here.<a name=328:13></a> The fact in Christ becomes the moral character of us.<a name=328:14></a> As we have it in Peter, "Forasmuch, then, as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.<a name=328:15></a>" Christ did actually die, and Peter had just been speaking to them not to suffer for evil doing, but, if it were God's will, for well doing.<a name=328:16></a> Christ had once suffered for sins: arm yourselves, therefore, with the same mind.<a name=328:17></a> This would be carrying about the dying Christ had died; and this dying of Christ I apply to myself, so that the body never stirs, and the will of the body never moves.<a name=328:18></a>

		We have, then, these two things: first, Paul, as a faithful man, never allows the vessel to have, for one instant, a will or a thought of its own.<a name=329:1></a> Just as much as Christ died, and completely died, so Paul was carrying this about constantly, and says, "Now you are as dead as Christ was.<a name=329:2></a>" And, though Paul was very faithful in that, the Lord helped him by sending him through circumstances, so that he despaired of his life.<a name=329:3></a> It was not a chastening, but he was having the sentence of death written in himself.<a name=329:4></a> He held himself practically for a dead man, and the Lord says, "Well, now I must bring death right on to you, and so you will be a dead man.<a name=329:5></a>" In his case, it was making it good by the trials he went through, and with this object, that nothing but the life of Christ could come out.<a name=329:6></a> The Lord says, "I must make this thorough, that he may realise it fully in himself"; and then Paul sums it up by saying, "So then, death worketh in us, but life in you"; that is, Paul was so entirely a dead man, that nothing but the life of Christ wrought in him towards the Corinthians.<a name=329:7></a> Wonderful description!<a name=329:8></a> If the vessel thinks or acts, it is spoilt.<a name=329:9></a> There is the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ to come out, and if the vessel is anything, by so much the light is hindered; but if the vessel is kept dead, nothing but the life of Christ is there to come out.<a name=329:10></a> It ought to have been the same in them as in himself, but it was not; of them he says, "life in you.<a name=329:11></a>" Death was working in him, and so nothing but Christ's life worked out in them.<a name=329:12></a> Death and life are both taken morally in this verse.<a name=329:13></a>

		The next verse in Psalm 116 is, "I was greatly afflicted; I said in my haste, All men are liars.<a name=330:6></a>" Everybody was against him, and in the pressure of it he said, "All men are liars.<a name=330:7></a>" It should be, "I said in my anguish or distress," in the sense of the pressure upon him; and then it may apply to the Lord; but, certainly, I should not apply it to Him if it were, "I said in my haste.<a name=330:8></a>" In the Psalms, except in a very few, you must always first take the remnant in, but sometimes Christ will quote a passage which does not at all apply to Himself in its next clause.<a name=330:9></a> Thus, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit," is followed by, "Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth" (Psalm 31: 5), but this would not do.<a name=330:10></a> It was necessary to bring Christ in if any blessing were to be given to the remnant.<a name=330:11></a> We find the remnant in Psalms 1 and 2 as an introduction.<a name=330:12></a> In Psalm 1 they come with judgment; in Psalm 2 with the King in Zion, and they are called upon to trust Him.<a name=330:13></a> In some of the Psalms we have direct prophecy of Christ, but in spirit He is connected with them all.<a name=330:14></a>

		Verse 13 of our chapter, already quoted, is the great principle that, though the whole power of the pressure was upon him, even as to life, yet Paul went on preaching just the same.<a name=330:15></a> He tells the Thessalonians he was "bold in our God," despite what had gone before, "to preach the gospel of God with much contention.<a name=330:16></a>" This is not an authority for preaching, but it is the going on in spite of the opposition of man, and it is an encouragement against the opposition of man.<a name=330:17></a>

		This chapter is a wonderful picture, for we have the whole glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and this put into a vessel, and for all that it is such a thing, that if the vessel is not absolutely dead, it will so far be spoiled.<a name=331:1></a> And that is not all: there is the positive power of God beside; you must have the vessel made nothing of, so as not to spoil the treasure, and then, when you have done that, some other power must come in and act.<a name=331:2></a> It is a wonderful description of ministry in its sphere and operation in creatures like us; and, looking death in the face, to continue still.<a name=331:3></a> Verses 10, 11, have both the same end: only he puts "mortal flesh," when he is actually delivered to death.<a name=331:4></a> The effect of that is, that Paul becomes a vessel of absolute life to others.<a name=331:5></a> All was for God's glory, but as its object, it is for the elect's sake, the church.<a name=331:6></a> "All things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might, through the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God.<a name=331:7></a>" There we have the truth of the church, that everything was for their sakes -- all this even in Paul.<a name=331:8></a>

		The difference between the Old Testament and the New is this: the Spirit gave them no communion and left them to "search" what He signified; but whatever He reveals to me belongs to me, and so "all things are for your sakes"; only then, Paul laid it by, as it were, and speaks of "what I have committed unto him against that day" -- all his own happiness for the other world.<a name=331:17></a> And now he says, Work away through this world and get there.<a name=331:18></a> This is all applicable to the saints at large now in their measure.<a name=331:19></a> He himself has broken all links with the present world, and now says, "The life I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God.<a name=331:20></a>" That is what we should seek to realise in our service; we ought to be always in immediate contact with Christ, and to bring out nothing else but according to divine wisdom and guidance in dealing with others.<a name=331:21></a> And it should be recollectively so; it is not merely in the main that Christ is the object, but there is another thing, the not being distracted, and also the having our object recollectively: constantly carrying it about with you.<a name=331:22></a> If, for instance, I am ministering, I should be consciously ministering direct from Christ to the people.<a name=331:23></a> The apostle expresses it when he says, "Whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we are sober, it is for your cause"; if he was out of sobriety of thinking, it is to God; or if he was in sobriety, it was for them.<a name=331:24></a> It shews what a serious thing ministry is, blessed indeed, but most serious.<a name=331:25></a>

		Now we go farther than responsibility into the unconsciousness of the state that people are in, which was learnt in grace; but the effect of the fulness of grace was to make him say that not merely the people had sinned, but also there was a day of judgment.<a name=336:1></a> "We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead.<a name=336:2></a>" What is the use of his going down thus into death, if men were not all there in that horrible pit?<a name=336:3></a> The epistle to the Romans takes up the <i>conduct</i> of men, and there is Christ's work.<a name=336:4></a> The Ephesians takes up the <i>state</i> of men, and then there is a new creation.<a name=336:5></a> And that is here: "Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more; therefore, if any man be in Christ, it is a new creation.<a name=336:6></a>" We have done with man altogether.<a name=336:7></a> I do not know anything on the world's side of Christ's grave except this, that they are all dead in sins.<a name=336:8></a> Christ coming down into the world was Christ's coming to men in this life to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; but He there tested man, and the cross shews there was no ground to go upon.<a name=336:9></a> <i>Now</i> we know a dying Christ, for men would not have Him, and so everything is gone, and God does not own this world at all.<a name=336:10></a> That is the way Peter meets the Jews as to the very fact: God hath exalted Him whom ye by hands of lawless men have crucified and slain, and that is where you are with God.<a name=336:11></a>

		In interpreting "If one died for all, then were all dead," if people would get God's mind, they would not say absurd things.<a name=336:12></a> As for all dying with Christ, I deny it altogether, and do not admit that we must get God's mind through the Greek.<a name=336:13></a> It is a total departure from the apostle's argument, and contradicts the next verse.<a name=336:14></a> The theory is that people live and die; but "they which live" are those who are not left in that state.<a name=336:15></a> The next sentence is demonstrative of it: "He died for all, that they which live"; that is not all.<a name=336:16></a> The aorist gives the historical fact, but it does not say that the historical fact is the consequence of Christ's having died.<a name=336:17></a> Why did Christ go down there?<a name=336:18></a> It was because they were all in the pit; and then the point is that some live (not all), and if they live, they are to live to Him that died for them and rose again.<a name=336:19></a> If it were translated, "then all died," it would be historical.<a name=336:20></a> There is no consequence in it, and "<i>then</i>" is not time, but "consequently"; the Greek in this verse for <i>then</i> is ara, which is nowhere time.<a name=336:21></a> It is not consequence, though it may be a fact.<a name=336:22></a> The proper force of <i>ara</i> is illative in later Greek.<a name=336:23></a> (That is, it introduces an inference).<a name=336:24></a>

		The first thing a sinner needs is, that Christ died for him; to preach Christ in the glory involves this, but where the gospel is preached, no matter how far you go, if there is a real work it attaches you to the place where the Man you preach is.<a name=339:1></a> Suppose John the Baptist says, "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," this goes right on to the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=339:2></a> All that His disciples reached is, "we have found the Messiah.<a name=339:3></a>" If you preach the greatest glory, you will find souls saying, in the sense of contrast, "Why, I am all in my sins," and in that way the glory works in the place the sinner is in; it attaches itself to the condition of the man, and then reaches his conscience; it gets hold of persons where they are.<a name=339:4></a> If it reaches a man, he finds out his own sinfulness, and so it touches the conscience.<a name=339:5></a> It is striking in Acts 10, though you get the Gentiles there, it is remission of sins that is preached for "whosoever believeth in him.<a name=339:6></a>" Peter says, "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him.<a name=339:7></a> And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.<a name=339:8></a> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it was he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.<a name=339:9></a> To him give all the prophets witness that through his name, whosoever believeth in him shall receive the remission of sins.<a name=339:10></a> While Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.<a name=339:11></a>" He testifies of Christ in full, and thereon preaches remission of sins, and then the Holy Ghost fell on those who heard.<a name=339:12></a> It is because there was a dealing with the Jews all through the Acts that we do not find the full and positive glory there.<a name=339:13></a> It is only in the last verses of the Acts that the Jews are given up.<a name=339:14></a> So we have no gospel of the glory actually preached, nor of the grace either in the strict sense of the term as we have been speaking of it.<a name=339:15></a> Even Stephen preached Jesus and the resurrection, not more.<a name=339:16></a>
